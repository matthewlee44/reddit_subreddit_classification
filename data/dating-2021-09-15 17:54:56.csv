Quick back story, met this guy in the club, couple days later we went on a successful date and then again literally two days later which was also successful. We communicated all day everyday he was also very upfront after the first date what he was looking for with me. 

We‚Äôve had two serious arguments, first argument lasted for days and he would take hours to reply. We made up and communication was back to normal, but since the second argument we had communication hasn‚Äôt been the same, during that argument I got about two replies and then completely ignored for 24hrs but he was active on his phone. (Second argument wasn‚Äôt my fault btw) I was trying to patch things up with him to which I got one reply every 24hrs literally with little to no improvement. 

We finally made up and he came to see me but he didn‚Äôt kiss me at all I had to kiss him first then that‚Äôs when he started to kiss me. After that communication dropped again and he would reply every 24hrs apart from one day when he actually replied twice in a day. Anyways, I confronted him about his mental health which he kinder confirmed for me and also went onto say he‚Äôs ‚Äòghosting‚Äô cause people annoy him. I told him that I was there for him etc, we had a little positive conversation after that and the last thing he said wasn‚Äôt really worth replying to so I just put an heart emoji. 

We haven‚Äôt communicated at all for two days now and i wanted to text him today. I‚Äôm worried that he‚Äôs lost interest in me or  it‚Äôs because of his mental state.

10,pp1ow0,1631748819,I have a younger guy friend who really likes me but I told him I don't see him in that way,"35f I have a 27 year old guy friend. (8 years younger than me) We met a few years ago at bartending school. (I was trying to make some extra cash on the side) We became friends bc we liked a lot of the same music. 

I dont have many female friends so he became my friend sort of. Most of the time I spend alone, but occasionally I'd hang out with him. He never once told me how he felt about me until recently. He said he really liked me but I told him I didn't feel the same way.

The thing is he's too young, and immature. I don't think he's ever been in a relationship &amp; we're at different stages in our lives. I've told him in the past I'm looking for something long term i.e. marriage. Even when I dated other guys he never once told me then how he felt. 

I do look a lot younger than my age. People think I'm in my 20s all the time which makes sense why younger guys would like me. Plus, I do have a sort of young, free spirit vibe about me but I am very responsible &amp; serious when it comes to matters of the heart. I've also been through a lot &amp; have been in a few serious relationships so I'm experienced but he isn't. 

Anyway, since then he still messages me occasionally but I haven't talked much to him since. He asked to hang out but I didn't really respond. I just told him I've been in a weird mood which is true bc I'm still getting over a previous relationship which he knows about so he should be understanding about that. 

The thing is every time I've tried to date younger guys it never works. It doesn't matter whether its 1 year or 5 years. All of them ended up being really immature &amp; not ready for a relationship. The thing is they always try to convince me they are in the beginning but I almost always know its a lie. Whether they're lying to me or lying to themselves. 

I told my guy friend that I'm also not looking for a hookup but more importantly I'm just healing right now which I know he knows &amp; it isn't the time for me to be dating anyone. Idk but I kind of got mad when he told me he liked me bc he kept it secret for so long even when I was dating guys &amp; he hid it pretty well would even make fun of me a lot which also says a lot about his immaturity. 

Hes not a bad guy but I'm just going through a major transformation right now &amp; I'm at a point where I'm questioning if our friendship is even worth hanging onto? Bc I'm going in a different direction &amp; I feel he may still cling onto hope that something would transpire between us.

14,pp1uvc,1631749435,Need advice moving forward,"Fair warning - its going to be a long post.

Hello, I \[22M\] am coming back to dating and wanted to find out others' perspective about my relationship with this (really gorgeous) girl (tbh this makes me hella nervous) \[21F\] I am talking to that I met from Tinder.

We first matched a couple of weeks ago and she had initiated the conversation by asking some basic, personal questions making sure I was not a serial killer. After making sure I am not a kidnapper, we continued our conversation on discord where things started to get hazy for me because I am a snail at picking up hints. We had our first call shortly after moving to discord which lasted for 2 hours, we ended it as she had to get with her friends, and bid me to rest well for work the next day. This made me blush a little and I bid her good night. Despite being new to my job, I decided to blow off work to continue the chat with this awesome girl. The chat started moving in a different direction where we talked about our routines, more personal stuff, and we ended up flirting a little here and there for a couple of hours at a time. 

Fast forward a couple of days of these chats, she decided to open up one night that she had recently broken up with her fianc√© and has not quite gotten over the break up. Coincidentally, I too, had recently broken up with my ex approximately the same time she did and told her about it. We spoke about it and learned that we were both on Tinder to look for long term relationships because we dislike being single. That is when I found out that we are looking for the same thing. Being the insensitive jerk and dating noob I am, I decided to tell her that sometimes it is best to talk it out to acknowledge and move on from the past. So we briefly talked about how abusive her ex was and how she had become more insecure and unconfident about herself these days. We ended the call when it got past 1-2 am, bidding each other good night and slept.

For the next couple of mornings, she decided to greet me good morning as early as 7 in the morning (one of the best feelings tbh) and that would be the segue to our conversation for the rest of the days. Chats were about how our days were going, talking about my job and her college experience, interests, dislikes, etc. Then one night, I told her that maybe we can keep the call on for the whole night so that we could keep each other company. She unexpectedly agreed to it (boo-ya!) and that all went well! I get to greet her when she woke up and vice-versa. 

(Approximately a week has passed by this time) Soon, the weekend approached. I told her that I am going to be studying in the city and casually invited her. She agreed and we met up at a local caf√© she introduced me to and studied together for a good 4-5 hours (just the two of us). She mentioned that she had a migraine and was getting a little tired so we decided to use my car to drive to the nearby restaurant and grab some food. I enjoyed spending time with her so much that I decided to pick up the tab. She was hesitant but agreed when I said she can pick up the next check. Now, I am not sure this was so much a date because neither of us labeled it and I decided to play it cool (legit was melting on the inside tho). Drove her to her car and as she was about to leave, she gave me a quick hug, saying thank you and telling me to have a safe trip home (that's when I vaporized on the inside). 

Same good old chat and voice calls throughout the week and the second weekend was approaching fast. I told her I am headed to the city to study again and she said she had to go home to her pet dog that was sick. After a good 4 hours, she asked how studying was going and I said it was going well. I asked about her doggo and she received an uncertain prognosis from the vet but had received $40 from her mom for her to go on a date \[side note: her mom knows she had broken up with her fianc√© and that she is going out on dates these days; she's been to a couple according to her\]. I then told her that I am about to grab some food after hearing her say she was starving. So we ended up meeting at a restaurant convenient for the both of us. We had a great time, I was super awkward and realized I had a booger on my nose (wtf is wrong with me, its like I am ruining my chances for me...). Cleaned myself up and we decided it was getting late so we got the check. I asked if she wanted to split it and she sternly mentioned that she was going to get the tab this time from our past arrangement. She took out 2 $20 bills. I asked her if that was from her mom and we both ended up laughing at it (yes it was from her mom). So we walked to our cars and as we were parting, she said ""I can't let you leave without a hug."" (At this point, I am a superheated vapor.) Bid each other good night and safe trip home.

We then started going on our overnight calls lasting good 12-18 hours at a time. At some point during dawn (5 am I think), my ridiculous and exhausted brain decided to mess up another time (as if booger nose was not enough like wut). The conversation went a little like this:

Me: ""Hey do you want to go on a date with me some time?"" 

Her: ""Are you asking me on a date right now?""

Me: ""(awkward laugh) haha, I know its not the best time right now but yes I am...""

Her: ""Sure""

Me: ""Good night (girl's name)""

Her: ""Good night viole\_blues""

I quickly went asleep and she later admitted that she had a hard time sleeping afterwards thinking about many different things. We talked normally for a couple of days and We later talked and I told her that I did not want to force her to do anything (dates... I swear I did not mean sex - I really want to be in a long term relationship with her) if she is still getting over her ex. We ended the conversation by agreeing that we can push the date to another time convenient for the both of us.

Fast forward to today, she was about to go hang out with her friends and said ""If you get bored, ###-###-####."" 

To be clear, I don't think she is a manipulative person or trying to take advantage of me in any way but as the saying goes, love is blind so I need y'alls input. Okay, now my questions are:

1. Does she have feelings for me?
2. Is her still trying to get over her ex a red flag?
3. Am I getting used out here as an emotional rest pad?
4. How should I reciprocate so that she does not get hurt?
5. Any other additional advice you want to give this dating noob?

If you made it down here, thank you so much for reading!

There have also been times where people said they are busy with school, family, work etc.

Being busy with school, family,work etc is super super understandable BUT these are things that don't go away.  I have learned to give myself a set time frame for how long I'll wait. For example, let's say my time frame was one month. During that month, I will wholeheartedly be myself and I will also observe and see how they communicate and how much effort they put in.

I want someone who is able to communicate and still be able to put in the effort despite things that may go on in someones life. We all have things going on but if we're serious about someone or want to give someone a real chance, we still will make the time and effort.

Of course, if there‚Äôs something serious going on in someone‚Äôs life, they should definitely go take care of it but I would want to be with someone that currently has the time to date and maybe we could reconnect sometime in the future, just not now.

Recently she have seemed more ready but she haven't told me so with words. More in the way she behaves. Talking about sleepovers, that she likes spending time with me etc. And last time I met her she touched my behind.  


I am not the best when it comes to flirting myself. I feel like I have to act on her signals in some way. I should have done so in the moment of course but I was too busy daydreaming to notice that she actually touched my ass.  


Then she was back to sending mixed signals again. I think she is just really insecure. I am more confident than her I would say and at this point I just want to figure out where she is at and if I am going to continue pursuing her or just call it a day.  


I am going to take her up on some of her suggestions she have come up with recently. Cabin trips, cooking together, she have suggested that I dress nicer which is ok. I could go way over the top and role play or whatever. Maybe even go shopping with her. Then a bunch of personal stuff.   


I am not sure how long to give this. I dont want my crush for her to ruin any more days for me. I am going to be more open minded when I meet other girls. I dont meet her too often but if nothing happens within 5 dates or so, then I have to tell her that it isn't working.  


By then I will have suggested basically everything I can come up with and I will have tried escalating sexually. I feel like we are just below that mutual attraction threshold right now.

So a couple weeks ago i met/matched with someone on a dating app (not Tinder) and we hit it off, she's 21 and I'm 26 so it ain't THAT bad of an age difference. Anyway we started talking and texting and everything was going good, so about a week and a half into it i asked her out on a date because we both let the other one know werl were looking for a serious relationship, i got a yes right away and so I planned a date. The date i had planned was a late lunch date and a trip to a little ""traveling"" fair that usually comes during the summer days with rides and games and what not. (Side note here) I'm a guy that loves ALL kinds of music.. all of it, so that being said, I'm omw to pick her up and listening to my ""Random"" playlist with ALL sorts of music on it, so when i get to her place, the song that was playing was one by the artist Bad Bunny (Latin artist) and she loved it and started jamming out with me, it was going to be about a 20min drive btw. After this, the song ""Hold On, We're Going Home"" by Drake started playing and she loved this one too ""omg this was my soooong"" she exclaimed. Everything's going good right, the next two songs were also to her liking (another Latin song and then an EDM song). We're singing, having fun, all gravy baby right? Well my friends, shit took a hard left turn when the next song started playing. My playlist threw it waaay back with a little motown when ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me"" by the Miracles started playing and she let out a mocking-ish reaction and goes ""whaaaat the fuuck is thisss"" and starts cracking up, pulls out her phone and started recording a snapchat and saying ""bro what iisss thiiss??"" to post on her story.. meanwhile the whole time I'm just looking at her surprised and smiling in a way like saying ""wow"".. and I just said ""well damn alright"".. After she posted her story she goes ""nuh uh, take me back bro"" which I'm pretty sure she was playing because i didn't even hesitate, busted a quick U and started taking her back and she looked at me right away and had a look on her face like ""wait, are you serious"". I just turned up my music and kept jammin out by myself. I knew i made the right decision because after that motown song ended, Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen started playing (a CLASSIC!) and she did the mocking reaction again and at that very moment, everything went out the window completely for me lol..

49,pp4onr,1631759860,"Ex reacted weirdly when I asked if he told his friends that him and I were dating, still bugs me sometimes","Hey everyone! So I dated this guy 2 years ago. I know, it already sounds like I'm hung up on him but I promise you I'm not, hear me out. We've known each other forever. From age 3 till now (we're 24 now for context). We were in the same school from kindergarten to high school.

 Then we went our separate ways and ended up in the same city 3 years into college. We were friends for a year and then things started to get flirty and we ended up dating. We had mutual friends and he also had his ""own"" friend group too. The thing is, I knew the other guys too. I'm not close with them but I knew who they were, we all went to the same elementary/middle/high school. 

So anyways, when we started dating, we waited a couple weeks and then told our mutual friends. We didn't stay together for a long time tho. We were together for 3 months. And around the 2 months mark, we were talking about who we've told other than our mutual friends. So I tell him I've just told my best friend (that I met in college so he doesn't know her) and a close coworker of mine (that he also doesn't know obvi). And then I ask him ""have you told your brother or the other guys"" (referring to his other friend group, which I *know* all the members of let's not forget, just not as close as him. And his brother lives with him, he's a year younger than us and also went to the same school all our lives so I also know him). 

So I was just asking an innocent question. But he reacted weirdly. Like his face got all ""wtff"" and I didn't understand. He made it seem like I just asked something impossible/that'll never happen and also disgusting. And it kinda felt like he was ""hiding"" me, that he didn't wanna show me off. We broke up a month later for unrelated reasons. And now it's been 2 years. 

But the thing is, before we dated, he used to invite us (me and our mutual friends) to his place all the time for game nights or just to chill etc. And usually, his ""other"" friend group would also be there cuz they live in the same apartment complex. But ever since we broke up, he never invited us there again. And it just feels like he's trying to hide the relationship he had with me. I think I've been to his place 2ice in the 2 years since our break up. Both times his other friends were there, but obviously we're all too busy hanging out and chilling, it's not like all of a sudden we were gonna start talking about our past.

So sometimes I think about this incident and I'm like ""was he ashamed of me?"". Physically speaking I'm overweight but so is he so he can't really judge me on that. And face wise, I don't wanna sound shallow but I know I'm cute, and he honestly isn't, like objectively. I liked him for his personality. Even our mutual friends were like ""you can do better anyway girl, c'mon"" after our break up. So yeah, it's something I still think about sometimes, wish I didn't tho. How do I get past this? It hasn't prevented me from dating, I have moved on and I'm actually currently dating a great guy, but sometimes I just remember that conversation out of the blue and I feel a little down because it's like I wasn't ""worth presenting"" officially to his other friends üôÑ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pp4onr/ex_reacted_weirdly_when_i_asked_if_he_told_his/

She recently moved to a new city where her ex is. Since she didn‚Äôt know many people in the city she reached out to him and they hung out, I wasn‚Äôt fully comfortable with this, and to my fault; would only voice this concern in a passive aggressive manner, ‚Äúgo ahead if you want to hang out with him so much‚Äù, etc.

Last week I finally told her about how I feel insecure and uncomfortable about them hanging out and how I feel it‚Äôs generally inappropriate to hang out with exes (I feel it‚Äôs fine to be on good terms but it‚Äôs not prudent to hang out all the time), when he invited himself and his friend over to her house two days after she and her roommates had a party and had him over, amongst other people. She thanked me for telling her, saying she appreciated it, and that if I felt that way then she would reduce the amount they meet.

Now I think it‚Äôs an important time to tell you that he was her first boyfriend and they dated while she was in high school, he cheated on her thrice before she broke up with him around 6 years ago. She assures me that all feelings are dead and that he‚Äôs just a good friend now (At least from her side).

Six days later (yesterday) her cousin moved into the same building as her (coming from my city). After which, to celebrate; she told me they were going to a restaurant along with my girlfriend‚Äôs roommates and she casually says, ‚Äúoh and we also invited (ex) and his friend since they‚Äôre the only friends we have in this city‚Äù (the cousin also knows the ex),after which they went back to her place for an after party.

My girlfriend is a person who likes to party and have fun and I generally trust her to do it, even with her guy friends. But now I feel very hurt and betrayed since she still hung out with her ex so soon after I expressed my concerns and feelings. The only plus point I can think of is that, at least, she didn‚Äôt do it behind my back.

60,pp5ox8,1631763751,Maybe I don't need anyone,"Maybe it's a weird way of clarity, I'm not sure and I don't know where to post this. I am a pretty female, but I've never dated anyone I have tried apps and have deleted all my accounts, just wasn't getting anywhere. I'm just no longer attracted to anyone and I can't connect or bond with people like I have when I was in middle school. I've been alone since highschool and don't have friends.

 I do keep myself busy and take care of myself as best as I can, I try not to think about not being able to get a date or find people. I'm slowly trying to accept my own loneliness at times I'm fine and I'm okay and happy, other times I'm just a bit sad like right now that I don't have at least one person. 

I have gone through some things and came to a point that maybe dating and finding someone isn't for me, but I don't want to be put in a situation that I was in and have to deal what the other person has major problems that  consumed them and need  something to cope and get addicted too. And I don't want to be put in that place again.

I feel withdrawn and detached to people, I've stopped trying to find someone. I put on a nice face and be nice to people during work and school.

 I think I'll be okay alone, I know it beings me down from time to time. That maybe I just don't need people like I thought. It feels obvious that other people don't need me either only my family. I just wanted to post this to get my thoughts out before it dwells on me to long. 

I don't think one person would ever be with me, not like anyone stays, which is fine I can handle. I thought that love or whatever would be nice and warm, but I feel pretty wrong about that, maybe it's worked on others and just skipped me.
I've been patient and I have tried to put myself out there and have gotten nothing in return. I just wasn't meant for people and I have slowly start to accept that I just wish it was easier.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pp5ox8/maybe_i_dont_need_anyone/

62,pp5rt9,1631764081,I can‚Äôt move on and I dont know what to do?,"There's this guy that I had a strong emotional connection to in the beginning. I really liked him and he matched my energy. He would do so many things to make me feel special, make stories out of the dreams I tell him and there was alot I liked about him. 
The relationship crashed and burned quickly because of how intense/fast it developed.

We had alot in common, our life goals were common and just being together, there was alot of chemistry. Needless to say, it was short-lived because hes scared of commitment and I don't respond/act well because of my own issues of fear of abandonment. Which he brought out in me. I wanted to see him often and pressured him on wanting a relationship because I know I didn't want anyone else. 

He pulled away, and acted distant on purpose. Said cold things to me about how ‚Äúhe didn't see anything special between us.‚Äù and how he talks to me /sees me whenever he feels like it. 
Which hurt alot and ultimately drove me to the decision to move on even though I still had feelings for him.

It's been two weeks and i didn't unadd him, which maybe I should. But what triggered me is seeing him post on his story, him specifically playing the theme song to my favorite video games (Minecraft lol) on the piano. Which he both knows how much I love when he plays the piano and I brought up in many conversations about Minecraft. 
I know it was meant for me, but I don't think I should show any reaction because it really would reverse all the progress I'm trying to make. Do you think this is a form of manipulation or maybe a kind gesture?

But a guy should have the decency to be the bigger person since it is unlikely for him to get assaulted. So a guy ghosting his date is invariably the asshole in the situation.

So redditors of r/dating, do you believe this kind of double standard is acceptable?

72,pp6i96,1631767090,So... what's up with this whole chatting for weeks/months before meeting?,"I figure this is a generational thing, but I just gotta ask:

I see a lot of posts where folks describe situation where they've been chatting one way or another with someone for weeks or even months without having met them.  Of course by the time they're posting they've already made some sort of emotional investment in the person they're communicating with (and whom they've never met).

My question is, how does that work?  I don't get it.  One can't truly know how they're going to feel about another until they meet them, so I don't understand why people would spend so much time chatting before meeting.

I'm an X'er, and I prefer dating X'ers.  I have no problem chatting up women in the wild, but I also do online dating (because there at least you know all the women are single).  But I don't do the pre-first date pen pal thing.  I'm right up front about that, and it generally gets a really positive response.

So, given that not fucking around with long correspondences with people you might not like that much is vastly better, why do so many folks invest so much into these pre-meet correspondences?

This is gonna be a little ranty but I am absolutely frustrated and I feel like I misread this guy‚Äôs intentions. I (25F) had been seeing and talking to this guy (24M) for a few months we had went on 3 dates In the span of a few weeks. He was the first guy in a LONG time I actually was interested in and saw it going somewhere.

This guy is kind of religious so on the first date he was extremely respectful, didn‚Äôt push physical contact and I really respected and appreciated that. It was a nice date overall and I liked him. 

The second date was great. We went to his favorite restaurant and he took me to a few of his favorite places. Spent most of the evening together and at the end of this one, we made out in the backseat of his car (no clothes were removed and it stayed PG). 

The third date was kind of more chill. We just hung out and spent the evening together, nothing super formal but it was nice. 

I mention the physical contact because now he is treating me like I‚Äôm basically just a buddy. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy and old fashioned but in my mind,if your take a girl out, pay for her meal and kiss her that‚Äôd be considered a date. We never had that conversation of what we are which is definitely partially my fault. I should‚Äôve  tried to gauge his intentions earlier but oh well.

After the third date, he acted really interested talked about us going places together and acted like he wanted to keep pursuing then the next week I asked him to hang out again and he completely blew me off. I figured okay he‚Äôs busy. I asked one or two more times over the course of a few weeks and got excuses. Okay I can take a hint. I backed off thinking okay guess he lost interest. He‚Äôd still message every now and then but not as often. 

Well recently he‚Äôs been messaging me a lot more so I was kind of excited that he seemed more interested in going out again. Well I am clearly very naive or thought this guy was more of a decent guy (he painted himself to be someone who only dates one person at a time and was looking for a relationship potentially based on what I gathered). 

Today we started snapping back and forth. At some point he mentioned he was disappointed that a girl he was interested in going out with kept blowing him off. Like hello, pot meet kettle. I was taken aback by the fact that he felt comfortable enough to tell me this because in my mind we had been on three DATES and there was mutual interest. 

I did call him out and said ‚ÄúOh okay so that‚Äôs why you kept curving me.‚Äù And played it off like a joke. He sent me a video also playing it off saying there was more to the story and what not ‚Äúlike with me and you‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think I need more. Clearly he was interested in this girl and that‚Äôs why he was blowing me off and now that she‚Äôs not interested, he wants to come crawling back. I really don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôd put himself like that either unless he genuinely in his mind viewed me and him as pure friendship which I guess is the case but I just don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm not sure what I should do. I‚Äôd hate to block him because I like him as a person and a friend but I feel as though I have absolutely just lost all romantic interest at this point after this conversation today.

The thing is, i don't wanna see her and end up treating her like a casual that only reminds me of those previous casual relationships i've had with other woman. As a result i always tend up to be naturally so nice towards her, rather than the casual aloof me. Since, i really want to treat what she deserves, i even abstain sex for her. Sometimes i though, I'm not being myself anymore. I mean honestly, i slept girls that is way prettier. But, i just see her differently then it just happened that i invested so much care and emotion towards.

Here's the tricky part:

While she told me things like ""I'm so in love with you"", ""I've never felt this way for someone so fast"", ""i want to travel the world with you"" etc, she seems to be holding back in some aspects. She has told me that she recently got out of a toxic relationship she is heart broken, and she is not ready to commit to another one yet, which i respect. Some days ago after her initiation, we were discussing of having a small trip abroad, to which she finally said, it's to early and would be like having a relationship if we go.

And my question is: What should i get from all this? I'm definitely willing to give her time, but i am genuinely confused!

85,pp805w,1631774144,How to Avoid Awkward Situation by Reading Signals?,"So, a few weeks ago I ran into a girl I had never seen before at my apartment complex. She lives in the same building as me. I'm pretty introverted, but she approached me while I was near my truck and we had a decently short conversation. The girl is absolutely gorgeous so I read this as someone just being friendly and getting to know someone in the same building as her. Well, we ran into each other another night while both drunk and talked a short bit and went our own way. Tonight we ran into each other once again while I was near my truck, but this time I would estimate we talked anywhere between 45-60 minutes. Jumped around from our dogs, to life, to politics, to working out, etc, etc. We were both getting torn up by mosquitos and me being introverted and always questioning myself gave her the chance to leave numerous times by mentioning that we are getting torn up and she can head in if she wanted, but she insisted she was used to it and that she had something else/another story to say. Won't get into the majority of the conversation, but in the middle she mentioned she knew a good amount of people in the building already and has many friends in the area. At the end I asked her if I could get her number and she looked happy to do so and put it in my phone. We had a short back and forth text session that was humorous before she obviously passed out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this situation has never really happened to me before. I have experience in the dating world, but not when it comes to someone living in the same complex. It's something my introverted ass would not want to whiff on as I try to avoid people I've had a ""negative"" interaction with. A major one would be interpreting this as interest opposed to just meeting a new friend. It's probably due to the fact she is so gorgeous that I have doubts, but I may be selling myself short as I have a great job, vehicle (she talked about it), dress well, have a cute dog, complex is a higher end apartment, and somewhat decent looking. But I still can't shake the feeling this girl is way out of my league and she was just looking for a friend. Any advice? I can elaborate on details if asked. I just really don't want to go down the path of talking to her one or two more times and asking her out on a date and the situation gets extremely awkward but I also don't want to throw this chance to the curb.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pp805w/how_to_avoid_awkward_situation_by_reading_signals/

Once I saw these vibes I told her that I liked her and that we should keep hanging out and see if it could lead to us being more than friends (keep in mind she got out of a serious relationship a year and some change ago so she did not want to rush into things and I understood)

As we hung out more often in that 8 month time span we just got closer and closer, you guys could say we were basically best friends but the flirting and sexual remarks were becoming more frequent. Fast word to about 2-3 weeks ago, both of our classes started (we are both in grad school) and our lives became hella busy. We had no time to meet in person since we are in different programs, and texting conversations became boring. I will be the first to admit. This is when I saw her take a decline in responding quick for the first time since we started talking, initially I thought nothing of it since school comes first and I lowkey thought we had something secure at this point (even though we weren't officially a couple yet).

She started to become more and more distant with her replies, and I began overthinking (which really fucked everything up as you guys will see). I started questioning if she started talking to other guys and thats why her replies took forever (I'm talking 2-3 days at times, compared to before it was 5-10 minutes MAX). So I make a fake social media profile to see if I can find out if she really is busy or she moved on. After going down some rabbit holes I found a Tumblr profile with her exact twitter handle. Mind you we're in our mid 20s so Tumblr and blogging isnt our thing but we never really talked about blogging so i decided to dig a little further.

I added that Tumblr account using a fake account I made and as time went by I somehow convinced myself that her posts were directed towards me and the things currently happening in our ""situation-ship"" (this is where it all goes to shit) Last week 4 days went by and I got no response from her, but the Tumblr profile kept posting stuff every SINGLE day, my smart ass decided it would be a good idea to double text her and just jokingly bring up the Tumblr profile to start conversation.

When I mentioned that I saw her Tumblr and that screen name XYZ was mine and I had been following her along the whole time she automatically had a panic attack and said she had not used Tumblr since middle school. Now I'm literally questioning everything because that profile had the EXACT same twitter handle as hers, and even some of the pictures in the blog looked just like her. Eventually we figure out that people are making fake profiles and impersonating as her online (most likely someone from her past, at least thats what she said).

So now shes freaking out that people are stealing her identity and she texts me this earlier today, these are direct quotes from my phone....

‚ÄúI feel really bad for saying this, but I do genuinely need a break from my phone and social media in general‚Äù

‚ÄúI really hope you understand. I have no energy to respond to texts or engage in any kind of conversation at this moment. I really have a lot going on‚Äù

Explains the things going on in her life

‚ÄúWay too much is going on and I honestly just cannot be in the right state of mind to have a convo especially after everything I learned about the whole social media nonsense‚Äù (someone was making fake social media profiles impersonating her)

‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôm not angry with you or anything. I just genuinely need a break from my phone please""

I truly don't know how to handle this, obviously I'm going to respect her wishes and give her the break she needs. BUT do you guys think she got freaked out because I was basically creeping on her and thats how I found that fake Tumblr profile and now she wants nothing to do with me? I cant stop but think that her texts above are basically a nice way of saying its over, but at this point im overthinking so much that I dont even know and I cant afford to make the wrong move again.

So I need some unbiased advice from you guys. (Also, she thanked me before all of this saying if I never brought it up then she wouldnt have ever known this was going on behind her back // and she even said yesterday and I quote ""once my spiral of exams are over and if youre free lets go grab some food"" - but today I wake up to the messages I sent above). Thoughts???????

\*\*\*I truly am ashamed of my actions, I've never done anything like this before. I just wish she was direct and told me if she lost feelings or if she was dealing with some other external factor I just wish she communicated that to me. I apologized to her numerous times and made sure she knows how embarrassed I am of my actions. The hurt I am feeling right now certainly has taught me a lesson. I just hope I didn't have to pay such a huge price to learn this.\*\*\*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pp8l7k/over_thinker_messed_up_in_need_of_honest_unbiased/
91,pp8n0f,1631777379,Guys don't do anything thoughtful for me and it makes me sad,"I (27F) was a late bloomer. I didn't date/kiss/have sex with anyone until I was 24. My first boyfriend was a real POS emotionally abusive alcoholic. To sum up that entire relationship, I once called him because I was struggling a lot with stress from work, taking care of my dad who was recovering from surgery for his cancer, and my uncle's death. As I was talking, he cut me off and yelled ""can you please stop talking about your stupid problems? I had a really bad day at work and I wanted you to cheer me up."" (For the record we worked the exact same job)

Every guy I've dated since him has been an improvement, but still not great. I'm a pretty affectionate person and I guess somewhat of a romantic. I like to make people feel special and thought about; friends, family, romantic partners, even coworkers. With romantic partners, I make it a point to make them feel cared for. I enjoy small gestures like making them dinner or picking something up on my way over to spend time together, making them little cartoons or paintings, giving back massages when they say they're sore, buying them a plant or a candle while I'm at the grocery store, or helping them with errands or chores. I don't do these things all the time, but every so often. 

As far as I can tell, these sorts of little gestures are normal in romantic relationships. But I truly cannot think of a time when a guy has done something little like this for me. The only time a guy did something thoughtful for me was when my alcoholic ex bought me a book that I wanted to read as an apology for leaving me a drunken voicemail calling me a sl\*t and a wh\*re. I've only been on two dinner dates (different guys), both of which I paid for. I don't mind paying, but I guess I feel upset that it seems like nobody wants to treat me to a date. Even my ex-boyfriends never took me out on dates. All they wanted to do was stay in their houses, watch TV, play video games, and have sex. 

It always feels like all of the effort comes from my end. The guys I date don't do anything special for me and it really makes me sad. I see the way my friends' boyfriends treat them and its so much different. Their boyfriends buy them flowers, help them with chores even though it's not their house, take them on fun trips, leave them cute notes, etc. It makes me upset that I feel like I'm not worth that little bit of effort to anyone, even though I put in the effort for them. I feel really unwanted and unloved.

The other day my coworker was telling me how she was sick and her boyfriend made her homemade soup and tea and just generally took care of her. I genuinely had to stop myself from crying because the idea of a man doing something thoughtful like that for me was so unimaginable 

I don't really know what to do. I don't think I'm particularly needy or anything, believe me, I like my space. I just want someone to care about me at like 40% of the amount that I care about them. any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pp8n0f/guys_dont_do_anything_thoughtful_for_me_and_it/

And so this random girls comes up to me and is like hey can I have a sip of your drink, I tell her sure, I think I just keep dancing and then she asks me my name and we started chatting for a little bit and I didn‚Äôt really feel like she was hitting me so I think she just went into the crowd a little bit and that was that. I was so drunk so I can‚Äôt remember if I asked her to climb on my shoulders or if I just kept dancing but ya, I‚Äôm just wondering if that‚Äôs a technique to just get some alcohol or if maybe it could‚Äôve been more.

Like one time I did that to a girl and asked to try her drink and I tried hitting on her but she said I was too young for her bc she was 30 but looked 22 lol. And the only other time a girl asked me to let her try my drink is one of my cousins friends and we ended up hooking up but it just seems like a way to like build some familiarity. 

Can any girl speak on this, I feel like maybe since it was an 18+ she could‚Äôve just wanted a sip and I didn‚Äôt really care.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pp8nn2/is_it_a_move_for_a_girl_to_want_to_dry_your_drink/
