0,o56ncc,1624312499,Women only please: why do your words say you want one thing... but you actions determine that is a lie?,"(27M)  I mean...  why do say you want one thing, and when a guy with those qualities arises, you actively chase after the things you claim you despise in a man. I do the best things I can for what good human beings should do, yet woman avoid me for all sorts of reasons.. all things they claim to hate in a man.. for instance:

Woman say: I want a man in touch with his emotions &amp; will support me
Woman see a man being in touch, when he has a bad day/experience &amp; ditch him the minute he shows human emotions.

Woman say: I want a man who will protect me, love me &amp; care about me 
Woman fall for and chase men who are rude to them, abuse their emotions, and sometimes resort to physical violence

Woman say: I want a man who loves me for me and doesn't only want me for sex
Woman ignore men who talk to them like human beings &amp; spark genuine connection &amp;  fall for guys who couldn't make it more obvious they exclusively want sex &amp; ditch the women once they get it. 

Woman say: that looks dont matter to them
Woman then turn around &amp; ignore men unless they are fitness models and/or have the looks of tom cruise

I figured these qualities in womanwould dissappear as I left high school into college &amp; now the working world  but literally nothing changed. 

Seeing the way you flock to guys who are complete trash, outright lie about the things you want, in public and to my face makes me wonder why do I even bother trying to continue living a good life? Why do I even bother trying to be a decent human being. I have tried being an asshole  and I can't. My guilty conscience takes over &amp; i apologize for being a jerk instantly.

Even posting something g like this on reddit where I'm anonymous, you people refuse to take my situation &amp; mental health as a human being seriously. I Get comments like  ""your having a pity party""....""toughen up, no woman wants that""...""that's why no woman wants you""...""just be patient, you'll find her""... 

More to the point, how can you find the truth in a sea full of lies? I'm actually at the point where I don't trust women. And if they do show interest or affection to me, im skeptical because the few times it has happened, I was a last resort, or it was out of pity. But dont ever express that you were heartbroken!! That's a sign of weakness &amp; women don't like that....

How is someone supposed to get help for their situation or express their story or how they feel about their life experiences, or how to get help lifting themselves up if all you do is destroy the person when they express their hardships in their lives? If I was a woman saying all those things exept about men, you would all be kissing my ass

All I really want is someone to love me back with the same energy I give them... turns out, IT REALLY IS too much to ask!! I can't get more than 3 weeks of conversations with women before I get ghosted, 90% of the time I dont make the first date... and the other 10% maybe ill get 2 if im super lucky. And I always initiate the conversation. Its always me texting first, messaging first, calling first,  arranging dates. Put in SOME effort! Stop being so lazy!

 I'm done with talking to women. If a woman wants to talk to me, message me. I can assure you I will give the same energy back you give me. I'm sick of chasing you all around just to be ditched the first time I show i have emotions. Or worse, get friendzoned.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o56ncc/women_only_please_why_do_your_words_say_you_want/
1,o56o7g,1624312560,"Four dates, seven days, four different girls. My thoughts.","I guess I'll tag this as giving advice.

So I've been recently getting into dating and I've been using the Hinge route, because at least it's a little less surface level than Tinder and I've never had luck there anyways. All the dates went pretty good, but I would say my performance (banter, confidence, energy) slowly declined each date, by the time I reached the last date it was probably the most quality girl I saw but I had dating fatigue and I didn't realize it. I wasn't myself I felt like I was asking the same questions twice when I really wasn't. I felt like I was tired in general and it was a breakfast date which didn't help, but she was amazing. It's tough out here dating and I know people say to keep your options open and don't put your eggs in one basket. But the flip side to that is if you spread yourself too thin then you aren't going to be your best self when you potentially meet the right person for you. So my advice is to not overload yourself, but meeting and getting to know multiple people is fine. 

Out of all four I've been on one second date so far, but hoping for a second date with another ü§û best of luck to everyone, whatever you may be looking for just keep trying, there is going to be someone out there that you vibe with.

Since then we've had 2 in-person dates and 1 virtual lockdown date. We saw each other at a pub for drinks last night which ended with me suggesting we go and watch a couple of episodes of the show she was telling me about. We went to her flat, cuddled on the sofa, and eventually fooled around. We undressed and let our hands wander, but she said she didn't want to go any further than just being in underwear (minus the bra). That was totally fine with me.

I'm finding her a bit hard to read since then. We texted a little but it's been short and a bit abrupt. This isn't super inconsistent with her texting style, and it might be down to me looking for assurance now I've made myself vulnerable. 

Anyway, for tomorrow I was thinking of asking her around mine at the weekend and cook something together. She really seems to prefer me to take the initiative in most situations, but at the same time I don't want to come off as B-lining for sex now it's almost on the table.

Right away, He starts putting rules, Saying ""Oh he doesn't  like women who give him attitude."" I didn't find this a problem since I don't give ppl an attitude that easily. But, BOI was annoying. He would make Suggestive comments, That would make me really uncomfortable, He Would touch my thigh once and constantly grab my hand. It made it impossible for me to concentrate on my work. 

Then, One day he says that he ""liked"" me. And I  said no. I don't like him back. Then asked if I was lesbian? I just laughed it off and said no. Since I had a meeting with one of my teachers for an assignment. He followed me there. And while we were walking he tried to hold my hand which again I denied him. And kept asking and I kept rejecting him.

I had to bring my best friend (15F) along. I didn't feel safe being alone with this guy and stop coming to tutoring for a couple of days. This guy..üò§

When brought my best friend along, it was worst, He tried kiss her hand without consent (In order to make me ""jealous"" Despite me literally declining him and showing him i'm not interested.) and gave her unwanted tattoo on her hand.

Out of all my girlfriends it's hard for me to pinpoint that she likes me because ""he gets disrespected because he's expected to be a stereotypical masculine archetype but I love how he just defies this stereotype!""


It's hard for me to imagine in any woman really thinks like this but I'm trying to be open to perspectives

On one hand it could be seen as confident because by definition a man who is walking around with feminine traits or neutral hobbies outside of sports or guns etc, has to be confident and strong because he will be disrespected

Just like my own life. I'm a big black dude and you can imagine how many people try to come at my masculinity when I tell them I'm an artist and that I don't hit on every woman and I'm not in a gang

But on the other hand from personal experience constantly getting disrespected from people can be seen as unattractive. You can't win every battle and there's always an a****** somewhere

Out of three people when meeting me

One is usually intimidated by my size and or race

The second is usually neutral and friendly and open and generally treat me normal

But the third type of person seems to want a pride and pick at me and try to test my masculinity. A lot of super frat boy types seem to do this and a lot of girls who seem to be attracted to those types also do this especially since I've been dating around I've noticed this

I seen all my life to wear sensitive boys or boys who are a little bit more open with their emotions getting attacked by both men and women

He was always busy with work and school, and did my best to relieve him of the stress. But even when he had spare time to himself, he didn't do any of that for me, and I guess he realized he wasn't able to put in that effort, resulting in breaking up with me. Fast forward a month later, I'm seeing someone who's been nothing but emotional support. But a lot of what ifs (that ended up being the result of a break up, or a guy rejecting me) are resulting me to stop seeing him. 

Okay so he enjoys my company for now, but what if he gets bored of me?
He's in touch with his emotions as well, but what if we manipulated each other for emotional support?
He gets physical when he's frustrated, so what will happen to me if I'm involved?
Will he become a different person or stay the same once he's settled?

Long story short he asked me to move closer to him in the car which I did... then he kissed me (I was a bit surprised as we were only 1 hour into meeting) after kissing he pulled down my romper and started sucking on my boobs..
 That led to him pulling his pants down and when he did that I let him know that I was uncomfortable and didn't want that. He still proceeded to grab my hair and push my head down to his lap. The whole time he kept looking around and asking if cars around us were empty. Eventually he grabbed me and turned me around forcefully and pulled down my romper completely... I was frozen at that moment. I didn't even feel him get into the position to try to enter inside of me but thank God I was able to feel behind me and I felt him attempting to put it inside of me. I was in a disadvantage because of how I was positioned in the small car so I started begging him not to put it inside of me. He kept saying he won't put it inside of me only rub it on my vagina which he did but I kept moving it to my leg instead. This happened for maybe 15 minutes (we were in an empty parking lot and I was terrified that if I got aggressive with him he would rape me).

Eventually he asked if I wanted to go outside for a walk which I said yes to with no hesitation as I wanted out of that car. We walked for a bit and when he looked down in my hand and saw my phone he questioned why I had it. The whole time we were walking he kept pulling my boobs out of my shirt. He even mentioned to me to walk down an ally way with him which I flat out refused. 

The whole time especially in the car he kept staring at me in the eyes. It seemed like he was contemplating fully raping me... on the walk he kept getting pissed that I wouldn't take off my jacket.

The whole time I was thinking about how females get raped while walking and I was honestly thinking how he was probably one of the guys who has done this.

About ~2 weeks ago, met an amazing women (in the city) on Tinder, and had a great date. We met for drinks and got appetizers, it went well, and we went back to her place (I live with my folks, am 26M, can afford to move out but my mom is in poor health), and had sex. I really enjoyed it, and she said (many times) she did too.

We texted since then, she said numerous times she wanted to meet and have sex again. I commuted to the city again this week, but her roommate was home, so I got a hotel in advance.

We had a 2nd date this week. This time of year is super stressful for work (why I was in the city), so I was feeling very uptight and tired. The date was a little more awkward than the first cause of that; and after offering to pay for the dinner, she said she was sorry and needed to leave. She seemed less interested than last time. I paid for the dinner, but the hotel went to waste.

I really liked this girl and want to give it another shot, but not sure what to text her? She seemed more excited than me for the 2nd date, but, I guess it didn't go well. I don't want her to feel pressured to meet me again, but given how well the first went, I'd like to give it another go.

We get along well, laugh a lot and the physical chemistry is seriously great. I can tell he cares about me and really enjoys being around me. However, there's a framed photo of his ex-girlfriend in his living room. I'm assuming it was a long-term relationship (5-7 years) and maybe around 2019 (yes, I stalked I know). I asked him who the girl was and he said a family friend... Also, I found a photo of him lying on a table and we were laughing about it then he casually puts it on the same photo of his ex, tucked in the corner of the frame. Now that I know it was his ex-girlfriend, which I didn't at the time, it makes it weird. He made dinner for me a while ago, adobo, and now I realized it's a dish she probably taught him since she's filipina. Even at that moment, when I wasn't aware of her, I asked him if he learned it from a past fling jokingly, he just said it was an easy-to-make delicious dish, so it's clear that he's hiding her

I know that many people keep old pictures of their past partner especially if they were a long-term one and I don't expect someone to delete all evidence of them. Also, it makes sense he wouldn't want to involve her in our conversations, it would open a deep hole. However, keeping a framed photo of her in his living room even after he moved apartments last week and still decided to keep it out, worries me, especially with a photo of him tucked in the corner even tho he has three other picture frames out...

60,o5dkb0,1624333618,I [21M] cannot tell if my friend [19F] is into me or not. Should I make a move?,"I feel like most people would feel what‚Äôs happening this weekend is a dream situation for a guy. My female friend is coming over for drinks, and I have the whole place to myself since my roommate is out of town. When we talked over text recently, she teased me about how she‚Äôs gonna out drink me and said she was looking forward to exploring the city with me since I just moved for work. She goes to college a half hour out, and we‚Äôve been friends who‚Äôve kept in some form of on and off contact over the past 4 years since we first met in high school but we haven‚Äôt hung out much recently due to covid.

Normally this would be great and all, but I just feel like she doesn‚Äôt match my effort in trying to text or keep in touch. For the past few months I‚Äôd try to keep in touch with her by asking her how her work has been, and how things are going in general in every day life, but it‚Äôs almost always me initiating conversation. We went almost a full month recently not talking to each other since I didn‚Äôt message first, and she often lets the conversation die out without asking about me. This with her relative inexperience with relationships and innocence (pretty sure she‚Äôs still a virgin who would not give her first time to a drunk hookup) makes me think she just views this as her visiting and hanging out with a friend. 

I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about her because I do think she‚Äôs cute and is really fun to be around, but I‚Äôm hesitant to make a move since I just don‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs interested, and even if she was, she‚Äôd have to become a much better texter for it to work out anyway. I‚Äôm not the type who would sleep with her unless she wanted to explore something serious either.

Should I make a move on her? I want her to know that I‚Äôd seriously consider dating her but don‚Äôt want to make the entire weekend awkward, or have her make a decision when she‚Äôs drunk without looking at the big picture.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5dkb0/i_21m_cannot_tell_if_my_friend_19f_is_into_me_or/

He‚Äôs really flirty with me and I think we‚Äôre going to meet up and hang out soon but it doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants anything serious and to be honest I don‚Äôt know what I want. 

And honestly, hooking up with him sounds kind of nice. I‚Äôve never hooked up with anyone (like outside of a serious relationship) but he‚Äôs really attractive and sweet and respectful. And has certainly been alluding to it 

But he‚Äôs mentioned an ex girlfriend a few times and I don‚Äôt know too much about her, but from what I‚Äôve heard they dated for awhile and were definitely in love. The pure fact that he talks about her a year after they split shows she was meaningful to him 

And as soon as I learned about her any desire I had to hook up went away. I just don‚Äôt think my ego can handle being just some girl that a guy hooked up with, while he had another girl that he actually really loved and looks back on much more favorably than me.

64,o5dvxb,1624334679,Quiet / low-energy activities where i can meet people when part-time disabled,"So I live in the UK and I'm partially housebound due to CFS/ME. That  means i suffer a lot of fatigue and pain and have to rest a lot and live life at a very slow/relaxed pace. One way of looking at it is that it takes me twice as much effort to do half as much as healthy people, and that's on a good day.

Thankfully I'm able to get out a bit every other day, but it's quite hard sometimes and so approaching or getting to know women (or anyone) is kind of difficult when I'm only just about functional going about my business and typically in some pain/fatigued.

I don't drink and my pain/condition makes me noise sensitive, so bars and crowds aren't an option. Most sports are completely out of the question other than gentle and slow walking and cycling. I've tried looking for events on meetup.com but it's 95% older people on there in my area and even if i joined a cycling or walking group i'd be left way behind.

So other than attending a meditation class sometime (which i plan to do after lockdown)  I can't think of any social actives I can do where I'd meet a potential partner and it's a bit frustrating really.

On the plus side, I've hit my ideal BMI and I've managed to start driving again after struggling with that, so at least I can get around. Furthermore, one-on one communication is about as much as I can manage for any length of time, so at least a date is a possible/healthy activity for me. Also, my disability is very much hidden and you can't really tell there's anything wrong me me based on looks. Also on the plus side is that my condition improves in the evenings most days.

And yes I've tried meeting people with the same condition, but most are isolating due to covid and/or are more housebound than me usually. Furthermore, half the girls with CFS seemingly only want to date healthy guys anyway.

I've tried online dating too, but I'm very average looking and so I've never even matched with anyone after a couple of months of trying.

I supposed I'd be best off meeting people online somewhere, but I can't really figure out a good option for that either.

70,o5e2oz,1624335311,Being a cute chick with a weird body (disguised with clothes). Suggestions when dating?,"Alright alright I know the whole accept yourself confidence is hot thing. I play that card well.

But let's just say: it's an objective fact that my body shape is disappointing when clothes come off (really weird boob shape and belly, short torso no waist etc.) and with clothes on my figure delivers higher expectations.

I'm cool with it. I eat healthy/work out and I'm generally cute and cool. But it's a shape thing that wont change and the 'big reveal' when first seeing someone can be a bit of a tense bummer because I know I dress my body to look pretty good and it's actually quite bizarre and unfeminine once the dressing comes off.  I've never had a compliment when nude and I've literally seen the disappointment streak across faces before, which to anyone would be bothersome.

No lectures about confidence please. It is what it is and that's okay! Ive had long term partners before and it's all good. It's mostly the anxiety of first exposing ""the truth"" I suppose.

**Just curious to know: which option would you think is better, if this was your dilemma?**

1- Confidently show nudish figure to new potentials as soon as possible before anyone of us is too attached so I know if they're truly attracted to me physically or not moving forward.

2- Wait quite a while and rely on personality/connection/other attractive qualities so that connection can prevail past awkward body during the reveal  (but more room for attachment so more hurt/disappointment if they bail, or can't find my body attractive despite liking me as a person)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5e2oz/being_a_cute_chick_with_a_weird_body_disguised/

72,o5eeu1,1624336458,I am getting confused and frustrated...,"So I \[26M\] met this girl who is three years old younger than me on a dating app, we had conversations about our romantic experiences. However, I have never been in a relationship before, so I was listening to her and tried to give sincere responses. In short, over the past 12 months, she was in casual relationshipsssss and she found it meaningless and wanted to quit and invest time for a long term one. We also had topics in other areas and at some point, we decided to meet up. I personally think that is a good one. However, she texted and invited me to be in a casual relationship (just sex) after the date. 

Well, I am kind of happy obviously because of the invitation. But I turned her down in the end because of two main reasons. The first is she cried to tell me she wants to stop casual relations, and second, I was never in a relationship and therefore being physically linked without flows of spiritual connections has a high probability of driving me crazy and I may annoy/bother her often if we really go for it. So, I suggested if she would consider a long term one and she said she doesn't think the chemistry between us match, and she believes she is good at identifying people who can have long term relations in the first few minutes of the first date.

With this, I am very confused. To my limited understanding, people just appreciate the attractiveness of a person, while deciding whether there is a romantic attraction between two people come at a later stage. But with the casual relationship invitation, I think it is fair to say that I am sort of physically attracted to her. So I am confused why she doesn't want to try to go for a long term one with me. 

I was a very introverted person because of a number of reasons. I tried to work on myself by cutting down my weight/gym, read more and have counsellings for two years. And these have improved me from being scared the shit out of myself when I saw a crush to be able to have normal conversations with them. I think I definitely had much space to improve but I have never succeeded to get myself in a relationship using dating apps. I rarely get matches on apps but I can also see that there are people getting matches from time to time. My observation for the past year of dating apps experience is that it seems like just being nice is just the baseline and there is more to do to get oneself into a relationship. It is kind of frustrating to get rejected/ghosted all the time... It seems like I am not suitable for dating apps but given the unbalanced population in my field, I have few choices... Maybe I should try to find other interests apart from what I have now...

I've seen a lot of posts and comments about guys under like 6 feet say they like tall women, but I've never heard this from tall guys themselves. Some tall women even like to admit that a lot of tall guys don't even go for tall women. I mean I honestly feel bad because its not like its their fault for being tall and the societal standard goes against them as they aren't ""shorter."" So its kind of like tall guys that emphasize this more make tall women feel like crap and its a shitty feeling. Coming from a short guy at 5'4 I know what its like to not fit in the norm and I honestly relate more to tall women in this aspect of life because we just don't really ""fit"" in with what society says is the standard man and woman.

Props to tall women that don't care about height, but the ones that do like tall men I think theres good reason for them to want tall men, I just know why it wouldn't be the same with tall men and tall women. I literally see every tall guy I come across with a woman below 5'7 idk if thats a coincedance or not, but theres tall guys that even say shit like women that are 5'2 and under are much better than tall women and whatnot which is fucked up because then you're basically putting down tall women. I can see how this can piss tall women off because as a short guy its like the reverse with me as women find tall men much better than short men. Theres no winning for either of us, but tall women aren't totally screwed.

He has bought private shows, bought videos, tip the girls, etc. He has commented plenty of dirty messages. I added the tokens he has spent and in 2021 alone he spent $1,171 and the website only shows the history back to the middle of 2020 and he spent $168 so a total $1,339. I really am in shock and honestly do not know what to do. 

We have been dating for 3 1/2 years, planned on getting married, and he has recently talked about buying a house in one year. I love him, but to me this is a form of cheating. Honestly, I am calm for some reason and don't know why. I know that porn addiction is serious and it is real issue for some. I have always thought he had a little porn addiction when we first started dating. He was constantly looking at naked girls on instagram and always masturbating to porn (I thought pornhub at the time but maybe chaturbate, who knows). The instagram/masturbating started becoming an issue. One time, I opened his computer to use it and left open a porn video. I know guys watch porn, everyone does but I don't want to see what my bf is watching. It was affecting our sex life as he would never want to have sex. Also, I would go on his phone and it would automatically be a naked girl that he just left her picture up. He deleted all his social media for me and told me he would stop watching porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

He actually did delete his social media, he has none. I would ask him everyone now and then if he still watches porn and he has admitted in the past year he has once after he said he stopped. I have asked him multiple times do you still watch porn and he would always laugh and say no!! I don't do that anymore, quit asking me that! how do you not trust me or believe me I really don't. I even having recent text messages him saying things like that. Then I would guilt myself for asking and blame myself for asking such questions after he has repeatedly told me no. However, that's not true at all, he has been not just watching porn but interacting and buying porn behind my back for these 3 1/2 years and lying straight to my face.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly just don't know what to do. We have talked about the situation and he has said he will stop and get help and do anything to fix this. He has expressed how he feels about this and how he is sorry etc. I believe that he feels absolutely horrible and all that. I don't know how I will be believe him or trust him in the future. Apart of me, feels sorry in a way for him because I know it's a serious addiction and I feel like that's why I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should break up with him or continue our relationship as along as he gets help. He has really changed for the better concerning other issues so I feel like he could change this issue as well. It just bother's me so much because it's not like he is just watching porn on pornhub. He is buying porn and sending nasty comments to random girls on live cams. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has explained that he doesn't know why he has been doing this or what is wrong with him and why he couldn't stop. As well as he understandings if I want to break up with him.

87,o5fkef,1624340572,"When it comes to dating, I wish people would be more honest.","Over all my time dating, I've been lied to a lot and it's been frustrating.

One time I asked a friend out and she told me ""I'm not in the mental state to be in a relationship"" but then show off her new boyfriend on FB two weeks later. I don't think I'm a spiteful person and if she'd just told me no, that would have been that and we'd still be friends. 

Another time, I thought I had a great first date with this girl and she kept wanting to extend the date. Then she told me she had a great time she'd call next time she was free. Still waiting for that call.

My current partner has told me she was over a fight we had over the weekend. As of this afternoon, she got mad again despite barely talking. So clearly, she's not over it. If she was still mad, I would have liked to talk about it and figure things out and how to make them better. Now I'm sitting here wondering what could have happened to piss her off again. Things sounded like they were getting better.

Why do people lie? I just wish people would be honest with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5fkef/when_it_comes_to_dating_i_wish_people_would_be/

90,o5ft1o,1624341474,Need help with this unique situation,"Hey everyone! 19M here. So I‚Äôve been talking to this girl for about 2-3 weeks and we hit it off pretty well I‚Äôd say. We both go to the same university, play the same sports, and she‚Äôs one year younger than me. We went on our first date last week and I would say that is went pretty well! However, one of the biggest issues that I found while we‚Äôve been talking is that she takes absolutely foreverrrrr to respond. Like I‚Äôll be sending her a snap and she wouldn‚Äôt respond for like 3-15 hours. I know that people say that when she‚Äôs texting back, it shows she‚Äôs interested still but I‚Äôm super conflicted. We just agreed on our second date for this Friday and I‚Äôm super excited about it. It‚Äôs just super conflicting because she engages in the conversation and also agrees to the date(turn on) but she also takes forever to respond over snap, IG, and iMessage (turn off). I was discussing w my friend about asking her why she takes so long to respond (in a polite way) but I‚Äôm afraid that this will sort of come off as a confrontation and then ruin the vibes (and potentially the date for Friday). I really hope this can work out and maybe develop into a relationship but like every hour that she doesn‚Äôt respond I feel like I lose that interest and connection. Most of my friends said they probably would‚Äôve ended it off already if it were them but like I said, I really hope this will work out.

(Terrible timing seems to be my thing) it sucks, we talk again blah blah blah... time goes by, nothing interesting happens. valentine's comes now, so i ask her........ and shes talking to another guy and rejects me, shit. nothing happens for some reason between her and the dude and we talk again. her birthday comes up and shes back in town again, i buy insulated leggings for her bday (btw she got me stuff too but not important) because her heater is broke, they fit perfectly and are her favorite color, plus a few masks/outdoor face shield that are one of her favorite colors. ironically i bought them before the pandemic. idk my powers baffle me. now valentine's comes again and we are a bit closer, so i ask. she's hesitant but i convinced her, its a romantic skype dinner that we dressed up for and it was actually really nice. so now i got her to be my valentine's, that's cool. but now is when it gets weird. we talk and agree that i go to visit her where she staying an hour away shortly after she graduated and she is coming back soon; however, i just really wanted to visit her out there. now we come to present time where i tell you that LAST WEEK I VISITED HER AT HER APARTMENT, WE HAD FUN AT DINNER AND ENDED THE NIGHT BY MAKING OUT FOR AN HOUR, AND WE ARE EACH OTHERS FIRST KISS!!! but now i learn she does like me and she wanted to have her first kiss with me, but doesnt want a relationship and yet still wamts to make out with me??? does such a friendzone even exists? like i aint too mad, i get to kiss her. but like, what the what?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5g5xm/where_in_the_friendzone_am_i/
99,o5g66a,1624342865,I'm afraid of going on dates,"I(24M) got a match on Tinder.  We talked and the conversation shifted to laptop she(23F) wanted to buy. I, who had a good time dealing with computer stuff, I suggested her a laptop. She asked me to go check the product in the market. Because of Evening LOCKDOWN, I skipped it to this monday. In sat I asked her so it's a date and she said yes. 

Now later I saw her pictures and videos and she is absolutely gorgeous,  stunning, seemed taller than me.... 

Her hairstyle is best and I never liked that kind of girl before. But I'm not attracted to her now. And monday when I we had this date, I never commenced any conversation about it and where I had to pick her up. And monday, went by.. and I didn't go on that date. 

I am so body negative of myself or maybe I'm afraid that I'll disappoint her.  Or I dont know.   Fear of bullying,  that she would say thing to bully me.. I didn't go to that date.  It was first date in years. 

I dont know if feeling like that is wrong or okay.  Need help. 

She's a sensitive person with ugly past, and I want to comfort her. She is very beautiful,  but I dont know why I am not attracted to her.  :( I want to make her days better but I'm not even making things easy for me.. what to do..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5g66a/im_afraid_of_going_on_dates/
