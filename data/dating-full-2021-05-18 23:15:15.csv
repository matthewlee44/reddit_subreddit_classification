I was seeing this guy for a little (4 dates in the span of a month), and he just recently ghosted me. I did see some of the signs coming, since he began to lessen contact after our third date (where we had sex). But in the week he ghosted me, HE was even the one to bring up on his own 'So, when are we seeing each other again?', and saying things like how I should see his new office - things that, to me, indicate some interest and a desire to see me again. This, along with the fact that I really felt like I connected with this guy are really messing with my head and lowering my self esteem. I know it ultimately doesn't reflect on me, but all I can think about is what I could've done wrong.

I know things are over, and I also know that I probably idealized him and the possible relationship in my head. I know I should go on some more dates (and have begun to talk to people on apps again), but I just feel like when I do this my head won't be in it, and I won't even enjoy myself or get to enjoy the other person. But, I also don't want to wallow in my own self pity.

That has never worked. When someone tells you this, you should take their word for it and move on. If you are interested in a relationship and they explicitly have told you that they are looking for something casual, it's not your job to try to change their mind.

Yesterday she texted me again after having not talked for a while and we had a good convo all day, then she asked me to go out tomorrow (I.e today) which really surprised me. I suggested a local coffee place she had wanted to go to and we got a time set.

We chatted a little bit throughout the day today, and around 5  (our plans were for 7:30) it got a bit rainy. Around 6 she had asked me if I still wanted to meet at the original outdoor place since it was rainy and I said yeah but we could look for a backup and I asked if she knew any places around the same area so we could both look simultaneously. 

She then asked me if I'd prefer drinks, coffee, or food, and I said drinks would be best but I didn't really mind any of the options and we could meet at the original place and see how it went, then move to a backup if it started raining again. I didn't hear anything for about a half an hour after getting a notification that she was typing something. I went to message her a few minutes ago ""are we still good for 7:30?"", and saw that I was blocked. On everything.

I have absolutely no idea what I did or said. My only thought is maybe she didn't want me to say drinks cause I know some people could think that is a bit suspicious, but if she hadn't suggested it I wouldn't have mentioned it at all and just said coffee.

The only men who find success on tinder are the shot-callers, the ballers, the ""alphas"", the rich, and the tall. That's it. Everyone else is basically screwed. For women, tinder is what it is. It is merely an app. They don't take it serious. They don't have to. They can simply make an account and sit back and watch as the likes start pouring in. But for average men, it's a competition, that most of us eventually fail anyway. When a man goes on tinder, there's nothing but pain, stress, and frustration. There's nothing but negativity. He should never expect success in any degree, other than being lucky. Being that's what tinder is based on, luck. Unless of course, you're an alpha shot-caller. But that's only 10% of the men on tinder. I think tinder was made specifically for women, and was made to manipulate lonely idiots such as myself into believing that, after a life of loneliness, I finally had a chance.

About me: I’m a 30 year old male, a tech lead in SoCal, 6’3”, 200lb, fit, well off, dorky kind of dude. I’m probably more introverted than extroverted, though I’d say I’m a pretty good communicator. I teach for fun. I’m confident in every aspect of my life and happy with pretty much everything – until it comes to my romantic life.

Which leads me to the point of my post – a while back I read an r/AskReddit thread about mail order brides that surprisingly was filled with positive experiences regarding the service. I expected mostly stories of people getting scammed, but instead read about shy-but-kind guys who never got on dating, ending up with badass women and really enhancing each others’ their lives. I’m fairly sure that was the only 1000+ comment thread where I read every single post.

Suffice it to say I was fascinated enough at least to reach out to some of these services. They're called International Marriage Brokers, and they don't call the people you meet on there ""mail order brides"" obviously. Signing up for a screening may have been the most embarrassing moments in my life, particularly the requirement that I give them a notarized document affirming that I was indeed single. It took a couple weeks of screening (in which the marriage broker seemed very confused why I was trying to use their service as a 28 year old male) but i was finally sent results! Results that were pretty much guaranteed to result in marriage. One of them seriously stood out: she was cute, had interesting passions, and seemed so kind. Honestly I was pretty enamored… but it was 6k to take any further steps. After careful consideration I felt like it was best to just keep giving the normal version a try. At least for a few years

It’s been 2.5 years since then. I’ve been on dates with probably 20 women since then… the most notable relationship that came from that was a girl I dated for 2 months that eventually faked a pregnancy to try to get me to keep talking to her (she sent me fake pics of pregnancy tests and everything, it was wild). Of the 20 women, there were about 2 that after dating I was seriously interested in, but neither worked. Dating has really just sucked. Like soul crushingly sucked. Like I’ve had to train myself to keep putting more and more of myself out there, just to keep having all of it rejected… I really really hate it.

The other day I was cleaning out my email and came across the emails from the International Marriage Broker again. I thought about the girl in the email that enamored me and I thought about the last 2.5 years since I decided I’d rather do things “normal”, and all I could think about was how if I just spent the money 2.5 years ago where I could be at with my relationship with this girl.

I’m done with the normal way. It weighs down the entirety of the rest of my life. I hate the ghosting (from either side). I hate having to talk to 3 people at once, asking scripted questions to suss out who “might” be legit among the throngs of swipeable options. I hate having to think about people as ""swipeable options"". I hate that I can’t care immediately, or it scares people off – I hate finally letting myself care just to get shut down without explanation. I hate that I feel like i HAVE to be showy, or a dick, or change who i fundamentally am to get noticed on some app. I’ve lost all faith in finding a partner the “normal” way. “Finding the right person” has haunted me for the better part of 25 years and I’m done. I just don’t think it’s for me.

I’ve thought a lot about this and I’m going to start the process to meet a woman over one of these IMBs, and I’m willing to spend upwards of $75k on the process to get it right. I’d rather have the person I can spend the rest of my life with than a down payment on a house. 

Am I crazy to go down this route? Is it wrong? It seems insane but the more i think about it a huge weight starts to feel lifted off of me.

“...last love. only love. it’s only love.” - the maccabees
22 f / 24 m
i 
am absolutely crushed after splitting with someone i was with for an entire year. he didn’t want commitment but I stuck around. we rushed into things way too quickly so it’s always been 50% friend 50% lover. i loved our friendship so much, we bonded over music and it was so great. i finally found someone who understood it to my extent and it felt good .... until it didn’t. in January, he wasn’t really treating me like a partner so i ended things. he said some really hurtful things to me so i thought it was best to part ways. turns out we ended up missing eachother and after a month of no contact, reconnected. we moved too quickly, again. he broke up with me the day before Mother’s Day and I am torn. I can’t listen to shit. we both have different love languages (mine: touch his: words) and i stressed to him that I was trying to communicate with him but it wasn’t good enough for him or we’d still be together. I tried so hard to save our relationship but he didn’t even want to see me. He wants to be friends but I can’t do that cause I love him too much :( it’s so sad, i don’t understand why we can’t be both of those things? 
I sent my last text to him this morning telling him exactly how I feel. I told him that maybe one day we can reconnect and take it slow like we should have from day one. I personally think we just need time alone to grow. We’re still young. I’ll never forget our connection. 

He’s my purpose. It’s hard to think that I might have to go about life without him.

We went to counseling, emotional abuse escalated, I separated for safety, and I divorced after seeking counseling from both a therapist and religious leaders.

Fast forward a month of not seeing him but we talk everyday. And this guy(B) I previously dated messaged me once before to which I rejected. But since that rejection I still thought about him and thought about the what ifs, but guess I pushed it down. He messaged me again 3 weeks later basically expressing how he’d kick himself if he didn’t try to catch me one last time. I originally rejected this but we ended up on a phone call discussing the situation as I felt this sort of sadness in me when saying no. We had a proper talk about it all, he said his intentions and said it was his mistake for originally cutting it off and thought this was a good thing he messed up and basically asked for a second chance to see me again

We met for a coffee as I felt I had to see where my feelings were and the chemistry was all there. I think what I’m missing with the other guy (A)is chemistry, even though we get along it’s sort of like I feel I have to think more about what I say, whereas with second guy (B) I can be anything. and maybe because of his sudden move away, things were fast forwarded. I have a lot of fun with the second guy and I feel a stronger connection romantically, and that’s just something I can’t hold myself back on.

We communicate/text everyday and we set up calls most days of the week. I asked him if he is married but he insists that he is single and not in relationship. However, he has weird time, especially on weekends. 

Another one, I can't seem to find any digital trace of him. He won't tell me his FB or his place of work. In fairness, his job is requires manual labor so I understand the busyness.

Don’t get me wrong his sister is adorable but the fact that she cannot speak English is a problem because of course he will be there entertaining her all day and again I feel left out.

all the signs to to speak, even said next time I go out to eat ask her she'll come. fast forward a couple weeks I ask her.

She didn't read the message for 2 days, then at work she said sorry some family stuff happened she  couldn't make it, I was told by all here she's not interested any longer and to back off and not make work place awkward for her. so I did so, stopped texting, didn't flirt at work. kept my head down, was professional, not cold, we still talked like everyone else.

over the past week she began reaching out first via text...
I still kept it polite, friendly nothing more, come Monday morning I'm talking to my colleague where I'm going for lunch, she over hears and says. ""I wanna come with you, I'm coming with you"" I said that's fine but the boss won't allow it today as someone is off sick and no1 to cover lunch, tomorrow she's back we can go then.


rest of day continues she's very flirty, keeps seeking me out asking questions, stands close etc.

we get home she texts me again at night, I say we'll go lunch tmoro if u want. she says, ""sounds like a plan cant wait"" at 7am.

15 mins later she writes,"" we don't have to go, we'll order in if its an issue"" which is odd but I ignore it and say
"" itl b fine, well go today, iv sorted cover"".

15 mins later ""but I cant eat, I'm on a diet from today iv got a show on the 28th"" I said that's fine we'll just get you a salad or something...( why say you want to go lunch 15 mins earlier? sounds like backtracking.


10 mins later  ""I also have to do something else at lunch""  at this point I'm annoyed, not only did she instigate it, then she agreed to it, only to start making excuses and back track within 40 mins?

any ideas what caused this?

I said"" that's fine we don't have to go, do what you gotta do, I asked cause you said you wanted to go yesterday"" 

I get to work 10 mins later, she's fine, for 4 hours, we talk, it's all natural. I get back from lunch, she then proceeds to give me the cold shoulder and ignore me for the next 4 hours.

2. what do I do from here?
3. do I reach out to her and ask if iv upset her in anyway?

Weve been on 2 dates and I’ve sorta caught feelings for a her. But I hate her at the same time. And I know that sounds crazy because it’s so early. But basically the first date went pretty well. We went out to dinner had some drinks and we enjoyed each others company. She was clearly very attracted to me as I was to her. She ended up staying over that night and we fucked. Now after that I noticed she pulled back a little and seemed a little less interested in me than she was prior to the date. I feel this was just to me underperforming in bedroom due to being a little drunk and not being able to stay erect. But I feel I also gave off too much of a relationship vibe. For example kissing her the next morning and stuff like that probably came off a little strong. But anyway I was careful not to overpursue this girl from this point on. I waiting about 3-4 days to initiate contact after the first date. And I tried to set up another date with her a week or so later. Despite still replying to me texts her response time slowed down quite a lot and she just didn’t seem too eager to see me again despite saying she would be interested in hanging out again when asked initially. So no luck that time I then waited another week or so and tried to make plans with her a second time but but I sort of left the ball in her court and told her to get back to I wasn’t doing much Saturday night if she wants to hang out to give me a call. When that day came I never heard anything. From that point I just decided to call the quits and move on. Even though I was pretty bummed about it. About 3 weeks went by of no contact. I was prepared to just delete her number. Then out of no where she texts me asking what my plans are for the weekend. I tried not to come off too eager but I told her I might be a little busy but I think I’m free Friday night. Then she actually asked ME out on a date. I was excited about this and I figured I had sparked her interest my moving on and not contacting her anymore. But when we went on the date. After she had a few drinks she got a little disrespectful. She was talking on the phone a lot and I felt she was even trying to make it extremely obvious that she’s talking to other guys by literally putting the phone in my face of her conversation with some other guy. At the time I was a little drunk and this went over my head abit. But after thinking back I think this was a really shitty thing to do. Especially since she asked ME out. Anyway after the date we got an Uber back to my place and she left from there. No sex this time but I’m not too bothered by that. More bothered by the mixed signals this girl is giving me.

I am sorry if this is a stupid question as I really have little to no experience of dating. So long story short I am bi and find it a lot easier to match with guys than girls on dating apps, however with both am inexperienced and have only went on one kinda ""date"" with a guy but we were just hanging out and getting to know each other as we met on a friends forum so whilst we didnt label it as a date, in theory we just hang out and got to know each other just like friends really. But anyway shortly after that we moved very fast, commited to each other but then I found out some shocking stuff and we parted ways not too long after. It was a rough experience but i did learn from it which was good. 

Fast forward a year and I have met this girl on a dating app, she lives a lot closer but still around 50 mins away via bus. We have texted for a few weeks and it seems like she is pretty into me, at first I wasnt sure as we was talking fine but then she barely spoke for about 5 days before coming back and apologising saying she was stressed out with work and busy. It did put me off a bit however have quickly moved past that now. 

She is saying doesnt wanna be friendzoned and wants to meet up but I just feel very hesitant, usually I get attached quite fast to people and wanna meet but this time I just feel like I dont mind all that much, its hard to explain exactly what it is. I think she seems a good person and probably it is best we meet up and get to know each other irl but I just feel we are on very different wavelengths right now and if we meet up shes expecting something way faster than I am which is ironic because usually I am the person who moves too fast. 

Anyway I hope I make some sort of sense and to sum it up should I meet irl with this girl if I feel little attraction when we talk on social media?

I really can’t tell if this guy is interested. I’m getting so many mixed signals. So we matched on tinder 2 months ago and have hung out like 10 times since and had like 4 sleepovers. Although we have only hung out late at night except the first time hanging out. He didn’t initiate a kiss until the 2nd date when he walked me out to my car. Every single time we have hung out it’s because I initiated it, he still to this day has never asked. When I ask though, he always says yes or if he can’t he tries to reschedule. He seems like he hides all of his emotions, not once revealing any feelings and has never complimented me. We have been texting every single day but he takes like 2-4 hours to reply to each message for probably a total of 4 or 5 texts a day. He seems into me so I’m conflicted. Plus when we text it is nevwrrr dry and neverrr sexual. He always sends paragraphs about his day, about my day, etc. he has never really flirted over text either. i asked him last time we hung out if he was interested in me and he said “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t” but that didn’t really help with anything. It seems like he does like me when we are together too because he’s always trying to touch me after sex, cuddle, etc. plus he always wants to learn about me and ask questions. I guess I’m just not used to the lack of compliments and sexual innuendos. I occassionally flirt and show general interest that I like him so I feel like if he was just looking for a hookup he would have told me so I wasn’t being strung a long.

At work we eat lunch together, go for walks, and hangout all day. Occasionally text and snapchat. I have no intention of sleeping with her, or going on “dates” outside if work. 

All my co-workers think we are dating.

My friends and gf outside of work do not know this girl even exists.

I am also celibate so that is mot a concern at all.

Is this wrong? I dont feel like its wrong but I dont want my gf or friends to know.
