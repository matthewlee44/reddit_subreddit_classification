I moved to a new country a few years ago and I still don't know more than a handful of people that I could actually hang out with. This was mainly because I was busy with school and work and adapting to this new country but also due to me not caring/investing in my social support system. As result, I sometimes find myself feeling some sort of loneliness and existential void, which in a strange way makes me yearn for having a female partner/girlfriend. However, I found that on the rare occasions that I actually hang out with friends (of any gender) and other people and have a good time, my desire to have a gf drops by like 50% instantly. I feel so happy and I feel like my needs are met and having a gf turns into something extra that complements my life rather than being an existential need.

 I believe that this is true for a lot of other guys there oo.
In some online dating profile reviews, I see other dudes posting their profile consisting of like 5 selfies, sometimes all of them taken in their room, and then you see them admit in the comments that they don't have any friends to hang out or do semi-adventurous or fun activities.  I think that is the first step that we need to fix. I took some baby steps toward fixing it personally but it could be a long way to actually get there. My advice to other guys here is that if you don't have friends and a solid social circle, that might create the type of painful loneliness that makes you yearn for a female partner as a sort of compensation for the lack of friends. It is better to focus on a lively social life before moving toward the goal of finding a life partner. If you actually interact with different people in the real world, chances are you are more likely to find a girlfriend too! having a social circle in itself also turns you into a more attractive man in the eyes of women. everyone wants to have a partner that does things and knows people right. I bet even most guys find women with a lot of connections more attractive than women who live an uneventful life without connections to other human beings.

there are tons of articles on reddit and such on how to make friends and develop your social circle so I won't go into the details of that but it might worth it to spend an afternoon or evening reading on them and doing some research.",,,

Lots of laughs and she had an emotional moment at the second bar where she ran into her ex but I handled it really well, which she told me afterward. We left and went back to my place, she met my roommate who is my best friend. We went to my room and made out for a while and had some really cute moments but did not have sex because she said she doesn’t have sex on the first date, which I told her I respected.

We headed to another bar and things were a mix between me clearly being tired but then getting back to laughs and a good time.

We walked back to her apartment complex and we walked around a bit there while I waited for my Uber. Then we made out before I got in my ride.

Texted her I got home and we exchanged thank yous for hanging and both said we had fun. Then I told her I was going to bed, and that’s where we stand.

So, I had been considering OLD, because I felt a strong desire to have my first relationship and lose my virginity. I was on the fence for a long time, because I don’t like having a spotlight on me and being vulnerable online to strangers. I’m generally a pretty reserved, low profile, introvert.

Last weekend, I impulsively created a bumble account. Been trying to live like Larry a lot more lately. Yeah, I finally managed to grow a pair and make an account. I figured what is there to lose? My chances of meeting a girl on OLD are 0% if I’m not on OLD.

I was honestly shocked by the choices available to me, I swiped left on almost every girl that was recommended to me. Made me question at the end of it if I might be asexual, or low libido, because I had no desire to talk to the overwhelming majority of women on there.

I discovered some things thru this trial by fire. Initial impression was most of the women seemed to be very high maintenance, have super boring personalities, and are shallower than a puddle. Others seemed to have daddy/mental-health issues. And others had terrible attitudes, social medias in the bio, narcissism, and many other red flags.

I’m sure you can find quality women on dating apps, but they seem to be a fucking needle in a haystack if they are on there. So many vain, superficial, boring girls that it made my head spin.

Maybe I have very unrealistic and high expectations, but good God, if this is what I’m dealing with, then I might be ok with dying alone. 

I value myself a little more after this experience, I want to improve myself even more, I want to put myself into situations where I can organically meet unique women who I can click with, rather than selling myself on the meat market. It actually makes me feel a little more confident in my uniqueness, and now I want to find a woman who is a good fit for me IRL.

I want a woman who will love me for me, someone who gets my soul. That is hot to me, and I’d even go for a conventionally physically unattractive girl if she can connect with my soul. I don’t want to entertain or waste money on girls who only care about stupid shit like how tall I am and if I have tattoos, or whatever else.

Yeah I’m a little more self assured now, which I’m very happy to have gained from this experiment. Yeah, I feel a lot more confident myself now. I was preemptively expecting that it might destroy my self esteem, but I feel stronger as a result. Not even too bothered that I only got one match, because I can’t imagine myself being with a lot of these people.

My advice to any of you on the fence. Go ahead and try it, get a few decent enough photos, some info about yourself, and start swiping. Not expecting to get any matches, but just to see what’s out there, to explore. Obviously, ymmv, maybe you won’t think the same as me.

I get it now, these apps are soul sucking by design. I do not think I will be returning to any OLD apps for some time. But, I’m glad I finally tried and got to see what they’re like, instead of being in that “what if” limbo for years. Now I have my answer, and a new approach. What an incredible epiphany this was.",,,

He was listing our everyone’s names and counting, and when he got to my name, he sort of paused/hesitated, so I said “…*my name*” and everyone laughed. He kinda chuckled and said “I know your name”.

I’ve been so upset since then. It’s not a huge deal but it’s making me regret asking him out because he obviously doesn’t give enough of a shit to even remember my name. My friend said that he’s probably just stressed from finals and blanked, but my name was literally the only one he forgot.

We have been hanging out pretty much every weekend/at least once or twice a week. I always enjoy spending time with this person, but a part of me feels like things might be going a little fast. Another part of me feels like he might not like me that much. I'm confident that he would let me know if he wasn't feeling it, but at the same time I feel unsure about some things. 

I've already asked him what he's looking for and I implied that I wasn't looking for a FWB. When asking, he didn't directly say he was looking for a relationship, but that he wouldn't do certain things with me if he was only looking for sex. And sometimes when texting, I won't always know what to say right away. Usually it might take at least a couple hours between texts because we both are busy whether it be work or school or family matters. 
 I guess I'm just nervous about a lot of stuff because I know I like this person and want to keep getting to know them, but am afraid he might become uninterested at some point. I consider myself average looking and him very attractive, so I obviously have insecurities there. Wondering if I should just straight up ask him or see through his actions.

I love my friends and they love me but I feel like they’d be disappointed in me cause I tend to date really good looking girls usually and I get a lot of compliments from girls and guys weirdly enough for being a hot guy.
I personally could not care less about a girls appearance as long as I find her cute and as long as she’s got a nice personality.
Now my problem is I ended up really liking her personality but I’d be much happier if she had to lose a little weight (mind you she actually eats very healthy food unlike me) 
So I’m not sure if I should keep seeing her cause I did actually like her anyways technically as in my eyes she’s pretty and her face is just too pretty and cute or if I should break it off before it gets more serious cause I don’t wanna end up hurting her if she meets my friends and family( my parents also don’t like chubby girls).

I [23m] work at a local coffee shop in my town. We get and sell pastries from a local food joint. Every now and then, there is this girl [20] that will come in a deliver them. I think she is smoking hot. Other than the couple of times I've chatted with her when she drops the pastries off, I do not know her.

Yesterday though, I got a message from her, asking if I would like to come over to her house, drink coffee late at night (I went over at 9pm) and smoke weed. I went over, we smoked and drank coffee, but we just chatted and listened to music for the next couple of hours. When I got there, she told me she had been up straight for the last 72 hours (she deals with insomnia) The lighting in her house was all warm, she was wearing a t shirt and short shorts. We even started talking about sex, and she started telling me about this girl she has been hooking up with. I straight up asked her if she wanted to fool around too, but she said no. I feel like we had a good time, but nothing ever happend. I asked her if she would like to hang out again sometime, and she said well see (I had to leave because she said one of her friends was coming over, but idk if that was true or not)

With all of this info, was this supposed to be a hook up? Did I blow my chance? Do things like this ever lead to hook ups, after hanging out a few times? I very much so want to sleep with her, but I like to get to know someone first beforehand, even if it is a hookup. Any advice is appreciated, thanks",,,

I'm sure a lot of us read the horror stories on this subreddit and elsewhere of the craziest, most obvious, bloody crimson flags that get shared here. We would like to believe that we'd never fall for things so obvious or present flags like that ourselves, but the truth is we're all human. So, title.

I'll start us off: I tend to ignore people's history. Things like past drug abuse, criminal history, or even just history with exes. I find that it doesn't tend to land me in hot water (I'm a bisexual male who usually dates women, so it's obvious a bit easier for me to ignore someone's past unless they're extremely violent). I've had many great relationships with people who may not have been everyone's cup of tea, and so it's a flag that I don't plan to start paying attention to anytime soon. However, it should be a red flag that people keep an eye out for.

My biggest red flag I show is probably that I love too fast and hard. I definitely do my best not to ""love bomb"" anyone, but even within the first week I'm thinking about the future of a relationship, like moving in or how vacations/holidays are going to be spent. I usually get close to my partners very fast, like within the first few months, which I realize is not common for lots of people. It usually is never a problem for me, but it should be a red flag for the people I date.

I felt like because If I go and choose, she will probably think I was already talking to that woman on the low. 

And that if we do it ... one of them will want to feel top tier of course (the first girlfriend) always but like ... I was thinking of the drama that may be or am I overthinking it ? 

Question 1 is ... how can I start up a Polyamory without her thinking I been talking to that woman ? If I bring up that woman

My fiancée (M, 29) has a female friend (F, 25) and he used to like her a lot in high school (from what I’ve heard). We’re long distance so we don’t see each other often, but when we do it’s great. So he’s coming to where I (F, 25) live to visit my family to host a engagement party, and I was speaking to his mom, and she told me that the female friend is staying with his family. His other friends are coming but they’re getting a hotel. His mom also told me that she used to like him, and she’s super close with the family and they hang out all the time. This made me a bit weirded out since he didn’t tell me any of this - he didn’t tell me she was staying with him. He’s a pretty jealous guy and he gets upset about me seeing my guy friends alone which is why I’m like… wtf? 

I told him that this whole situation was weird and how he didn’t tell me those details. He said that I’m being rude and disrespectful towards her and I need to be nicer to his friends and that my family better not treat her differently. He kept emphasizing to treat her right. It was really … suspicious.

We ended up going on 4 or 5 long dates spending the night with each other hiking etc. She invited me to her birthday party. She then invited me to meet her sister the weekend before her birthday. We really did not end up getting along well. She clearly disapproved of me which I caught onto pretty quick. She then proceed to go distant on me but continued to text me. I went on vacation, when I came back she began to have a lot of interest in me again. We started hanging out a lot had a lot of chemistry I ended up really catching feelings for her.

Then I came over one night after a bar for my friend’s birthday, I was feeling a little sick ( I had literally only had 1 drink and ended up just going to her place do to not wanting to stay out which she had invited me to do) , she pointed out I was breathing really annoyingly kinda just being weirdly critical, pulled away when I leaned on her lap, I felt like she was having one of those “ick” moments. She said she wanted to sleep alone tonight so I called a Lyft and left she texted me after saying she felt sick and I said it’s all good I wasn’t offended. 
Didn’t talk for a couple days after that called her on Monday to catch up. Phone call felt a little less enthusiastic. I just kinda played it off. I texted her throughout the week, she would respond promptly but I could feel a change. She had been inviting me over every other day for the week before that. I asked to make dinner palns to which she said she had work no effort to make new plans.

At this point she had a lot of my clothing and was not really making an effort to see me. I asked if I could come grab some of my clothes and drop off a gift she had asked for. I was down to just leave it on the porch but there were tons of people on the sidewalk and I called and asked if she could just grab it from me. She basically refused to come down to get it saying she was about to get into the shower. She said she was sorry, then proceeded to say she was going to be really busy that week unprompted ( I didn’t even ask to make plans). I said it was okay see you around. 


But I was honestly feeling pretty sad at that point and texted her right after our phone call and said “kinda brutal that you weren’t willing to grab this from me I’m not tryna hang out rn I don’t know why you couldn’t just come down for 30 seconds have I done something to upset you or are you just not really feeling this anymore”

She said “I’m not upset with you I just feel sick and I have plans I can’t cancel”

Which felt kind of contradictory and probably untrue so I just didn’t respond after that.

She didn’t reach out for the next four days so decided to text to see if there was anything salvageable.

 I eventually said “hey how you been”
She said “I’ve been good how are you”

I meant it as sort of a joke but I said “moderate emotional damage but you know that’s how the cookie crumbles sometimes”
“How was work any interesting customers”

I know not a good line but i was feeling pretty upset about her total lack of effort or contact. She didn’t respond to that text, I checked Instagram and noticed her story feed was gone, so I realized that I was blocked that moment. I was pretty distraught and said “that was supposed to be light hearted but I’ll take a hint here good luck with everything”

This was after seeing each other for around 3 months. Definitely well over a hundred hours spent together. I really expected some sort of closure like her saying I’m not sure this is going anywhere etc but she legit just blocked me on all platforms the moment I said that. 

I tried moving on it’s been like a month, I constantly think about it, I’ve never been ghosted like this before honestly has me so crushed.

Have you guys experienced being ghosted like this I can understand if it was a only a couple dates but seeing someone like 15+ times and spending a lot of time together just to completely cut me off without another word. It’s really hurt me more than anything I can remember in the past year.",,,

I attempted to date in my early 20s and had a few women semi interested but nothing really ever developed due to my admitted lack of maturity at the time a well as the scarring playing a role. 

After giving up for a few years I'm now trying to put myself back out there and nothing is working. Online dating is almost off the table as people won't overlook the scarring to match with me and I would feel like a shitstain if I covered something that significant up in a profile.

I know the game and I’m not an idiot. Guys try to play the game like I don’t know what their end goal is. It’s honestly made me defensive toward any guy who is approaching me. I have to have the mindset that their actions are just ways for them to get me for sex. Anyway I observe their words if they mention sex a lot or try to hangout with no intention of a date yup that guy just wants sex. 

Anyway, this guy a couple days ago comes back asking to start talking to me again. Before he blocked me because I said if he wanted sex he could’ve just asked instead of ya know for the relationship. It kinda felt like once he knew what I wanted he was waiting for that end goal. Right after he blocked me I confronted him on fb calling him out for blocking me and he was like “well I don’t like having to repeat myself.” As in explain that he wants me more for sex.

The only reason why I brought up sex was because he sent me a gif asking to see my “titties” and I felt like he was using us talking as a way for me to feel like I could expose myself. Which I never do and never did even with my ex. So it’s two months later and he asks to talk again. I reply “I see I thought you didn’t think we’d workout.” He leaves me on read and doesn’t respond.

Wtf is this guys issue? Is it that painful to communicate? Ik he’s probably upset I asked another question that requires him to explain himself.",,,

This is a throwaway and I'm going to delete the post shortly, but I was wondering if anyone had advice. I don't really do hookups and my standards are very high, so this is the first girl I've really had feelings for.

We talked the entire winter break (late Dec. to late Jan.) and we would snapchat so much and text on snap for hours at night (almost every night in January). I really really liked her and I know she felt the same because she sent me a bunch of texts of her texting her friends saying how much she liked me and how cute I was etc. etc. So over break we snapchatted and texted a bunch, facetimed probably 10x, and hungout 3x. It was great until we had a sleepover soon after we both got back to college.

I should also note right before leaving for college (in late august) she broke up with her 3 year BF. But the day after the sleepover she got distant and I picked up on the hint and asked her about it. She told me along the lines of she just isn't ready for anything serious and won't be anytime soon, and she's really busy this semester and it's still hard cause she just got out of the LTR 6 months ago. She also said she felt really really bad (tbh she really lead me on but it was because she really thought she was ready). She even told me she thought she was ready. I mean, we were saying goodnight to each other every night and making sure we landed when we flew and got back safely etc. etc.

We snapchatted for the next 3 weeks once or twice a day but last week I told her it was too hard and she said she understood so we no longer snapchat. She's not the type to go and hookup with a bunch of guys at all and I'm 99% she's seriously just not ready for anything. I definitely did rush things a bit but she never said to slow down or anything cause she thought she was ready. In her message calling it off, she said I didn't do anything wrong and to not apologize for anything, that I was only ever a great guy to her, that it's still hard for her cause she got out of the LTR semi-recently, and she's really busy this semester (I am too though). She also told me I was the ""right person, wrong time"".

When I told her last week that I had to stop snapchatting her she also unsaved all of our saved snaps and messages with really stung but I'm hoping she was just doing that for me.

This is kind of a ramble but I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for navigating this. I've never felt so strongly towards a girl and it just sucks because the situation sucks. I know I need to move on and not wait and I will try to do that but we didn't even date and I still think about her everyday which is kinda embarrassing IMO. Idk. I don't plan on messaging her again until at least May to give her months and finish the semester or unless she reaches out because the last thing I want to do is not respect her decision or space. I'm just still stunned that she pulled such a hard 180 and just frustrated in myself that I rushed things (even if she may have wanted that pacing at first) and frustrated at the situation.",,,

She showers me with compliments often, pays for dates frequently, etc. which leads me to believe she may be love bombing me to some degree. Also when we first began dating she would say things like “you’re a good distraction.” Or “you keep my mind busy.” She’s also told me that she’s never loved someone as intensely as she loves me. I also notice that her expressions of love often seem disingenuous and more like puppy love.

I need some honest advice (from people in healthy relationships please lol).

Preface 
- I'm not a big texter and prefer to meet in person. I know from experience you can't build attraction over the phone with a girl and too much texting and chit chat gives you nothing to talk about when you're together.

- I'm a busy guy who's only usually available 1-2 nights a week


Storyline 

So I met this girl on Bumble a few weeks ago and we hit it off pretty well. 

This is the first girl I've truly gotten butterflies with so needless to say, I'm trying hard to not f this up.

She drove 40min to come see me. 

We had great convo, asked each other lots of questions, great eye contact etc. 

I took her out to eat by the beach and then a fun activity competition afterwards.

After the first date we made out for a little bit and then said our goodbyes. I texted her after to make sure she got home alright. 

The next day I scheduled another date for the following week. 

We didn't talk until that date. 

The next week she drove an hour to come see me. 

We had a great time at a really cool place and then made out for a while. 

She texted me later that night and told me what a great time she had. I responded and we sent a few messages back and fourth. 

4-5 days we didn't talk

Then I give her a call see how's she's doing and plan another date for this week. 

Here's the thing and my question. 

This girl obviously likes me but she won't reach out first. 

(My apologies if this comes off prude but this will help explain my situation) I'm used to having my phone blown by the girls I'm dating. I know she is more reserved but it still makes me wonder. 

Why isn't she reaching out?

Actions in person &gt; words over text? 

Thoughts?

Thank ya'll for taking the time to read.",,,

This girl I really like and I have been on a couple dates. 

They've gone great. Dinners, fun activities afterwards, and then make out sessions.

She's drove an hour each time to come see me and I'll drive to her this weekend. 

Her actions obviously show she's interested but she won't text me first. 

We don't talk between the dates because I know the ""dangers"" of over texting a girl (gets boring, no anticipation, etc.)

Her actions tell me she likes me but she won't initiate contact. 

She is also somewhat reserved it seems.

Hi,

Posting this from a lot of frustration and sadness. I have been seeking a CS degree and in junior year in a prestigious university. I have a job to provide my academics and daily life. I often come in media too for my innovations and contest winnings. But I always keep things extremely subtle. My parents don't know about my job. My close friends also barely notice me in the media (newspapers and magazine to be precise).

I have a girlfriend, a lot of friends, girls and boys.

But recently, nobody seem to be interested in me. I am not a kind of guy who loves to stay in the center of attraction. I love to be subtle, treated as a normal decent guy in my real life. Yes sometimes I get exposed for my works and people seem to praise me for those, but I hate that and leave the place ASAP as that makes me uncomfortable.

Recently, my girlfriend don't seem to give me enough time. I get stressed at the end of the day due to my work. I want her attention badly. I also love my friends, whenever I call them, they seem to be extremely busy and can't make time even after 4-5 months. Not going to talk about my other female friends because whatever I do, they claim that I am behaving like a ""boyfriend' where I do the same thing for my bros too. I hate to be that flirting creep. So I keep it very short with them.

My close friends and my girlfriend are the people I do things and thrive for. My girlfriend seem to be extremely busy 24/7 and gets too bored whenever I start talking to her. Even if I ask her how was her day, she says that it's cringe. Even when we meet, she is extremely busy with facebook and other apps looking for things to buy.

My friends weirdly ignore me. They seem to be very annoyed at me. I went to a vacation at a distant place, a friend(f) of mine lives there. I told her I came here so if we could meet. She vanished into thin air and did not even sent a single message.

I don't want to lose them. I love to live with as less person as possible. They are the happiness to me. But their behavior, especially my girlfriend's behavior is hurting me a lot and I feel down for 24/7. I admit everyone have their own business. But sending a message takes 2-3 seconds. If I can make an effort to reach them, is it too hard to send me atleast a single message in two days?

As everyone is somewhat avoiding me, so there is a problem with me, not with them. Am I expecting too much?

How can I be happy again and gain my confidence back?",,,

Ive never met anyone that meshes with me so well, and Ive never felt this strongly.  Ive never missed so hard, and Ive never ugly cried like this. Im genuinely mourning.

I dont know how to even process the idea that she wont be in my life anymore, even now I feel she’s the one. She’s in pain too, but she’s stronger than me.

I’m going to the gym, I’ve visited friends, I’ve got an overseas trip planned for a couple of weeks from now, I’m looking forward to things and I’m generally happy…. But I miss her so damn much

Why do I still feel like this?? Does this feeling of “she was the one” ever go away or will I always carry this into future relationships??

At the start we agreed we were casual, which I absolutely was fine with &amp; we agreed on a casual date last weekend, for her to be unable to make it as she broke her ankle a week before - which i feel she was absolute genuine about. 

But then couple days later, shes posting snaps of her in Newcastle drinking cocktails &amp; eating in this fancy restaurant with this guy then, drinking with this guy &amp; couple of friends. Her snap map showed of her in a hotel at 1 point. 
So, at first i messaged her saying to have fun then she messaged back saying she wasnt there to do anything cos of her ankle (assuming she means to have sex) &amp; so, i was only bit annoyed about this because i’d made all the extra effort with her - speaking for a month, travelling 3 hours &amp; the money I’d spent on hotel and that. 

So, I confronted her by snapchatting her what was going on and she didn’t reply, so i decided to (also as per friends advice) to remove her from my social medias as it really felt like she was taking the p*ss. Then the next day she messaged me with 5/6 angry messages saying that she’d been having a bad day so she hadn’t replied &amp; i’d put her in a mood by deleting her off socials.

Also, out of frustration in that snapchat message I admitted i was growing to like her and, she angrily responded in the text message how we’d agreed to be fwb. 

So, i explained how i felt about the hotel situation &amp; she said the guy i’d seen on her snap was just a friend, and she was with other friends too.

Then i said about the snap map, and she replied with along the lines of ‘stop being a jealous boyfriend/date’ &amp; she can have fun with whoever she wants.

So since I’ve been trying to communicate, by saying we need to call to talk it out and, every time she’s made excuses &amp; yesterday prior my latest attempt to call she said I’d been acting strange and, been having go at her lately (I only tried to explain how i felt about the hotel situation and, with us generally &amp; vexed it out in frustration after one of her lame excuses, saying she was too hungover). She also asked what was going on with me &amp; whenever if i liked her.

Then, she said she wasn’t in the mood to call after I suggested calling to discuss it again.",,,

I’ve been in an ldr for 2 years with my amazing boyfriend. I’m (23f) he’s (22m). He tells me he loves me always and visits me.

Backstory: my bf works at a cellphone store 

Anyways, he’s a very friendly guy and loves to make friends. All his friends tend to be girls because he finds it easier to be friends with them since the guys in his area are trashy. He has some but they’re online gamers. Being said, my bf said he made a friend yesterday. this girl came in as a customer with her ex bf at his store. Well call her lily. Lily comes in with her ex and my bf helps her with her phone. Her ex ended up leaving the store to go to a different one. Lily then chats with my bf about how she just moved from a state to this new state to life with her bf but they recently broke up. She told my bf how she is graduating nursing school and needs to figure out how to get money to move in somewhere asap.

Now, I trust my bf. I just don’t like the idea that today he kept mentioning her. They text so it’s whatever. So he asked her today that they should hangout so he can know more about her life story and she said she’s free in august. He also asked if she wanted to be roomates and then she said “we’re strangers still” or something like that. My bf lives with his chaotic family and needs to room with someone anyways, but why HER?? Can’t he find another damn person. 
I feel like the 3rd wheel, I don’t know how to react sometimes. I don’t say anything cause I don’t want to seem insecure but I really am jealous because I don’t know her. They already follow each other on ig.
I’ve been so angry I’ve been bottling it up ):",,,

Most of our dates are home made dinners (mostly my preference). However, when we do go out, we always split, or I end up picking the bill because I feel like splitting is tacky. He usually offers to send his half and unless it's a considerate amount I decline. I think he has picked up one bill since we've started dating, and I somehow feel he was expecting me to transfer my half. 

He picks up the ingredients for whatever he's cooking, but if I ever want anything extra (even the smallest thing), I have to get it myself. He doesn't necessarily say it, but I can tell by the way he acts - he tries to convince me whatever I want to get is unnecessary or too expensive. 

He looks for deals on everything, which I normally wouldn't mind, I do the same thing, but not to this extent. I know he makes more money than me, so it is not a money issue. The gifts he got me so far were ridiculous, while I tried to personalize whatever I got for him and listened to what he actually wanted.

I didn't want this to bother me, but it is bothering me and I am losing attraction. I don't think he should pay for everything, I have no problems picking up the check every now and then, but this whole rigorous 50/50 thing is grossing me out. Whatever I suggest, he suggests the cheaper, wacker thing. And it's not like I suggest luxurious things.

I grew up poor, and for as long as I can remember I wanted to live a life where I don't have to double check prices and remove chewing gum from my shopping cart because I feel it is too expensive. Now that I have created that security for myself, I don't want to be with someone who will make me go through it all over again unnecessarily. He grew up rich, so I truly cannot comprehend where this is coming from.

I don't know how to bring up this topic, and I also feel that this isn't a character trait that will change anyway. Should I just end it now? Is this an incompatibility issue that cannot be worked on?",,,

I did say upfront when he arrived that I was really anxious but after his visit he said he was surprised to see no visible signs of my anxiety besides some fidgety behavior. I joked around a lot because I didn't want to make him uncomfortable so I think he thought I was fine. Last night, I confided via text that I truthfully wasn't feeling so great and had been on the verge of tears all day. He was sympathetic (via text) but I honestly just wished he would have done a little more and called me (he lives over an hr away so can't easily visit). I know I could just simply tell him this but I'm worried about coming across as ""clingy"" or like I'm trying to place my burden on him. I do see a therapist for my issues.

We would usually text all day and have long phone calls before we met in person. Once we met we stopped having phone calls and just spent more time together in person but text most of the day still. A lot of the conversations we have face to face are very surface level, like how was your day, or food things like hey I saw this new restaurant by your house. Rarely the bigger things are over text. Like when he first told me he loved me and wanted to be in a relationship it wasn't face to face.

He was a virgin when we met and wasn't pushy at all about sex but we have a pretty good physical chemistry and it ended up happening a couple weeks after we became exclusive. It was very hard getting him to open up to me in the beginning. Like for a good while I doubted he was even interested in me romantically. He was not forthcoming verbally or physically at all. But it seemed like progress was happening slowly but surely. Lately I don't really feel that way.

Basically we don't talk. If we see each other, we just make mundane small talk, make out, have sex, and he falls asleep. If we're at his place I'll just go home but if we're at my place I'll get up and go watch TV or play some phone games or watch youtube or whatever. I have never heard any goals or aspirations of his. I don't know much of what he's passionate about currently. I do enjoy intimacy with him but my biggest reason for doing that was more because afterwards when we'd talk he'd be the most open with me, relatively speaking. But it's like pulling teeth. I hate feeling like he hates talking to me about deeper things. It makes me feel like I can't tell him about things myself.

I recently made a big confession to him on the problems I had with this. I told him a lot of what I said here but also that I didn't want us to have to struggle with coming up with what to say to each other and I wanted to get to know each other and be more comfortable with each other. His response was pretty upsetting. He basically just said he was sorry for causing me stress over worrying about problems with us, he wished he could be everything I need, he wished he wasn't an idiot, he knows he's bad at this (at being in a relationship), and he's sorry.

I know we're less than 2 months in. I know some people take time to open up. But he's specifically said he's happy with our time together as it is (meaning the small talk, sex, sleep). He has no problem with what we do as long as we're together. I laid it all out how I was feeling and his reaction didn't come across like he was planning on making any changes. I've been leaning on a friend for emotional support pretty heavily lately. It feels horrible that I don't feel I can do that with my own bf. At this rate it feels more like we're friends with benefits. I feel guilty when communicating my negative feelings about the state of the relationship with him. So far no changes get made and I end up apologizing to him for burdening him with my feelings.

I just don't know if I'm expecting too much. I have really limited dating and relationship experience. Is there some way of getting back to making progress with him or is the only option to end the relationship?",,,

- Dinner and drinks
