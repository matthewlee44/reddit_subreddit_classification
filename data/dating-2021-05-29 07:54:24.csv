My emotions were all over the place and I ended up posting a rude and indirect message in ig, and it took it personally even. though it wasn't directed towards him. I apologized for it but I was still pretty emotional and didnt want to tell him about what I was going through over the phone because it is a heavy subject. Since all of this, I have tried to reach out ad explain myself, but he has gone MIA. He has temporarily deleted his ig and hasn't spoken to me in a week.

Recentely I' ve been thinking about giving up with all this 'dating' thing.  I am 26 m,  I've had 2 girlfriends in the course of my life, one was a short relationship (some months) and the next one was even less, like  some weeks. 
I've  got dumped without even knowing the real reason. The girls never explained it to me. Maybe I am just not made for this, maybe I am  not fit or worthy for a fulfilling realtionship. 
Although I had 2 gfs, I am still virgin. And not by my choice. 

So, if I may not be made for this, I'll concentrate on starting bussinesses instead and  I hope to become very very rich. 

But a question that is still crossing my mind is this : is it really easier to date as a rich man?

First off, I (24M) have never had any luck with women. Kissless virgin here. But I have alot of female friends and relationships comes up as a topic quite often. I think I have spotted a pattern. Alot of these girls have told me about the creepy dudes that tried to kiss them and such. The guy leaned in to try to kiss them and she jumped back.

But! I've also heard how these women met their current boyfriends and it's often described like ""he started to kiss me"" or ""I don't know what happened but suddenly we were kissing"". 

It's the exact same behavior from the male. The only difference is that the woman happened to like him. I wonder how many girls the guy had creeped out before he met the right one who found him attractive.

18,nnpvga,1622302365,Hold out or just cut ties??,"So a bit of backstory here, I’ve (28M) known her(25F) for like 7+ years as we used to work together. I knew she had a crush on me and it seems she’s always liked over me the years. Always keeping in touch and texting me etc. Even at one point calling me asking me why I didn’t love her. I guess in a way I just brushed it off cuz I only viewed her as a friend and wasn’t attracted in that way.

At some point a couple years back we began sexting and such which led us to attempting to have sex (whiskey dick) which whatever we continued as friends.

Fast forward to 2 months ago. She hits me up asking to go to Vegas with her friend group. I said sure why not. We spend lots of time together, share a room and have sex. Meanwhile during the trip her entire friend group is hinting that we should be together. I guess on some level I began to agree. 
 
After the trip we hang out all the time. She invites me over the sleep in her bed every other night it seems. I began to grow feelings for her. Then outta the blue she texts me saying she doesn’t want to date anyone right now and needs to work on herself and be more independent but she loves our friendship. Which is fine it just doesn’t really match up with her intentions for the entirety that I’ve known her. I mean does she really just want to work on herself or is that just a polite way of rejecting me??

I’m a bit sad but that’s life. I can’t stop thinking about her and it’s really hurting my mental health. We haven’t seen each other since then but text once in a while to see how we’re doing. I’ve done all the cliche things like working out and focusing on myself and to great success I’ve lost 20+ pounds etc. 

It just doesn’t seem to help. Am I better off keeping our friendship even though it’s sometimes hurtful or just cutting off contact entirely??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnpvga/hold_out_or_just_cut_ties/

- For the last 9.5/10 months he continues to still watch my Instagram story at least 1x per month

Think if a guy has no other options because he has dealt with this scenario with all other girls. Of course he’d take the offer but think about this. 
He has gotten to the point to where he was interested in the beginning and made moves and was rejected every time but still remained friends with her. Now that the the opportunity arises he doesn’t even care anymore because he has tried and it’s only right when she feels like it. I’m not saying she should have sex whenever you feel like it but after all that time and out all the guys she has slept with between the time you guys have been friends, now it’s finally your turn.

Now if she isn’t interested in being friends with benefits/fbuddy in the beginning. It’s best to move on if you aren’t looking for a platonic friend. Is that so wrong?

I’m sure most men would be fine with being friends if they had their sexual needs met(many don’t unless you masturbate) but desperation kicks in and they try to do anything to get at at least something.

My now ex and baby daddy have been apart for a little over a month now and have just recently started talking again and on occasion messing around.

He then went on to say that I’m not being honest about having been with anyone (sexually) because I felt different on the inside and I just needed to be real with him about it because he would morally have to just accept and get over it since we aren’t together. I’ve told him I’ve been talking to some people but that’s where it ends  and it’s true. I barely even talk to them - like I’ll give one or two replies and then just stop answering all together as I’m not even really looking for sex I just get lonely at times and would like someone to talk to but after I start I realize it’s not helping anyways. I have our son to think about first and I do . (I’ve only been out three times since we split each was with friends who didn’t want to be around while we were together and none of the times did anything other then hanging out and catching up with them happen.)He then had me walk him to the car and kept saying how he doesn’t need anyone fake and how I have to cut off whoever if I want to get back with him . There’s no one to cut off! It really makes me mad at this point because when we were together he was saying the same thing . I had to be cheating because I would randomly feel wider or deeper in my vagina. I never did anything like that when we were together but he has it stuck in his head . I told him I have no reason to lie but he says I do. I really want us to work but I feel like this is a big sign we won’t . He already said last night people are getting weeded out of his life that shouldn’t be there and if I don’t want to be one to just tell him the truth , but that obviously isn’t working .

I like what I know about him, he seems genuine and I want to meet up again. I sent the first message after our first date and I've yet to hear back from him after our second, but feel like leaving it in his court this time. I felt more of a spark on the first date and maybe that was because it was a more active date and walked off some of the nerves? I suppose I’m wanting to go a bit deeper and I’m not sure how much is nerves. I want to open up to him, see if there's an emotional connection, but he has to be willing to ask the questions. Maybe it's nerves or he's wanting to keep it more playful and flirty? Any tips so I can continue getting to know him? Date ideas that may help us get more familiar - sooner than later?

Ever since then, I've tried dating, but to no avail, as things seem to not work out most of the time. Recently, I have become more aware of my mental health and the trauma that it caused, and I think that's impacting my approach to dating. So, I've decided to take a break from it all and not be actively looking for a relationship, at least until I 1. Feel comfortable with myself and 2. Learn to live with the trauma. Therefore, that means that I have to consciously stop ""being on the market"", so to speak. I tend to not feel too good when I'm single, as the loneliness kills me, and I tend to get jealous of other people who are in good relationships. I also tend to have a low self esteem, and not being in a relationship doesn't help that either. Several friends have echoed this sentiment, and are encouraging me to ""embrace"" being single.

So, there's this trainee that joined the company about 4 months ago.

In the beginning, we hit it off very well; I can tell she was very comfortable around me, given how she was willing to talk about anything and everything. She would greet me enthusiastically every morning, and check up on me whenever she was working from home. I would do the same to her whenever I knew she was stressed out from work, or just feeling down in general. We would always wait for one another after work to go back together, and even after parting ways, she would text me random stuff to keep the convo going. We could talk until the wee hours of the morning at times, only finally going to bed cause we got work the next day.

We went out for dinner twice, and each time we did we would spend hours just talking; until we just barely catch the last train home. During said conversations, we would talk about very deep topics that we couldn't usually talk about at work; at times, they can be pretty heavy.

All was going fine until one day our convo happened to be about gender inequality (i.e. She mentioned how the bar for women has always been high, to which I asked her ""from her POV, how is it so?""); to which she straight up told me ""let's not discuss such ""controversial"" subjects. if you'd like to learn more about it, the internet has lots of articles and opinions on them, all of which have been articulated better than mine could. my opinions on these are not essential to our current work nor our friendship. there are lighter subjects we can always chat about.""

Even after offering my sincere apologies to her, things haven't been the same since. Our conversations nowadays aren't as exciting/natural as it was before. Her replies have become one-liners at best; most of the time, I'll just be blue ticked. Even at work, she actively avoids me now, when before she used to seek me out to keep her company.

Wanting to try and mend our friendship, I reached out to talk to her via text - couldn't do so in person due to heightened COVID measures in my country. However, instead of communicating what the real issue was, she just told me the issue was because I asked a controversial question and I was getting too comfortable with her - how this was disrespectful to her. Furthermore, she would just give very vague and emotional answers. She ended the convo by saying how she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

Typically, I would just move on but for some reason she just means a lot to me that I just can't accept the way things turned out. To further add to my conundrum, my colleague (whom she would confide to sometimes) just told me that she has possible feelings for me as well. 

Should I call her up and tell her how much she means to me and how I don't want things to end just because of this one small issue, or should I really not bother anymore ??

The usual goes something like this.

\- Ask an interesting girl out after some courtship that feels like a job interview for an unpaid internship. They'll almost always say ""Yes"" but only around 5-10% will actually stay true to their word after a few annoying weeks of sorting out logistics.

\- Go on the actual date. Be forced to guide the entire conversation as charismatically as humanly possible as the date is way more often than not, too shy, dull or lacking pratice to carry a conversation themselves, but if you can't make up for it, you won't get a second date. The few times she takes the initiative is to ask boring interview-like questions, or logistics. Still, you gotta pretend you're having a good time and keep a smile. 

\- Pay for the entire date, regardless of how well it went, or if she intends to go on a second. You could ask to go dutch but then you guarantee yourself not getting a second. (Yes, I'm aware some women are okay with going dutch, but most aren't, and even the ones who say they're okay with it will still think less of you for it)

\- Kiss... maybe? Try to read the non-existent body-language or communication skills to guess whether or not you should because god-forbid your date actually expresses what she wants, and if you pick wrong you're not getting a second date. 

\- After doing everything perfectly, and getting lucky enough that another fellow didn't do everything perfectly as well but used the right perfume or had a more compatible zodiac sign (this isn't a joke), set up a second date and do it all over again.

In the beginning, at least my heart was racing from nervousness, now I just find myself bored with the company, and seeing dating an uninteresting chore. Even the potential of having sex isn't keeping me infatuated, because of how much effort would be required to get to that point, and if sex even comes around (which is also a guessing game like kissing because god-forbid your date show any initiative or be upfront about what she wants), it'll still be a performance show, focusing on her pleasure, where she'll probably just starfish, to even hope to get a second round. 

I used to spend a lot of time analyzing potential dates before asking them out, but that was a surefire way of getting hurt and being taken advantage off, so I've limited the time I take to ask someone out. I've also been selecting dates based on their initiative before we even start talking as well as how our first few conversations go, but even then, their initiative dies the moment the date starts, nerves I'm guessing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nntinm/is_any_point_of_dating_fun_for_men/

I’ll put my hand up and say it wasnt my greatest performance as, i couldn’t get my thing fully going but felt that i made up for it in other areas - which i could tell by her facial expressions &amp; stuff.
Despite that, it was good at times.. Just not as good as I could’ve done, if i hadn’t been as drunk.

Anyway, so we slept on the sofa downstairs and, it felt as she was playing with my hand and feet, using her hand and feet before finally sleeping. 
Then in the morning I said I was off &amp; asked if she had insta, and made it clear she didnt have to give it to me.. which she (as it seemed) quite keenly gave to me.

I noticed she didnt follow me back but, accepted my follow request. I (after my mates approval) decided to DM her saying i had a nice night, and hoped she did along with a joke how my thing wasnt fully working.. and, whenever she’d be down for doing something like that soon on a casual basis.

(I’m not gonna lie i’d liked to get know her bit better as we didnt really speak much at all).

I'm a 35M from a well-to-do family, only child of immigrants from the middle east, and grew up on the west coast in the US. I have had 4 long-term relationships in my life, none lasting longer than 3 years. The first 2 i met in college, the second 2 i met through friends of friends. I have a lot to offer a woman, mainly the fact that i actually want a life long partnership and family. I've also been in therapy for nearly 8 years now, and in the last year (Since my ex and I split) I have put the ""petal to the metal"" so to speak on personal growth. Took a good hard look at my issues, identified them, started attending online groups, starting drawing, reading, took stock of my values, faced issues with family head on, started caring more for body, and though i can't say that all my ailments are ""cured"" I do know i am making progress. 

Even with all this work OLD has been a 0 for me. I recognize that i am not the best looking man on earth, I do cary extra weight, but by no means am I hideous or disgusting. In fact, all the long term relationships i've had have been with beautiful women. I also understand that when woman swipe or receive messages from guys, they're looking at dudes who have better bodies than mine, so the competition is fierce. 

I also understand theirs a great deal of nuance thats lost when meeting people online. Often time our smile, or way of speaking, or energy of how we hold ourselves says a great deal about us when we meet people through friends or in person that you just can't tell in online dating. 

So, the pandemic is ending. Let's just assume OLD is a no go for me. Bars where i live are still not open for ""Mingling"" and approaching someone at a Dog Park, or grocery store, can either go really well, or you can come off as a total creepoid (So chances are slim but possible). And let's just take the workplace off the table (Mostly because I am working from home, and social gatherings with new people are still at a zero)

My question is: If you're not successful at OLD, what are your other choices in this time we're living in? Women, where do you feel most comfortable / Approachable IRL? Do i need to take classes again to put myself in more acceptable situations?  I feel like i'm the most ready I've ever been to welcome someone into my life, but seem to be continuing to strike out, and am willing to accept this is my fault, but i'm just at a loss for what to do.

(ill save some time here) it's now about 1 am and I'm headed home, so I find her tell her I'm going home, she says okay they are leaving too. (I got maybe 10 words out of her the whole night). I go home and they all go to another bar and enjoy their night, I'm sitting at home chilling when I get a text from her just saying ""I'm drunk lol"" I just respond with ""just be safe and I guess we aren't seeing each other tonight"" and she replies with ""I gotta talk to you when I get home"" 

It is now 3:30ish AM and I get a text from her ""So (S) is upset that we're talking and I didn't realize y'all were like that and I cant do that to her"" (S is one of her sorority sisters I used to be FWB with but she caught feelings so I ended that cause I didn't want that with her).

The conversation continues as I explain what we were and how (S) shouldn't be upset with her but with me if anything. Yada Yada. she then goes on to say ""I don't really know what there is to explain, I mean I like you but I can't really do that to her so I think we should stop here."" \*boom heartbreak\*

I tell her I really like her too and that it can easily be worked out. she says ""I mean it could but I don't want everyone having a problem with me""

This is where it gets saucy, I text (S) saying don't be upset with her and I know I cut you off in an asshole way so be upset with me not her because she didn't know what were or at least the full extent of it. Where she says ""I'm not upset with her, IDK where she heard that from"" I just say okay and she goes "" Just to let you know I overheard that (S) doesn't like you. so just some advice you should probably leave her alone :)"" I told her I don't believe that one because of just the way she acts around me and is wanting me to be her BF.

Come today she (E) opened the last message I sent last night around 8 am-ish and hasn't responded at all. I was actually going to ask her to be my GF today but then last night happened.

obviously, someone is lying here I just don't know who, I would guess (S) is. so I guess I need advice on what could I do to patch this up and should I message or call her so we can actually talk about the whole scenario.

I don't know if I should just wait to see if she reaches out or try and explain my side of stuff before my name gets tainted. 

TL;DR EX FWB said shit or is upset with the current girl because FWB fell in love and I ditched her. Now relationship with the girl is in jeopardy. (possible lies being told)

64,nnvnw2,1622320123,Staying away from a very flirty girl with a BF?,"About a year and a half ago I started working with a girl. We casually flirted and I developed feelings for her. I never pushed anything because I wasnt really a fan of dating a coworker. However she seemed flirty and single because she would never speak of him (didnt even know she has a bf at that time)... I decided to just remain friends with her. I asked for her insta and she gave it to me to only have her never accept my request(ok???).... Didnt think of it as a big deal because half of the office follows me and I follow them back.  A few months later she brought her BF to a work function and after that I decided to pull away from her and be professional. For around 4 months I would never approach to talk to her, only respond to work related questions and be distant. This actually made HER approach me a lot more, flirt and tease around with me and she even added me on social media... I kind of started interacting with her which made her flirt even more (she started texting me more, started touching me a lot, amped up the teasing). And the touching is no friendly touching: She would slide her hand across mine and explore my tattoos or hold my hand and say she is cold and so on.... Also dont get me started on her mood swings and her jumping into conversations when i am with other female coworkers....

67,nnvwrc,1622320975,Coming to this sub is depressing,"People are actually matching with others on OLD, go on dates and vent/ ask for advice about relationship issues. It's depressing to see people getting on with their dating lives, it's not worth mulling over this. Though, I do have to admit that it helps me to acknowledge this. 

Not after words of encouragement or advice, just venting for the most part.

There's also been a shallow feeling lately personally about the state of modern dating and also because the start of my 20's has been very lackluster. Combating the incessant insecurities and social anxiety just puts the cherry on the top. 

At this point I thought I'd finally get an epiphany of dating, that I'd suddenly realise how I've been doing everything wrong but dating just feels like a chore for me whether it's because of a surface level attraction issue, personality issue or aspirations/goals issue. 

I think I'm just not ready to date and maybe I never will be, in any case, it's just not worth my time to think about. I have nothing to offer right now and I don't believe it's because of the fact that I'm a guy as most would try to imply guys have to have something to offer and that's because everyone has some that they can offer to a relationship whether it's known to them or not. 

Working towards a goal will get me to where I want to be, if anything, because this just isn't something that will happen as easily as I think it will and maybe others here feel this way too.

I've dated around and had a girlfriends but I'm still a virgin as I have messed around and done everything except PIV

Now ironically my entire life outside of dating has been pretty great

High school and college we're all right as I got super involved with the community and extracurriculars.

I was leading at least four clubs.

And apparently I was so impressive that I got hand-picked out of a bunch of students to go to France

I get complimented all the time and I'm even noticing interest from other women but something that makes me feel weird is this idea that if you have a horrible dating life in the rest of your life must be horrible.

I've always had an equal measure of male and female friends. I'm not perfect but I've gotten along quite well without getting arrested or getting in trouble or anything.


Of course no one life is perfect le and not everybody is going to like you, but I think it's too far fish to say that a guy must have negative trait X y and z just because he struggles with dating

Right now at this moment you probably passed the perfect guy or girl up because of whatever reason.

This person could be the best person ever but because we only can take in an instant of a person especially when we're out in the world, we tend to judge quickly

I’ll start with some context. We both work together in a grocery store (different departments), and we both go to the same university. We met last fall; it started with a simple hello and some small talk and I don’t know how or why, but I fell for this girl faster and harder than any of my crushes before. She would always compliment something new I did with my style, would calm me down if I seemed stressed, and after almost a year alone in quarantine it was nice to have someone that made me happy. I ended up working passed my anxiety to ask for her snapchat, and she would steady swipe up on my stories and vice versa. One day I post a picture of my breakfast, and she swipes up and asks me out to go to breakfast with her too. The catch is, I thought that this was a date. I thought I read the signs that she liked me, like we would both blush when talking in person, she laughed at all my jokes, complimented my style, and occasionally flirted. 

We go out for breakfast one morning before we both worked, and I could start telling that it wasn’t a date to her based on small subtle hints. This is where it gets bad. As I get into work, one of my coworkers who I told about the “date” tells me, “I think I screwed things up with you and so and so.” For some stupid reason he thought it was ok to ask her how the date went. She proceeds to tell him, “you know, I’m always so nice to boys and they think that I like them.” I proceed to message her and she tells me it was just a breakfast between two good friends. I was so shook by the situation and stressed out that I ruined things between us that I was in a very bad state for a long time. She started leaving me on read a lot and treating me differently at work.

Fast forward to now, we talk like we used to at work but thats about it. She almost acts as if nothing happened. I’ve been trying to get over her for a while, but the more I see her at work the harder it gets. Like she’s still in my dreams from time to time, it’s that bad. 

I guess my question is what the heck do I do. When I talk to her in person I just get so nervous because I think that she hates me. Should I give her an actual, honest apology about my honest mistake? How would I approach that? Or should I just give up on her all together?

I never really stressed about it since i dont have a hard time getting to know people, so i always thought „if it happens it happens“, but ever since the pandemic meeting new people has gotten a lot harder.
So i decided i should try Tinder,  because i realized a lack of effort in looking for a partner might not boost the chances of getting into a relationship.

I know pictures are insanely important and i have friends that help me with them, so ive got that covered. The thing that i really struggle with tho is my Bio. Should i focus on being witty/ funny? Im guessing i should explain what im looking for? And most importantly: How far in-depth should i go with my hobbys/interests and how much is to much? 

Edit: Maybe some info about myself might help: As i said im 22/M and i go to University. Im decent looking and in great shape.

I dunno about you guys but I only deny a follow request on Instagram if I actively dislike the person or if they're like 13 years old. She's even followed by a guy I know who has almost definitely never talked to her. This means that she'd basically rather talk to someone she's never met before than me. God I feel like an idiot.

93,nnzpl1,1622334219,Beware of scammers on dating sites,"Wondering how many people have come across the scammers’ profiles? I have come across two so far. 
These are the signs to figure out a scammer. They are normally super gorgeous people. Their English isnt that great. So far both were engineers. They both just arrived to Canada. One came from Florida, another came from Dubai. They both seemed very nice and polite. And they ask a lot of questions! 
The first guy didnt want to talk at all on the app, he asked to move to Whatsapp, which I naively agreed. He told me stories about himself where he wanted me to feel sorry for. They just ask very strangely. Luckily i sensed this before they had a chance to send me links or ask for money.

Anyone else has experienced anything similar? Be safe out there everyone!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnzpl1/beware_of_scammers_on_dating_sites/

95,nnzsky,1622334528,"Spoke on phone, set a date, FaceTimed but not sure if she’s interested","Found a girl online. We texted for a few days, she showed lots of interest. We exchanged numbers and spoke on the phone for an hour. We set date for the weekend which was 4 days ahead. 

Texted enthusiasm from her end died down a bit. We texted a bit the next couple of days and decided to FaceTime the next day at 7 PM.  During the video call, she didn’t really put any effort in her appearance. No make up, she was cleaning her room, and folding laundry. We were talking for 30 minutes. I kind of sort of got the impression she has changed her mind and lost interest

At the end when we spoke about the upcoming date, we originally planned to go to a cake shop for desert and afterwards stroll on the boardwalk. It turned out to be raining that day so I mentioned hibachi which she said she doesn’t like. She asked what’s wrong with getting dessert anyway. I said that without the boardwalk, it’ll be a pretty short. She said that will be good in case it’s awkward and uncomfortable and laughed, saying she cracks herself up.

I thought that was a bit of a weird joke. Like there was some truth to it. Maybe she feels stuck and uninterested. I’m interested and I made sure I looked presentable for our FaceTime call. She didn’t. Her joke also makes me feel like we’ll go out but it’ll be a waste of money and time.

97,nnzxoj,1622335075,"What is the etiquette when the relationship has a ""failure to launch""?","I (M23) asked out this girl (F21) through Snapchat. We have a lot of common friends and have known each other for two years. There was a long period due to COVID where we didn't see each but we ended up at the same outing about a month ago where we went to a museum and did some bar-hopping and I ended up catching feelings. I asked her out through snap and she was definitely interested. She even rearranged some plans to come to a party I was having, came way over-dressed and brought a ton of sweets like cakes and pastries for my mom (we're both immigrants, if you know, you know) Sadly, after that party she needed to accept a job for the summer about two states away and I'm gonna be moving about 40 min away from the city we share in common to work my dream job but it's pretty likely we'll be able to see each other again once the summer ends. Although who knows, the job might be a lot of stress or it could not be because it's remote 50% of the time or more . We left things on pretty good terms hopeful for when the summer ends but not trying to feel beholden to each other. I suggested the whole ""not being beholden "" thing but I was probably trying to sound more ""mature"" and cool than I actually am. So my question is it ok to keep talking to this person romantically (seems cringe), just as a friend, or do I leave them alone and focus on my own stuff and try to rekindle it once the time is right. I'm feeling pretty insecure about the whole thing, I had a relationship when I was 19 that ended badly and it took me years to get over it and now I've developed a habit of being attracted to unavailable women. I really thought that asking this girl out was growth but look how that turned out...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnzxoj/what_is_the_etiquette_when_the_relationship_has_a/
