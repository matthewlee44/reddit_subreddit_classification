Just about 5 days later she asked me another question saying ""oh sorry I did not answer hahaha but why?

That same day I tried moving the conversation a bit more personal other than our grade, and we ended the chat like this:

Me: ""Hahah, I really like you"" (referring that I like her as a person lol, didn't say it as a way to say that I like her)

Her: ""Me too, hahah""

Me: ""Although I have not spoken to you too many times, you have always seemed a very friendly person""

Basically I ended the chat like this, I actually do like her and I feel that she's someone who matches my vibe and I want to get to know her. Any tips on starting the convo again in a not weird way? I really want to speak to her and get to know her.

I have tryed many dating apps, starting dates at school, at university, at work, at some other random places. And after 10 years experience in dating life, i have ended up in conclusion, that every girl uses realationships with men only just for fun. For 90 percent of women I see that they doesn’t want to create/have long term realationships. I have worked on myself too enough, if you will say to me to just chill and work with myself and just take my time. I feel like i am flourished already, because of so many experience that I’ve got with girls in 10 years of dating life.

Can I hope to find in one day that The Only One girlfriend/wife ? Or in this 1990’s generation almost every born girl just want to use men’s honesty and true feelings just for fun, and when they are asked for be in/create long term realationship, then those girls says the banal template phrase “I have a (imaginary) boyfriend” or “I am still discovering myself even if i’m 25 or 27 years old”. Do will those 1990’s born girls will finally grow up and finally find herselves in theyr 20’s - 30’s, or just even then they’ll say “I have a (still not found, but I have imaginary boyfriend) boyfriend” or “I want to discover myself even in my 50’s, so I’m still don’t want a long term realationship. Maybe come back to me after 500000 years and maybe then I’ll be ready for long term realationship”. 

Why almost every women (maybe they are still teen girls in their 25 yo) still not even thinking about future, strong long term realationship, kids, marriage, helping for each other like honest (and not narcisstic) couple and other beautiful couple things ? 

Why every girl lives only for herself interest ? Why almost every girl uses men as a toy and not for long term realationship creating ? Haven’t you, 90’s girl , already grown up from playing with Barbies and Kens ? Because men are not your Barbie and Ken doll.

IF you are seeing someone that has been cheated on, be careful. Get to know them first and see if you are truly compatible with each others desires and tendencies. Watch out for controlling tendencies like looking through your phone, skewed perspective on platonic male/female relationships, and extreme clinginess.

I'm not going to say that everyone whos been cheated is going to be difficult to date, but its possible. This event probably had a huge impact on their life and it could either change them for the better or worse.  He/She can become extremely controlling.

# Personal Story

So this happened a couple years ago. I haven’t thought about this girl in more than a year now but she came up in conversation recently as I was catching up with a friend.

I dated this girl about 2 years ago. Her ex cheated on her for the last several months of their relationship and this gave her some serious PTSD. Her outlook on life drastically changed and she became super insecure. Now she was already kinda crazy to begin with so the extra insecurity really amplified her natural difficult personality to the point where I was walking on egg shells every day. She also began worshipping this psychology professor Jordan Peterson religiously. He was good at first but now I can't stand listening to him make an argument with 1000 words that can be said in ten words. If you don’t know who he is... just look at his fan base. It's a cult. 

I met her through tinder. At first, things were great. Though I didn’t find her that physically attractive (maybe 5.5/10), I swiped right because I kinda knew her through mutual friends and was just going through a break up so I said fuck it why not. We matched and I'd say we connected pretty fast. She was chill (at first lol. more on that later), smart, and career-driven, attributes which I find valuable in a long term partner. I take her on a couple dates to get to know her better and eventually I ask her to be my gf, in which she says yes. At this point, I'm pretty excited. I tell a couple of my friends and show them a pic of my new gf, thinking they'd be excited for me. It was sort of the opposite. Turns out, they knew her or at least heard of her through mutual friends (for the record, we are kinda in this community where everyone knows or knows of each other, one way or another) and she was kind of known for being weird and difficult. Should've been the first sign but hey... I was thinking with the wrong brain. So I said fuck that I don't care.

As we date and spend more time, I'm starting to pick up why my friends had that reaction. Wow she was difficult. TBH, this was years ago and I don't remember the chronological order of the events nor do I remember all of them, but there was a lot. Let me just list out some of the crazy things I remember going through:

1. She was INSANELY adamant that girls and guys CANNOT be just friends. Now at this point in time, I had many female friends. Some I found attractive, some I didn't, but never acted on them. This was probably the number one thing we fought over the most. But check this out. She had a guy friend who she was super close to. Close enough to make those cheesy pacts where if both of them were single at the age of 30, then they marry. It was that kinda close relationship. But, to me this wasn't that bad. I have female friends and honestly didn't feel any type of way about them. I met him once when she invited him over to my apartment (which was normal because we were in college at the time and he happened to live near by) and when he came over, she was all of a sudden super flirty and touchy. Like leaning over and putting her hand on his chest. Wtf??? The hypocrisy... This frustrated me immensely not because I was jealous (still didn't care at this point but I think its because I didn't feel threatened and also no offense she wasn't that much of a catch), but mainly because we fought literally HUNDREDS of times over this notion that guys and girls CANNOT be friends... She pretty much only made that argument when it favored her.
2. She looked through my TEXT MESSAGES. Now this is partly my fault, as I should've had the backbone to not let her step all over me, but at the time, I was immature and weak. She would look for trouble in my phone and go through my text messages with my female friends. 
3. She was FAR from chill. There was this one time we were at a cashier register ready to pay, when she all of a sudden dropped some of the items we were purchasing. I chuckled because it was funny, helped her pick up the items, gave her a half one arm hug, and walked away (bc she was paying) to look at some of the items on the side. Apparently, me not standing by her side is considered un-loyal. So we had a huge argument over that which ended up her kicking me out of her car as she threw all my belongings on to the street. Like who tf gets mad over that? We had a lot of fights on similar pettiness level, all which were started by her. And of course, me being a pushover loser that I was, apologized and allowed myself to be stepped on.
4. I didn't have snapchat, but she did. I never liked taking pictures that much and was for sure not a selfie guy. She guilt tripped me into downloading it and if I didn't reply back to her snaps, she would start a mini-argument. This one isn't THAT bad but damn was it annoying.
5. Another event that I just remembered. This one pretty much happened weekly during my last semester in college. Just about every week, my roommates and I would play poker in our apartment. Usual broke college $5 buy-ins lol. Good times. Anyway, of course, knowing how she required a lot of attention, I would let her know that I would be not on my phone as I'm drinking and gambling with my roommates (3 other dudes btw). I would expect any reasonable adult to understand this and just let me have my peace, but no. Not her. Every time, without fail, in the middle of the game, I pick up my phone to multiple unread messages and missed facetime calls from her. Super fucking annoying that I couldn't have one night to myself and had to cater to her neediness.
6. This ones unrelated to her getting cheated on but I'm going to add it anyway because its just disgusting. She didn't shower after working out... She had a routine of going to the gym in the morning and running a couple miles before heading to class. But she wouldn't shower until the end of the day... wtf bruh. She would literally go straight to class after running miles, drenched in sweat. As the day goes on, the sweat dries so she doesn't feel like she needs to shower right away. I was pretty appalled by this as no one I know to this day shares this thought process. I mean it affected out sex life. Her arms were bumpy with what I think are just clogged glands and her pubic area almost always smelled bad. Couldn't get hard around her unless I was insanely high or haven't had sex/masturbated in several days.

Since he's been back, he told me he went out on a date but the person was just ""meh"" and he had kind of forgotten about the date...and then he gave me a pair of earrings that he made with his sister while he was out of town, mentioned that I was very cute, and talked with  me for about an hour in my office.

Shes a great communicator, good looking / well groomed, has good morals and values, appears to be honest, thoughtful, moderately religious (like myself) and wants the same things in life. So lots of key things ticked. 

The few things I didnt like:
- I feel like sometimes she doesnt get my humour. Sometimes I make a joke and she doesnt get it and asks me to explain. Will she grow to learn this?
- Shes very self-absorbed/self-centered and loves talking about herself. For example, if I ask her 10 questions she will only reciprocate with 1 or 2 back. This suggests she might be a selfish person?

The first date, we went to a pretty exclusive social club that costs $5,000 to be a member of. I wasn’t aware of this before the date. On it, we had a good conversation, and he kept trying to get me to drink. I didn’t think much of it, but, by the end, I’d had five drinks because he kept motioning to the waiter to order more (way more than I would normally have, especially on a first date.) 

We walk back to my car and I am trashed. Like, I don’t feel safe driving. He makes out with me for several hours, and wants me to go back to his place. I say no, then call an Uber back to my house.

He is really obsessed with me and wants to go out again. I go on a second date. I’m way more cautious with alcohol and do not let him order me drinks, but I still have THREE (by his encouragement.) He tries to put his jacket on me several times, and I keep saying no, and then he does anyway.

We go back to his apartment, and the lack of food and surplus of alcohol makes me feel extremely dizzy and unwell. I tell him I am drunk. He starts making out with me and tries to perform oral sex on me, which I say no to. I am feeling stressed and upset.

Just as a note, for some lucky reason, even if I have had six drinks (that’s the most I’ve ever had in my life) and feel like everything is spinning, I am still able to look someone dead in the eye and clearly say “I am too drunk to consent and moving further is rape and I will report you to the police.” It’s super weird, but it’s stopped all misbehavior, as I sound so serious. 

So I tell him “I am too drunk to consent,” and he kind of stops. I tell him I want to go home. He says I should sleep over. I now feel concerned something will happen to me if I fall asleep, so I call an Uber. He’s not happy with this.

When I go home, the next morning, I send him a long message detailing the number of things he forced on me and how, if we had had sex, that that would have been assault. I tell him that I think he tries to get girls drunk so he can sleep with them. Then I say that, at his age, he should know better.

I blocked him so I wouldn’t have to read his response, and it made me feel better. One of my friends told me that I was a jerk for doing that, and that I should have at least left communication lines open so he could learn more from me.

Hi, so first of all I’m new on here and idk 100% how this works but I need some feedback and thought. So for everyone that will take out the time of their day to read it and tell their opinion thanks a lot.

So to start of ill tell you a little back story and put the parts where the weird stuff is happening separate so it’s easier to read.

So me and my gf have been dating for over four years, I’ve known her for much longer same goes for her friend. In the first 3 years of our relationship we would hang out with her from time to time (she doesn’t live that close so we usually met up every 3/4 months). In those first 3 years everything was normal and chill the vibes were good but nothing special.

So this last year we have been hanging out together a lot more then we used to do. (once a month sometimes even more) the 3 of us would have sleepovers and it was all good. I would sleep at the outer side of the bed


Because obviously my GF wouldn’t want me to sleep in the middle. But things changed I noticed that the vibe between me and her friend changed (like I said I will note all the stuff separate down bellow so it’s easier to read)

But over the last year my GF really changed her way of behaving when it comes to her, as if she knows what’s happening. She won’t let us be alone ever, whenever I mention her name I will get a dry response and stuff like that. Them 2 never talked about it with each other but I can tell my GF is very jealous.


- I noticed her friend would look at me and seek eye contact all the time.
- She laughs at all my jokes and is on my side in every argument
- She is always calling me out (“bullying”) being annoying. Basically just seeking attention to have convos with me or have a laugh at stupid stuff
- One time we were in the bathroom alone and she was standing next to me with a oversized shirt with no panties on (not nude or anything just a regular sleeping shirt), and we were laughing brushing our teeth and she said something (can’t remember what) grabbed her panties of the radiator, politely slapped it on my arm, walked away looking back at me and laughing (I was shocked and froze hahaha)
- She told me and my GF (separate) that she’s into guys who have a girlfriend and that she knows it’s bad but she likes to play the games (which she is playing with me ig?)
- When I post that I’m in the gym, on Snapchat she will respond with stuff just to talk to me.
- Last time we were together the 3 of us parted ways and after 10 mins she sends me a stupid snap, also just to talk to me again.

Basically she just want to have contact and have my attention with me (IRL) even if my GF is there. The affection and the connection between me and her is something that is super dangerous.

The things above are just a couple of situations summarized as this has been happening for over a year. There has been much more thing that happened which I either forgot or I’m not gonna say here cuz it’s already kinda long and I don’t wanna stretch it to much.

Point is, I’m a guy that has a good intuition and I can usually tell when someone people me or not and how the vibes are. But this is different, this is my GFs friend and it feels weird. I want to believe she’s into me but I also don’t because it’s messed up. 

- also she never did anything that went to far or said anything that is like crazy, but I can just tell by the way she acts and behaves and looks at me that she’s into me (I GUESS) 

Anyway I would like to here u guys opinions on this and how I should handle it and if she actually likes me or am I making things up?

And what do you guys think she wants from me, I am acting kinda cool about it not responding to everything but like I said I’m not 100% sure if I’m making stuff up, like usually I know but this situation is different. And I’m also thinking like, if she’s into me why wouldn’t she just tell me or go a step further?

Also I was thinking of contacting her friend in private and just ask her Whatsup and what she wants from me, and also if she has been noticing some weird behaving of my GF to her, because this is having an impact on our relationship. But I’m scared because I think the affection will be to much and we will do more then just talk..

I know this one guy who on paper seems awful. I don’t even want to say he’s my friend because he’s not my friend and he’s kind of an asshole. 

He treats women shitty to the point where some of our girl friends refuse to be around him, I’ve never seen him or effort into his appearance other than when his frat has functions. Any time else he’s in a stained muscle shirt and sweat pants, all he does is drink and smoke to the point where he has to pay someone to do his work. He just seems like the anthesis of what everyone here says will help me with women.

Yet he’s always fucking different girls. Like literally always. One of us keeps a hit list of every girl he’s banged and it’s like 30 different girls. And I fully believe him because I’ve seen him just go up to a random girl at a party and bring her up to his room to different girls in a single night. It’s crazy.

I mean he’s a good looking guy but it seems like he’s failing literally everywhere else and he still is successful with women and I put in so much effort and I can’t get a girl to hold a conversation with me and I can’t figure out what’s so wrong with me that one girl won’t take a liking.

I am not sure how to navigate the talking stage and I think telling him would hurt him for no reason other than to make myself feel better. 

So I've been seeing someone from Hinge for about 7 weeks. After our first date, we've generally been in a rhythm of texting a little throughout the day, and going on some type of date once a week where we have sex afterwards.

I got tested for STIs a month ago (ish) and told him about my negative results two weeks ago. We both said that we hadn't been with other people since we first hooked up in this conversation, but we didn't talk about not seeing other people or being exclusive. 

Over the weekend, I ran into a former one night stand at the bar. I was very drunk and I decided to go home with him. 

I am unsure if I should tell the guy I am talking to about what I did. I plan on getting tested again once enough time has elapsed for the test to be meaningful. I keep going back and forth. I think at the moment, I would only tell the guy if he suggested being exclusive/defining the relationship? Does this make sense?

So, in my experience I found some preferences I have that might be weird, rare, or turn off to a lot of women, so pls tell me if there are women with SIMILAR sexual preferences / traits like mine.

My sexual preferences / traits are like:

1. Don't like or need sex toys
2. Don't have sex fetishes
3. Don't watch porn - it's boring lol (I don't care if girl watches, just telling mine stuff)
4. Not into flirt games (I like being direct and honest from start)
5. Monogamy, don't need anyone else if I find emotional and spiritual connection with a girl. (Fun fact, no one teached me this, not a culture or any religion nor parents, I just knew I am not into polygamy or other stuff)
6. Once I find someone worth my time, I don't find anyone else attractive
7. Brutal honesty and being 100% open with a sexual partner
8. When I see them alturistic traits and emotions in a women, thats attractive to me
9. I like to show my emotions and don't want to be percived as feminine because of just being genuine good and empathetic
10. I think I am demisexual actually, what do you all think?

So, even tho I have high sex drive I put all of that into gym, and while I search for a similar girl like me , I find that kind of girls are rare in this hookup culture.

4. We're talking about liking each other, seeing each other again. 
5. He uploads a selfie on Instagram, I like it. So do 20 other girls. 
6. Then I go check his Facebook dating profile and it's no longer there. Then almost immediately, my friend sends me a screenshot of his Facebook dating profile that she just saw appear in her choices and I see his new selfie that he had just uploaded on Instagram on there. 
7. I confront him and tell him I find it strange that 2 days earlier during our Facetime he kept reassuring me that he likes me and only focuses on one girl at a time and that we were planning on spending all next weekend together and yet he's updating his dating profile with new pics.

He's unsure why he still appeared in my friend's choices.
9. He said he wants us to be exclusive. 
10. He's been distant/busy the last couple days, but says I can call/ text anytime...

If what he says is true, wouldn't I have received a notification that tells me one of my matches added a picture (if he indeed didn't unmatch me prior to adding the pic)?

I thought I ruined my chances but a few days later (when his girlfriend was NOT at our house), he said I could come watch TV in his room ""if I wanted"". I declined just cuz he has a girlfriend. However, I still like him.

We’ve talked every day and have gone out about 5 times. We slept together after the second date and have seen each other more since then. We really vibe well and she shows PDA when we go out. We just decided to hang out today and explore some art stores and just walk around talking and looking for Xmas presents for family. It seems to flow really easily and it’s like we’re already dating. Holding hands and kiss a lot. We then just went back to my place and cuddled and watched a movie with some food. I don’t wanna blow it and really could see us dating. I’m really not good at the whole dating thing and it’s been a couple years since my last serious relationship. She always talks about future plans and me going to her place next time and what kind of new restaurants we could try. I just don’t know how long is a reasonable amount of time before really making our relationship official. After we hung out today, we talked about going hiking and a really nice dinner in the near future and I’m bad at reading signs but I can tell she feels the same. Maybe I’m answering my own question and typing it out and reading it helps but it feels like we’re already dating even though it isn’t official. Should i just let it go until she brings it up or just straight up ask if she wants to be exclusive? Or does it seem too early?

I have feeling for him and we have been seeing each other almost every weekend for about 6 months now. Anyways at one point I wanted a relationship and he didn’t and made it clear he was going to still sleep with other people (going out to the bar, talking about it in my face, ect) so I said okay cool I’m going to do what I want to do as well. Plus he was still questionable messing around with the mother of his child. Anyways so randomly all of a sudden he starts saying he can’t stay the night with me anymore claiming he has to (work) which may be true but he would always leave and never stay overnight like he used to and started barely responding to texts and a lot of other things that bothered me just being distant. long story short he texted me on thanksgiving saying he tested positive for an std and said he thinks I was the one that gave it to him because he claims he was having sex with me the most frequently. And although I feel it was him because as previously stated he was seeing multiple other people while I was just seeing one other person that I just started sleeping with maybe 2 months ago when he told me we were just friends and he didn’t want a relationship. So anyways I could have gotten it from the other guy or he could have gave it to me there’s really no way to know. But he thinks I gave it to him and I think he gave it to me and we both got treated and what not so we didn’t see each other and barely texted for 2 weeks then over the weekend he came over and spent the night for the first time and assuming he was clean I have him head and then after that when I wanted to have sex with him he said ok with a condom so I got one then he said oh I’m too tired. So whatever went to sleep. The next night he comes over super late and again same thing then when I asked did he want to have sex he said he didn’t want to because he just got an std from me (allegedly )and he wasn’t feeling like comfortable to have sex right now even with a condom so I said wow well we’re both clean now I got the same treatment as u. He knew this I told him I went to the doctor and was on pills like last week. Anyways he responded saying well I don’t know that and he said he cares too much about his dick and the health of it and he can’t risk getting infected again. and proceeded to call me sneaky. EVEN THO it was clear and established first by him that we were sleeping with other people. So we ended up just talking and cuddling which was still nice because I hadn’t seen him in weeks. So how can he 1. Call me sneaky 2. Blame it on me 3. Say he doesn’t want to have sex anymore. Like I’m just feeling like what is even the point anymore. And is this a permanent no sex thing or will he get over it at some point. Idk 🤷🏽‍♀️ of course I like chilling with him and we still have fun together. But like I said I really don’t know how to address the situation or who is in the wrong.
