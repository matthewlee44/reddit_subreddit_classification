We both initially bonded over our love of Final Fantasy 14, and various other topics, including shared political beliefs and nerdy interests. We waited to hang out until we both got vaccinated, which was fine by me, even though it took a bit for her to get hers. She lives 45 minutes away, so it's not even that far either. 

Talking to her is weird somewhat,we literally talk (over text) all day every day, about whatever topic we're on, but no flirting from her. Like, I've gotten maybe 3 compliments from her in the almost 4 months we've talked. I flirt on and off,and sometimes get, as she puts it, ""sappy,"" which she seems perfectly fine with and has said so,so I don't think I'm overstepping any boundaries there. 
She has a shyness about hanging out, explained to me as her being an introvert and used to not being around people during the whole COVID-19 pandemic, which I totally get. 

We didn't even see each other until laaate in July, and just met up for lunch for two hours. Then it was three weeks before we hung again, this time a walk in the park and lunch at her office (her parents own the company she works for and she can go in on off hours to her office if she wants) while playing some Switch games. Then this Sunday, she drove to meet me and we had lunch, but only hung out for exactly an hour and a half. Getting her to go on a date is like pulling teeth; she likes when she does hang out with me, but it's tough to get her to agree in the first place to meet up.  

She says she likes me, and doesn't respond negatively to me flirting or being sweet in person, but again she doesn't reciprocate. She says she was raised in an emotionality distant household so she's kind of stunted emotionally,and I get that. But she also told me when I pointed out in text that we barely hung out this past Sunday (I had plans for a few hours, she dropped on me only when we met up that she had ""things"" she had to do soon after, cutting it to only lunch) that she again likes me, but she doesn't know me that well, and that's why she seems to be taking it slow. 

Now I'm fine with taking it slow, but to me, if she wants to get to know me more and become more comfortable, seeing each other only close to once a month for less then 2 hours at a time will keep us from ever really moving anywhere. And we again have been talking in text form nonstop since we first ""met,"" so I find it hard to think she feels she barely ""knows"" me. 

Am I the asshole for thinking we'd get to know each other better if she had more frequent and longer dates? To clarify a few things: we are currently only seeing each other, to the point of us uninstalling our dating apps.

Had 2 edibbles with mates and went back to hers, was violently high, didn't know the dosage, ended up in hospital for a few hours, she was disgusted with me and didn't really want to speak to me.

2 days went by (9 June) and we met at a bar and ended up going home together, been with one another since then, asked her to be my girlfriend June 20th she said she loved me june 26th.

A month of smooth sailing till July 22 , finds texts on my phone telling a girl buddy ""I don't think I've got feels yet(June 24th)"" and my girlfriend looses it, first big fight, basically wanted to end it there.

I then went out the next day wrote a long love letter, got her a teddy and some new underwear and some flowers, all was forgiven, then that evening went to work , finished work had 3 pints drove home, she found out through my calorie tracker that I had drink drove, said she can't trust me and that I'm  liar, I promised wouldn't happen again, she forgave me and things were okay for 2 days, then the monday morning I had to inject test, it was at her flat and I shot in her bathroom (she knew I was using) freaked out because I brought it into her home and that I broke her trust.

Things were basically dog shit for the next few weeks, she spoke and treated me like shit, she then wanted a time apart on August 3rd , fucked her ex who is a 54 year old man, we are both 20, she then wanted me back August 7th, I took her back then for her to tell me she's going on holiday with him for 10 days from August 10th till 20th, nothing happened is what she said and that I need to trust her, I then drink drove again at some time during that period, told her about it because I got a speeding fine, she was upset again(I understand why) and was off towards me taking ages to reply and didn't take a call on her birthday which was the 19th of August.

She came back the 20th I had got her a nike tracksuit, flowers, a swarovski necklace and calvin klein underwear which her mom helped me pay for.

August 27th a week later I'm helping my mate move out and she's off towards me, says ""I wish you didn't lie lol"" and then proceeds to say it's nothing and doesn't want to tell me, tells me the next day "" i found out you lied about getting my gifts"" when her mom said not to mention her helping me out.

Then from there we had another argument on Thursday the 2nd September, because I told my bestfriend about a guy I don't like(which I work with), that sexually assaulted my girlfriend a few months back, but she wants me to do nothing about it.

This upset her because it wasn't my place to say which I totally get.

Then things were ""ok"" till yesterday which was my 20th birthday and it was a great day until about 11/12 in the evening when we were all really drunk, it was myself my girlfriend,  my best mate and my girlfriends best mate. My girlfriends dress kept lifting when she was dancing and her underwear would show. My mate mentioned it to me and her mate said to say something to her, so I did and she said she can't help it it's a dress, then 30 mins later WAP came on and she wanted to do the dance in a dress and I said absolutely fucking not and it kicked off from there.

She was crying and swearing at me saying I shouldn't tell her what to do and it's just a bit of fun and it's unfair etc etc we had a full blown argument at 2am about this shit.

Today has been ""ok"" but now she doesn't want to go out tomorrow night which is my actual birthday party or on Thursday to a house party we've been invited to, because she doesn't want a repeat of last night.

There isn't a week that we don't argue and things are constantly up and down.

We also live together with her parents now, she had a sugar daddy when we met, cut him off a little bit after we started dating, had a relationship with a 54 year old man which happened to be my last boss and she regularly sees him because they are still good friends.

I really love this girl but it's gone to absolute shit and I don't know if things are going to turn around because every time I think things will get better they do and then they go to shir again.

I want to stay with her I really do.

If we are all genuine about this we all know it’s true.

Now this isn’t to say that personality and all that other shit isn’t important. You of course can’t keep a girlfriend with just a pretty face, but you can’t even get a girlfriend without said pretty face.

Good looking assholes get laid, find short term girlfriends, get dates, get the interest of multiple women at a time easily.

Ugly guy with a heart of gold? Despite being objectively better to be around and more than likely a better partner, he will struggle so much to get a single date.

Now I’m not claiming to be said ugly guy with a heart of gold, but I’m not terrible. I’m unfortunately the “I love you, you’re just like a brother to me guy” and “I wish I could find a boyfriend like you” and even worse “You are going to make some girl super happy one day, when you find one that’ll overlook your appearance”. Girls love me as a person, they just find me unattractive.

Fucking sucks man. It’s heartbreaking. I do my best with the shitshow I was given. I try to dress well, I groom and maintain myself obsessively, I workout until I’m nauseous 4 times a week. Trust me it helps, I feel a lot more confident and I’ve met a lot of people after I started going to the gym and trying to make myself look as best as possible, but like after now 3 years and still trying with girls I have no luck. 

If I was a guy that was good looking and an asshole I would still at least get laid which is miles beyond anything I’ve done. Like in 21 and I haven’t even gone on a single date which is kinda pathetic.

So can we just stop.

I get it. It’s nice to hear that me being ugly isn’t the cause of my failures with women, but in most of my cases at least it has been. It’s just not realistic to tell a person, “Your looks aren’t holding you back at all, it’s your personality” because (even if their personality does need serious working on, which admittedly we all can work on improving ourselves on the inside) it’s mostly his appearance.

P.S. I know a lot of people are going to jump to tell me that I’m desperate or that I hate women or some other BS to explain why I’m single, I’m not. This is also a problem I have with this sub, if a guy is frustrated he’s automatically whiny, low self esteem and a misogynist.

When he broke up with me a month ago, I was absolutely devastated and shellshocked. I was quick to blame him for everything that had transpired over the course of our time together, needing to find the worst parts of him to justify how he could make such a harsh decision when I loved him so dearly.

(I am not interested in pursuing anyone new atm).

But, after some self-reflection, I have begun to notice there was a lot of truth to his words when he pointed to the toxic patterns I exhibited during our relationship that I wasn't even aware of. I have an anxious attachment style, and ADHD, so I often overthink/spiral like it's an olympic sport. I allowed myself to hyper focus on my own insecurities and I would project them onto him in the form of rigid expectations, discounting his own boundaries and perspectives on things. I was so consumed by the fear that he wasn't taking me seriously (according to my own checklist of specific gestures that would prove to me he wanted to be with me) then would react poorly when he didn't adhere to every one of my expectation. Naturally, this placed a ton of pressure on him to go beyond his own boundaries to soothe my anxieties and would tire him out with the constant need for reassurance. I know partners should be supportive, but I placed too much responsibility on him being my source of happiness, instead of being happy myself exempt from placing that burden on him. He had his own fair reasons for doing things, and I should've respected that more. I should've had as much faith in his good intentions as he did for mine....

With all this being said, many may think I am being foolish to think it would be a good idea to try again, or that this relationship has been too damaged to reassess things

However- I have a strong belief that I know what I need to work and that I can be the improved, wholly happy human being/partner that he deserves and that I always intended to be for him. There's so much left we can do, I know we can be happier than ever. **He said that if I took the time to focus on myself and my own happiness and worked on my problems (he'd do the same), that he'd be more than open to consider getting back together.** I don't want to put a timeline on things, but I want to reach out when I feel ready.

I actually thought he was kind of cute and interesting enough to get to know more but for some reason I didn’t ask for his info before they left! So my question here is: is it okay if I ask the first guy for his friend’s IG or number? I didn’t outright reject the guy and do feel bad for ignoring his pickup line, but it seems like it shouldn’t be a big deal since it was such a casual interaction and there was never a pretense of dating like there would be if I had met him through an online dating app. Curious to hear opinions on this!

I am hoping to get an objective, outsider perspective on my current situation.

I (M23) work with a part time colleague (F24). She is exactly my type, emotionally and physically. Anyway, a few weeks ago she was aligned to my team for two days. During the day, everyone was saying that we should both go out, which we both laughed off. During the day I asked for her employee number for a document, to which she gave light flirting, ""My employee number or my actual number"". I took her home the second evening and asked for her number. She gave me the task of finding her on social media, again with light teasing. I did find her and we did start speaking.

Her replies where slow, I mean really slow. Eventually I got her number. For three weeks, she went on holiday to a different part of the country. I got bored of the long delays and decided to just delete her of Snapchat, but did retain her number.

After 4 weeks of not speaking, she text me out of the blue. She asked for some security codes for the building. I thought this was pretty random as she has worked there three year. I asked her if she wanted to get a catch up drink, but stated she was in work the following day or she would have. The next day, I asked her if she was available early week. She stated Monday. I asked her if she wanted to get a meal to which she stated she would like to.

Yesterday, we went for the meal and the conversation was great. Two and a half hours in the restaurant. We spoke about past experiences with dating (to which she has had no good ones!). She told me the reason for being delayed was because a co-worker told her not to give everything away too fast (SO I ASSUME SHE HAS TOLD THIS CO-WORKER SHE LIKES ME?) I took her home and she was in no rush to get out of my car. I asked her if we would go on a other date, to which she teased ""if you are lucky"". We texted a little later night. This morning she thanked me again for the meal. I told her she was welcome and we can do it again if she likes. This was almost 10 hours ago, and I have had no reply.

Small overview of my situation: I went abroad to study this semester, I arrived less than a week ago. Once there, I met a student on the bus that goes to the same school as me and who comes from the same city in my home country. The feeling goes well, we spend the 2 hours of the bus together to discuss, very good feeling  

The next two days, we eat together, we visit the campus, we walk, we visit the city. Once again the feeling is going very well, a bond is created little by little, laughs, eyes contacts, I gradually install physical contacts. She responds quickly to messages, reminds me of herself, sends photos on private jokes, suggests and accepts that we see each other, etc.  In short, I really appreciate this girl, even more for her personality than for her physique.  

So it's been a few days that I know her, we start to approach more personal themes, our families etc but I have the impression of having lost foot. I went to a party last night, where I had too much drink, and I sent her some voice messages, like ""tomorrow noon we can eat together that would make me pleased"", she tells me that she will keep me updated the next day etc and I ended up with the worst, a drunken voice message saying something like ""good night kisses sweet dreams"" I was wasted.

Today, no news for lunch, nothing, I just send her a message at the end of the afternoon to tell her that I was ambushed again in a party that starts very early, she answers me that she too started early today (when she was supposed to start her classes ??), then I tell her that the plan for the locals I'm having a night out with is to take me to a bar because ""I'm going to get all the girls there "", which is true, that's really their plan haha. Trying to make her jealous, probably a mistake, and she just replied 2 laughing emojis

He treats me like a princess and is really respectful towards me and my family. We even sing together to my spotify playlists on daytrips when it's just the two of us. I think I may have found the love of my life. We have known each other for about 6 months now and I still feel this way. I think he feels the same way, but I am not sure because we have not talked about dating each other. Also, the thing I think that is keeping us from being in a relationship is that we have different faiths. He is a devout Catholic and I am a devout Baptist (these two faiths don't mix very well lol). We did swap books about our faiths and talk about it a lot. We are keeping open minds to talking about our beliefs together. He keeps bringing the topic up. I think it's because we both know that we have to agree on this before we can have a relationship and we really care about our beliefs. He stated that he wished he were raised as a Christian, and he won't stop asking me about my beliefs. Someone help me figure this out plz. I know I should really just talk to him about this, but I'm sacred to do so.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,994390,public,self,I need advice on my relationship with my crush.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pju021/i_need_advice_on_my_relationship_with_my_crush/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

I recently started seeing a guy again (an old flame of 5 years ago) for about a month now. We’ve been intimate in the past, I’ve met his family,  and I’m always comfortable when I’m around him — plus, we have a good time on our dates (which are sometimes an all day thing). 
I have a family friend’s wedding coming up in a couple weeks, and I’m thinking of inviting him as my plus one. I’ll have a few family members attending this wedding as well, so he would be meeting them for the first time. Other than that, I really won’t know too many people there, so I’m thinking that may be less pressure on him.

Do you think it’s too soon to ask him to go to this wedding with me? I really enjoy his company and think we’d have a good time, but I don’t want to potentially scare him off since we haven’t really defined what we are yet.

I am a virgin, and prior to this year I had never kissed or dated anybody or even tried to. I have lived a rather unconventional life, I grew up poor and was relentlessly bullied at school for aspergers etc so I dropped out and proceeded to teach myself via homeschooling for 5 years. I did well enough at it that I received a scholarship for college. I commuted from home for college and then law school, I finished top of my class from an economics degree and then a law degree so I never had much of a social life at uni, but I was friendly with people and occassionally still chat online to a few people I went there with. After problems in interviews I was eventually able to secure my dream job, and have since moved out to a new city with my own apartment, and I now make considerably more money than my parents ever have combined. Currently I'm applying for scholarships to go to Harvard or Yale for a masters and I've been told that I'm a very realistic chance at getting one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the year, just after moving out I started tinder and bumble hoping to get over the virgin issue and try to start leading a normal life with sexual relationships etc but never really got anywhere and deleted them. Over the course of this year I made friends with some people from work and had better pictures naturally taken etc. One night about 3 months ago, at the behest of a drunk girl friend of mine from work I started back up on the apps: first bumble and then tinder and hinge. As before, I never really went anywhere on bumble or tinder, but for whatever reason, I get quite a few matches on hinge. Over the last 2ish months I have gone on 7 dates with 4 different girls from hinge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first girl was 26F1 - she was a very cute and lovely person. We went out on a coffee date for 45 minutes and instantly clicked. Subsequently we went out on two dinner dates and a date playing mini-golf. After the fourth date (second dinner date), she drove me home and then initiated a french kiss. I interpret this as a sign that she's expecting me to escalate things so I invite her inside. She responds by saying that she's not quite ready for that and has an early day at work the next day and then we organize another date after another kiss. She texts me a few days later with the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Hey NAME! Hope you had a good weekend, I'm so sorry I've been absent, I've been trying to sort out my own head... I'm sure you could probably tell on Thursday that I was a bit nervous and uncomfortable, and I've been a bit stressed ever since. I think if I'm being honest, I'm not ready to date anyone yet, having come out of a long term relationship recently. That is a cop out and really unfair on you, but I don't know hwhat else to say. I think I need a bit more time, and maybe a break from the dating scene for a little while. I really am so sorry and I hope you understand...

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards I go on three more dates:

&amp;#x200B;

25F - she was very attractive but had clear and visible quite severe mental health issues, kept talking about mutiliated corpses and things of that nature

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

23F - pretty clearly not a good fit from the start I would say

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

26F2 - I went out on a date with 26F2 on Sunday for coffee. I quite liked her, she was stunningly attractive and we seemed to have a good conversation for about 40 minutes before the cafe kicked us out because they had a lunch reservation. She then invites me to go on a walk where proceed to chat for about 20 minutes. At the end she initiates a hug with me and tells me to message her. I do later that afternoon and she responds earlier today with the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Hey. Nice to meet you too, to be honest though didn't quite vibe. Best of luck with the hinge endeavours though!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What that means exactly I'm not sure. I am thinking two possibilities. Either a) she decided that she could do better because of how attractive she was relative to me. I'm not sure if that's the answer despite the obvious logic of it as I am not sure why you would invite someone for another 20 minute walk after the date if that were the case. b) the other possibility is that she detected that I was autistic and was put of by that, but equally I think that would've been apparent from the start, and as I said, I thought things went quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In my predicament, being a 25 year old autistic virgin, I am of the view that I need to rectify this as soon as possible, and realistically by the end of the year, else I'm not ever going to get anywhere. I'm not sure how to make it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also engineered another date, I think, I don't know. The thing is that I worked on a group project for a couple of months at uni with another guy and a couple of girls, including 24F. I have not spoken with 24F since, it's been 2.5 years, and didn't have a lot to do with her during it tbh. However, I saw her profile pop up on hinge, screenshotted it and sent it to her remarking that it's a small world. We chatted for a bit and after my situation with 26F2 above fizzled out I invited her out and we're going out for lunch in a few days to catch up. What to make of that I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, I am looking for advice as to how I can lose my virginity and settle into a relationship before it becomes even more of a liability than it already is.

For example, exercising and eating healthy. Or going to yoga. Or shopping. Or watching movies. Your lifestyle is your daily routine and what you do or don't enjoy doing.

I was recently trying to explain this concept to a woman by saying, ""I want to date someone who has a similar lifestyle to me. I want to date a woman who enjoys being physically active, since I exercise 1 hour daily and that's important to me.""

I was told this was a superficial thing to want. This person then said they needed someone to be white to match their lifestyle, as they lived a lifestyle that only whiteness could allow someone to participate in. They used examples of going to the Kentucky Derby, yacht clubs, and balls. I explained anyone could do those things with her, but she said no they couldn't, as she wouldn't enjoy it with a nonwhite person so they therefore cannot be a part of her lifestyle. She thought this was a truer meaning of the word ""lifestyle"" than say trying to find someone who just enjoys your hobbies, because it went even deeper for her. To her you are either born into the ""white lifestyle"" or you are not and there is nothing deeper.

She said that being white was her lifestyle, and thus only another white person could experience it with her. She also said her social status derives from her whiteness and she needs someone on her status level.

I have seen online dating data suggesting that most women prefer white men. I always assumed it was just a skin deep preference. Ie. Many women prefer the color of white skin. Like wanting a brown dog or a black dog.

I never thought of it as something as deep as this. I didn't know people thought of whiteness as being an entire lifestyle that only other whites can experience. Or a fundamental part of their social status.

Given how strongly though I see many women have ""whites only"" dating policies, I wonder if this is a common thing among women. 

I have never frankly understood the concept of a ""whites only"" dating policy, since I've found women of all races attractive and I think anyone can live my lifestyle. But if this is how many women feel about it, it would help to explain why it is so important to them.

I consider myself an open-minded person. I'm someone who favors free and open debate. Even to the KKK, I would say let them speak because I think free speech is important. I also believe in total freedom of as much choice in life as possible.

I am just interested to understand this concept since I had never encountered it before. Is this a normal thought pattern among women?

This is a very unique situation. I have a boyfriend that I have been dating for over a year and because it has been COVID, we have seen eachother only once a couple of months ago. He lives in the US and I live in Canada. We have been dating for a year and he is the healthiest partner I’ve ever had. We have built a strong foundation with the help of my therapist who has been so helpful throughout encouraging me to continue to date him because he is a healing partner and I have learned so much. He is kind, respectful, reassuring and so calm and gentle. I was very attracted to him via FaceTime. I have a lot of childhood trauma that you should be mindful of and he has been excellent and very secure the whole way.

When I met him a couple of months ago, I had a lot of anxiety particularly because it wasn’t the intense chemistry I had via FaceTime. He wasn’t as physically attractive in person as I had seen in FaceTime and I was so caught off guard. I spent the entire weekend with intense anxiety because of the disconnect and then also the  difference between what I expected and what I saw. Nothing has changed based on his demeanour but I just wasn’t as physically attracted.

He is coming to tomorrow to see me and I am so nervous and anxious about it. I really want it to work because this is the healthiest partner I’ve ever had but the thought that the feelings are going to recur is scaring the crap out of me. I am 33 and ready to get married but this intense care about physical attraction is leaning me the other direction.

Both girls, and particularly the one of this year, were quite good-looking, and the latest one is also someone who is absolutely world-class in her job: that is to say, l believe that to some extent, if those girls liked me, I can't be that bad.

- Once l've met someone, what kind of first date should I go for (coffee, drinks, dinner? Κeep in mind that as any student I don't have lots of money...), and how do I generate that necessary ""closeness""?

I ended a friendship with my only male best friend because he had feelings for me and wouldn’t respect that I didn’t for him. My current boyfriend has close female friends, and I want to understand that this is okay, but I don’t know how to begin. I do already attend therapy, and this has still been a struggling topic.

The TLDR is all you really need to understand the situation. Infidelity subreddits have always been helpful and provided a lot of support and comfort whenever I've posted about dealing with partners cheating, but the one thing I never liked was the overall adamant belief from them that men and women can't be friends. I love my current boyfriend a lot, but recognize that if I want to be with him, I need to accept his close friendships with women. I know that I can always just choose to leave, but I also know realistically that most people have opposite gender friendships. I'd have to deal with it no matter what relationship I enter into.

Don't get me wrong, I can understand where this feeling is coming from. It's becoming harder for me to resist that belief myself because I don't even have a successful friendship with a guy to point to. My closest/best male friend secretly harbored feelings for me, and wouldn't respect that I just wanted to be friends. We're no longer friends. I'm also referring to close friendships specifically, one where you can call a guy your best friend and have no romantic feelings, not just simply having male acquaintances.

I really do want to change, but I keep running into mental obstacles because I don't have a clue where to start. I don't know how to begin thinking differently.

Over the summer I decided I would finally grow  some balls and ask her out. So, before classes started back up and I  knew she was back in town, I told her that I wanted to take her out on a  date. She replied with, “That’s sweet but I’m actually not looking for a   relationship right now.” I told her I totally understand given that  this is our last year in college. Maybe this is important, or not, but  she was in a serious relationship about two years ago.

I  can’t help but feel like I gave up too quickly and that I should tell  her how I really feel. I wasn’t particularly looking for a relationship  either but she’s smart, beautiful and has a contagious  personality, and  I enjoy being around her. I’m also aware that the whole “I’m not  looking for a  relationship right now” excuse can also just be a nice  way of saying “you’re not the right guy.” But I’m being hopeful here I  guess.

This kind of response is  all too familiar for me, but I never pursued any girl further after  that. I’m really infatuated with this girl and I’m tired of getting  nowhere in starting relationships, but I also don’t  want to force her  into it. Any advice would help.

On a totally unrelated subject, we were Googling something on their computer and I noticed my Reddit username in the list of recent searches - they were in control of their computer and they clicked on the box to expose the searches.

I asked what this was and they said, “oh yeah, I figured out your username.” 

“And you have clearly been searching for my posts, right?”

They admitted they had.

I asked them how they got my username and they did not want to tell me.  🤔 I asked them how long they had been looking at my posts and they said for over a year.

I asked them why and they said they wanted to see what I posted and if I was telling them everything.  I asked if they felt I had lied, omitted anything.  They said I had not.

I feel incredibly violated by this.

Their response is that Reddit is public, everything you post can be attributed to you personally, it is not meant to be an anonymous forum (I disagree.  I feel that it is different from a FB or Instagram profile, which usually does have identifying information, pictures) and that finding someone’s true identity is easy.  

I disagree and feel I am being gaslighted.  

They say “I’m sorry that you were hurt by this,” which feels like a bullshit apology.

A little backstory, I've been spending the past few years really trying to figure out what I want in a partner and I've shifted towards looking for a life partner rather than just a good time. I have anxious attachment and certain personalities can bring that out but Ive been trying to really work on that (and have made some decent progress).    


So when I met this girl that checked almost all of my boxes I was really excited. Our chemistry is borderline magical, I haven't felt this way from someone in what feels like at least 5 years.  However, she seems to take things much slower than I'm used to. I usually go for (and get) a first kiss on the first or second date. We have yet to kiss and that's honestly okay, but maybe not helping my current situation. During the first date I told her ""I'd love to kiss you right now"" and she shook her head 'no'. During the second date, I went in for the kiss after dinner and she pulled back saying ""we can't"". I asked if it's because she wants to go slowly and she said it was but didn't provide any more information (so I'm a little unsure). At the end of the second date last Monday (aug30) , I asked if she was free on Friday (sept3) and she said she had plans with her sister. So I told her she could schedule the next (third) date. She said okay, and I dropped her off at home. She was pretty warm and enthusiastic over text for a few days after that, but never brought up the date. After about three days I asked her along the lines of ""so when are you going to ask me out on a date?"" and she responded by teasing me with ""you really are impatient aren't you? ;)"".    


We had the long weekend just pass and she had plans for all of it, so she was pretty busy and wasn't as responsive as usual. Not the end of the world, but it did trigger my anxiety quite a lot. Her response time since I asked about the date has slowed down a lot but her texts are still very enthusiastic and it doesn't really seem like anything is wrong objectively. But subjectively I am honestly freaking out a little bit.  I was trying to just chalk it up to her being busy and hoped things would be normal again after the long weekend. But they have kind of stayed the same.   

I know she felt the same way I did about the dates being great (she commented on our chemistry and how her face hurt from smiling so much, and sent me a picture of the rose I gave her in a vase after the date).     


But I'm at a point where I'm very confused. I've dropped a few hints for things she could suggest for our next date subtly (""oh I also haven't been to that place before!""). I've considered being honest about how I'm feeling and have crafted a message to send to her about it. Essentially it boils down to ""I'd love to call to chat if you can find the time. But here's how I'm feeling..."". I can share the specific message in a comment if wanted. But I also don't want to come across as needy this early into things, so I'm hesitant to lay it on the line. I'm trying to remind myself that it's only been 8 days since our last date.. But that in combination with her decreasing how much we're talking has me freaked out. Enough to come here and ask for advice lol.   

I can't tell if she is just taking things slower than I am used to, or if she is losing interest and trying to break things off slowly without any confrontation. Does anyone have any insight or advice into what I might do to help myself out of this situation?

So, last year while working at Asda, I met a girl who I fell for hard pretty much instantly. I liked pretty much everything about her, but unfortunately I waited to long to ask her out and another one of our co workers beat me to it. This obviously really sucked but I accepted it,and  thought maybe in the future when I’m no longer working with them I could follow her on Instagram to see if they were still together and maybe go from there. I didn’t have a proper Instagram account at this point, just a blank one that I use to follow pages I like.

I ended up leaving the job in April and haven’t spoken to anyone there since then, at this point they were still together. I’ve set up an Instagram account since then but only have a few followers. More importantly, I’m pretty sure she knew I fancied her at the time, so I’m worried that following her now will just seem weird to her, especially if she’s still with her boyfriend. we never spoke outside work and I’ve not kept in touch with anyone there. I also kinda left the store on bad terms after getting fed up with management, so this might also make it a bit awkward to try and get back in touch with her.

This leads to intense overthinking and sometimes I even feel no attraction to other women during this period of the relationship, even physical. My replies (which are already fairly fast - I reply if I’m available) become much more frequent as I find myself unable to stop talking to the other person 

Sometimes it’s good at the beginning - it’s always great to get good signs back from someone you feel this way about and sometimes you get it back - but after a while it becomes very unattractive (as you could imagine), not even like I’m that different I just give off different vibes, usually become unable to criticise them and stuff like that

I also develop an inability to accept the truth by refusing to read signs, if she says a reason why she isn’t able to call I’ll always believe it, completely denying the possibility of her not wanting to talk to me even if it’s the 2nd time this has happened

I've always shied away from dating women I was really attracted to and have finally decided to really go for what I want, or at least try to.

This may sound shallow, but I'm a white guy that is primarily attracted to black women. Visually, I really like black women that embrace hip hop culture and style in terms of makeup, hair, jewelry. To really be specific, if a black girl is wearing big hoop earrings or those bamboo ones, fake eyelashes, long acrylic nails and weaves, there isn't much that can top that imo. This is not a preference that can be described as a phase, I've liked for as long as I can remember.

For everyone who is going to get mad: I find many black women attractive that do not share this ""style"" too. But can't deny that a black girl matching the description above will always be the most attractive girl anywhere in my opinion.

For everyone else who is going to point out that this description is only visual: I get that it seems shallow.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an elderly millennial and I like yoga, drama, travel and random and funny animal videos. I am educated, very attractive, do a good job in my career, and have enough views on things in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking for a relationship, but for someone I want to establish a relationship with. When you spend more time with others than when you are alone, a relationship becomes worthwhile when the number of two people exceeds the sum of the individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for someone I can meet, someone I can meet in the future. But I am not in a hurry, I know that great things take time to develop. I always think that there are too many mediocre things in life, and love and relationships should not be one of them. I want to find a great love of mine. A person for whom I would be crazy, just as he would be crazy for me. I can talk about anyone in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

You: male. unmarried. There is no romantic relationship of any kind with others. You are over 35 years old. You have a career that you love and enjoy. You have the best intentions, you are funny, kind, and you are affectionate. You can come from anywhere, because after all this chaos, you have the ability to fly to me (and I have the ability to do so).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,994841,public,self,35 [F] Los Angeles-[Friendship] [Relationship] [Chat],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjzuzz/35_f_los_angelesfriendship_relationship_chat/,all_ads,6,,,,

I just need to get it off my chest in an organized way. I hope this is reasonable. I would greatly appreciate any advice or insight.

I'm a male (24 years) who lives in a major city. I've always seemed to struggle with dating. I'm heavily introverted, but have a good social life and several great friends I get together with regularly. I consider myself an average/decently attractive guy. I think I'm pleasant to be around for the most part. I do social activites (bars/events/etc.) and try to expand my social circle as much as possible, but there's only so many ""friends of friends"" out there.

In college I lived a normal college life. Partied and socialized a lot, it was a blast. I had a share of hookups, sex, etc. but not much more than that. I mention that to communicate I've had that exposure and I'm not some dude who doesn't understand what the dating world is actually like and hates women or something.

So now I'm an adult, doing the regular lifestyle, working a job, and falling into hopelessness. I'm almost at the point of giving up honestly. I don't ever seem to warrant interest from women when I'm out in public. I don't understand how to meet more women. I've exhausted my ""network of friends"" as mentioned. And again, women don't seem to make an effort to be approachable/initiate anything, and I know it's ""the male's responsibility"" to start that stuff.

I've tried dating apps for several years now, it's never worked for me. Barely any matches/interest, which absolutely destroys my confidence, so I always end up deleting them. My profile is fine according to my male &amp; female friends. What are my other options to meet women in reality? Cold approaching in public seems bad. I think women find it as off-putting and/or creepy, and factor in coronavirus making it unacceptable to interact with people you don't know, and masks and everything make it quite awkward. Am I supposed to just wait around and hope for a cute girl to end up right next to me in the produce aisle during my grocery store trip I make every 1-2 weeks, and make some dumb comment about the asparagus to initiate conversation? It just seems far-fetched and doesn't actually happen to people. What are the odds?

I know it's not right to desperately desire to be in a relationship, but I don't feel like it's like that for me. I think I would be fine to be single forever, and don't feel like I need a woman to ""complete me"" or anything like that. But is it wrong to desire companionship? I want to get married and have a family eventually too. That feat sounds impossible right now. Nights by myself all the time are making me lonely. I'd just like to actually have somewhat of a dating life. This whole thing brings me to tears sometimes. I don't know what to do. My dating life is nonexistent. I see a therapist to talk about my issues, but it's not like he's a dating coach.

So this was long, I'm sorry, but it felt good to write out like this. Thanks if you've read this far.
