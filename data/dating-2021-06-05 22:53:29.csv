1,ntcza4,1622951789,"Sometimes, We Have To Settle With Who We Are","For a really long time, most of my life in fact, I considered myself ugly.  As a black (or at least identified as black by others) person in a majority white/asian community, I didn't look like my peers, and in fact didn't quite look like the stereotypical ""black male"" either.  My skin is more of a tan than a brown.  I'm a few inches below the average height for a male in the U.S (although I swear to god they push the bar higher every year).  My voice, rather than being deep, is more high pitched.  I have an inability to grow full facial hair.  So, for a long time I hated everything about myself.  I hated that I wasn't ""manly"" enough, and that I didn't conform to my standards of beauty, or to anything at all.  I refused to listen to recordings of my voice, avoided taking pictures whenever possible, and avoided spilling the ever-present fact that I was a big fan of the cutesy side of things.  This ""masculine-performing"" attitude deeply affected my everyday life.  I hung out with people I honestly had nothing in common with, and I pursued relationships with ""normal"" people because in my eyes it was only proper to pursue the ""traditional"" types.  In doing this, I failed to see the obvious: I was not ugly, and despite what I consider in retrospect to be an awful personality, at face value, I was attractive.

For a very long time, I had gotten attention from women and girls.  As a child and even teenager, I was often doted on by older women, and girls my age more often gave me a warm reception than a cold one.  That isn't to say it was all good; A certain childhood incident damaged my self esteem a lot, but I definitely was not one of those ""girls run away when they see me"" kinds of people.  It's funny, but you never notice how people express interest in you when you're too busy trying to adhere to what you think who you ""should"" be attracted to.  When it comes down to it, I had always landed into the ""cute"" archetype.  My mannerisms were cute, my habits were cute, I was explicitly described as cute by girls and you know what?  It went completely over my head because I refused to accept it as a compliment.  There was no way I could be ""cute"".  I had to be ""hot"" or at the very least, ""manly"".  With the wrong perspective, you just fail to notice how other people see you.

I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'm a perfect 10, or even an 8.  Well maybe I am an 8, on a good day, under the right circumstances.  That's the thing: It matters.  If you're looking for a certain kind of person, odds are they're also looking for a certain kind of person.  That person might be you.  That person might not be you.  For me, I can tell you that the person looking for me was not the person I was looking for in the past.  It just didn't match up.  Me who was nontraditional in so many ways, trying to act like they were 5 inches taller, 50 pounds heavier, with a voice like James Earl Jones and who eats nails for breakfast.  Sometimes you both physically and emotionally cannot meet the standards of your chosen segment of people.  Trying to will just hurt you on a level that might be impossible to repair.  For many women, I will probably not be the person who has ""strong hands"" or is tall enough to make them ""feel secure"" (I've heard those are the big selling points).  I don't really consider my voice to be abhorrent anymore, but I definitely am not going to be making anybody tingly with some dulcet tones.  However, I also know that there are people who appreciate someone like me, who isn't some tallboi who looms over them, who can comfortably watch through a romance movie or a K-Drama without groaning or complaining.

Important Part:

I guess the advice I have to give is: Find your niche.  Find your physical and personal assets and flaunt them.  This doesn't mean you have to ""settle"", although you might have to adjust your standards a little.  Deeply consider if your actions in your daily life are actually compatible with your ideal partner, and that goes for men and women.  I'm not talking about ""brush your teeth, take showers"" either, and don't even start with ""I'm ugly"".  If you read romance novels/webtoons/mahnwa or watch the waifu/husbando-bait type of stuff modern anime is notorious for and find yourself saying ""damn I wish that character was real so I could lock them in my basement"", consider if any of those 2d characters would even be people you could get along with, if that kind of person would even like you.  If you heavily identify with a certain ethnic group, consider how you cultural and societal beliefs and norms match up against who you're interested in, because they're your audience, and you're selling yourself.  ""Suitable for you"" does not mean settling for something you despise, it means lining yourself up with whoever best matches you: your true self, not what you act like as a front.  This is going to be a harder battle for some people than others: Some might realize that they already are there, and for some people like me, they might need some tweaking, or a lot of tweaking.  I can't guarantee that for the legitimately unfortunate of visage that there's a desired ending at the top of this mountain, but there will at least be a journey of self discovery. Remember this: No one is born beautiful, inside or out.

2,ntd5mw,1622952405,A complete change in frequency of communication - what to think?,"So I \[28M\] was set up with an incredible person \[32F\]. We knew what we each looked like and both said that we were interested. Our schedules didn't allow for a date right away, but we were texting non-stop and the conversation was amazing. We were hitting it off super well and we both agreed it felt very natural. 

We had our first date 3 days ago. It went well, as in we really enjoyed talking to eachother in person and such. We went to dinner and an art event. The dinner was great, the art event was meh. But we cracked jokes and still had a nice time. Held hands, arm around her, it all felt very natural and fun. We talked about what we were both looking for and we each agreed that we're open to looking into a relationship, but slowly. 

It ended and I felt great about it. But since then, it's changed from texting/talking couple times every hour or so to... maybe a text a day? And they've all been the ""sorry! I haven't been looking at my phone, been with a friend"". 

I understand being busy - and I'm all about that. Neither of us are really 'phone' people, so I completely get that she's doing her own thing. 

But it just strikes me a little odd. I've never encountered this before. 

Am I reading into it too much? Should I just be more patient? I offered a second date and she wasn't available, but said that ""we can play it by ear"".

Last year in March I went on two dates with this cool guy (literally right before the pandemic made me go back to my state). The second date I stayed in his room for the night after our date. It was super fun and we got kinda intimate but no sex. 

In the morning I was so awkward and I acted weirdly bc I had never spent the night with a guy. Even though nothing serious happened. He was really nice and trying to show me stuff on his phone I guess to be nice and make me feel better? lol 

He drives me back to where I lived and I’m just an awkotaco. 

Anywho, I apologized over text and said he was a great guy. Then yeah. Just completely embarrassed myself bc of how i was distant. Ugh.

Month goes by... he’s always watching my stories so I swipe up on his a couple times. And I guess that bothered him(???) so he unadds me. I then retaliate by unfollowing him on Instagram. 

Forward to today now. I randomly thought about him and decided to request to follow him back. He watches my Instagram stories often for some reason even though he unadded me on Snapchat (?) an hour later I kid you not, he unfriends me and cancels my request to follow him. 

WTF. Is he a drama king or an i being sensitive? Also I want to say I do not think about him often and Idc too much but it kinda shifted my mood bc why tf would he do that when he’s been watching my stories ?!?!?!?

tldr: started dating someone who was 16 when i was 18, i turned 19 a few months later, we have a 2 year 7 month age gap. it was legal, the family loved me, all of our friends supported us fully. they were a junior and i had just graduated HS a month or two prior. also we’re no longer together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntduxl/is_16_dating_19_started_dating_at_1618_2_year_age/

12,nterdb,1622958359,Judging a person based on their height/race/face is superficial. Judging a person based on their weight is NOT superficial.,"I am so sick of people equating judging a person's quality from their height/race/face to judging them based on their weight. These are NOT equivalent things. Let's review the difference:

Height/race/face:

- Tell you nothing about a person's personality.
- Tell you nothing about a person's lifestyle or values.
- Are inborn traits no one chooses and don't reflect anything a person did in their life.
- Are absolutely the most SUPERFICIAL traits you can judge someone based on.

Weight:
- Is absolutely a reflection of a person's values, lifestyle, and general/future health.
- Tells you about their mental health, addictive capacity, and how much they care about fitness.
- Indicates risk for diabetes/hypertension/heart disease/joint problems/etc.
- Is a reflection of a person's choices every day.

As much as every obese person on Reddit wants to claim that they are only obese due to a ""medical problem,"" whenever I am in the grocery store, it is never hard to figure out why obese people are obese. 

My cart is full of things like chicken, sardines, broccoli, frozen veggies, salads, lentil soups, unsweetened almond milk, and sometimes a small treat. Their carts are full of pop, junk, and ice cream. I fast 16-20 hours a day and exercise every day. If I hang out with someone who is obese they usually can't go more than 4 hours without eating (and usually eating something poor in quality).

Dating someone who is overweight is a LIFESTYLE AND VALUE INCOMPATIBILITY for me. Rejecting someone based on their race/height/face is purely superficial.

But around this winter, we had a fight and made up again, like it was because he didn't do anything but play video games. Over time, I began to notice that he also began to smoke and drink alcohol again in the company, where he flew accidentally because of his best friend. Then I started noticing that I was the only one who tried to hang out with him, but every time he said something like ""we'll see"", ""I don't know"", or ""I can't predict the future"". But as a typical person, you could have just planned things out in advance and not announced them at the last moment; and we corresponded more often only because I always sent him some posts or asked him something. After that, I had to move away a little because of many family problems, and his messages like ""I'm here"" at that time did not help in any way. Still, later I decided to talk to him about the fact that I can no longer stand all this, about his parties, about his empty promises every time, about his laziness that he does not recognize. I don't know what to do. After this serious conversation in real life (the rest were on the Internet), as always, he promised something, but I don't believe him anymore. I don't know what to do, as if everyone who also loves anime and plays games becomes closer to him than I, who spends more time on development, YouTube and music.

after that, every time we hang out he tries to invite himself to my house and i’ve declined. but today i wanted him to play this game with me we both like so when he asked to come over i said yes. i did let him know that he wouldnt be staying this time. he said “we should see where the night goes” and i told him im certain that im not ready for sex. 

then he asked me for my reasoning, and i told him that sex too soon can cloud judgment and i want to make sure that im making the best choice possible when deciding who to be vulnerable with. also since i struggle with my body image i really need to feel comfortable with the person i decide to get naked with. for me, two weeks of hanging out just isnt enough time to really get to know someone.  he kept insisting that i just “wait to see how i feel in the moment” but i’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times before by guys who had tried to forcibly coerce me into sex. its not his fault those guys were shitty but i’ve learned to be very firm in my boundaries since then. 

then he asked me why i consider him a poor choice, and accused me of not trusting him. he got angry and said changed his mind about coming over. he then said he trusted and liked me, but not anymore since i obviously dont feel the same. i didnt say that at all (i wish i could upload pics of our convo) and i apologized for not expressing myself correctly but he said im stringing him along and its unfair. when i didnt reply to that, he accused me of not even liking him enough to respond back. 

i honestly was in shock at the sudden change in his behavior and i didnt want to argue with him. i told him that but he said it doesnt matter because he doesnt like me anymore, for now.  he said he’d have to see how he felt. i asked him to sleep on his decision and he said “im good, if you’re not thats on you. ttyl”. i didnt respond to that either. 

i think he’s just another guy trying to use me for sex, and im so turned off by the immaturity he demonstrated in this conversation and the fact that me saying we wont be having sex causes him to not want to hang out with me and makes him not like me. however, i dont want to he too harsh so im asking for yalls help. what should i do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntezh2/should_i_cut_him_off_i_told_him_i_wanted_to_wait/

I'm a decent and respectful man, I have good manners as much as the next person, and I can hold a conversation and have a laugh with someone, but I'm never the one to initiate these conversations, and it's mainly due to feeling unworthy of friendship/social interaction due to my past experiences with people. 

I can't help but feel I'm unworthy of entering into the dating world because I have no social circle and I enjoy my solitude.

However, especially in the last year, we have been keeping in touch a lot more, over texts/calls. Given the distance and that we won't be able to close it in the next 3 years at least, I don't expect anything to happen but really like her nonetheless. But a part of me has hoped that there could be something in the future, if we happen to live closer to each other. I've done a few gestures (e.g. sending her just because flowers) and she seemed to like it a lot.

However, in the past 1-2 months or so, she has gotten a lot more distant.

22,ntfbri,1622960578,Got rejected for the first time and it was a bit awkward,"Hey,

Going to keep it short here and just share what happened to me yesterday.

There's this girl I'd been wanting to date and I finally had a moment alone with her after class so I directly told her that I wanted to go out with her. I was really hopeful as I really thought she had something for me, but then she looked sideways, repeated what I said and started explaining herself how busy she was and that she won't be able to, then our friend came in a great mood and asked her what she wouldn't be able to do, then it became really awkward for a moment as we looked at each other and no one said anything except for our friend who noticed she was in the middle of something and backed away.

Then the girl just said to me we'll figure it out and I was like yeah okay, bye and we split ways.  

Never been rejected before, at least not like that, as the girls I've asked out before have always agreed to meet. Honestly, I feel as I've taken a shot and it hurts.

If anyone would like to share some similar experiences or an advice, please feel free, I'd love to hear your stories!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntfbri/got_rejected_for_the_first_time_and_it_was_a_bit/

24,ntfgyf,1622961173,Issue dating as a short male in today’s generation,"I’ll try to keep this simple but detailed enough so you understand my background and experience on dating as a short Asian male in America. I include race because I think it’s relative and does play a big role in today’s dating world. 

Disclaimer: I am not racist and nor do I discriminate any groups of people on this thread. I’m just speaking from what I have experienced so those can properly understand. 

I have not tried dating in other countries so my perspective is very limited. However, as most countries are adopting western culture I would assume it’s going to be the same.

So I’m a single 24 year old, 5’2” male currently living in New York City. Growing up I’ve always been attracted to non-Asian women. Not sure why, (maybe because of movies and televisions growing up watching) but I never really found them attractive. Just recently, I’ve been looking for an Asian female partner.

No, before you ask I am not a virgin and I have been in 3 different relationships (long and short term). I have dated a Russian girl, Latina girl and Jamaican girl (all who are shorter than me or about the same height).

Now before you say, “oh but you’ve been able to get into relationships and date them even though you are short” ... it’s still hard to search. It’s hard to find a girl now a days that is shorter than 5’2”. When I do find a single short girl, she is either looking for men who are 6’1” or a non-Asian partner. Again I’m not racist, and I’m open to dating any race as long as you are a genuine person and vibe with my personality. I’m also not looking for anything too serious either but I’m also not the type to just hookup all the time either. I date with some intention that we may be in a relationship or at the very least be friends.

Lately, I’ve been trying to date Asian women. But, all of them want to date a tall American white guy. It’s understandable, I wanted to date a white girl or Latina growing up as a teenager. Not sure if this is just some weird sexual fetish racial thing but now it’s been more common than ever. Asian women are short and they fit most Asian guys’ criteria when it comes to the dating world. But times are changing and from my experience most Asian women don’t even want to date an Asian man (do correct me if I’m wrong about this).

I’m sure this is all part of the journey to looking for the right person. But I don’t think most guys taller than 5’2” can say or even understand and comprehend the amount of effort, rejection and degrading experiences they have to endure from other taller alpha men and women who just don’t see us as a potential partner. And I get it, women have the right to choose the type of guy they want to date and to each their own.

It’s just so difficult and frustrating because height is something I cannot change. It’s not like weight where I can go the gym do cardio on the treadmill and cut back with a strict diet for a couple months and see progress. I will always be 5’2” and nothing can ever change that (except for leg extension surgery). Other men’s height taller than 5’2” don’t understand how good they have it. It’s taken for granted and us short guys have to suffer and the world just doesn’t care about us. It will never change and I’m not really sure what to do.

FYI: I do go to the gym and workout. I’m pretty fit, my stomach could use some cutback but I’m currently about 130 lbs and 15% body fat. I’m not overweight but I am working on getting a tone down on my ads and core.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntfgyf/issue_dating_as_a_short_male_in_todays_generation/
25,ntfl9u,1622961692,Is having no personality a personality?,"It was brought to my attention that dating does not depend on financial status, manners, or core values, but it depends on your personality. So I decided to ask for a good advice to y'all. I'm feel conflicted about what defines your personality. If it is true that I do not have personality, wouldn't that be considered as my own? So trying to have personality by imitating someone else would mean that you're willing to lose your own in order to please your significant other. So here is another question, if the person i am dating does not like my personality, does that mean i need to change myself into someone I'm not.

34,ntgo4j,1622966356,Second date didn't happen after a great first date. How do I,"So, I [26M] met her [26F] through tinder. I am a resident physician, she is an ICU nurse at the same hospital. Small talk, blabla, first date got arranged, which was no as easy to do with our schedules + her having two exams coming up soon (she recently switched to ICU). 

It was great. Just five hours of talking, getting to know each other a bit. At first we walked around the city, then at about 8pm she suggested we grab something to eat and go to her place. Still just great conversations, some alcohol gets involved. A around 11pm I need to go home, go for the kiss, again A+. Then at the door we kiss again.

The day after we text and basically start planning the second date already. But, she has her exams coming up and being an ICU nurse in and of itself is quite busy these days so I put the ball in her court (you know where this is going now). We still text a bit every now and then like once every 3 days, but slowly you can feel it becoming less easy to get a hold of her.

Then, two weeks after the date, I sent a text asking when she would be free for the date. The text she sends back: 'Hey! I think i dont want to meet up again, sorry. I'm not feeling so well lately and i just dont feel like dating right now.'

Oof ouch owie. So that's two months ago, haven't talked since. But I cant shake the feeling that this isn't a completely done deal. I mean, it might be that she simply changed her mind about me after a great first date, but she *is* an ICU nurse in the midst of covid and might just have it rough.

So I really need to know which of those it is, since it doesnt feel like a closed chapter to me. Two months later its still messing with me. Saw her walking around from a distance yesterday and *fuck*.

How would you go about this? Simply texting her how she's doing  seems a bit needy like 'hey I still want a date'. I don't really run in to her at work, my patients dont go to the ICU a lot. Havent seen her during work, but I feel like walking in to each other at work might be the best way to reconnect.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntgo4j/second_date_didnt_happen_after_a_great_first_date/
35,nth2dy,1622968031,Missing is Part of Moving On,"When you share your life, your story, your vulnerabilities, and the entirety of your world with somebody, a part of them becomes a part of you—something that will stay long after they're gone.

When you revisit the place you first met, or pass by the street you used to cross together, your heart skips a beat; frantically beating with the rare possibility that you might accidentally come across them the same way you did before.

Hearing and speaking their name, and the simple thought of what they looked like and how they used to smile and laugh around you: those random images and sounds that play endlessly in your head; these are the things that make you long for them, for the ""us"" that would've stayed the same if things didn't happen the way it did.

Perhaps, these are the things that make it hard to move forward with someone else, without them. The past was a beautiful place to live in, but all you are now is a visitor, a stranger in the world you used to own, a mere remnant of the past.

The thing is she's adamant on marrying someone of her own denomination due to family pressure. I'm a little more relaxed on that part. 

I've been in a fair amount of relationships so I know indicators when a woman is interested in me. And she gives those signals. Personally I don't think she realizes she is cause her lack of experiences with relationships or the opposite sex for that matter.

This might come off as unconventional or just plainly stupid, but anyway. Disclaimer: This is not an ad, fishing for relationship. Don't skim over few words and judge it to be so.

I am (guy) 20. I'm very emotional (emphasis on very, very much). I feel lonely these days in lockdown. I might come off as needy because sometimes I am. I am pretty cheerful on my happy days. I am very thoughtful, sometimes narrow-minded until I learn or hear things from the other perspectives. I am pretty modest (mostly). My problems include - I'm very clingy. I love showing my love outwardly to others in every way possible. I 'need' to help others it makes me happy. I overthink a lot (emphasis on lot) . I also suffer from terrible anxiety and panic attacks. I need affirmative positive words at least few times a day to make my day good. I don't like being ghosted. I have self-esteem and self worth issues (have therapy so working slowly on all the problems). I need attention from people whom I love. By the end of this whole phase I'd love to overcome all my mental illnesses. The ideal self that I'd like to become would be - Decently confident, happy, optimistic, polite, modest, kind and loving being.

My professional life -

I am a business major, currently going through my last year of bachelor's and then I'll pursue masters as well. I'm into video editing, and would love to make a profession out of it. But its work from home-esque work. So I'm open to taking the role of home-buddy with a bit of help.

59,ntktgd,1622983051,Can i solve this on my own or should i seek professional help?,"After trying all kinds of stuff i have come to the realisation that i probably face bigger hurdles than most when it comes to dating, flirting and similar.

30 years old guy, kissed two girls, never had sex, been kinda close when i was too drunk to understand any better. Never had a girlfriend. Your average foreveraloneguy.

I wouldn't say i am ugly, but not attractive either. But i haven't had any luck on tinder. 6'1, athletic, often heard i got a nice body. Tons of friends, male and female. Nice education. I shouldn't have a problem with dating i guess.

Some how i do have a huge problem with girls, i had lots of situations where i think girls have been hitting on me. Girls that come up grinding me on the dance floor, randoms that started talking in the bar, female aquintances that have been really physical at times, even had a random girl on a train look at me a lot and then started toeflirting (dragging her feet up my leg). But i freeze up when this happens, i get some sort of anxiety and find any way i can to escape the situation.

I have no idea why my body and mind react like this and i finally was brave enough to talk to a psychologist these last 6 months to try solve it. I got some tools on how to try be more ""calm"" in situations where i freeze up or get that anxiety. And how to work on my self image, lots of self-hatred connected to my inexperience. Feeling ugly, pathetic, no sexual value, pretty much feel like a joke when it comes to dating and flirting.

So i am just throwing this out here, do you think it is solvable on my own? Or should i look for another professional to talk to? I reached out to some friends to try get advice, but it's a topic i rather not talk about as i feel shameful about it. I am also kind of clueless on what my steps would be if i try this on my own.

64,ntlf51,1622985029,"He confessed he liked me a lot but I was unsure, then I caught feelings and he's now saying it was never serious and he didn't mean it (22F and 22M)","I know the title is confusing but here is what happened. My close friend of 2 years (22M) confessed to me about two months ago over message that he likes me a lot. It was part of a conversation about the future and then he just confessed but I did not take him seriously at all to begin. He's a funny guy and he always compliments me so I thought this was just something he was saying. This happened a couple of times during text conversations, he would always bring up us becoming an item until I asked him if he meant it for sure. His response at the time was ""Well yeah, I'm down if you are"". 

Now I didn't go in to this blindly so I wanted to take my time and get to know him even better than i already do. I needed time to see him as more than a friend too so I started to get a bit worried when he would text me things like ""You're my girl"" and ""Lets get a place to move in together"". I should also mention that during this entire period, we met up once and he was clearly  feeling it because he was a lot closer physically and his body language was a giveaway. I would never really reciprocate these texts to the extent he did and I would usually laugh it off. He was definitely more 'in love' than me. Because of this, for 2-3 days I slowly cut back on how much we messaged because it was getting a little much, although I did at one point tell him I need time. We ended up messaging regularly again and he tried saying the same stuff again but (without realising) I was shutting it down. So for example if he said to me ""I need you as my other half"" I would jokingly say ""I don't want to be"" but looking back it sounded like a straight rejection from me. I think I was scared to let my guard down with him because every time in the past I've let it be known that I like someone, it's backfired on me. He knew about this too.

A couple weeks pass and we enter finals in college, so of course we're both stressed but we message everyday still, mainly about finals. I notice that I've started getting more attached to him as more than a friend, but whenever I try dropping big hints that I do like him back, he changes topics. He would always say ""We can speak about it after finals"". We called a few times and he was really flirty but whenever I would reciprocate he wouldnt know how to respond. It was really bugging me how as soon as finals ended, we stopped speaking. So I called him and straight up asked him if he was serious this whole time because his behaviour just switched. Looking back, I should have started with saying I like him. He didn't know what to say and he started getting all mumbley and saying it wasn't serious and he ""speaks like this with everyone"" (lies). The closest I got to telling him I liked him is ""Its not a no from me though so why are you saying this now?"". He was like ""sorry, I didn't mean any of it"". But I've known him for 2 years so I can tell when he's lying.

I think he's backtracking because it seemed like I rejected him this whole time and now I do actually like him, I might have lost him. What do I do now? I won't see him until autumn now.

TLDR; he liked me, I was unsure. He was being too direct but I wouldn't reciprocate much so it looked like I was rejecting him. I actually started liking him but now he's saying none of it was real. I waited so long to tell him I liked him because it's backfired on me in the past when people have known I liked someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntlf51/he_confessed_he_liked_me_a_lot_but_i_was_unsure/

67,ntll41,1622985562,"Is it better to date a fat, ugly girl or remain single?","I tried to make the title a little mean so people look(:

25 years old. I have had anti social tendencies my entire life and making friends and meeting people has been a life long struggle and has caused me a lot of low self esteem and depression. Never have come close to a girlfriend. Bassicly I am not a very interesting or attractive. I have no social status which it seems to me the thing women are attracted to more than anything. I have been on dating apps for years and well... The only girls that engage with me on them are all overweight. I find this to be a major turn off. Yesterday a girl who I have been talking too on hinge followed me on social media(now I have 25 total lol) and when I looked at her recent pictures looks like she has gained 50 lbs in the past 6 months. I know it's shallow but that is such a turn off for me. I have had sex with fat girls before and it is not nearly as enjoyable as a girl with a fit body. The excess fat is just gross to touch and look at. I think for example having a flat stomach and wearing a crop top is extremely sexy look for women. For the record I am a pretty slim myself as I bike a lot, although the ""ideal"" body type for a man is heavier and stronger I think. I think I am average looking, not a male model or anything but I do not consider myself ugly, and I have confidence in my body.

Should I try and date someone who i think is ugly? I just don't think it would work! It would not be fair to girl. I would not want to date someone who thinks i am ugly. Maybe you could say I should focus on personality more than looks, but to me it seems everyone(including and especially myself) has a boring or douchy personality. I want someone who I am attracted to, I like spending time and doing things with, and can trust. They would also need to feel the same about me.

72,ntmbg2,1622987814,Dating always gets boring. It's the dumping-loop.,"I'm not sure how to express myself... It's actually a bit embarrassing even. It feels like I'm in a dating loop where the end is always the same: me getting bored of my partner. 

I've dated several women over the past years. They were all ""wife-material"" as one would say; they tried as best as they could and on paper they were perfectly fine. The first dates are awesome... They're exciting, we get to know each other, might go to bed with each other after a couple dates and eventually it's just a given we have a sleepover every time.

A few months fly past, and suddenly there's ""the switch"". I don't feel the energy anymore, I reply later to texts, I'm not so thrilled to go on another date. I just feel bored; even the sex is boring and feels more like a duty than pleasure. I don't feel so attracted anymore and start to focus on the bad things, which obviously turn me down even more.

The usual result? The girl getting insecure and starts pushing more and more, which makes me back off even more and more.

Currently, I'm headed into that direction once again. I'm not even that big of a casanova and online dating sucks big time for men. Ergo, there is no backup plan involved whatsoever. And yet, I don't feel to commit anymore than I now do. Especially when I'm extra busy at work/college, I barely want to create time.

74,ntmu5z,1622989335,"Lied to hang out with another girl, feel like plan B. Should I dump him or give him the benefit of the doubt?","I started seeing a new guy the end of April. We realized we both have a lot in common, similar values, goals, sense of humor, etc. Every date we have we talk for 6+ hours straight without stopping and have vulnerable, meaningful conversations. We talk for hours on our nights we don’t see each other too.

I began to stay over his house several times a week as I began to like him, and we would spend a lot of time with each other. When we couldn’t see each other, he would Facetime me. He had previously told me that he had only been in two relationships his whole life - married for 13 years to his college sweetheart, and then a rebound right after the divorce that lasted for 3.5 years. He said his last relationship ended 8 months ago and he had recently started back in the dating game after taking that time off to be single. He’s intent on having a family and children though, so he didn’t want to take too much time off being single and not dating.

After a few weeks of being with each other often and our many great times spent together, I tested the waters a little about being exclusive. He said we had only been seeing each other about a month and he wasn’t ready to rush into something serious again headfirst like he did with his other relationship after the divorce, and he wanted to take it slow. He does keep telling me that he’s not on the dating apps or trying to talk to anyone new though, and asked me to be upfront with him if I was. 

I’ve been mostly staying at his apartment because I live with my sister, and I wasn’t ready for him to meet her yet, and he kept saying he wasn’t ready to meet my family too (trying to take things slow). This Friday, however, he had gone out with some friends in the area near me and asked to come over and see me and wanted to meet my sister and said he was ready. When he came over though, he was super drunk like I’ve never seen him before, and didn’t make the best impression

The next morning (yesterday), we woke up and without me saying anything he repeatedly kept saying how embarassed he was that he had made such a poor first impression with my sister, and was really upset by it, saying he wanted to make it up to me and wanted us to all go out again when he’s completely sober so he can make a good impression with her and my family. He brought this up many times and was generally remorseful even when I kept telling him it’s not a big deal to sometimes make a fool out of yourself after a night of drinking.

As we were in bed though, his phone dinged a couple times next to me and it said “(Girl’s Name) Hinge 4.30.21 (the date they started texting)”, and I asked him about it. He said she was a girl he was talking to and they had started talking when we had started (I vaguely knew about her in the very beginning), and that he barely talks to her and she texts him mostly, and that she’s after him for the wrong reasons (money). Without prompting, he showed and read me the text she sent him and she said good morning and asked if he was working today or if he would be around. He knew I was upset and kept assuring me, saying I’m with you pretty much every day, when would I be seeing her?  And that he had just stayed with me at my sister’s house and had met her and wanted to go out with her again and get to know her and that was a big deal, and that we had still only been dating a month. I agreed but still felt a little weird. 

We kind of left it at that because he had to go back home because his dog had had a seizure Thursday and he needed to make sure she was ok, and I had appointments to go to. He’d also known beforehand his friends were throwing him a surprise party for his bday this weekend so he wanted to make sure he’d be ready to go if they were planning it for him that night (he wasn’t sure if it was supposed to be Saturday or Sunday night though, they wouldn’t tell him the time).

When he got back home from my house yesterday, he called and said he didn’t know if his friends were going to be having his party last night as he hadn’t heard anything yet, and asked if I wanted to go over and hang by the pool or go out. I told him I would like to and I would call him after I was out of my appointment before I would head over.

When I called him and said I’d probably be heading over soon, he said I have bad news- my 5 best guy friends are picking me up tonight at 4:00 to go out just us and celebrate before the actual big party tomorrow. I was a little disappointed, and he wanted to cancel on them, but I agreed it was best for him to go if his friends wanted to celebrate him. He said he would try to see me after but most likely they were going to try hard to get him drunk so he didn’t know if he’d be sober enough and said don’t plan your night on it, but that he would try to call me when he got home to talk. We kept FaceTiming for an hour more, and then he said he had to go get ready cuz his friend would be there in 40 mins to get him.

A few hours later that night, I had a weird feeling and looked up the Hinge girl on his Insta out of curiosity. Her page was public and she had posted a story at 4:00 that afternoon of her laying by the pool at his apartment complex. When I went to look later though she had made her page private so I don’t know what else happened after that. He didn’t answer any of my texts last night or call me. 

Now I feel kind of blindsided and lied to. I know we aren’t exclusive, but I felt we were almost there and that he wanted to wait a little bit longer just so he didn’t feel like we jumped in right away a month after dating. However, in that month we’ve been on around 15 or more dates and do see each other all the time and up until then he treated me so well and was so caring and attentive. 

I can’t help but feel like Plan B now if he cancelled our plans yesterday to hang out with another girl and most likely lied to me so easily about it. It hurts to feel that maybe he doesn’t feel the same way I do and that maybe this has all been a lie.

My question is, should I drop him and not answer any more calls/texts, or should I have a conversation with him when he calls and pretty much tell him that I had looked her up out of curiosity after our conversation, and that it would hurt me to know if he had cancelled our plans yesterday to have another girl go over instead.  I want to tell him that we don’t have to rush into being exclusive, but if by now he is still only seeing me as a plan b option and we’re not on the same page about where this could possibly be progressing to, then I probably need to remove myself all together. 

Does that sound too aggressive? Should I address it differently, or should I just outright ignore/block him and move on? Any help and insight is greatly appreciated 🙏🏻

TLDR: Guy I’ve been seeing often possibly lied to me to cancel our plans to see another girl. Should I stop seeing him with no explanation, or talk and give it another chance until exclusivity has been 100% agreed upon?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntmu5z/lied_to_hang_out_with_another_girl_feel_like_plan/
75,ntmuw0,1622989393,What “entitlement” means on here,"Basically anyone that is upset that they can’t get what they want feels entitled. Even if they know they will never get what they want no matter what they do.

But this actually only applies to certain types of people. Specifically people that everyone knows is so incredibly privileged in every walk of life.

So basically someone talking about someone “feeling entitled” on here only has credence if the claim is made against a man. And it basically amounts to “you can’t have a human emotional reaction when you don’t get what you want. Privileged pig scum.”

Except the whole situation of not being able to get what you want here kind of really, really, really sucks. And you want people in this position to just smile and take it day after day after day? And pretend that it’s not happening at all? Sounds like a big ask.

When people can’t get something they really, really want every day of their lives, they deserve some major kudos if they complain minimally about it.

I'm not the flirty type either so idk whether I'm giving her the best signals too. 

But should I just tell her how I feel about her? Because I don't think I'd forgive myself if I didn't and she actually liked me.

87,ntoenb,1622993765,"I told her how I felt, and now it's pretty much over","For context, I met someone on tinder 3 months ago. Went on a date after a bit of back and forth. Ended up going on 3 more after, each one lasting several hours. Filled with laughs and fun. She was the second girl I met in person through tinder.

After the last one (was the last one because we left college for the summer), I told her ""Stay in touch alright?"". She replied in a happy manner ""Obviously!"". That was that.

We continue to stay in touch over snapchat. I start to overanalyze everything about her responses. How long it takes her to, the faces she makes, the fact that I often wouldn't get a snap back before she fell asleep (used to when we were at college), etc. We lost our mutual best friends on snap as well, which further bothered me in the same way. If I mentioned something to start a convo, she wouldn't carry it (I always would when she started a convo), I always asked her on the dates (and to facetime a couple weeks ago). All of this was just making me wonder whether or not she was into me.

But it wasn't that simple. She'd always start convo about small things in her day, we were almost always laughing when we were together.

I was getting mixed signals, and it was driving me insane. It has ruined a third of my summer break. Would constantly be on my mind unless I'm doing a focus-intensive task.

So yesterday, I told her how I felt. I said I saw potential for a relationship, and figured it wouldn't hurt to see where we both stand, and potentially save wasted time. She said she thought she knew what she wanted but realized she doesnt. I followed up by asking if she'd just like to continue the way things have been going, or if there's not enough reason to. She said she'd have to think about it. Told her to take her time.

So yeah, it's pretty much over now. I feel pretty bad but its nothing horrible like the end of a committed relationship. I really did like her. She was honestly the funniest girl I'd ever met.

But in the end, this was probably the best thing to happen, that I had some control over. If I spent the rest of the summer overanalyzing every interaction we had, I would be mentally exhausted for school. It was already kind of hell doing this for a month, not knowing where she stood, but that part is over now.

If she does want to continue talking, I know not to expect much. If she doesn't, then that's kind of what I expected, and I will save time. 

I should definitely see this as a win. I'm very socially anxious, so the first dates with her were terrifying.  But you can't grow without putting yourself in those positions. 

Plus, if I found someone like this on my second tinder date, it can't be a pain in the ass to find someone else I like that much. Everyone says otherwise, but even the first girl I met on tinder wasn't bad. Went on two dates with her, but we had different lifestyles.

All in all, this kind of blows but it would have blown a lot harder if I hadn't told her how I felt",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntoenb/i_told_her_how_i_felt_and_now_its_pretty_much_over/
88,ntogfr,1622993897,What you need to attract a woman,"1. Women love a fit body on a man. You will have to go to the gym and give up your favorite foods for a while. 

2. Women love it when a guy is good in bed. You fuck her good and she will look at you like a God.

3. Don’t be boring. You don’t have to have the best personality. If you are good looking you don’t have to be that funny. Women will laugh at your not so funny jokes just because they are physically attracted to you and don’t want to lose your attention. 

4. Do nice things but keep it at a minimum. Do it enough to keep their interest. If you do it too often they will view you as weak. Don’t be a pushover.

Might be my only chance to do it in person though. My friend suggested facebook but I think that's even weirder. Something about adding someone you've only gotten to speak with for 6 minutes just to ask them out doesn't sit well with me and I'd be afraid it would make her uncomfortable.

tldr: started dating someone my friend who turned 16 when i was 18, i turned 19 a few months later, we have a 2 year 7 month age gap. it was legal, the family loved me, all of our friends supported us. they were a junior and i had just graduated HS a month or two prior. also we’re no longer together, but remain good friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntp4ya/is_16_dating_19_started_dating_at_1618_2_year_age/
96,ntpbc7,1622996275,Having a hard time reading interest and need advice figuring out on how to proceed,"I (M/20's) met a woman (20's) at Zoom university back in Aug of last year. After some casual texting I picked up she was interested in me, so I asked her out in December of 2020 with the expectation we would both be living in the same city starting in January due to school being back to in person. I asked her out and she gave an enthusiastic yes to a date in the next month. This never happened unfortunately. The school administration decided that online classes would continue for the next semester so we haven't ended up in the same city.

We have continued to stay in touch though throughout the time but it has seemed hot and cold. For example, there was a period of time where I sent her a message and she didn't respond for 7 weeks, she said she did not see the message and apologized, but I highly doubt that (In fairness, my last message was me asking her to send me a picture of something non-sexual, so that could have been too forward, I also didn't follow up just let that one text sit for 7 weeks) . Regardless, I let it slide this one time. There are times where she will initiate conversation, but for the most part it feels like it's fallen on my shoulders to do the pursuing and courting. She reciprocates well and uses pronouns such as ""we"" to refer to the future plans, gives compliments occasionally, and sends heart emojis and pictures which all seem to indicate she is still interested. But at the same time I can't help be a little put off by her disappearing for 7 weeks and her lack of initiation as disinterest. I have no problem putting in my share of effort, I just don't want it to be for nothing and find out I've been led on this entire time like an idiot. I'm just trying to do the best I can, and COVID threw a wrench into it. We are expecting to be in the same city to go on a proper date by August.

Any advice how to proceed to keep this going until august will be appreciated.

We met via facebook's app for couples and we never stop talking since then, we discovered that we both have the same interests in almost everything (food, series, music, goals, games) he even lives close to my house! which is a surprise bc everything is always far from my house, we also discovered we went to the same primary school. Anyways, we talked and had two dates in the two months we've been talking.

Everything was great but I always noticed he had little time for a relationship or his personal things. A little thing about my past is that my last relationship fell apart mainly because my ex couldn't set his priorities between me and his college things, I actually don't care about the part of the relationship where we don't see eachother but I do care about communication. About 3 weeks ago I talked to the E. because since the beggining he was so nice to me and made clear if is okay, he would like a relationship with me and that if I have anything to say to him that I feel free to do it because we are both grown ups, etc.

E. told me he dropped out of his first engineering degree two years ago bc of his mental health and he didn't like the school. So now he is trying to enter to medicine school and we all know that career takes almost 5 years to complete. I told him that maybe we should pause our thing because of our degrees and other stuff, that we could talk in the future if that's okay for him, he was very comprehensive and said that it was okay, he agreed and we stop talking, almost 3 weeks have passed.

Now I'm thinking if I made the right choice, I made it based on what happened to me in my last relationship (My ex was angry all the time bc of his college problems and didn't have time for us) but I've been thinking if I should gave it a shot, thinking maybe this guy isn't like my ex and it could work now.

We we began talking again on Friday night we stayed up until 2 am texting (he asked for my number which I felt comfortable giving to him). Yesterday morning he texted me at 9 am apologizing for falling asleep during our conversation which was understandable as I was exhausted too. 

We mainly discussed the restaurants and bars in the part of the city by him (I also live in the same city) and what there is to do, while never actually settling on a place to meet up at for Saturday nor a time to meet. 

On Saturday afternoon he started asking if I was still working then. I told him yes and I should be done by 7:00 pm or so. Of all things he wanted to discuss what I do for work then I did the same with him (it seemed backwards to me as shouldn’t we be discussing where to meet in a few hours at this point?) 

I was busy at work so I took a couple hours to reply to his last message. A couple more hours go by and he’s still silent. At this point it’s past 6:00 pm. I sent him a message then asking if we’re still meeting tonight. He didn’t respond until 8:00 pm (I said I should be done at work around 7:00 and told him this several hours in advance) only to say he was “so sorry” he didn’t respond and he “got a last second text to hangout a his friends pool for a bit while you were working”. 

To me not only does this seem completely inconsiderate to neglect to even tell me while I’m waiting around trying to figure out what I’m supposed to be doing with my night but also seems like he’s actually putting it back on me as the reason he blew me off. Kinda like it’s your fault you were working so I had to occupy my time somehow and blow you off. He didn’t even offer to reschedule.
