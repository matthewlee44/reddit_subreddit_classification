0,mfyy9v,1617050353,I'm obviously not the hottest thing but damn I don't want to date someone unattractive either,"Irl I only ever get asked out by men I find unattractive. I'm assuming this verifies I look unattractive in person if a guy that isn't attractive approaches me. Is that a bad assumption? 

I got asked out today by a guy as I was waiting for my car repair. The man was so unattractive to me I thought he was going to beg me for money. To be fair I get asked for money A LOT in my city even though I'm not rich either. 

I thought to myself I'm a dickhead for thinking this way but at the same time I thought why should I always just be nice if I'm not interested. I'm one of those people that goes out of their way to be nice and ends up being bothered by someone they don't want around but can't get rid of.

1,mfz63m,1617050935,Dating someone who has trouble talking about her feelings,"So I (22M) met this girl (23F) on tinder about two months ago. We didn’t hook up or anything on our first two dates when she came over. We just hung out, she would spend the night and we would just kiss and talk until the sun rose. The first time I met her I kissed her, almost immediately when she came over. I’m not sure why, but I was really into her. I could tell she was nervous the first time, and she would pretty reserved about her thoughts and feelings. She talked kind of loud when she was nervous, I thought it was sort of cute. 

Anyways, things go really well for the first month or so. It was all really fast, but we ended up telling each other “I love you”. I felt like a little kid again, every time I think of her (even now) I get so excited. The only thing is after getting so close so fast, I can’t help but to feel like we’re slowing down. I think that’s normal, getting out of the honeymoon phase and just calming down. I think I started to take this all too seriously too soon, everything felt more simple when we first met. Maybe cause I wasn’t really stressing about anything, I was confident in both how I look and how I act. Plus, our conversations were incredible, and I could tell she was really into me. She was opening up more and more, and acting unbelievably cute when we were alone.

However, I also learn that she’s had some really shitty relationships in the past. Her ex’s had trust issues, some drug problems, were manipulative, and one even threatened her with phone calls, texts, and Snapchat’s when they broke up. She also has trouble handling affection sometimes, she said her family was never affectionate with her when she was a growing up. It freaks her out sometimes. So basically I’ve resorted to jokingly mocking her and being more friendly than romantic. She likes that a lot, as it makes her feel like we’re first and foremost friends. She’s more comfortable with roasting each other than the gushy affectionate compliments that I was used to giving. I kind of like this about her, because she’s independent, not clingy, motivated to take her of herself, and never really flirty with her guys friends.

She does however have a lot of guy friends. I went to her place over the weekend, she met about 20-30 of her friends at this party. The majority of them were guys, but at the same time I didn’t really feel threatened or anything. Then I met one of her friends who was obviously in love with her. She told me they had a “thing” for only about a week, and that it happened two years ago and there’s nothing to worry about. I meet the guy, and yeah, she’s right, nothing to worry about haha. So I don’t feel jealous, and I feel like she’s a trustworthy girl. 

I am really happy with this girl, and honestly am so into her personality more than anything else. I mean the sex has been great, she told me I’m the first person to ever make her orgasm, and I personally find that to be an achievement lol. Anyways, she recently has been talking about wanting to spend the rest of her life with me, I obviously feel the same way about her. 

The only issue is I’ve been struggling with some insecurities and anxiety that stemmed from getting cheated on years ago. This was like the beginning of college, and I am now about to complete my undergraduate studies. The past week or two, I was acting insecure and questioning her about what she was doing and who she was with. It was stupid, and embarrassing. The last thing I want is to act like her ex’s, but I was just anxious and and scared.

She’s a popular girl, lots of friends, and also works her ass off to pay the bills. She’s also got some stuff going on in her family life that has her stressed out. Essentially, she’s got a lot going on. Sometimes, she doesn’t respond to my texts for hours, and won’t call me until 2AM. It’s only when she doesn’t talk to me that I get anxious, I want to feel like I’m just as important to her as she is to me. I guess I’m better at putting my thoughts together than she is, because sometimes she just sounds a little cold. She often tells me that she messes her words up, and is bad at describing how she actually feels. She said it had something to do with her family, and how they would kind of shit on her for being emotional or acting sensitive. Ultimately, she IS a sensitive girl, with a lot of bottled up emotions. I know this because she’s told me, we’ve had a lot of deep conversations where we both were able to be vulnerable with each other.

Last night, I left her apartment and she gave me a very romantic goodnight. We kissed until the very last second before I left, and she reminded me that she loves me. I think I genuinely want to marry her, because she really makes me so happy. 

At the same time, I’m worried about our communication problems. I’m worried that if I get too close, I’ll freak her out. She already got a little fed up with me last week when I was asking too many questions. I told her that I wanted some more attention, and she explained that everyone in her life is fighting for her attention right now. That “people expect too much out of her”. She also told me that she doesn’t feel that way about us, she just has a lot going on outside of our relationship. I couldn’t help but to feel like I was a part of that problem though. I’ve decided to give her space and just not text her until she texts me, or calls. Last night we were on the phone until 4AM, we actually talked about most of the things I mentioned in this post. I feel mostly relieved, but thought I would share this on Reddit because I still need advice. I don’t want to feel jealous when she spends time with all her friends and doesn’t text me. I also don’t want to be a wedge between her and her friends, I’m the new guy after all. After meeting all of her friends, it seems like they like me. Even though it sucked being instantly judged and compared to her toxic ex’s, it was cool to see that her friends all cared about her. None of her guy friends seemed to be against our relationship, but the one friend she had a thing with years ago did get on my nerves. He came up to me and said ,”have you heard about me and ____?” I shook it off and said yeah cause my girl already told me all about it. It’s just weird because now he’s trying to get with my girls roommate. Would definitely kick this guys ass if he tried some shit. 

What do you think this relationship will lead to? Should I just chill tf out and focus more on myself, rather than get more obsessed about this girl? Not saying to break up, but to just take a step back and let her breathe. Also, do you guys think that her inability to express herself at times will be a major problem in our relationship? It’s not like she’s doing anything wrong, it’s just that I am the kind of guy that likes to text his girl all the time. Tell her how beautiful I think she is, and how happy I want to make her. Sometimes she really likes it when I’m like that, but other times she acts really weird about it. I am not afraid of her cheating on me, I’m more so afraid that she’ll meet a guy whose less sensitive and emotional than me, some hard ass who may be just better with her than me. I think this is an unhealthy way of looking at our relationship, so advice on this feeling specifically would be incredible. 

I have an internship with a digital marketing firm lined up for the summer, and I graduate from college this Spring. I’m excited about my future, but I’m also in love with this girl. It’s distracting in the most amazing and addictive way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfz63m/dating_someone_who_has_trouble_talking_about_her/
2,mfz9b4,1617051167,Girl I thought Ghosted me Mysteriously texts me back,"\^ This is 1 month and 15 days after my last text to her.

To start the story from scratch, I met her on Hinge and we went on 1 date I thought went well.  She texts me the next day telling me she had a great time and from there I try to keep the connection going by checking in.  It was me initiating texts each time and this goes on for 2 weeks until my last ignored text that was clearly a question to which she never responds to.

Much time passes and at this point I write her off and move on.  

Suddenly yesterday I receive this strange text:

&gt;Chick: Heyyy! How've you been?! Sry I've been MIA

So she texts as if nothing's wrong.  Below is what I say followed by the rest of the conversation:

&gt;**Me:** Oh hey! I thought you had ghosted me?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Chick:** I didn't mean to actually..I know it looks like it, I'm sry! I feel like that's such a mean thing to do...I would never do it intentionally, it just kinda happened  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Ok...is there an explanation at least? Like you were seeing someone else which is fair since we only met once and it ended which is why your hitting me up again all of a sudden  
&gt;  
&gt;**Chick:** Hmm kinda?! Is that ok? Work got a bit crazy too...but I was just thinking that we did have a nice time and didn't want to completely dismiss it all together.  I mean if you feel weird about I totally understand  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Dang I was hoping you got abducted into outer space and they finally released you 😂 Well ok, I dont consider that cheating on me to get mad but is it definitely over? What are you looking for?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Chick:** Ahhh shoulda gone with that!  
Oh yea def...its been done for a while  
&gt;  
&gt;I just wanted to be honest and upfront...I feel like dating is hard enough

So I dunno what to make of this.  I still like the girl and would like to give it another chance.  Does she seem sincere or playing games?  Its ironic she says she wants to be honest and upfront if she completely blew me off a month ago.

I did not respond to the last text and considering calling her to further gauge the situation but interested in hearing feedback from the folks here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfz9b4/girl_i_thought_ghosted_me_mysteriously_texts_me/

4,mfze1n,1617051527,Should I trust my gut?," I (F 23) started talking to this guy late last year (M 23), we met on a dating app and we hit it off fairly quickly. Soon we started exchanging numbers and was texting and calling on a regular basis.

He asked to meet up with me in February and it went really well, we met again and it seemed pretty clear that he was into me, which was great as I felt the exact same....

For the past couple of years after a difficult relationship, it has been very difficult for me to commit to someone else, I tend to get cold feet and run before it gets too serious, whereas with this person it seemed almost effortless, and I was so happy I finally felt strong feelings about someone who felt the same about me.

I recently went round his house for a couple of days, met the parents etc (we live rather far away from one another). It was all going great, until the last night, something felt a little off. I felt he was being distant, and I know it may feel weird but I had a gut feeling something wasn't right. I feel like I have to mention that I may have been in a bit of a bad mood during that day, but it didn't really seem to effect him during the day, it was only in the evening when it all felt off. I have no idea if that related to anything but thought I should mention it.

Ever since then it has all felt weird, and very different. I'm not too sure what is going on, and I don't want to confront him about it just yet. But it is driving me crazy, I feel like he's slipping through my fingers and I don't want to fight for it if he doesn't want it anymore. I have been feeling very low recently and this really isn't helping. I'm scared he is going to finish with me, because I have really grown feelings for him. I'm just sad as I feel a bit used, and I am constantly thinking whether it is something I have done, whether I have put him off in anyway.

It may be nothing, but I feel like if you have a gut feeling you should trust it. What do you all think? I know it sounds rather stupid but I just need some advice as I'm not sure if I am over thinking it or if other people have shared similar experiences. 

I have decided to take a little step back, but I feel like I need some guidance as to how I should approach this",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfze1n/should_i_trust_my_gut/

6,mfzjhv,1617051916,I want to know if he's lying for my peace of mind,"I was seeing a guy I met on hinge for 2 months and it's been 2 dates because we live far from each other. On date 2 we had sex and he didn't call afterwards. I called him out on it and he said it was not his intention for me to feel used. I then blew up at him and blocked him after he ghosted me again when I softened. 

About a month later I went on a date with another guy but I didn't feel the connection. I messaged the first guy telling him how I felt, that I had probably acted in the heat of the moment and wanted to reconnect. He then got back to me and said he had been getting serious with someone for a week or two. I feel so sad about this because I really thought there was a chance we would work out and I didn't think I would be replaced this easily. I also kind of feel like he is using the seeing someone as a cop-out because I am looking for something serious and he just wants to play around. I want to find out that there really isn't a girl or if there is a girl, she is just there as a casual hook up. Knowing that he is just a jerk and is using ridiculous excuses because he knew he played a shitty card but doesn't want to do the work to fix the relationship cause he broke it will make me feel better.

His hinge is still there on my matches list but there haven't been updates on his profile. FYI I matched with him twice due to app lagging in the span of 4 months. I still want to know if there's a way to find out if he's still using it.

Would appreciate any thoughts on the situation, any hinge tricks or both.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfzjhv/i_want_to_know_if_hes_lying_for_my_peace_of_mind/
7,mfzup4,1617052747,Asking someone out without jeopardizing a potential friendship,"So I met a woman (Let's call her A) at a cookout last weekend. She's only been in the area for a month or so and lives with two men and another woman as roommates. We seemed to hit it off to the point that one of her roommates invited me back to their place afterwards to hang out. We all had a great time and ended up exchanging Discord contacts before I headed home late that night.

Since then, A has PMed me several times outside of group chat, but hasn't hinted at any kind of deeper interest in me. To farther complicate the issue, she hangs out with another guy, but they appear to just be friends. 

I would like to arrange a date with her as soon as possible, in case someone else makes a move. However, since I'm not sure how she feels about me (or the other guy), I'm conflicted about how to do it. It would be super awkward if I misread things and I would like to remain part of their group, regardless.

8,mfzvoo,1617052824,Defrosting and desperate? Or genuinely interested in reconnecting?,"For some context, a few months back I (24F) had been on about 4 dates with this guy (27M), (I’m sure you’ll find the other posts on my profile about him) we connected really well, had a ton of common interests and he had seemed genuinely interested in me.

I was enjoying his company and getting to know him, while also having some fun at the same time.

I recently got a new job and posted it on my story. He responded congratulating me, after months of nothing. Its important to note that it’s getting warmer where I live, COVID restrictions are lifting, and patio season has opened back up. 

Do I even respond to his message? Is this guy worth the headache to restart things with even if I’m not looking for anything serious? Or is he simply desperate and keeping me open as an option where we’re just going to start back at square one with him just hitting me up for booty calls?

Naive of me to think because he seemingly showed genuine interest a few months ago, he might’ve reconsidered and is looking for the same thing I am now? 

I continued to date these other guys after things “ended” with him but all of them were nothing of particular interest and nothing really progressing further than a date or two. And while I’m still continuing to go on all these dates, nothing really is clicking the way that it did with him.

20,mg0v8x,1617055615,Need advice on a complicated situation," 

So just to start I am 21F and the other person is 23M. We have always gotten along really well and are very comfortable around each other. Lately everyone has noticed that it seems like it is turning to more than friends. Obviously I am into this person and would like to see where a relationship would go but his feelings are very unknown. We were drinking together the other night and the conversation came up and pretty much we both said that it would be super fun but he was not sure what he wanted out of a relationship. So I said okay I totally understand that if you are saying no. His response was that he did not want to say no however. That was pretty much where the conversation was left that night.

We saw each other last night and got talking about it again (again after drinking a bit) and I asked what he was thinking and he pretty much said it would be fun so lets try it. We talked a bit about that might be wanted out of that and did not really get very far as we were both a bit out of it. Then I commented that he never really seemed to think of me as physically attractive or had never expressed it and that I felt like he just saw me as eh. He responded with I wouldn't say eh. And so I asked if he was at all physically attracted to me and he in short said not really. That he is attracted to my personality and how comfortable we are with each other. He said that is what he cares about more than physical attraction. The conversation ended there with him walking away saying thanks for pulling that out, bye. I texted him later to ask if we could have a conversation about this when we are both fully sober and I have been pretty much avoided all day. I do not want to push a conversation but I feel like a conversation has to happen at some point.

So here is where I need advice. What is everyone's thoughts? Does it seem like it might be a mutual thing but they just got freaked out and back tracked? Do you think they really are not into me? What would the best course of action be here for me to take? Anything helps.

TL;DR: This guy and I seem to be moving more toward something more than friends. The last two times we drank together we got talking about us getting together. It was said that we should try it but then taken away right when I asked if they found me attractive in any way other than personality. Need help deciding what step to take to keep things from being awkward and advice as to what anyone thinks is going on here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mg0v8x/need_advice_on_a_complicated_situation/

 I currently live and work in the US (and I am a citizen), but prior to college, I lived in a different country (and most of my family is still there). Culturally, I am more like where I grew up than the US, but I cover pretty well, and it's not obvious at first (my accent is very light, and nothing about my name or apperance gives it away). I also try to visit home at least once a year (when there is not a pandemic) and I've considered moving back there sometime in the next 5-10 years.

Should I include that I didn't grow up in the US in my profile?

23,mg144r,1617056311,"I’ve gone on 2 dates with this guy over a 1 month period. He initiated our 3rd date, then cancelled, and never rescheduled. How should I move forward?","I’m 23, and I got back into the dating scene recently. I met a guy on a dating app that I really liked. We had two dates that I thought went well. Our second date ended up being a 12-hour long hangout. We kissed for the first time on the second date, and it became apparent that he was not very experienced with the physical side of relationships. I don’t mind that at all, but I got the impression that he was really intimidated when I took the “driver’s seat” role while making out. It was actually a bit funny because he had speedily taken off his own clothes while we were kissing, and I remained mostly clothed. He quickly backtracked and asked if we could take things slower, and I agreed.

Two weeks ago, he initiated a date, but then cancelled it the day before and never rescheduled. His reason for cancelling was career related, but honestly seemed a bit fabricated to me. Our text conversations for the past week or so have dried up and he’s been more distant in addition to leaving me on read. Instead of texting me a little everyday, he began texting once every two/three days and he leaves me on read to end the conversation.

He’s been starting to reach out again. I know he was busy this past weekend but ??? I don’t know how to proceed. On one hand, he seems a bit inexperienced with relationships, he seemed busy this past week, and maybe he’s embarrassed about our make out session. On the other, my gut is telling me that he’s been distancing from me, and I’m not a priority to him.

How can I get a clearer answer? What should I ask?

The date lasts 7 hours of nonstop talking and it’s wonderful.

Today he tells me that he doesn’t think he doesn’t know what he wants but that we shouldn’t date anymore. As expected, I am just crushed and I tell him that. He ends things about how sorry he is and maybe we could have worked towards a relationship and how he hopes that maybe we can talk again. The message he sent was paragraphs long.

29,mg1l60,1617057710,Mad at myself for catching feelings for a girl I just met,"So I went on a day with a girl yesterday. We immediately connected and honestly I can't deny that I have feelings with her. We plan to go on another date in a few days. The most we did was hug and a kiss on the cheek. She texted me saying that I was pretty and she had a great time. But I feel as if I'm honestly way more into her than she's into me. It was her idea for the second date though. 

Anyways,

I've been on dates with other girls before but never have felt like this before. I even kissed another girl on the lips a few times several days before (second date) and I don't feel the same way towards her. The girl I saw yesterday isn't the best looking, doesn't have the biggest features and that sorta thing. But for some reason I'm so into her personality, her face, how she acts. 

I'm also so mad at myself for feeling this way. The last time I felt this way it leads to disappointment. I'm also scared I won't be as confident next date. 

Should I tell her how I feel next time I see her? I don't want to turn her away though. Also, should I go for the kiss?

30,mg1p04,1617058023,"She told me it was the best first date of her life, then broke things off after our second date. What went wrong?","28 M, I’ve been on dating apps for years but it’s actually pretty rare for me to go out with someone I actually vibe with.

I matched with this 28 F about a month ago; we texted for a few weeks. Our text banter was excellent and I could tell immediately from her messages that I would like her.

I Facetimed with her after that, and we had loads of chemistry. Our conversation felt natural, and we didn’t run out of things to talk about. We talked for almost two hours on FT; afterwards I asked her if she wanted to meet up, and she joked that I passed her test and we made plans for dinner the following week.

Our dinner date was equally amazing; we were both smiling and laughing the entire time. We made tons of plans for the future; whenever she talked about a food she liked, she’d say “I’ll cook that for you” or “we can do that together.” Midway through the date, she told me that she wanted to see me again and that she could see this going somewhere. We went on a walk after dinner, and she ordered an Uber home. We hugged, and then she told me that she wanted me to kiss her. We kissed, and she said that it was the first time that she’s ever kissed a guy on a first date. That night, when she got home, we texted for two more hours, and we both said it was probably the best date of our life.

We made plans to hang out on a second date a few days later (this was yesterday). I wanted to plan a fun date for us, but it was raining so the options were limited. I picked her up, and we drove to an arcade place. We played a bunch of arcade games together, and then laser tag with some other people. She still seemed pretty interested during the date; she was touching my arm and flirting with me, and we kissed during laser tag. Then something changed when we went out for sushi after. She seemed tired, and a little less engaged. I dropped her off at home afterwards, and she said “can we hug?” I hugged her, and we ended up kissing again. I asked her if I could see her again this week, and she said “maybe, I will let you know” (which is never a good sign in my experience). I asked her what was up, and she said that she just “wanted to take it slow.”

I texted her last night when I got home that I had a nice time. She wrote back to me this morning that she had a wonderful time, but that she’s realized that she’s not ready for something new, but that I’m an amazing guy, etc etc.

She did mention to me early on that she got out of a six-year relationship last July. But I asked her if she was over it on our Facetime and our first date, and she insisted that she was. So I suspect that she didn’t feel as much chemistry on our second date. And so I’ve been replaying the whole second date in my head trying to pinpoint where I went wrong, and if I did something to push her away. But even that were the case, given how amazing our first date was, I’m wondering why she wouldn’t give me another date?

Also important to not that she also told me that she only talks to one guy at a time, and I believe her, so I don’t think it’s another guy or anything like that.

I understand that these things happen all the time in online dating, but this girl was by far the most I’ve ever clicked with another person on a dating app, and she was just as invested in this until yesterday. Does anyone have any idea what might have changed?

37,mg2aok,1617059822,I’m just... so bad at picking up on signals.,"So without going in to my life story, I’m pretty introverted and generally have a really, really hard time approaching women and asking them out. I’ve had some significant relationships but most of them were through OLD. One of the issues I have is I really struggle with reading signals from girls. There have been times where I really thought someone was interested and it turned out not really at all when I worked up the courage to ask them out. I really want to not rely on OLD especially because it’s not working at all for me right now and I want to get better at developing things with girls I meet in real life, but it’s tough for me.

So I work at a high school (not going to really get into too much detail) and there’s a girl that I work quite a bit with that I’m really interested in and I think she might be in to me too, but I’m really struggling to take the dive and ask her out mainly because I’m worried I’m completely misreading the situation. I know I’m overthinking it and I need to just either ask her or move on, but I guess maybe I’m wanting to see if anyone has any insight.

We really hit it off pretty much from the start and have good back-and-forth banter. I make her laugh quite a bit and we’ve had a lot of fun during a pretty miserable time to be educators. I have a job that requires me to bounce around to a lot of classrooms and I don’t really have my own office area, and she was pretty quick to offer for me to be in her classroom (with or without students present) whenever I need a space (she has a spare desk in her room). So clearly she enjoys my company.

But other than that- I don’t know? Lol I’m clueless. I feel stupid. She could be sending some pretty clear signals and my socially anxious self is just missing them. I don’t want to assume she’s interested in going out with me and then have things be mega awkward. I honestly enjoy hanging out with her and I’d be fine with not being more than that if she wasn’t interested in that way. But I’m DEFINITELY interested in more than that.

Ive heard people say “don’t date people you work with” and I get that, but another consideration is that I’m not going to be working at this school after this year most likely, so we’re not going to be co-workers for too much longer anyway. 

I don’t know, suppose I’m maybe just wanting possibly some advice for things to look for to gauge her interest and I’m also just wanting to kind of talk about it I guess. Maybe someone can relate to the struggle of reading people.

38,mg2ibp,1617060471,"Don't miss out on an authentic connection because there's no ""spark"".","I made a post a few days ago that blew up about only investing in people who invest in you. Attachment theory and the idea of trauma bonding have been incredibly useful topics to me in the realm of dating and I would highly encourage anyone who hasn't looked into them to check them out! 

I've recently been seeing this guy who I was acquaintance-friends with for years. It's safe to say that in the brief time we've been seeing each other, it has been one of the slowest paced, most openly communicative experiences I've ever had with a man. Nothing about it has been quick, there was no ""spark"", and I was not immediately attracted to him physically for the most part (just some select things, like his eyes/beard/smile). All I knew was that I liked talking to him and he was honest. Nothing about it has been typical for me as I am used to hot-cold dynamics in relationships. I am usually chasing someone else. I am usually someone's therapist. This has not been ""exciting"" in the usual, passionate intensity I have sought Previously. And I am happy to report that keeping on with it, and being open, and giving things with him a chance despite my internal attempts at self-sabotage (aka ignoring my nitpicky voice in my head) as been the best decision.

And I am just here to encourage anyone who is sick of the hot and cold run around to give someone a chance, even if there isn't an initial spark. I am learning in this process that authentic, genuine, healthy connections take time to build. It won't necessarily be that ""sudden butterflies"" feeling, but I can tell you that every time I talk to this guy, something he says or asks or does floors me in such a safe and encouraging way. At any other point in my life before this, I would have discounted things before they even had the opportunity to develop. Authentic connections are peaceful, accepting, and lack the ""drama"" that comes with stress hormones in our relationships. I have not ever had that. It isn't comfortable when you're used to trauma bonding.

I gave her my phone number after a few days and we continued to talk from there. Later on asked her out on a date and she agreed.

But when I text her I feel like I'm not sure if she is actually interested in me because she never asks me questions about me and just responds when I ask her things. I feel like I initiate conversation most of the time and am generally the one pursuing her. 

In her responses she is genuine and showed actual interest and excitement in wanting to go out with me. She sometimes takes several hours to respond because of her work, which is fine. But I can't tell if she is actually into me though, as I'm not very attractive. From my impression from her so far she is a very kind hearted and genuine person, so I want to get to know her more.

I felt really lame talking to her because I am a more serious person and she is really attractive to me. We are both 20 and college students on tinder she marked ""lesbian"" so I know she is actually into girls. 

From reading all the posts about dating and meeting people in tinder I feel a bit pessimistic that anything will come of it(and I might get ghosted), but I have had a bit of a crush on her. 

Should I continue to pursue this and see what happens? I'm not sure what kind of signals I am receiving from her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mg3u3j/ive_f20_been_talking_with_this_f20girl_i_met_on/
52,mg3ysz,1617065164,Snatched from the jaws of defeat,"So I've been seeing a girl for a few weeks. I really like her, great chat, inspiring person, funny. We've been texting every day since we first met up. We've had a couple of dates since then.

I'm 33M, haven't had a long term relationship in 10 years, zero game, only recently trying to put myself out there.

So the other night I invite her over for dinner and to cook for her, I wasn't really in the right mood but we had a great time the day before on a walk which kind of got cut short. So I invited her over, not really expecting her to be able to.

She agreed, which is great and made me realise she must be pretty interested in me. But at the same time I was worried how things would go, I'm a pretty anxious person and sometimes it takes a lot of energy for me to be on form conversationally, I wasn't feeling bubbly. I doubt myself a lot, and have a constant battle with not feeling good enough. I have no idea how to naturally move things on with a woman.

The evening actually went fine, she enjoyed the food and we talked for a few hours. I had this looming fear that I really needed to make a move. I was putting pressure on myself feeling like I needed to do something to show my interest, the conversation at times got awkward, and I feel like I fucked up the opportunities that arose to tell her she looked lovely, to walk her to the car and kiss her goodnight etc.

After she left I put my face in my hands and felt devastated. I could see she was kinda confused, I kissed her on the cheek goodbye but it was all very rushed and awkward. I felt like I'd blown my shot by being too scared to say something or make a move.

The next morning I confided in my good friend and basically said I had blown it. I asked if it would be super lame to text her and tell her how I felt about her, and that I wasn't feeling 100% last night and was sorry if I was acting weird. He said do it right now as damage control.  I felt kinda dumb because I feel like I shouldn't have to do this via text, but worst case scenario it gets it out there.

I'm so glad that I did, she was super kind and understanding. She did say she was a bit confused by the end of the night, and I explained that I was very new to all this and super nervous.

I think if I hadn't let her know how I was feeling about her, things would have fizzled out really quickly. And now I feel like there's a mutual understanding of interest in each other, I hope it'll be easier for me to talk about and show it in person. I'm pretty excited.

53,mg42l2,1617065520,Non-communicative boyfriend,"Yesterday after my boyfriend dropped me off at my dorm, he said goodbye and as I left the car he said “bye! text me!”. A hour or so later I texted him a picture of some art I had finished and asked him what he thought. Two hours later he had not responded, so I sent him a text saying “Hello?”. An hour and a half later and he still had not responded to that. During all of this I could see he was active on Instagram about every 20 minutes. I then called him and asked what he was doing. He said he was busy with a homework assignment and had not gotten a chance to check his texts. I said that I understood that he got busy, but it didn’t make sense for him to ask me to text him and then not respond to me, but still have time to check social media. I said “If you’re busy, I get it, you could just send a quick text letting me know you’ll be free in a couple hours.” He got very annoyed and defensive and said “Well guess what I’m an adult and I don’t have to update you on where I am and what I’m doing every single second.” I said “Obviously that’s not what I’m asking for, I just want some more consistent communication.” I brought this up because he does not send me goodmorning or goodnight texts, he doesn’t tell me about his day or what he is up to, he doesn’t check in with me throughout the day and sometimes will not respond to me for 8+ hours or sometimes won’t respond at all. I feel like I initiate all the communication and I tried to bring up that I would like that to change and he just got all defensive and shut me down, saying “Well you called and got an answer right?”. I feel like he is not hearing me when I say I have a need for more consistent communication, and is taking it offensively. I need an opinion on whether or not he is being unreasonable, or if I am just overreacting. It wouldn’t be such a big deal if he didn’t respond quickly, but I know when I am with him he checks his phone constantly and is always on it responding to people’s texts and looking at social media so I don’t see why taking 10 seconds to text me back is such a big request to him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mg42l2/noncommunicative_boyfriend/

61,mg4qhb,1617067716,Noticing a pattern in men who I [27/F] attract/men who don't seem interested in me. And I'm not very happy about it. Feeling like something must be wrong with me?,"I don't feel like I'm in the best headspace- so I apologize if I'm unable to articulate myself clearly. 

So, the men I attract/have dated or had long-term relationships with have all had the following in common: cold, emotionally unavailable/preoccupied, addicted to alcohol or drugs.

I have recently gone back to bumble after my breakup in August, but can't seem to get many matches or a second date. I don't think I'm hideous, but I am far from unattractive. I would say I am pretty average in terms of attractiveness and I like how my body looks. I'm a 27F with a good job, my own place, vehicle, and I have a bubbly personality, a lot of interesting hobbies, stories, and friends. My life is mostly together. I'm a good conversationalist, and I've been told by many people I'm pretty funny and easy to talk too. My friends and ex's have described me as being really caring, loving, and dedicated. I've been told by my last ex I was the most compassionate and caring girl he's dated. I volunteer and give back to my community and have really good values. I think I'm a well-rounded, good person. 

As mentioned, I don't tend to get a lot of matches on bumble. When I do, we go on one date and usually I don't hear back from men I think seem kind, funny, or interesting. When I meet men who seem interested in me, they have always turned out to be toxic/abusive duds. I have some male friends who (if I'm attracted to them and have spent time with them/gotten to know them), if I express I'm interested in more than friendship they turn me down, saying it's best to just be friends. And that's okay, but it *keeps* happening. Men who I meet on apps who I feel are nice or I have good chemistry with will usually ghost, let me know they met someone else, or aren't interested. I've never had a second date from an app with someone who didn't turn out to be an alcoholic/abusive/toxic. 

I have gone to therapy and talked about this and I've been putting in the work around childhood trauma and an Anxious/Fearful Avoidant attachment style, but I can't afford ongoing counselling to continue working through this. I am trying to break past patterns, but the men I meet who seem like they would be great partners keep expressing they don't see anything with me/want to just be friends and when I do meet people who seem to be okay after a year goes by they tend to be addicts, non-committal, or just mean. 

I feel like I must be doing something wrong. I get really good feedback from my loved ones and friends there is nothing wrong with me. But after all this time of bad relationship after bad relationship, and rejection from men who seem pretty decent, I'm feeling pretty disappointed, confused, and it's hard to not feel like it's about me/I'm doing something ""wrong.""

I'm not sure what to do differently. I know maybe this isn't very clear and I might not have given much detail, so I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mg4qhb/noticing_a_pattern_in_men_who_i_27f_attractmen/

All of you guys had good opinions and viewpoints, which I greatly appreciated and will take into consideration for the future! However, I felt like I had one more piece of advice to share, that I felt would benefit a lot of people who may go through something similar as what I did.

An hour after the date ended, my date texted me telling how she made it home and how she had ""fun hanging out with me"". I was debating whether or not to reply, since I was still going through a lot of emotions - so I ended up visiting a friend to clear my head and decided to ghost her. To my surprise, the next day, she sent me another [message](https://imgur.com/a/8qadYKG). She apologized for leaving the date awkwardly and was still going along with the ""stranded friend"" narrative. I decided to reply back and state the obvious, how there was no connection between us and how I wish her nothing but the best.

Don't be like me and ghost someone after a date that did not go as planned. Even if you didn't receive a text back from a date, but have something to say, just say it! - even if they may ghost you back. Give some closure for both of you guys.

63,mg4z1y,1617068523,Not sure what to think...is this a situationship?,"Alright...

So last week I posted about my situation. I went on a second date with a great girl. Date went well. Ended with a nice kiss. I think I came on a bit strong the night of and the next day in regards to setting up a third date. We talked about it and she said not to worry about it, everything was fine. Since then the texting as pretty much been a low simmer, if anything at all. Feels like I’m getting the slow fade. 

But something interesting happened this past weekend. On Saturday night, I received a text from my ex-girlfriend. We dated for about three months. Over spring break, I asked for some of my things back. She said she would mail them to me but never did. Her text was in regards to getting my things back to me. We met locally and chatted for a bit. She then suggested that we go back to my place to keep chatting because it was getting late. We stayed up until roughly 2:00am. She stayed the night. Things got physical, but not all the way. Best way to describe it was comfortable, yet awkward.

We broke up mutually and everything was amicable. We both needed some space and time to clear our heads and process some things. She needed some closure from matters that occurred in her last relationship. This closure did include her going back to her ex-boyfriend. I will admit that after I found this out, I brought it up to her. I said some things that I regret and made some accusations about her that weren’t the best. Admittedly, I was not in a good headspace at the time. 

During our chat, we cleared the air. We both admitted that we moved too fast the first time around. We introduced our kids to each other within a month, so that type of fast. We apologized about some things that took place during the relationship. It was a great conversation where we really did well to understand each other’s perspective on things. We discussed some parameters for a relationship moving forward in regards to the “big” things. We both said that we would like to try a relationship again. We decided that we would take things much slower this time. Spending time together once a week or once every other week. Chat via text and phone calls. We want to give each other space, so there is no burn out this time around. We were together almost every day once kids were introduced. We agreed to keep the kids out of it for awhile this time around. We discussed exclusively, but did not confirm it outright. I know her and she knows me. Dating multiple people is really not our style, so I’m going to tie up the loose end I have. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation before, or advice in general?

She broke up with him recently, citing these as the reasons. We’ll call him ‘Eric’ cause he legit looks a lot like Prince Eric from the Little Mermaid.

Some examples she gave me were:

-He was obsessed with his hygiene. Apparently he spent hours in the bathroom manscaping, trimming his chest hair and even armpit hair, nose hairs, and even waxed his ass and shaved his balls (sorry if that’s TMI). He would scrub himself thoroughly all over in the shower for a solid 10-15 minutes and rinsed off in very hot water.

-His taste in movies/shows were mainly documentaries and old classic movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. He could never get into anything she liked.

-He never wanted to go out and socialize. He was a homebody and a bookworm which she thought was kind of cute at first but eventually it started to nag at her that he never wanted to do anything or go anywhere.

-He seemed really self conscious about his bodily functions too apparently? She said that in the year that they dated each other and spent time together, she never once heard or smelled him fart or even burp in front of her, lol. She said it made her feel self conscious about her own bodily functions, like he would judge her if she ever did it in front of him? She said it made her feel like she was dating a manikin from the mall. 

We surmised that he was probably gay and we still think he might have been—which is probably the real reason they broke up but she didn’t say. But she said the sex ‘kept her on her toes’ because apparently he was very good in bed and they did it a lot?

81,mg6szh,1617074685,"Having second thoughts about relationship, am I overthinking?","So I’ve been seeing this girl for 2-3 months and the first 1-2 dates it was sort of still Figuring things out, but after that it’s been on the incline. I think what showed me she was serious about me is when she said that her mom knows about me, she introduced me to her roommates, and she introduced me to her friends and kissed me goodbye which I didn’t expect

I haven’t had this sort of relationship in my life where we both just want to touch each other all the time for some reason (maybe it’s just more me) but I’m just super attracted to her. Our last date we just cuddled face to face and just massages each other for a little bit as well as weird things like biting or licking each other. 

We can also just have fun together and talk about really nothing at all but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. What really hooked me in was when she made me dinner, then we had sex after, but she said she was on her period (I think maybe she just wasn’t ready for sex, but no piv) and she mostly pleasured me and was super unselfish in bed, and things were pretty hot and passionate . 

Now the only thing holding me back from trusting her completely is her partying habits and like she told me she was going to go to some football players birthday party (she didn’t end up going) but like you don’t want your girl at at a party like that. Her roommates and her friends are like sorority girls (she isn’t) but they get invited everywhere and they’re all super hot so its not a coincidence that everybody wants them at there party. And it was her birthday this weekend and she told me she was going to do molly and cocaine lol, and i told her I didn’t like her doing cocaine (I don’t really have a problem with molly).

Like my heart is telling me to just not come to any conclusions until I have a reason to doubt her trust. My head is like dude you might get hurt and like it seems worth it to risk getting hurt to sort of see what our relationship becomes, but I’m just anxious about it. We haven’t defined the relationship but we’ve talked about doing something months in advance and we say and do couple things. I’m just sort of anxious about the relationship meanwhile I think she isn’t as worried as I am about things.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mg6szh/having_second_thoughts_about_relationship_am_i/

Me and her were planning on getting engaged when she and I finished college, before we finished everything started falling apart nonstop fighting and arguing so we broke up, the same day as the break up I left work early drove to her house to bring her flowers and propose to her she thought it was completely crazy and threatened to call the cops thinking I was going to harm her for some reason even though I’ve never shown any threading behavior before to her ever. So I texted her mother asking to talk to her she thought that was crazy and said if you just let things be I would’ve texted you and talked to you. So then 2 months from that she texted me saying we should hangout and chill and see what happens and blah blah blah she played games and she said she felt weird to hangout over the me going to her place in the past with flowers so we said our peace and let everything out and went our separate ways. So then almost a year October 2020 she texts me and says we should start fresh and not rush anything she misses me and we are meant to be and we came back to each other for a reason and she misses me, she we hangout she comes over to my place we talk I kissed her everything’s going good for 2 weeks then she ghost me after we have a legit date not just hanging out. So I was like wtf. We go our separate ways again so current day I texted her through snap and asked if we could be friends and be chill and stuff like that she says yes we talk then she says I’m never going to date you again I said that’s fine I just wanna be friends and chill. So idk what to do I do miss her but don’t wanna ruin her back in my life any advice?

86,mg728x,1617075614,Is it worth it to date when you intend on moving soon?,"I'm planning on moving out of the current city I live in, in about 3 months. It just hit me that this is supposed to happen soon. I'm pretty flexible with my plans, and I haven't found a place over there yet, but I've known for a while that I need a change in my life and need to try something new. I was mostly staying here because of work and my ex, but I work remotely now and we broke up... and the city's energy is just... boring. I'm hoping to move to a bigger city where there's more vibrancy (though I'm a little worried about the dating scene there being tougher, I'm also not sure if it'd be that bad).

So, is it even worth it to date here or should I just put it on pause for 3 months and wait? What would you do? I already am seeing someone (who was also planning on moving to the same place) non-exclusively but pretty sure it won't be anything long lasting just because I'm not interested enough. I do virtual dates here or there but I can honestly feel a strong disinterest on my part... I ended a virtual date tonight after an hour just to watch a movie lol.

I dated this guy for just a few weeks. We had a really amazing connection and I liked/like him a lot on a personal level. But he ghosted me and doesn’t want to talk to me because I’m not the person to keep things super casual- he called me “dramatic”. I can get over this on some level, we want different things and it doesn’t seem like he appreciates who I am or what I want. So it’s not that I’m desperate to be with him because that would just make me feel bad about myself.. However

I can’t stop thinking about the sex. Oh my it was soo good and it’s been weeks since we’ve talked and I can’t stop having flashbacks that make me want him soooo bad. I feel desperate. I’m not the type of person to open up sexually with a lot of people, in fact he was the first in a long time. I knew it was dangerous bc he didn’t want anything serious but the attraction for me was so deep i did it anyways and i don’t regret it. Or maybe I do because now I feel like a fiend.

This feeling happens regardless if I swipe left or right, but especially when I reject a person. That person very well could be a fun, and an enjoyable person to be around. But if I rejected him I’ll never know will I? That person very well could be my best friend, or maybe just casual friend or maybe even my worst nightmare I’ll never know. It is just an endless grind of swiping on people that I will never meet. Why do bios even exist in the first place? Is this supposed to be some corporate job interview? Surely people are much more complicated than just one paragraph about themselves right? My point is, is that it all just feels soulless and mechanical. There is nothing organic about dating apps.

In person, we both were eager to talk to each other whenever we had the same shift (she’d even rush to catch me before the end of our shift). When she first rejected me , she mentioned she was kinda interested in someone else but really likes being my friend and hopes we can stay friends. I stopped pursuing then she texts me back a few days later saying sorry she didn’t even see my text til today (everyone has their phone on them 24/7 lol) my lack of communication skills took this as maybe she has some sentiments &amp; doesn’t want me to give up yet. I pretended to have deleted her number &amp; she laughed and said yikes. After a few days I said I was joking hoping she did well on her exams. I attempted again this time I mentioned I was interested in a few women but felt there was potential between her &amp; I but if she rly meant that she wants to stay friends I accept her decision. She responded harshly this time and I didn’t say anything. She texts back 2 days later(i think she was expecting me to react negatively) saying her friends sent that and she is now seeing the man she was interested in hoping everything’s cool and we can stay friends. Two days later I asked for some space. My question is, would a women who was starting to catch feelings for you react this way bc of me mentioning I was interested in other women at the same time?
