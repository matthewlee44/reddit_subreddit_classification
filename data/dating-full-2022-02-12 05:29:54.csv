So yeah, overall I just quit and decided to just take a couple months just focusing on other things and just not worry about online dating but now I’m starting to think “you know, maybe not at the moment but maybe after I work on myself for a bit I can hire a really good photographer and have them take good pics of me in different areas and also have someone help me create a good bio”, so is that a good idea?
Also something else that I found out too is that most online dating apps rank you by how active you are and I honestly have no clue how that’s going to work out because I have a really busy schedule except for the weekends.
Also I’ve heard that dating apps are more look based rather than personality based if you get what I mean.

I just need to rant and would like some advice. We’ve known each other for about half a year and started seeing each other about a month ago. We were going to see each other on the 13th but he had to reschedule so I suggested the Monday the 14th which happens to be Valentine’s Day. Then he said he was fully aware it is Valentine’s Day and said it wasn’t appropriate to see me on that day because we just started hanging out, but I don’t see what the big deal is, it’s literally just a day. I told him I was kind of hurt by that. 


He said he enjoys spending valuable time with me and his priority is work and not a serious relationship and date on Valentine’s Day escalates things towards serious relationship. So then I asked if we could be casually seeing each other when we have time but be exclusive because I’m not that comfortable sleeping with him if he is sleeping with other women (risk of STDs, jealousy and trust issues, etc) and he said that won’t work for him because his goal is to get serious about dating 5 years from now and that this is the time for him to learn about what he likes and doesn’t like (and my question is, how is he going to learn what he likes and doesn’t like by sleeping with many girls for the next 5 years??)  

So I’m at a loss because he’s given me so many signs that he wants a relationship (ex. He said he would always be there for me, he told me to draw us together, he said he would work hard to make me proud and that he’s grateful I think highly of him, he asked me if I think he cares about our relationship, we do the couple-y things like cuddling, hand holding, we’re emotionally vulnerable with each other etc). But it seems like he wants all the benefits of a relationship without actually being in one. 

Is he basically wasting people’s time and wants to screw around for five years? It seems to me that he thinks he’ll so conveniently find someone to settle down with when he’s ready, as if life works that way. You can’t plan your love life, what if the one comes along before then?? And he’s expecting women to be okay with being used in this way and to agree to this arrangement especially if they’re his age? (27) 

I’m at a loss for what to do. I liked him a lot but I don’t know if this will work if we want different things and I don’t know if he means he’s not open to a relationship at all, or if he would be open to one after getting to know each other for a few months more. We’re still planning for another dinner date though, so maybe I’ll bring it up again.

We have a lot in common including our sense of humor, we enjoy each other's company it seems, like when we're together it feels like we really click genuinely like each other. It started off really slow in the sense that we didn't talk too much at first and it took almost 2 months before we went on our first date. I had tried to go out with her after about a week or two (I don't remember exactly) but things just never really fell into place. Stuff got in the way a lot. Then starting the end of last year and the beginning of this year we started texting more and we finally went out on a date. The date went really well and I thought we vibed really nicely. Since then we've been on two more dates, text a lot, talked on the phone and video chatted a few times etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am noticing and realizing is that I initiate a lot of the conversations and dates. When I really think about it, she's only initiated a conversation with me twice and she only hit me up to go on a date once. I think I have hit her up to go out around 7 or 8 times (keep in mind we're both pretty busy and we live far from each other. about 45 minutes away so meeting up takes planning). There have been a few times where I even hold off on starting a conversation to see if she texts me or calls me and she never does with the exception of one time. 

The reason I am posting now is because I have held off again from texting her this week to see if she at leasts texts hi and I haven't heard from her yet and it's been 6 days. Plus, I checked her profile to see if she may be actively using okcupid and she is (you can tell if someone is on because they have a green dot on the profile pic). In fairness on that account I have been on okcupid and tinder still occasionally but I'm not dating anyone else. I just get on to match and chat in case this doesn't work out so that is probably what she is doing, it's just worrying to me given everything else I have discussed.

I wonder if maybe I made some jokes in poor taste and that is turning her off? I have a dark and sometimes inappropriate sense of humor so I've been peppering my kind of jokes in but she seems to receive them well but maybe she just is being polite. I sent her a downloaded screenshot of a meme I posted to reddit and it had my username on the bottom. Maybe she decided to look at my account and saw a post I made about me possibly being aromantic? I don't know I'm just starting to worry because I actually do like her a lot which I have never felt with anyone yet.

Anyways, when I went to college during my first semester after breaking up with my Highschool boyfriend, I decided to go on tinder and do causal hooking up for some time, but then this boy came around and told me he wanted to take me on a date, so I took the chance. 


He was from a neighboring town so the drive was a little long, but once he made it, he brought me flowers and kindly took me to a nice restaurant. After the restaurant we bought one of those card games that couples or people who are getting to know eachother play and we got super sentimental and emotional. He showered me in sweet things like “I know you’ve been hurt in the past, but hopefully I can change that” or “I’m so great full for this moment right now” and after all that emotional passion, we had passionate sex. It was probably one of the best sex I’ve had in my life. After that, he kind of ghosted me, but for some reason I didn’t really care?? I just loved the sex.


Months after I reached out to him because I wanted to start talking to him again, so I started messaging him everyday (not in a creepy way) just yknow how everyone gets to know someone and he just showed a lot of red flags. He would tell me he could turn on his location if he wanted to calm me down. Whenever I made a sarcastic joke like “Omg I’m gonna hang up” and then he would actually hang up and not talk for days. He would always tell me like “you don’t know me, I’m a horrible person” and I was like….noooo you just have low esteem about yourself. But I just ignored it. I kept letting this boy emotionally hurt me because at the end of the day I was hoping we would make up and have that passionate sex. However, one night, I just about had it. He was making me so upset, he was destroying my happiness, he was ruining my first semester of college so I decided to call him and explain how I felt and he got super offended so I just stopped talking to him until 2022.


Flash forward to about a week ago, I message him because I’m like okay I don’t desire a relationship with him, I just wanna have good sex and that’s it. So I start texting him and blah blah and yknow it’s normal and I’m enjoying just talking to him and just being his friend, but I was always texting him first so I stopped texting him as much. Then he started texting me and the conversations were very weird, he would tell me about all his sexual experiences and all the people he had sex with and it came off very….pretentious? It’s almost like he knew I wanted to have sex with him, but he always declined or flaked whenever we were gonna hang out just to taunt me. I fell into another depression and I deleted all my dating apps because I truly just did not know what to do. 


Flash forward to today,

I’m having a pretty good day, I’m actually currently watching Encanto because I’ve been looking forward to watching this movie (it’s amazing by the way). 

Then he texts me, 


“This girl wants me to fuck her and make her pregnant and then leave”

And of course I was like what the hell lmao that’s such a weird occurrence and since he’s told me about other crazy experiences with girls he’s met I proceed to say “where do you meet all of these crazy girls?”

And he proceeds to say 

“Well you use to be one of them, so now you understand”. 




Never in my life was I more offended……

but I also knew what had to be done. 



I sent him a paragraph. Not too long. Not too short. Basically telling him that if he is meeting all of these crazy girls and having the same outcome that maybe he is the problem. I told him goodbye and I blocked him on Everything. 



That being said, I just finished Encanto and I’m crying not only at the movie but because I did what I knew I had to do all along. 



I mig have not gotten the closure I needed….but I feel so much more liberated. More free. 




If you see this and it’s a sign to block someone… block them. It’s not worth your emotional suffering.

We really hit it off, had great chemistry, and after a few drinks we went back to mine to continue drinking and chatting since I only lived around the corner. 

We started hooking up at my place, but only kissing, and I said to him that I didn’t want to just have a one night stand with him because I actually thought we had more of a connection than that and I wanted to give it more of a chance. He said he agreed and that he wanted to see me again too, and that we could do things at whatever pace I felt comfortable. 

He asked to stay over cos it was pretty late and he still lives with his parents, and I said sure so he stayed over. He left quite early the next morning but not without saying goodbye. 

2nd date was at his because his parents were away on holiday so he had a free house. We had some drinks and chatted and then made out but nothing more than that. It got late and we both had work early the next day so I left but we said we’d meet up again. 

3rd date was at his again (he said let’s utilise the free house while we can before his parents get back). Chatted, then ended up having sex - the sex was great, like really really good for sex with a new partner, which we both agreed afterwards. We cuddled loads and chatted afterwards which has not been my experience at all with people I’ve had casual sex with. It all felt very much more relationship-y that other similar encounters I’ve had since I’ve been doing online dating.

That was Tuesday, then I heard nothing from him. Was obviously hoping he would text. Yesterday (Friday) I sent a message saying I hoped he’d had a good few days, I had a really nice time the other night and did he want to do something next week. I know it is now only Saturday but I’ve heard nothing and while we have by no means been constantly texting, he’s usually more communicative than this. 

I feel like he’s got what he wanted (sex) and I’m now never gonna hear from him again. And it really fucking sucks. I guess I’m just ranting but I just feel so used and a bit led on, and by far he was the person I have felt the most connection with since I’ve been dating. Maybe he just wanted a fling while his parents were away and he could utilise his free house but WHY don’t people just COMMUNICATE what they want. Feeling pretty shit

We live a little bit apart so we only see each other once or twice a week but we text and call often. We’re college sweethearts, but I’m still in school and he’s got a 9-5. There is also no way he’s cheating on me since he’s a very faithful person. (If not, his family and friends will beat him up for me.)

The thing I’ve noticed for a while is that I don’t really see any shows of affection from my BF. It’s not that I always expect it, but he knows what things I like, what I’m interested in, what my goals are and I message him whenever I think of him. I tell him pretty much everything, and he’s more private about himself. If I don’t ask first, he won’t tell me on his own. Most of our conversation is initiated by me. I get him small things that remind me of him, but I can’t recall a time he’s done the same (any more than a candy or snack we both like to share). For example, he knows I love flowers, and exactly which flowers, but has never gotten any for me, even for special days. (It’s not a money problem for him.) I’ve even flaunted flowers I’ve gotten from family or myself to give him a hint. This is just one example. At most he knows I love plushies and will consistently get them for me as gifts on special occasions.

He’s more of a physical touch and quality time kind of guy, and giving gifts is very low in his love languages (mine is a bit higher but still also low). I don’t know if he’s just more of a silently loving type but it frustrates me that I just can’t tell sometimes.

I hear everywhere that couples have their own little thing that’s special for them, or one person does something only for their s/o, but I can’t find a single thing like that between us. We’ve even talked about marriage and our futures, but I can’t see myself with him if I’m not sure he loves me. It’s putting me in a mental war where I know I can’t continue to love him if I find out he doesn’t feel the same way.

She asked if I was sitting there, and I told her that I'm not and that I'm just waiting for the class to begin. I ended up not sitting next to her because it was crystal clear that she wanted to sit alone in the corner, for some reason. She spent the whole time on her phone barely looking at anybody, although we did lock eyes a few times. She also was the very first to leave the class that day. But there's something about her that made me go crazy, she's so mysterious and intriguing, and when it comes to looks she's exactly my type. I have this class only once a week so I have to wait 7 days to see her again. I decided that the second class I was gonna try and sit next to her, but when I arrived it was too late, she was already sitting next to two girls she apparently knows. I decided I was gonna talk to her after class but she left in the middle of the class that day (I guess she had already told the teacher that she would be leaving early).

Newcomer to this subreddit and I’ve already seen a post or two that are fairly similar to what I’m gonna type out here. Hope this one gets noticed. I’ll try not to ramble on forever, too. Here it goes…

With Valentine’s Day two days away, it brings in more reminders of just how alone I feel in this world of dating and really, just in general. I see these posts on Instagram, Facebook, the very few **“friends”** I have on Snapchat that are in relationships, and it just makes me feel like a total outcast. And before anyone says “just focus on yourself on Valentine’s Day and stay off social media if you feel that way”, I’ll save you the trouble and say that I most definitely try to.

I’ll tell y’all a little bit about myself. I’m a 21 year old, 5’5, introverted af, straight black kid with scoliosis and a pretty serious resting face to which some people in public (well before this pandemic) think I look like I’m on my way to kill someone, been asked by some point by my old friends why I don’t smile/why I look sad (never really had a reason to smile, honestly), or why I don’t talk much/am shy. 

I also don’t consider myself physically attractive, and have been told a couple times even by an old female friend of mine that I’m unattractive, nor am I the best with words. I also don’t drive (no license), not a gym person (just isn’t my thing. I’m not out of shape though. I weigh like 140 lol), don’t drink alcohol… I think you get it. Complete hermit. Oh, and I’ve had a deep voice since 6th grade. I do have some hobbies and interests though, for sure. Never had sex, let alone even a FIRST KISS**, been on a date… yep. A few times back in high school, an old acquaintance asked if I was gay just cuz of that. Really pissed me off.

That was long, but yeah. Anyway, Valentine’s Day is just another day that reminds me how lonely I am and feel. It makes me wonder what it’s like to be in an **ACTUAL** relationship. Not this disgusting “gEn Z” hookup culture, needing to be of a specific zodiac sign, blinded by lies, gaslighting, etc… form of dating.

I express a little in all my dating app bios that I’m looking for a serious relationship and nothing less/superficial than that, all while still trying to make myself look a little bit inviting, like adding one meme and one photo describing like “this could be us” typa thing, included with the photos of just myself that I personally like. I handle myself seriously with that and I don’t plan on stooping down to that fake shit any time soon.

Is that even possible these days? Has OLD and just dating in general fallen to no return, or am I tripping? Cause I really feel Gen Z destroyed dating with these new and sad norms. I just wanna be able to find someone who accepts me, what I am and how I am. Asks me how I’m feeling and shit. I do my best and hardest to just do that on myself since nobody messages me and asks me if I’m good or anything, even if I have a meltdown about something on my Snapchat. I barely hear from my supposed friends anymore like that lmao, unless I start the conversation, which is always the case. But that’s neither here or there. Just means that nobody truly cares and no one’s got you but your own damn self.

Btw, I’ve gotten a fair amount of matches on both Tinder and Hinge (the two apps I use the most) over my time of using them. Good looking ones, too, surprisingly enough considering my looks and personality/wordplay. A large amount of those resulted in either getting ghosted, unmatched fast (either by me or mostly the other person) or just a few new friends, one of which I can actually consider a good friend.

Dating just seems to be a fantasy at this point. I've always been the kind of guy to be friends for a couple months before trying to date, taking things slow, etc. But from my experience it's a waste of time in them end.

After my last relationship (ended horribly) I've finally given up on dating. My last relationship (I didn't even want to date her because of recent trauma, she insisted, partially my fault for giving in) went horribly because of my bad experiences, but she was very adamant about making it a real thing. Just for her to end up cheating. So finally I've given up. So, against my morality, I've joined the ""hookup"" culture. 

I'll make 1 thing clear, I absolutely hate the current state of relationships. Every single sexual relationship I've had is from knowing the person for months and just ""letting things take their course, naturally"" but now I'm over it. People are just shitty. Period. I have found sexual relationships to be way more fulfilling because of our knowledge and trust for each other vs a 1 night stand. I find a personal connection way way way more of a turn on than just being ""hot."" But I've given up. Nothing is real anymore so why bother.

Valentine's is near and just wanted to post it here. This sub has been very receptive and non judgmental in most of the posts , so I figured might as well share my experience here.

Reaching mid 20s and I feel this entire dating fiasco is hopeless. Been on so many dates, had few relationships and everything breaks apart. I'm a 9/10 (not being self absorbed just wanted to set some context), settled down in a good job, got plenty of humor to back myself with, pretty much understanding of most situations and puts effort in trying to solve it rather than breaking things off. Trust me your typical movie boyfriend who's perfect in all ways and is willing to go the extra effort to hold onto things and yet single AF. Most of the time women tell they're insecure with me because they assume I'm too good for them and am sleeping around with other women at the same time. I'm too nice and understanding that they feel shitty about themselves. I'm too romantic that they don't feel they're doing justice to it. I've lost it at this point. I do everything right and yet somehow those are the things that break things apart. I see people happy around me even though they're absolute d\*cks. People tell oh the right one will come along I'm like no, seen this happen way too many times I've lost absolute hopes. Don't even know what to do anymore. Sure live for yourself and what not but what's the point if there's a void as big as the sun that can only be filled with company and no amount of self development, therapy, travelling, exploring works? I wish there was a way to switch of your natural instincts to find someone, disable all emotions and live a robotic life. Have tried everything at this point, i feel like might as well go to the Everest and jump from it. If any of you have any answers or wanna berate please do, else thanks for reading it till here.

So my friends (late 20s - mid 30s) are active on dating apps and sometimes they match with the same guys. 


These guys magically share each girl’s interests and values, even if they are at odds with each other. For example, one guy tells girl A who is vegan that he has been vegan for many years and they should totally go check out that new vegan ice cream place. At the same time, he is gushing to girl B who loves meat about how much he loves a good rare steak and tries to set up a date at his favourite steakhouse. More worryingly, some of these guys would even lie about whether they want casual sex only or long-term relationship, if they are monogamous or not, their political beliefs as well as their stance on marriage and children. 


When called out these chameleons usually just claim to be fence-sitters who didn’t want to limit their options because guys simply don’t get the same amount of matches women do and need to stand out. They argued that they would likely have adopted their partner’s interests and values anyway.

- Opening doors in general. Same thing applies. Don’t open the door and gesture with your other hand like a butler, or with a big grin on your face like you’re trying to impress her. Just do it like it is your typical behavior, as if you don’t really notice.

- Don’t overdo it with compliments. If you’re constantly giving compliments, it will come off as disingenuous. Only give her a compliment if you’re really genuine about it, and want to express it. Otherwise, chill with the compliments, and express through action.

- Gifts too early on are too much. You can’t buy someone’s attraction or affection. 

- Paying for the meal. Men should pay for meals in the early stages of dating. However, don’t be rigid. If she insists on paying for her portion, don’t make it a battle.

I matched with the most beautiful woman on hinge and we talked for a while before I asked her out.

I did a lot of research and asked friends 
how to make it better for women on a first date. 
The best thing is to hug asap 
To have physical contact 
And to keep a list of topics to talk about 
Also sit right next to her and keep physical contact The whole date

I picked out an expensive bar and made sure to give her loads of options 

She was even more gorgeous then I expected. 
She hugged me as soon as she saw me
We then sat really close to each other and kept physical contact 
We talked for 4 hours and it went really well
At the end of the date I stopped her to ask for a kiss and she kissed me
She appreciated me asking for consent and being respectful. 

She complimented me and said I had a pretty face which was nice and unexpected as a guy to hear. 

That night I woke up at 3 am and couldn’t sleep again, I couldn’t stop thinking about her and how great of a time I had. 
Plus I felt a little drunk too 

She inspired me to take up rock climbing because it’s apparently a great way to meet people, I also think itll look interesting on my profile 😜  

Overall it was an amazing experience and I’m so glad I put myself out there and allowed myself to be vulnerable to experience something like this and now that I have a taste of it I want it more and I want to keep it happening. 

I feel like I realised a lot about me in this date, that I’m way more of a catch than I thought.

My boyfriend has never had sex before. He’s had very little experience in general. This is because used to have low self esteem but has since lost a ton of weight and started going to therapy. He also converted to Christianity and believes that sex should be saved for marriage. I myself am a convert to Christianity and agree. I however had a lot of experience prior to my conversion.

I think my experience and his lack of experience have caused us to have very different views on sex and marriage. While I think that a healthy sex life and intimacy are important for marriage I wouldn’t say that sex is the most important thing in a marriage-there are several other factors that come before that. On the other hand, he is very excited to have sex and places it on a podium. He talks and jokes about sex constantly-not a day goes by where he doesn’t make a sex joke or bring it up in conversation somehow.

He wants to get engaged in the next three months-so six months after we started dating. I think a large part of this is because he wants to get married as soon as possible so we can have sex. He makes jokes about it but I think he is low key being serious. He knows that I’ve had experience and has admitted to me that it made him jealous. I on the other hand, would like to wait a year to get engaged. It’s not that I don’t love him or don’t trust him-I see myself marrying him. I would just like to experience life together more and cherish the dating period. For example, I would love to travel together. We have yet to go on a big trip together or even a small road trip. We will also be going through some life changes in the upcoming months that I would like to handle first before we throw a wedding into the mix.

If it weren’t for sex I wouldn’t be questioning our relationship. He loves me and cares for me a lot. But I think his lustfulness is clouding his right judgement and I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated so much :)

Chances are these people are only swiping right on profiles of guys that they think are hot or guys that appear to be of a certain status. Just because you may match with this person and have a decent convo, it doesn’t mean that this guy is interested in making you his monogamous girlfriend. 

Some are just matching with whoever they can get and it’s the bottom of the barrel type of guy. No need to ever lower your standards in times of loneliness. Much better to improve your situation rather than settling.

If you’re looking for a relationship, why not focus on profiles that clearly stat “ looking for a relationship” or “looking to get married”? I know these profiles may be less fun and “exciting”, but at least you know exactly what the guy is looking for.  Then look for qualities in profiles that matches the qualities you want in a boyfriend or husband.

If I was single and swiping away and I see a profile with someone that is a young party girl, then my thought would be hey this woman seems like she would be a lot of fun to hangout with and just see what happens but I don’t expect a relationship to come out of it. I feel like everyone should have that same mindset. If you aren’t looking for short term fun, then don’t try to go on dates with people that you know there is little chance of a longterm relationship. 

If you are swiping on these quality profiles but they aren’t matching with you, then review your own profile to determine why aren’t these quality men aren’t swiping on yours.

I was down on vacation in Texas, and it was warm enough so I could wear a tank top. So my tattoos and everything are exposed. I went into the store to pick something up. And I saw a lady on my way in. And I noticed that as I was passing her, She gripped her purse tighter to her body. At first I thought nothing of it, but then as I got in the store I thought 'Wait a minute, did she think I look like a thief? Ouch""

Since then, I've been told I have a bad case of RBF for dudes. So I tend to look like I'm mad all the time, so people don't want to come up to me.

long version: (i am in highschool) I started dating my girlfriend a couple months ago, her and i talk often online, we usually have short conversations about meaningless topics, usually about what we’re doing at the moment and our hobbies. I think she’s really sweet, i’ve been acquaintances with her for three years but we were never that close, however i knew she had a huge crush on me and really liked me.

Let's say you make cookies for a bake sale, and you really want $2 per cookie. You want potential customers to know how great your cookies are, but instead of putting out small ""samples size"" bites and then marking your cookies with a ""$2"" price tag, you instead just make the cookies free and have an optional tip jar.

What happens then is, most people just stop by, thank you, and take your cookies for free. Some of them might tip, but the majority do not. Before you know it, all of your cookies are gone and you barely made any profit. 

You begin to doubt yourself: **""What's wrong with my cookies? Why are my cookies not good enough for others to pay for?""**

Meanwhile, the person next to you sold all of their cookies, and made a great profit. *Why them, and not you?* 

**The truth often times, is simply: that the other person had clear expectations of the price they were requiring.**

This doesn't mean that there's not people who might *still* try to steal a cookie when their back is turned. Some might even be successful. But the boundaries are set, and the majority of people will either decide the cookie is worth paying for or leave. 

* How does this apply to modern dating (if y'all haven't already figured it out)? 

The ""relationship benefits"" is the cookie. Some of y'all will give a person everything they'd get if they were in a relationship with you... without being in a relationship with you. Sex, affection, time, dates, money, attention, etc. 

You're thinking the ""right person"" will naturally want to commit regardless, but by giving all the benefits away so freely, you're 1) inviting people into your life who don't consider commitment with you worth it, but will ""enjoy the ride"" because you aren't requiring it and 2) making it harder to see the people who would actually commit, because you're wasting your time on people who won't. 

Of course, dating is supposed to be fun and you need to market yourself as a great potential prospect. The person you're dating should get a ""sample"" of all the wonderful benefits of dating you. 

But they shouldn't get the whole cookie. That's reserved for people who are *actually* committing to you.

Before I start explaining more, I want to note that she's from a Muslim Qatari and following her religion, she's not allowed to date or have any sort of interactions with another man before marriage, and I was the first boy she got into something like this with. We always planned on getting married soon, but it was hard as her parents wouldn't accept me being from another country. Recently my family agreed to go to Qatar with me and finally ask for her hand, but 2 days ago she told me something that broke me.

Apparently, some boy's family that knows her family are going to ask for her hand soon (few months), as expected, I told her my plans and that I'll be asking for her hand soon when I go there as that's what both of us have always wanted. But on that day, she told me that she doesn't see me as her husband anymore and won't take down the offer of the other boy and his family. (The boy and his family live in their city.)  


Before our dreams started coming possible, both of us would pray for it to happen and become reality, but that it came true she switched up on me and said she doesn't see me as her husband or in her future anymore, because she cannot leave her family and it's easier to marry that guy as it would probably please her parents more.

Months of planning and dreaming, just to switch up on me when ""our"" dreams and plans became reality, simply because she's not willing to fight and go through the struggle of being with me.

Now I'm left here with a broken heart and soul, not knowing if I did something wrong. She was the first girl that fulfilled every aspect of me and that I truly wanted her to be a part of my future.

&amp;#x200B;

Today she blocked me everywhere telling me that both of us should move on and that she meant every word and promise she gave to me, but cannot see me in her future as she cannot go through the struggle and marrying a man in an arranged marriage would be easier, as both of their families know one another.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always known how to deal with the pain of a break-up, but not this type. Opinions or suggestions would be appreciated.

This past month I swiched meds because my orginal meds were giving me crazy side effects. So when you switch meds, most of the time you have to ramp the existing one down and the new one up which disrupts your body chemistry, and for me that effects my mood, ability to cope with situations, and some times my ability to focus. Around the time i started to transition meds, my friends car that was parked out in front of my apt, got stolen and i felt responsible for it cuz she left it there while she was gone for a 1 night trip. It really effected me as she not only blamed me but cut me off. 2 weeks later i got hit with the flu and a uti in one go, and was out of commission for 3 days. the week after that a huge work project was due. So on top of the normal life stressors, i also was dealing with the side effects of my meds, and honestly it was pretty hard to be fully excited and present in with people my personal life. 

A week after my friends car got stolen, i met someone on tinder (27m). We decided to meet up, and we immediately hit it off. We started seeing  each other 3 times a week and it seemed like we headed in a postive direction. It is winter and were we are it gets down to 10° or lower most days and nights so most of the time we would get dinner, if weather permitted go do some winter activities, playted a game or watch tv and then talk till dawn. By total coincidence, we learned that both of us got out of long term relationships 6 years for me 8 years for him. For me that kind of made it easier to connect cuz he could relate to the jitters and unsure feelings of dating after not being single in so long. For both of us this has been the longest relationship since our ltr. I felt safe and developed feelings.

We dated for about a month, but then he ended it cuz he felt that i wasnt putting enough energy into a new relationship, and felt like we were getting stuck in a routine. Unfortunately he did not express this to me while we were seeing eachother because i feel like i would have been aware and tried harder to express how everything in the past month has effected me. (He knew about the car, when i got sick, and the work deadline) I know hes right to and extent because of how crazy this past month has been for me... but i didnt want to seem like it was an excuse, because both of us have had to deal with our previous partners for making excuses for why they were not fully present but wanted to be around for convince. And i didnt want him to think that was the case.

We recently had a talk about a dating app where we had met. She said she recently deleted the app. I said I would that upcoming week. 

I had not gone any dates with anyone else since meeting my GF. I still was using the app to swipe and the occasional casual conversation.

A day after that date I had a conversation with a woman who I was convinced was a catfish. Her pics looked too good to be true. I had encountered similar fake profiles on this app (usually they ask to talk on snapchat, red flag). I told this woman I was single, open to anything, because I truly thought she was a catfish and I would report her account once she gave me her Snapchat. 

Well, the day after that convo my GF tells me she wants to swing by my home to drop off a gift for me and my parents. (Currently staying with them.) She makes a point to act as if everything is just swell via text. 

She shows up and shows my parents and me the convo with the woman. Turns out this 'fake' account is actually friends with my GF. She yells for less than a minute and storms out. 

We have a brief convo outside but I was too flustered to really explain it all. She says she needs time and space.

She leaves and I feel horrible of course. But after some time thinking about it I feel quite perplexed by her decision to lie to me in order to expose me in front of my parents. My parents and friends all say this is a red flag and I should no longer entertain the idea of seeing her (if she is open to it). I tend to agree but would like to what others think. Personally I just feel she could have handled the situation so much better (text me, call me, ask to speak in person). There was no need to lie to me and confront me in front of my parents.

i redownloaded tinder yesterday, which is actually something i try not to do after a breakup because obviously it’s fresh and i haven’t had time to process it but in all honesty, i knew my ex would break up with me. i would’ve never left him due to my own attachment problems (which is toxic in itself) but i truly did love him and always wanted to see the good in him, despite everything. and i was broken up with him once and wholeheartedly grieved the first year and 6 months we were dating that time around, so now i’m just grieving the last three months. but it’s different, since he flat out told me he pretty much only loved me when it was convenient for him, and he called it a very selfish kind of love on his end. and i think he is a narcissist, so there isn’t anything i could’ve done. 

anyway, i began talking to a man on tinder all day yesterday who i think is kind and interested in what i have to say and can hold an entertaining conversation. admittedly, it’s nice to have a cute boy be nice to me right now. i have been very open about my personal boundaries regarding pacing and sex and he hasn’t had any issues and is pretty much in the same boat as me. but now i think we’re gonna fall in love and have this beautiful relationship literally a day into talking. i have no idea who this person is and what red flags are there, yet i’m already eager to hang out with him and see where it goes. i do want to be in a relationship. i very much want to love and be loved and i have worked so hard to get myself where i am today, which is far more mentally stable and healthy than i was a few months ago, so i feel like i could handle it. 

i guess what i’m asking is, men and women who are like this, what do you do to slow your brain down during instances like these? am i crazy for all of this and am i just tricking myself into thinking i’m okay? 

any and all advice is appreciated!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158564,public,self,how do i stop romanticizing the future with the first man who’s kind and interested in me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/squwdx/how_do_i_stop_romanticizing_the_future_with_the/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

We ended up talking longer than we should have and were late to the movie theater so they didn’t let us in, so we went to a park and talked more. It was cold so we left and he walked me to the subway and gave me a hug and said “let me know if you need help with the game, talk soon” I also noticed later he unmatched me but idk if not was before or after we met.

A couple hours after i texted him and said “i know things didn’t go as planned but i still had a nice time! :)” I texted him it late so he responded the next morning and said “i had a nice time as well! it was nice getting to know you :)” then i said it was nice to talk to someone who plays the same games i do (idk if that was weird or not but i was trying to not overthink the text i sent him and that’s what i came up with naturally) and he didn’t reply to it. Was that message not meant to have a response or is he probably not interested?

Length of relationship: nearing four months. Nature: Long Distance


I posted earlier on this sub, and a number of others, about how I was having intrusive thoughts about other women, even while thinking about her. I've recovered; it took hard work, but I came up with some strategies to convince myself that those thoughts meant nothing, and that I loved her. I recommend checking the post for a better understanding of how my mind works...if you can figure it out. I can't.

Anyway, I'm making this post for a different problem.

I've been very tense since yesterday, after my girlfriend told me that she couldn't afford to give me more time; she was, until recently, working as a schoolteacher, and is currently in the last semester of an education course. I should also mention that we live in a bit of a regressive society (India), and she finds it very difficult to talk in front of her parents. That's why we facetime whenever we can. Lately, however, she's been finding it somewhat difficult to make time.

To get back to the matter at hand, ever since she said that, I've had a sense of unease; I can feel that something is wrong. In fact, I can physically feel it as a but of a knot in my stomach. (I'm sort of weird; please bear with me)

This knot alternately appears and disappears, but something happened last night which made me very unhappy. Late at night (I couldn't sleep), I thought, ""I don't love her"" and the knot eased, and I was both surprised and unhappy.

I've been very confused since then, with the unease omly dissipating on brief occasions when I talk to my girlfriend. Keep in mind that I have discussed the problem with her; after trying, in vain, to resolve it by myself, I decided to talk to her. She listened, and I talked, and I felt better by the end of it. But it still returned after a while. She told me to say the same thing again, and see if it brought relief, but now it doesn't really work anymore.

I'm honestly not sure what is going on. I have a lot of ideas, but none of them lead anywhere. I should mention one very important detail, however: even when we talked or facetimed today, I could tell her, quite normally, that I loved her; it didn't feel forced, and I didn't feel as if I was obligated to say it. Sure, not loving her all of a sudden would call her a great deal of pain, but I DID NOT, at any point, feel that consideration for HER feelings was making me say it, just to avoid hurting her. I could say it aloud, when she did, and it was as easy as it always has been. It's also noteworthy that I always feel better while talking to her.

I honestly don't know what's going on, though. Sometimes, I say, dispassionately, that I don't love her, and feel nothing; at the same time, just to experiment, I tell myself that I love her, and also feel nothing. I think of her laughter, and her habits and nature, and they make me smile as they always have, but I still feel uneasy.

I said that I had some ideas about what was going on: the first is that the honeymoon phase wore off when she said that she couldn't make more time, and my mind can't process why I've suddenly stopped being giddy and head over heels all the time. What supports this theory is that my love, for the duration of this relationship, has been very passionate; hell, we've been sending each other gifts every month. Maybe it's gotten lukewarm, and my mind can't understand why, which is why it's making me uncomfortable? Maybe my idea of love is only what I've been used to so far, and now that it's stopped, I think that I'm not in love, when in fact I am, but in a different way?
(Note: sexual desire for her is through the roof. We haven't sexted in a while, since I told her to put it on hold while I was having the intrusive thoughts I mentioned earlier)

The second idea I have is a very depressing one: maybe I've actually stopped loving her, but don't realise it? But how could that be possible? I've said before that saying the words doesn't feel forced. I should also mention now that I feel distressed at the thought of causing her pain; yesterday, we were discussing her parents, and she started crying, and I felt the same pity and agony I've always felt for her. And if I still feel so happy when we talk to each other, and laugh and smile and say how much we love each other, then why am I so uneasy when she isn't there?

The third idea is perhaps the most obvious: I just fucking miss her. We last met in the second week of November, and haven't seen each other since. I've tried my best to be as patient as possible, but there have been periods when I've expressed my frustration at not being able to touch her. Maybe I've gotten a little fucking tired? But why would that translate to worrying about not loving her? And why would I feel relieved at the thought all of a sudden, when so far my relationship has gone so well?
That's what worries me the most: there's literally nothing to have caused this all of a sudden. The most she said was that she couldn't afford more time, and she's absolutely right; I understand. I know that circumstances are difficult. But to think that I don't love her, and to feel THIS UNEASY...that's disproportionate. And I do love her. It's so easy to say it to her.

The fourth idea: maybe the relationship isn't going as well as I'd like it to? I don't know. I've also considered the possibility that I might be burnt out from emotions; the last week has, owing to the intrusive thoughts I mentioned earlier, has been especially rocky. She's been constantly supportive, however, and I love her for that. Maybe I'm just...emotionally burnt out? I don't know if that's even a thing.

Look, what worries me is that all this happened in the course of a single fucking day. How is that even possible? I went to bed on Thursday worrying about cheating on her, and on Friday, after I'd recovered a bit...I suddenly didn't love her after she said that she couldn't make time for it? That's my major problem with the thought: you can't switch love off like that. And there's still the fact that I'm perfectly in love, although still a little uneasy, when I'm talking to my girlfriend.

I'm sorry for the long post, but can someone help? My girlfriend asked if I wanted a break to think things over, but I wasn't sure. On one hand, nothing has happened to warrant this. On the other, I'm still a little uneasy. The knot in my stomach hasn't eased.

And if it's any help, I'm surprised at how calmly I'm taking the situation. I tried being distressed, as I've always been at the prospect of breaking up with her, but it didn't work. I don't mean to say that I feel numb; I just feel calm, although nonplussed. I'm...confused. I don't know what to do. The idea of breaking up doesn't bring me to tears, but it doesn't make me feel especially happy, either. Why the fuck am I so calm? I should feel unhappy, terrified of losing her. But instead...I don't even know how I'm feeling. I don't know what I'm thinking.
