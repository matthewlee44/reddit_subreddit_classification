1,r44cjp,1638106206,Anything I could have done better?," 

Dear community,

me (27F) dated for 3-4 months a person (30M) that is active in the military. He moved recently to CA, where I live. We met between 1-3 times a week and things were going steadily. I never have been before with someone in the military, so that life was unknown to me. Long working hours, etc. but don't have a problem with it.  
However, after a few dates, he told me he has PTSD, depression, and anxiety but I should not worry because that is his problem. I saw sometimes how he changed from one second to another, from being cheerful to very sad. In the last weeks, the communication went less and less, and I finally asked him what is going on. He answered he has too much to deal with in his life (job and other problems) that he can't give me the attention I deserve.  
I was always consistent, honest but also have my own life (so was never clingy).  
Did I do something wrong here?

There were some issues that made me doubt: 

\- His low self-esteem, he was always doubting himself and putting many things in a negative light.

\- He wants to make a career in the military, which would mean moving every few years and likely putting my own career aside.  

Have you had a similar experience or any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r44cjp/anything_i_could_have_done_better/

3,r44idj,1638106735,"Ladies: How do you know when someone is an ""Alpha Male""?","I (39M) was on a first date last night, and at one point as we start to talk about dating in general she (40F) mentions that she is into doms, and can even spot a ""fake dom"" from a ""real dom"", and then says she is really only attracted to ""alpha male"" personality types. 

In retrospect I should have followed up with her at that moment and asked specifically how she could tell when someone is an alpha male, or how she can tell if someone is a dom from a conversation (or even what the difference between a fake dome and a real dom is), but honestly in the moment the comment just really irked me. I get that we all have preferences and types that we like, but saying it out loud to the person you are out with just seems like drawing a box and saying ""either get in this box or I won't be interested in you."" It would be like if I said ""Well I tend to only be attracted to women who sleep with me on the first date...."" . So rather than follow up on it I just let the conversation keep going in a different direction.

But after a night of thinking it over, it really does have me wondering, how does a woman tell if a guy is an ""alpha male""? Especially in the current climate where being potentially controlling can be seen as an extreme negative and a red flag that boundaries won't be respected?

As far as myself, I wouldn't say I'm ""beta"".. I'm not a pushover, I stand up for myself and my opinions and communicate openly about what I want, I am not timid.. but I'm also not forceful or controlling, I'm pretty flexible and ""go with the flow"" at times, and especially with the social climate of the fourth wave feminism period we are in I tend to maybe be even deferential to the woman on a date (things like choosing where to meet, what activity she's inclined to do, etc) to make sure that she's comfortable with everything we are doing/is going on.

And no, the date didn't go anywhere. It was actually probably the fastest first date I've ever had, two drinks over an hour and a half and then we left and went our separate ways. Nothing really bad happened (I don't think), there just really wasn't much of any chemistry or connection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r44idj/ladies_how_do_you_know_when_someone_is_an_alpha/

11,r450sg,1638108319,I have social anxiety with girls. Please help,"  I have social anxiety with girls, especially with those who I find attractive. I am 20 years old guy who never had a girlfriend and have almost no experience with girls. I am good looking, smart, and a really ambitious guy (I am the straight opposite of so-called ""needy"" guy but when it comes to interacting with girls I cant show my self and I think I seem to them like the really awkward guy )and can talk with my friends or other people about any topic with ease very naturally but when it comes to girls especially girls who I like I can't speak a word properly and feel super awkward and nervous.

I somehow know where is this coming from. Throughout school, I was in a really toxic environment. My classmates would make fun of people who spoke with girls and they were really judgemental. I think this had a really big negative impact on me.

Now, I am really self-conscious in social situations and I cant approach the girl I like in front of other people as they were judging me. Even when I am alone with her I do not know what to say and seem really awkward.

Last week I meet that girl who I thought was cute at work. I started talking with her a little bit at lunch. Then the next day I meet her again and said hi and smiled she smiled back. I felt like she was also into me. But another day, when she was sitting alone I gathered all my courage and decided to ask her out. I was so nervous and didn't really know what to say and I could feel that she was feeling that nervousness. Although I got her number and asked her out it was really kinda unnatural, she said she was not sure. During the week when I bumped into her at work a couple of times I wanted to say something but I really did not know how to behave and what to say and I am sure that it seemed really awkward. Yesterday I texted her asking her out but she said she had something to do, and when I proposed another date she made an excuse again. I am pretty much sure that I acted like a ""needy"" guy although I am a pretty good guy with my own goals and ambition but I think my interaction with her killed all her attraction to me. Although her rejection hurts me, the most painful thing for me was my inability to interact with girls properly at my age. Especially in front of other people I cant do anything. It seems to me everyone is judging me. 

I am so sorry for this long text, but I want to get feedback from people who went through this kind of situation or just from people who have more experience. What can I do to improve my social skills especially with girls I like. Any advice will be appreciated.

14,r45hvn,1638109745,(25f) Awkward Start of getting to know someone/Now what?," So I’ve know this guy(35m) for 3 years. We mainly had a sexual relationship from the very beginning. We met at a musical festival, and instantly hit it off. We’re making good conversation, I’m a bit tipsy and have my friends with me. As we go on and making jokes with one another He then starts asking for my number or social media. We exchange fb info and our personal numbers. Shortly after He needed to be somewhere and had to leave early, and mentioned he also didn’t want to bug or impede with my friends and the music event. Which made sense, I respected and appreciated that. After about a week of meeting each other he starts messaging me asking me how I’m doing, telling me he was so happy to meet me and that he’d like to hang out the coming weekend or the next if possible. I said yes this coming weekend would work perfectly based on my schedule and such. 

Well I didn’t expect him to get straight down to the dirty in the bedroom when we first hung out…….but I also didn’t mind it. As I was going through a lot in my life at that time, and who doesn’t like being desired like you are some delicious cake? It felt nice to be desired in that way, especially shortly after I came out of a long term relationship. Let’s just say, it easily got super steamy, and passionate! And bang, he was now the best I ever had! With great size, lion personality, the sexy hot looks, and a huge heart to show for it all. After the first time, ooooh damn, I couldn’t get enough of this guy! Annnd I hated that fact because obviously I didn’t want to look desperate….

Anyways, shortly after our first time together a few weeks passed by and it was getting closer to the busy holiday season- which ofc people get lonely around this time and i obv wanted more of him! So the SECOND time we hung out, I was the one that initiated and he was completely happy about saying yes and inviting me over. This time around we did more than the last time, and we did it longer too, with multiple rounds! It felt like a half-night marathon! It was fantastic! From this point in time we have talked more, texted more and have had a couple phone conversations. This lead me to believe he was perfect dating material and I actually see a future relationship with this person. We seem to have similarities in personality, despite the ten year age gap. But we can’t ignore the fact that there’s great chemistry. Of course the universe wasn’t on my side for this steamy romance; the worst news came to light and he was telling me he plans to move to the east side of the state because of his new job offer, which was a middle school teaching position in his home town! Of course I was happy for him. It’s always a huge accomplishment starting your new career, it’s rather thrilling as well. Okay okay, if I’m being honest, I was also very sad to hear he was permanently moving 5 hours away. 
This of course meant that there were going to be less frequent visits with each other, but we could still occasionally see one another if one had time to drive over for the weekends. Luckily he still had a part time job (the bar down town from where I lived), which made it convenient for us to see each other, On the days he was in town to do weekend jobs. This leads me the third-and-forth time we hung out. 


The THIRD time we hung out he was the one that initiated and asked if I wanted to go see a movie the night he gets into town. I said yes, and he payed for everything(despite my offer to pay half). After the movie he brought/invited me back to his place and I ended up sleeping over again. YES, it was as steamy as all the other times. (And Yes he was still paying for the place in the west until the lease was officially over).
The forth time played out similar to the third. 
  
About 3-4 days after seeing each other last he gets a call from me crying about some issue I am having with my ex(baby daddy) and that there’s some hostile exchange of emotions between the two of us based on my dating actions and how it’s unfair for me to go out and date while we are still living together. (Of course living together was our only option at the time, based on financial reasons). Let’s just say, we both were still grieving over our 5 year relationship break up. This occasionally made it complex and toxic to be around each other. Welp, from there the guy I really liked and was still technically dating, had nothing but understanding and supporting words to say. At this time In the phone conversation I instantly felt guilty for even calling him about the issue. 

We still talked for about a month or so after that phone call. But than he started getting more busy and I started getting more busy and eventually I applied for college out of state and moved about 5 states away…. In this process I got back with my ex to try to make our girls happy and attempt to build a happier Family than the dynamics before. 
1 year later we open our bedroom to add excitement to our relationship. This was a rather thrilling change on both parts. He found a few women that he really liked I found a couple guys I enjoyed, eventually this made us want to do threesomes and swinging. This eventually lead him wanting me to be extra pleasured by the guy I was seeing before we  got back together.(Mainly because he was always on Business trips and he wanted to ensure I was getting everything I needed physically until he got back home) 
So he flys me to Oregon to see mister steamy for a few days.  This goes over well- I’m happy and I’m satisfied and I go back home. In the course of the next year or so we mainly did this with people we knew in state. Than this year right before Halloween, my partner flys me up again to stay with mr.steamy and this time our chemistry only grew stronger. I tried ignoring this as much as possible because I didn’t want to fall for another guy and because I loved my partner….


All that brings us to today. Currently my partner and I are broken up…We both realized that this was going to happen eventually simply because the lack of meeting each other’s wants and needs in the relationship… some jealousy was felt, unhealthy communication was at hand, busy schedules got busier(On both parties), and lack of self-awareness was all contributors of the break up, so I believe.  (Another major reason why we weren’t working out was because I wanted a polyamorous relationship and he wanted to close-the relationship based off jealousy and uncomfortability.) And sure it hurts me we didn’t work out especially over these types of circumstances. But at the same time I feel more like myself since the break up. 

This brings me to the question I’m always asking myself. 

What do I do next?!

I’m obviously going to focus on Me, my Masters degree, our kids and rebuilding who I am as a person, as well as working on gaining independence again. 

But is it wrong for me to want Mr.Steamy?! As a long term FWB or even possibly a committed partner if that’s what we both decided on? HELP I REALLY DON’T WHATS GOTTEN INTO ME LATELY!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r45hvn/25f_awkward_start_of_getting_to_know_someonenow/

I asked to DTR bc it felt like we needed to decide where this was going since it was getting longer that we were seeing each other. He’s not in a place to take on a serious relationship, so we stopped seeing each other (more of a timing thing, the sentence makes it seem like he strung me along, but there were various factors that contributed to this decision).

It’s been a little over a month now and I feel like I’ve had my time to wallow and started dipping my toes back into dating. I’m wondering when/if to reach out back to him to open the communication line again. 

When we were talking &amp; breaking things off, he suggested friendship and I said I couldn’t do that rn since it was so fresh and I needed time to remove myself from seeing him as a partner. Now I feel like I’m ready to have him back in my life as a friend, I genuinely don’t think we’ll ever date again, but I do miss his friendship. 

The other hard part is the holidays. I think he’s going back home soon for a while, so idk if it would be dumb to open communication again, then both of us be preoccupied with fam time and holiday things - so maybe I wait until the new year to initiate? All I was going to ask is if he wanted to catch up over coffee as friends.

I’ve talked to some friends about this and some think it’s too soon whereas others say everyone is on different timelines/you know yourself best. I know there is a camp of people who believe you can’t be friends with an ex and say to leave it, but I’m not so sure.

I can go out to events, bars etc. but I can’t approach women or try to make small talk to anything because I think I’m too facially unattractive to do so. 

Certain people have said it’s in my head because I’m actually handsome but I also don’t have any experience of talking to women at bars because I’ve never approached since I always assumed I’m just too ugly. 

Now that I’m getting older. I want to just go out and have fun and talk to people. But I get anxiety and panic when some of my friends tell me to go and approach a woman that’s standing at the bar. I’d love to but I just think a lot of the time they’re too attractive. I’d say 90% of the women i see at bars are too attractive and I’m just too ugly to approach them. 

So I have this horrible issue where I can’t approach because I feel I’m too ugly. And I can’t get better at talking to women unless I approach. But I have no experience and need experience but I’m too ugly to even talk to them. 

Has anyone ever had an issue like this before? I feel like the longer I keep thinking I’m ugly and not taking the shot. The worse the outcome is being.

23,r46qup,1638113243,My ex and I broke up and now I cant get my confidence back.,"Hello Reddit.

I am an 18M in senior year of highschool. My ex and i broke up about a year ago and we had dated for a year before the breakup. We met through the grocery store we both worked at. We broke up because she wasn't in a place where she could date and it really killed my self esteem because i thought she just didn't want to spend time around me. (im like the stereotypical nerd in movies)

After we broke up i lost what little confidence i had in myself. I constantly feel lonely and I've been diagnosed and medicated for generalized anxiety disorder and depression.

For some context, i went through a massive amount of trauma in my early teen years which forced me to fully mature at least mentally in my mid teens 15/16.

I think this is why i always am looking for long term, loving relationships. I have been interested in girls since then but when i start talking to them, they never reciprocate and always seem to either ghost me or in some cases move seats in class away from me. This will happen like once a month and than I'll move on a few weeks later to the next person who i develop an interest for.

I find myself watching those cute couple and relationship tiktoks and youtube videos. Essentially i want to have relationships where the person likes/loves me for me and not just because I'll spend hours listening to them cry over facetime like what happened in my previous relationship.

Is it even possible to find what im looking for anymore?  Does Anyone have experience in this area? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It was awesome. We kissed, were feeling really great and ""cute?"". But, when I thought things would get better, he kept ignoring some of my messages, was talking less, never asked me out again (september-november) or flirted. 

In school (he's from my class), he hugged me and was cute with me in the 2 days I went to school (it's online/in-person, so I chose to study online and went in person for those 2 days). Then I stopped going because of personal reasons and the last day I went to school (3 weeks after?) was past week. He was so indifferent and distant, didn't even talk to me, acted like we're not even friends! I even think he was hanging out with a girl idk in lunch time.

I thought we had so much in common, I liked him fr, to the point I'd date him. Now we're just so distant, and it didn't use to be like this.

Gotta get over it. How? I don't have a clue :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r47g3j/hes_acting_so_indifferent_and_cold_even_after_a/

After, we were texting and I asked her what she thought of the restaurant we went to and she replied although that it was good, there is another place she likes. I took that as her subtly asking me out to a second date so I said that I was down and when was a good time for her. Then she said that she’s not sure bc she was busy with finals and other things. 

Was she nicely rejecting me? Did I come off too forward in trying to set up a second date? Was I wrong to assume that she wanted to go on a second date also?

This is my first date since June and it’s making me anxious. I thought things went well but now I get the feeling that she’s not interested

So I finally went out to this club/party event for the music I like and it was awesome! It’s crazy how much easier and natural it was to talk to people than I was expecting. I had four people add me on Instagram after that.

Im actually trying to make friends and find a group, so I approached dudes too and they we’re so chill about it. I was dancing with a group of men and women and just handed the one dude my phone with the Instagram search and was like seems like you got a good group of people here! And he was stoked! Now we’re DMing about concerts and other local events.

I had another women start dancing with me and talking about shows and shit too. She asked for my snap but I’m not 19 so I gave her my Insta.

Then another girl was watching me like 10 feet away. She came up to me and yelled over the music “you look adorable!” And then just went on her way. I know some people would be annoyed she didn’t stop, but to me it just made the compliment even more genuine. 

Also had a girl at the bar make conversation while I was getting drinks. Didn’t get any contact info, but again, just nice to know I’m capable of socializing and I’m approachable.

I already mentioned how I look (maybe 7/10 face) and I was wearing a sick jacket. 

Even the photographer was like nice jacket! Can I get a pic?

I was so worried it would be too loud or awkward, but it was great! 10/10 experience.

My advice: go somewhere with your specific interest. So much easier to make conversation and find people that are your type that will also find you attractive. Also, I’m sure everyone could tell I was having fun! 

And instead of looking for possible dates or sexual conquests, just be open to connecting with anyone regardless of gender or how attractive they are.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r47nuc/i_went_out_and_socialized_irl/

I called things off, because i wanted a relationship and he didn't. 
Initially i kind of got mad but later clarified that I'm not mad at him not wanting a relationship but for leading me on and making me believe that something could happen with the way he would act.

It was the first time we went out one-on-one so she probably could have understood that I want a deeper relationship than just a friendship. We had a great afternoon, we talked a lot, I paid for her lunch and we walked in the city centre.

The day after that I met her again (for other reasons), but we weren't alone except for a few moments. In those moments she mentioned some fun things that happened during the lunch, so that was a confirm that everything went good (if it went bad she probably wouldn't have mentioned it)

After a few days I asked her to have breakfast together in a bar, but she rejected the offer because she wasn't feeling really good those days. I would like to ask her out again maybe for something different, but I don't want to be annoying or sound aggressive. She is pretty shy and I think she probably won't ask me out if I don't start texting first (she is like this with everyone, we have a few common friends).

I (24 F) recently ended a relationship with my boyfriend (35 M) because he was divorced and had two children, and his ex wife was crazy. It's a whole story in and of itself, but the nutshell version is that he kept telling me that the situation would improve between him and the ex, and it continued to get worse because she took an issue with me being around their kids. Both of his kids were spoiled and had serious behavioural issues stemming from the mother trying to alienate them from their father, and it got to the point where I legitimately had enough, and ended the relationship. I saw it going nowhere, and there was NO WAY in hell that I would be able to bring another baby into this mix (I eventually wanted to have children of my own, which he was aware of). 

Now, I feel like I try going out on dates with NORMAL men, men without baggage, decent jobs/families, and then within a couple of weeks, they slow fade me and are not interested. I feel like I am either destined to end up with a loser with baggage, or just alone. And it distracts me from living my life. Focusing on work. Everything.

The last time we spoke there was an argument over the evenings plans (I said about going to the movies, she said about food so I booked a table but I miss-read what she meant and so I got a big angry text message). This was back in June.

Cause i'm a larger lad (a fat F\*\*\* if you will) i've started on a proper diet (posting healthy food pictures on the social medias etc) and hitting the gym more, (7 pounds in a fortnight, go me!) now out of the blue she messaged me last night (6 months after we spoke last) saying ""I miss you.""

Whenever we used to interact this is how it would start, then when deciding what to do I would be the one making all the plans with little or no input from her (unless I get it wrong, see above).

Anyway, I said I was going to the gym this morning and could meet her after, today comes round and now she's decided to put up the Christmas decorations, offered to help but she didn't accept or decline, just dodged by asking if mine were up.

So yeah, I like the girl and i'm pretty sure she likes me, but I don't know how to continue with whatever this is, or whether I should cut my losses and stop talking to her.

PS: She talks to her parents about me (not sure if relevant)

PSS: When were together we both feel relaxed and she laughs at some of the stuff I come out with.

So back at the club, I'm doing my thing, and close to the end of the night, this one guy is super drunk talking to me and acting kinda creepy, so Kelvin swoops in and pushes the guy away. I tell him ""thanks so much, he was being super weird"" and Kelvin is like ""yeah, no problem I got you"". So Kelvin and I start dancing, both having drank a bit, and eventually kissed. Kissing Kelvin made me realize that I was seriously done with my relationship so I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of days later.

2 quick notes: Kelvin knew my ex-boyfriend years before we had gotten together. After the breakup, my ex-bf started stalking and harassing me, and Kelvin was around to see how much it affected me.

Since the night of the club, Kelvin started pursuing me and we hung out for close to 1 year. We would go on dates at least once a month (though he would call them 'outings') and we were almost intimate a few times, but I would tell him no. From what friends and family would tell me, including his sister and his closest friends, Kelvin would talk nonstop about me and would tell them that I was the nicest girl he had ever been around.

Kelvin and I continue hanging out for a few months, and around the fall, Kelvin and I talked about how it would be difficult if we got into a relationship because his friend and my brother were dating. We figured that if they ever broke up and Kelvin and I were together, that it would be too much and we would probably break up anyway from all the drama and stress. 

About a month after, he stayed over at my place one night and I told him that I thought it would be best if we didn't pursue something more serious. I could tell that he was hurt or taken aback because he didn't say much. This is where things took a turn for the worst. Despite the conversations we had about not being together more seriously, Kelvin and I clearly still had a thing for each other, and his friends and family would constantly approach me asking when we would make it official because we would still hang out like normal and people could see how strong our chemistry was.

That November, Kelvin and I went out to lunch like usual and he confessed to me that he had a crush on one of his coworkers, let's call her Brianna, and was going to start pursuing her since we had decided not to move further. To say that hearing that didn't hurt me would be a lie, but I played it cool because he was right. Later that month, he had a get-together at his place to which all of our mutual friends, his sister,, his close coworkers including Brianna and myself were invited. The whole time, Kelvin acted as if I wasn't there and was ALL OVER Brianna - to the point where our mutual friends and his sister approached me asking what the f was wrong with him. He embarrassed me so bad that night,  and his friends were equally puzzled.

After that get-together, Kelvin and I continued hanging out and a few weeks later he told me that Brianna and him decided to remain friends because she wasn't interested in him. We continued spending time together up until about February/March of 2017. 

In March, several of us in our friend group, including myself, had birthdays and we all went out one night. That night, Kelvin and I were hanging out like usual and out of nowhere, I blurted 'f you' at him. He looked at me confused and asked why I said that to him. A few moments later, we got into an argument and I told him how I felt about him embarrassing me at the get-together back in November. During the argument, he apologized and told me that he would be with me in a relationship ""if he wasn't such a f'ed a'hole"".

After that night, he and I hung out one last time where he told me that he couldn't give me 'what I wanted' and that we were better off not trying anymore. Once I heard that, I decided that it was best for me to move on and we never really saw each other again except once at an event that summer but we didn't really speak. I ended blocking him on social media.

After all of that, in addition to other things, I went to therapy and worked on a lot of things. One thing that therapy helped me with was communicating more effectively. Since then, I kept having this urge to reconnect with Kelvin to smooth things over and let go of any grudges. I eventually reconnected with him earlier this year, and told him that I was sorry for everything and would love to speak with him either over phone or in person. He thanked me profusely for reaching out and agreed to meet up, but leading up to the day we agreed to meet, he left me on read and we haven't been in touch since.

I did see that he moved on and I fell in love again a few years ago. My motivation for reconnecting with him wasn't to try rekindling anything, but rather to sincerely move past what happened and be on better terms. It does hurt that we fell into such a dark place over a misunderstanding/miscommunication, and that we didn't even get a chance to talk things out.

I'd love to hear any thoughts about the possible reasons for his behavior, and how I can come to accept that I may never get to talk things out with him. &lt;3",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r49oe1/i_would_be_with_you_if_i_wasnt_an_ahole/

One year ago today, I posted on Reddit that I had come to the realization that I was falling for someone, and I didn't know how to handle it. I was seeing a therapist to help deal with my intimacy issues, and I was still very very unsure if I could handle being rejected by him, because that's happened before where I misunderstood their intentions and their feelings towards me. As I was writing the post, I realized that all I wanted was for him to read the post. So I finished writing it, called one of my girlfriends, sobbed uncontrollably for 10 minutes trying to work up the nerve to call him, and then I called him. I asked him to read what I had written , and call me back. 20 minutes later, he called me back and told me that he was feeling the same way. He came over to my place, we spent the rest of the day together, and we've been dating ever since.

Yesterday we celebrated our one-year anniversary. This is the happiest, healthiest, and most loving relationship I've ever had. It's not perfect, but he is perfect for me in so many ways. He is a loving friend, Father, partner, and we share so many of the same interests while still being able to have our own distinct life and identity. I feel so blessed and so lucky to have been able to spend the last year with somebody who makes me feel so safe and so loved and appreciated. I just wanted to share that this subreddit definitely helped me get here, because I wouldn't have been able to tell him without its help.

59,r4a7te,1638122513,I got confirmation that I ruined things with a guy who really liked me 2 years ago,"Two years ago I was talking to a guy that I met on tinder. We had really good chemistry over text and on the date we went on. He lived an hour away and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone, but that there was something about me. 

He was a really attractive, talented guy, and he told me that he was falling for me, obsessed with me, and could see himself spending his life with me. I mentioned before that all the first dates I've gone on before haven't led to a second, and he said that maybe that's because they weren't as smart as me and that he might be my perfect match. Things didn't work out between us and we stopped talking after a few weeks. He was very sexual from our first conversation, and told me after our first date that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be dating if it was good. I told him that I don't want to have sex with someone that I only knew for around a few weeks and he said that we should go our separate ways. 

I got a little clingy when he said that. I was afraid to lose this guy who liked me so much, and I begged him to give me another chance. He said that I was acting crazy and that I made him lose all those feelings that he had for me, and that he might be able to get them back if he could have sex with me. I told him that I still didn't want to have sex with someone that I didn't know that well, and he said that I was being stubborn, and we stopped talking. 

I've been struggling to move past this since it happened, going back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me, to feeling like I ruined things with this guy that could see himself spending his life with me and who could be my perfect match. 

I messaged him recently and asked if he actually felt all those feelings or he was just trying to sleep with me, and he confirmed that he really did like me at first but I ruined it. It's been confirmed, and I feel like shit for ruining things with this guy. He was the only one who was as smart as me and my might've been my perfect match, and I've lost him forever.

62,r4ax9j,1638124332,How to start dating after college with no experience?," TLDR: Quiet, introverted guy who failed at the college dating scene, and has been rejected his entire life, is trying to find ways to start dating.

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that crowd (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

66,r4b9wb,1638125249,We have a communication /intimacy issue. Do you have some advise?,"
I am a 21-year-old woman. I don't have a lot of experience. I have been on dates and I have had one relationship that lasted a year. I have never had sex.

Last may, I met a guy online and we have been dating since July. He is 22 years old and he does not have a lot of experience. He has never been in a relationship and I have feeling that he is also virgin, because he is very shy and told me that it takes him a while before he feels comfortable with someone.

The dates have been lovely. We have talked about our interests, serious topics etc. The thing is that we haven't gone any further. We haven't kissed or anything. I have been afraid to make the first move because he is so shy and introverted even though he has told me that he feels comfortable near me. I don't want to hurt him or rush him. I feel like this also bothers him. We have talked about the fact that we both feel pressure to be more intimate, but  I have -since he struggles with that- told him that we don't have to rush. We have time. I just did not think it would take this long. I want to at least kiss him, because I feel like intimacy helps with getting a deeper connection. Right now, it just feels like we are good friends. 

There is another thing that has been bothering me. A couple of weeks/months ago we were talking in his car and I told him that I was still using the dating app lowkey simply because we weren't (and aren't still) exclusive/offical yet. He reacted surprised and told me that he does still have the app but that he doesn't use it anymore unless he gets a push message. He must have forgotten that I -because I still use the app- can see when he has been online. I am not stalking him or anything but it does bother me that he can't be honest. Why not say that you are still using the app? We are not exclusive (yet). Do you think he was being dishonest or it is indeed push messages?

I am someone who tends to overthink and I crave clarity/proper communication. What do you think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4b9wb/we_have_a_communication_intimacy_issue_do_you/
67,r4bcq0,1638125456,How to date online (my opinion),"I’m a guy and would say this advice is mostly for guys but at the same girls might be able to take something from it. 

Been seeing a lot of people complaining at the moment so thought I would share my strategy I have developed over the time I used old. 

This advice is for if you are looking for something serious btw. 

So first off you get an initial match. In my opinion you should be asking for a social as soon as the first conversation comes to a natural end. Almost use it as a segway. Like “yeah I like zebras too, what’s your number?” 

This is personal preference but instead of a number I prefer an Instagram. Reasons, easier to spot a catfish. You can get a better look at who they really are etc. it’s my personal preference so just do you. 

If they are willing to give a social/number it tells you that they are at least partially interested. 

The next step is to ask them on a date. 

Personally I believe that 3 days of talking is optimal.  But I would say just go with the flow of conversation. Also note that the date could be whenever. Could be the next day or could be two weeks away. 

If they agree to go on a date then it answers the question if they are interested or not. Obviously there is risks of cancellation and all that but you know at that given moment that they are somewhat interested. 

I would also suggest asking mid day/early evening people are more likely to agree something late at night and then realise in the morning that they are actually not interested. 

When you get a date confirmed simply for to it. Keep conversation light. Don’t get too invested and have a good time. 

This is coming from someone who use to want to get to know a girl a bit more before meeting them however it is so much easier mentally this way. You don’t get attached to anyone that isn’t serious about dating. I’ve saved a tonne of time speaking to only serious people as the people that are not serious just cull themselves. 

My number one rule is don’t get too invested. You can easily think that a person is perfect for you based on interests/philosophy of life but what I find it comes down to is the vibe. Are you attracted to the vibe of the other person? You will only know that when you meet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4bcq0/how_to_date_online_my_opinion/

69,r4btww,1638126716,I tried to cheat on my girlfriend and lied about porn when she asked me to stop to help her get over the cheating.,"I (22M) recently began living with my girlfriend (21F). I thought I loved her before then, but damn was I wrong. I fell so hard for this woman. She is just so genuine and sweet, helpful, kind, smart, goofy as hell, and I just can’t fathom losing her. About 2 weeks ago, she went through my old phone. I don’t remember doing it, but evidently I tried to cheat on her and searched for hookers near me.

I apologized to her and talked it over. After a little bit, she was feeling a bit better but self conscious, understandably, and she asked me to not watch porn for a little while so I could focus on making her feel attractive/wanted. I don’t want to say I’m addicted to it, but it is very difficult for me to stop. When I watch it I don’t even like it, and when I’m done I feel like shit. I had done well though so far. About 3 weeks into living with each other and I only had once after a particularly horrible day at a new job.

I wanted to stop for years now and it was a lot easier now, so I said I agreed. A few days later though, I smoked a little bit and was feeling sad and that’s usually what makes me want to. So I watched it. A few days after that she asked me if I had watched porn since she asked me not to. I knew if I told her I did it would hurt her, so I lied and told her I didn’t. 

She had went through my phone though (I told her before any of this that she freely could because I really didn’t remember the attempt at cheating so no she wasn’t being nosey she was doing something I gave her permission to do). When she did, she found I had lied about the porn, and found even more from the cheating thing from a time before that was pretty early in our relationship. 

One she found just looked very bad and wasn’t cheating. After seeing it I recognized the account (Seeking arrangements). Fresh and Fit were found on it and Aba and Preach said it was going against what fresh and fit preach, which is how to be desired by women but keep your self respect. I loved both channels. I didn’t grow up with much of a father figure so learning how to be a man from them helped me a lot. I wanted to see which was telling the truth so I made an account, saw aba and preach were telling the truth, did nothing beyond that on the site, and unsubbed from fresh and fit. 

The issue is that is a really hard story to believe, even when dates for the videos and the account line up along with my YouTube watchlist. What made it even harder is I apparently went for Ashley Madison and several other hookup/affair sites at the time. I do not know why I have these accounts. I literally never used them, but having them ruined things. We are now broke up, but still living together. 

I have no intention of seeing others, and neither does she. She has my heart. Even if she didn’t in the past, she does now. I am going to try to get her to take me back after I get over the porn thing, but I don’t think she will take me back and honestly I don’t want advice on that. I just want to show her she is still loved. I am going to show her in every way possible so she doesn’t have to feel the feeling of being unloved again, but I will eventually have to repeat ideas so I would like some ideas from everywhere else. 

Please don’t tell me how horrible I am btw. I know I fucked up and I fucked it real bad. I don’t plan on trying to convince her to take me back until I get over the porn. Please help me help her. She deserves it more than anybody right now.

TL;DR - Tried to cheat on my girlfriend. Lied about porn when she asked me to stop to help her get over the cheating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4btww/i_tried_to_cheat_on_my_girlfriend_and_lied_about/

We end up staying up and talking almost all nights with the communication ranging from our work, pop culture, politics everything.

We are pretty similar in terms of ambition and general beliefs but i have noticed he can be a little sexist. Not going into details we recently had an argument over the Brock turner case and he was of the opinion that a mans career is more important than a crime against women?

76,r4cez1,1638128300,WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THIS?? CONFUSED!,"I've been talking to this guy for 2 months.
And earlier he told me that I should keep my options open when finding a good man during our talking stage. And he said that he doesn't want me to ""wait"" for him. Ever.

I told him that he doesn't have to mind me when it comes to this because I know when to let a man inside my life and that's not easy for me. I only talk to one guy at a time.

And I told him that if he thinks he should do it, then he can. Totally. But he told me that it's not easy for him to let a girl in as well.

So I asked him to go straight to the point. I'm confused because it feels like he's very into me. He updates me with his daily life, he confides in me, he's the one who keeps the conversation going, we talk a lot, we sometimes spend 3hrs in a video call. just earlier, he kept sending me videos of his visit to his parents.

He told me that he drank too much. I don't want talking to him whenever he's drunk. But I am really bothered right now. 😒😒

It feels like he just doesn't wanna hurt me because I'm a sweet girl who doesn't know how to get mad (I'm sorry I need to say this 😂)

Btw, we are 10k miles away from each other. So we haven't met yet but we talked about him coming here. Though there's no concrete plan yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4cez1/what_does_he_mean_by_this_confused/

Also if you get triggered by BAD grammar than I suggest you don't read ( not necessarily mean I'm not going to try) it's just I didn't pay attention in English. 


Earlier  this year meet this girl on OKcupid... yes I said girl cause she was 20 yrs old I believe. She already has a kid mind you. Normally I don't really care about woman having kids simply because now a days it's pretty common to run into a single mother. But yeah I meet her on OKcupid, I wasn't blown away by her looks or anything. She only had selfies on her profile. She was OK at best, but I try not to be shallow and dismiss her solely based on looks, I gave her a chance.

 At first there were a ton of red flags we rarely talked on the phone, needless to say never video chatted, you know normal catfish vibes. But something told me ""she may not necessarily be a catfish, but she is definitely hiding something"". About a month later we meet in person and um... well she was the person in her pictures, but the pictures were a little miss leading and she was extremely malnourished it seemed. Before I get into my thoughts about her I just want to say overall she was a very nice girl, kind hearted and means well. 

First sight I knew sexual chemistry wasn't going to be there. Like I said face okay! body? Mmm she maybe weighed 60 lbs wet. I consider myself (fit). I like my woman fit, with a nice physic, and curves to her. She had the body of a dike respecfully. I didn't want to leave her and disrespect her or anything, we spent the weekend together getting to know her. Decent girl, so I decided okay fine let's give it a shot. She lived in GA I live in NC so we always didn't see each other but she'd drive to NC every now and then. I appreciated that showed effort and determination. Now throughout our time ( dated for 6 months) I never really formed that sexually chemistry with her, I think she sensed that. What she did was what really drove me to leave her.

Never have I ever asked a girl to buy me anything, and i mean anything. When the xbox series X/S came out I mentioned it couple times didn't think anything of it. Week later she claimed she bought it and it's on its way, me being in surprised and excited but also skeptical I started to see why I stayed around. Couple weeks go by no xbox, she swear up and down she bought it. I ask to see the receipt... never seen it. So by now I knew she lied but I was over it, but she continued to play alone saying oh the post office or mail carrier lost it 😊 yeah ok. Skip forward a month or so once again I mentioned I wanted to buy a Nissan Titan 21, same exact situation happened now I ended up believing her a little bit. She was so persistent about it. She claimed she made the down payments ( multiple of them) it was custom built, and it was sitting at her house in GA. Told her to send a picture, there was some excuse to why she couldn't. 3 months this truck was an issue after the 3rd month from when she told me about ""buying it"" to when it was ""delivered "" I told her I don't care no more I'm done with you then I broke up with her 

She used material things to keep me around. Even though I'm not materialistic at ALL. Never asked for these things but if you tell you got this stuff for me I expect to see them at first I told her "" no don't buy expensive stuff for me"" but she was hard headed or so I thought. Point is don't always feel obligated to lower your standards. What makes a person ugly is how they treat people and what they do to get what they want.

Since I had two long relationships I (27m), and saw the stories of my friends and of people here on reddit, I came to the conclusion that sleeping with someone too quickly in hopes of generating a long-lasting relationship doesn't work. 

Girls: If a guy won't stick after you tell him to wait, he is obviously bad news anyway.

Guys: If a girl wants to sleep with you too quickly, chances are she will do the same in a couple of months/years with some other guy. 

The key is waiting, but talking about it, and don't make promises you can't keep.

However, seeing her again reignited my interest in her, and I wanted to make sure to make the most of the weekend.

However... my mind just totally blanked. Over the weekend I only managed to establish that she was single, and was unable to delve into any deeper topics or points of conversation. I had her laughing hard at several points, but mostly over superficial stuff. There were several periods of just silence between us.

Looking back at the event, I'm sure I was beyond boring to be with and probably ruined any chances I had with her. Regardless, are there any tips for being more engaging and bringing up deeper topics to talk about without seeming too forward?

When we met I was very depressed. Life was such a struggle and without her support I don't know what would have become of me.
Fast forward to summer 2020 and she broke up with me and has since moved back to her home town. Honestly, it's mostly my fault we broke up, my emotions were very erratic and I definitely had a hard time keeping control of my temper. I often found ways to blame her for a lot of my anger which probably made it very difficult to live with me.

I've since spent the past year working hard on myself. I exercise, quit smoking (something she regularly asked me to do), I've built up my social circles and I'm back at school studying a PhD, I'm truly happy (most days), and most importantly, I started seeing a therapist (something she would often ask me to do). People I've dated since have even told me how good I am at communicating my feelings.

We're still friends and recently we had a late night talking together on the phone. It was mostly just a catch-up, but eventually I worked up the courage to tell her how speaking with my therapist has helped me gain a better understanding of my emotions and how they relate to some trauma I suffered in my teenage years. I told her how sorry I was for the way I behaved. She started to cry, but in a good way, and told me that she had been spending so much time playing things over in her head, blaming herself and not understanding why I had so much anger inside me. She thanked me many times and it was all very cathartic for both of us.

In a couple of weeks I'll be going to a concert with her. I told her she's welcome to stay at mine that night but she's already booked a hotel instead.
I believe that when a woman has become indifferent to you (in a romantic sense) there's very little that can be done to change her opinion, and I don't want to put her through any more pain than I've already caused. I don't even know how things would work with the distance, and I doubt that she feels the same way as I do. That being said, I truly do believe I've come a long way since we split up and I want to tell her that. I want her to know how I feel about her (even though I expect she already does) and I want her to know how special she is.
