The first couple of years were miserable. I'd go weeks without matches and the overwhelming majority of matches that I got flamed out pretty quickly. Over a two-year period, I had one date and it didn't go anywhere. Since then, I've improved my quality of life outside of OLD, I've optimized my profiles with better pictures and prompts and I'm getting matches daily on all three sites. *HOWEVER*, while I managed to improve my profile to attract more matches, I still struggled to get dates with the women that I matched with... at least until recently. 

**Current Predicament:** So, I decided that I wanted to try to figure out where I was going wrong conversationally with my matches. I read (listened) to some audiobooks, I did some of my own research/ AB testing to see what worked and what didn't work. As a result, I'm seeing an uptick in my dates (I have two this weekend), women are sending me nudes, double and triple texting me, and the results seem to be paying off. The problem is that it is legitimately difficult for me to keep up the persona that women seem to be attracted to over an extended period of time. It is so far away from who I actually am. I'll give you some examples: 

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that women respond favorably to:** 

* Playfully arrogant humor
* negging
* sexually suggestive humor (depending on the site, vibe, and/or rapport) 
* douchey af fake connoisseur vibes 

**Things that will get me immediately unmatched:** 

* Joking about using/producing/selling hard drugs
* Self-deprecating humor
* Really any sort of joke that paints me in a ridiculous light for humorous effect 
* emotional vulnerability 

Here's the thing, I'm not ripping on myself all the time or trying to spill my guts to strangers, but I have lots of friends (men and women) and many of them would probably consider me to be one of their closest friends. I make strong connections with people and people are super comfortable being vulnerable with me and opening up which makes it easier to form meaningful relationships. Part of that is because of my natural tendency to be open, vulnerable, liberal, self-deprecating, non-judgemental, and to not try to out-alpha every guy I meet. So, it's just so counter-intuitive to try to shut all that shit down and to be a totally different person when I'm trying to attract a woman. And, to be clear, I get it. I get that emotional strength, masculinity, and confidence are all attractive qualities in men to women. I want to project those characteristics, but it just seems like there's no room for my more authentic, goofy, self-deprecating, emotionally open and vulnerable self.

I wasn't exactly nice about it though, and I have to admit I kinda overreacted (he was a small little dog, on a leash, and I was saying stuff like ""if he fucking bites me, he's gonna get it"", etc).

Come to find out a day later from one of my coworkers (53F) that she actually used to work at the same place I work now, about 6 months prior to me starting there, and that I also actually made her feel scared for her dog's safety. I felt bad after hearing that, and I decided I should talk to her, so she gave me her phone number for me to do so, which I did later on over text. She responded with forgiveness, which was glad for, but I also decided to just avoid her from then on, just to avoid potentially having another conflict.

Fast forward to a few days ago, my coworker from before, along with another coworker of mine (45M), ran into me after work one day, and they actually proposed to me that I try hanging out with this girl, and also smoking her out (apparently, she doesn't wanna smoke downtown with them at their places because there's cops patrolling, but she and I live out in the rural countryside where the cops very rarely ever come). The lady even offered to incentivize me by baking me a cake, supplying me with weed, etc, and the guy was talking up how I'd be hanging with a cute girl, etc.

I don't know why they were trying so hard to convince me, it sounded like a good idea to me from the start. I decided to take them up on that, and texted her asking if she wanted to get together and do something, and she responded by inviting me to come out with her on her nightly walk with her dog tomorrow. Then shortly afterwards she texted again saying that another coworker of mine (and ex coworker of hers) was coming over for pizza that afternoon, and she invited me over for that as well.

So I spent a couple hours at her place eating pizza and talking story. She mostly talked about her job and moving back into town again after she left, etc, and it was really interesting. She seemed like a pretty cool person, and I'm glad I decided to hit her up. Oh, and she gave me some treats to give her dog, and now he's totally calm with me.  Then after my coworker left, we went out on a walk, and we ended up stopping by at my workplace, where I decided to walk her around and give her a tour (of the outside of course, we didn't break in or anything). After that, I walked home with her and we talked for a little bit more before I petted her dog and gave her a hug goodnight.

I'm sure I'll definitely be hanging out with her again. Only thing is, it really seems to me like my coworkers were/are trying to set us up, like romantically. I'm not really feeling anything like that though, and I'm not getting any signs or signals from her either.

We've gotten to the point where we act like a couple. We get together just about every weekend, we call each other lovey dovey names, he's supposed to be putting up some furniture for me, and he's slept over at my place (only once though cause he got a parking ticket lmao :'D).

Anyway, his birthday is coming up, and I think we'll probably spend it together. I asked him if he had plans with his friends or family, and apparently, he doesn't (which is weird for me since I always spend birthdays with my family and friends but whatever). So, I am planning to take him out where ever he wants to go (my treat), then go back to my place where I will surprise him with a couple of gifts and a tiny cake. This all sounded really sweet and lovely to me.

Then I started wondering, am I doing too much? Will it freak him out if I go through all that trouble when I'm not officially his girlfriend and we have only been seeing each other for 2 months? Some people don't see birthdays as big deals, I know, but I think it's nice to make people feel special sometimes. We don't always get that, so I always try to do extra nice things for birthdays.

I’m 22 right now and girls just don’t like me. I don’t know why. In the last 6 years I have asked out probably 200+ different girls and have been rejected literally every single time. I’ve worked on myself and body so much to try to make myself a good option. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I have a lot of girl friends who have told me that they think I’d be a really good partner and a lot of friends that think I’m fun to be around. But obviously not enough for 1 girl to like me.

So now I’m thinking of just giving up for the next maybe 15 years. I figure in that time some girls may get pregnant or develop some problem or gain a lot of weight or something will happen that’ll make them less desired by other men so they’ll be willing to settle for me.

I’ll also do what I can to make myself financially attractive. I know it’s not ideal to try to find women that are only interested because of money, but since no girls will love me for who I am, I’ll try to make someone love me for my money.

I (21f) have been dating this guy (22m) for exactly one month. We talk everyday, whether through text, call, or in person. We can text and call for upwards of six hours no problem. We are both extroverted, like being active, and are typically the ones to keep conversations thriving. That's about it for our major similarities.

We've spent longer than I'd normally like getting to know one another. I made it clear we need to have a great understanding of each other before we dive into anything serious, even sex. He came out of an abusive relationship 4 months ago, after being hurt for 3 years. She was controlling, and so am I if I don't have someone to point out my faults and tell me I can be wrong. I'm ENTJ-A and he is ESFP-A. Normally, I wouldn't consider these with any weight, but I don't want him falling into the same trap. I  tell him about my concerns occasionally when it comes to mind. He's not worried because he sees me as more self-aware and kind.

Even though sex is off the table, we still cuddle, kiss, and so on. I've had a clear head to see that we have a lot of differences in terms of what we find interesting. He loves all things that induce adrenaline. eSport games, F1 racing, simulation, body building, and electronic music are the big ones. In contrast, I like Single player and social party games, romance and drama, theoretical mathematics, multi-day backpacking expeditions, and yoga. 

All these things make me wonder if we are right for each other. We feel mutual and our conversations can go on effortlessly without needing to talk about hobbies. On the other hand, I worry too great of a difference leads to many missed connections. The first missed connection was last night. I spent about two days, an accumulation of 4 hours, making a playlist of my music taste as requested. I compiled 3 hours and 15 minutes, 48 songs I immensely enjoy and are parts of my life. I placed them in a specific order to tell my life story, to categorize them, and help him transition from one genre to another. I let him know how much dedication I put in and how much excitement I had that he was about to listen to something so personal. 50 minutes pass and he says he's listened to every song. I asked how, and he responded by saying be waits for the beat to drop to decide whether or not it's worth listening to. I noted that most of my songs are heavy into a lyrical story, or about the melodic composition. They don't have beat drops per se. That's when I found he doesn't pay attention to lyrics in songs or the emotion in the instruments. He only cares about the meshing between instrument and vocal sounds. It hurt, but I accepted people find different things in music.

We got along great, grabbed coffee and chatted for 3 hours. Continued talking everyday and eventually went on 6 more dates within a month, including movies, dinner, drink, and even face time calls.

We would hold hands in public, cuddled during movie, but we haven’t gotten to kissing and sex yet since we were taking things slow. 

*So backstory: I was previously engaged for a couple months before breaking it off 6 months ago because ex and I had opposing opinions about wanting kids. Basically, I didn’t want kids yet.*

*Back to the date.* 

We talked briefly about our exes on the 3rd date, so I thought at this point it won’t be too inappropriate to talk about kids and my previous engagement. So at the end of the 5th and 6th date, I asked her what her thoughts are on kids and also mentioned that I was previously engaged. I said I wanted to be honest and I'm open to any questions if she was curious about it. I brought these up on the drive home right before dropping her off. 

Thing is, I was planning on asking my date to be official so I needed to know she was ok with my past. So I held her hand and told her I had something to tell her and I hope it won’t change anything between us. She said she couldn’t relate and needed time to process this info. So I dropped her off and said our goodbyes. Vibe was a little bit awkward so of course I aborted asking her out officially.

She didn’t text me for almost an entire day before replying that she didn’t think it was an issue right now, but she needs time until she’s less busy with work to really think everything through, and that it’s too early since we’re still getting to know each other. (Not sure if that’s her way of saying it's okay or not interested anymore?)

Well we continued to text everyday, but I could feel the dynamic was different. Less flirty, less frequent texts, etc. 2 weeks passed and I casually mentioned if she’s gotten the time to think it through and process my engagement yet, and she replied with “I thought I gave you a good enough answer already”, and that she’s confused and pressured as to what I want from her. Also that my engagement shouldn’t be her problem to deal with when we’re still at the stage of deciding whether to be friends or something more. 

I guess in my mind, I thought we were at the stage of becoming official soon and that sensitive topics like this should be talked about, since we were both looking for something serious.

I just wanted an “OK”, an acknowledgement of my engagement so it doesn’t surprise her one day, but she feels as though I’m trying to dump my baggage on her and that it’s something I’m still holding onto and need to work on. I asked if she was still interested in us and she replies she’s not ready for a relationship right now.

So did I bring up these topics too soon/pushed too hard and scared her off? Or is there a clear miscommunication?

Emotional self wants to msg her and explain things. Logical self is telling me to move on and there’s no recovering. Any way to save the situation?

When we are together we are always laughing, cuddling, sex is amazing, conversations so fulfilling, we do alot for eachother. We are very thoughtful and always helping eachother out.

I know she really loves me from how hard she tries to please me (not just sexual but my needs and doing little things).

So we go on a trip to a cottage with a bunch of my friends. We really are enjoying ourselves. There is this one instance where a group of us are watching a movie together and we'll call him friend A. Friend a is a good friend of mine and he was poking fun of me and getting under my skin. It's bothering me but I don't react or say anything. My girlfriend is laughing to everything he's saying and her full attention is on him. And nothing he says is remotely funny, no body else in the room is laughing. Only her.

She does do this I noticed with people when we are out. She gets sucked into conversations and kind of doesn't acknowledge me and is really polite to the person she's talking to, no problem of course. 

Anyways later on I express my annoyances with friend A to her and say I don't trust him (he has a history of cheating). He also made a very forward comment to my girlfriend infront of me that rang some alarm bells previously that day.She apologizes and says she was just being polite and didn't know it was bothering me. No problem the rest of the trip it was great and she stopped giving him attention when he acted like a clown.

Here's where it gets juicy though. Fast forward about a month and we're invited to a Halloween party at a friends house. My girlfriend goes as a sexy devil in a very revealing costume. Takes like 4 hours to do her makeup really trying to look good. When we get to the party shes already pretty drunk. 

Friend A arrives with his girlfriend and 2 other friends the 6 of us are talking greeting and after a bit I find my girlfriend trying so hard to get friend A to take a picture. He's playfully ignoring her and she keeps screaming his name In a playful way tapping his chest. This bothers me a bit but it's fine I'm being a little insecure but I keep an eye.

Half an hour later I'm talking to a friend and she's next to me AGAIN trying to get friend A's attention for a picture. I was standing there as well as another friend but she insists on trying to get him to take the picture. This time shes laughing and grabbing his arm, he's again ignoring her. 

Another thing to note that friend A's girlfriend was also there and I noticed whenever she wasn't looking they'd lock eyes when my girlfriend was talking to his.

Anyways, I don't say anything, I'm too stoned and a little tipsy but I made sure to make a strong mental note of how I felt and what was happening so next day I could access.

Next day I politely and respectfully call her out. She denies any flirting and says if she was she had no idea. She apologized for the touches and acknowledges that if the reverse was happening it would bother her too and she apologized profusely and says she will no longer touch my friends but again won't say she was flirting. Which is fine I don't expect her to admit that.

Thing is I just can't get over it, it's been like 10 days. I feel like I was betrayed and that our relationship wasn't what I thought it was. She disrespected me and the relationship..

Side note I don't know if this matters. She's been in a relationship before where her partner cheated on her. She was also pretty promiscuous between dating (20 partners, she's 29) she's said she's never cheated with previous boyfriends. I believe her.

Anyway I just don't know how to handle this. How do I get over this or do I even get over it and should I just break things up. Am I being paranoid? I have so much insecurity and it's a challenge trying not to project it on her.

I've been forced into solidarity as my job went remote due to the pandemic and my closest friends moved away for their jobs. In the past two years, I got really good at being alone. I fell into complacency and haven't done much to rectify my lack of social life. I've been going absolutely crazy due to loneliness and have decided to make change. I've tried a couple things here and there including Meetup groups, sports teams, going out to breweries alone, and getting a puppy. I tried dating apps as well but fuck me they absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. Sadly I haven't had much success in making friends or finding a girl to date, so I know I just need to keep working at it and get better at opening up to people I meet. I think at least *trying* to date and meet women might help me overcome some of these challenges. 

I've met exactly one girl in the last two years with whom I was actually interested in, and it was because I ran into her outside my apartment complex with my new puppy. She also had a dog of the same breed, so we immediately had something to break the ice. At the time my confidence was at a low point and some other factors like not knowing whether she was single and that she lives in my building were also holding me back from making a move. Given the prolonged dry spell and loneliness, I became infatuated with her immediately, but I know I'm not just into her because of my lack of friends and dating. I simply find her extremely gorgeous and cool. Unfortunately, we haven't had much of a meaningful conversation because every time I see her I get really nervous, so despite running into each other probably a dozen times at this point, I've done nothing to escalate the relationship because she's been the only prospect I've had in so long, and I'm scared of rejection. On several occasions she gave me explicit opportunities to exchange contact info. First she told me she'd give me her old dog crate since her dog grew out of it. Then she mentioned the idea of a puppy play date when I ran into her and her friend coming back from the park with their dogs. Did I get her number any of these times? Nope.

So while I understand I'm kind of putting all my eggs in one basket here, I'm actively trying to get out there more and adopt more of an abundance mindset, but I cannot let my fear of rejection prevent me from shooting my shot anymore otherwise I'll never find anyone. I think I want to ask her out, but I'm not really sure how because she's a neighbor. I thought it would be good to try to set up something with the doggos as a way to gauge her interest, but now it's raining every day here and it gets dark at like 4PM, so there's not much opportunity for that anymore. So my questions are as follows: How can I best state my intentions without creeping her out or making it awkward if she's not interested? Should I just ask her for a drink date or should I try to push for more platonic activities first so I can see if she's interested? Or should I just not do anything since she lives in my building?

I've  been forced into solidarity as my job went remote due to the pandemic  and my closest friends moved away for their jobs. In the past two years,  I got really good at being alone. I fell into complacency and haven't  done much to rectify my lack of social life. I've been going absolutely  crazy due to loneliness and have decided to make change. I've tried a  couple things here and there including Meetup groups, sports teams,  going out to breweries alone, and getting a puppy. I tried dating apps  as well but fuck me they absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. Sadly I  haven't had much success in making friends or finding a girl to date, so  I know I just need to keep working at it and get better at opening up  to people I meet. I think at least *trying* to date and meet women in the real world might help me overcome some of these challenges.

I've  met exactly one girl in the last two years with whom I was actually  interested in, and it was because I ran into her outside my apartment  complex with my new puppy. She also had a dog of the same breed, so we  immediately had something to break the ice. At the time my confidence  was at a low point and some other factors like not knowing whether she  was single and that she lives in my building were also holding me back  from making a move. Given the prolonged dry spell and loneliness, I  became infatuated with her immediately, but I'm fairly certain I'm not  just into her because of my lack of friends and dating. I really just  find her extremely gorgeous and cool from what I know about her (which  isn't much, frankly). Unfortunately, we haven't had much of a meaningful  conversation because every time I see her I get really nervous, so  despite running into each other probably a dozen times at this point,  I've done nothing to escalate the relationship because she's been the  only prospect I've had in so long, and I'm scared of rejection. On  several occasions she gave me explicit opportunities to exchange contact  info. First she told me she'd give me her old dog crate since her dog  grew out of it. Then she mentioned the idea of a puppy play date when I  ran into her and her friend coming back from the park with their dogs.  Did I get her number any of these times? Nope.

So  while I understand I'm kind of putting all my eggs in one basket here,  I'm actively trying to get out there more and adopt more of an abundance  mindset, but I cannot let my fear of rejection prevent me from shooting  my shot anymore otherwise I'll never find anyone. I think I want to ask  her out, but I'm not really sure how because she's a neighbor. I  thought it would be good to try to set up something with the doggos as a  way to gauge her interest, but now it's raining every day here and it  gets dark at like 4PM, so there's not much opportunity for that anymore.  So my questions are as follows: How can I best state my intentions  without creeping her out or making it awkward if she's not interested?

I’ve been dating this guy for the past couple weeks, we had a good rhythm going and I saw him about 4 times in the space of a week - we both went on holidays and he came back on Wednesday.

We had a cinema night planned with friends but he was too knackered and I ended up not going either.

I invited him for lunch on Sunday, he seemed to be keen about it and accepted my invite.

I then replied I wanted to have lunch and go to the tate to see an exhibition on Sunday, and asked him if he could free up on that day. It’s now been 24h since he replied (a little more) and I’m just asking myself too many questions.

I have anxiety when the men I’m dating take long to reply - we don’t really have a texting relationship but he’s replied quite regularly for the time that I’ve known him.

Today he’s been posting IG stories, IG posts and even looked at my story but not one single reply. 

I feel my anxiety shooting through the roof - I haven’t texted him again bc I don’t want to seem eager. That said it’s quite unusual for me to be that patient, most likely because I like him and I dont want to self sabotage over digital communication, when he’s great at it in real life.

We also haven’t been texting back to back all the time, so I’m trying to understand whether that’s a sign of disinterest on his side.

Even if things are going well, I still feel anxious and believe they'll fall apart in no time.

I went on my first date last year and I went on 3 dates (? maybe not dates) with someone this year and confessed to her. Yet it feels like nothing happens. Everything is and has been stale for a while. The pandemic smacked me after a few months, I went on dating apps and I had some matches here and there (and that's where I got my first date as well). But nothing happens.

I'm a bit lost right now, I'm doing fine in academics, I think I look okay as well (not the best, physically I'm kinda skinny and not really tall tho), I would say I'm funny to be around when I feel comfortable with those around me. But I'm an introvert. I'm going on Erasmus in 2 months and I want that experience to be amazing but I don't know, I can't seem to think positively right now. It's so hard for me to imagine myself succeeding in dating, I just kinda need some advice on how to handle these feelings if anyone has ever had them and maybe some advice on where/how to meet people.

This girl has come into my work a few times. We have a chat about random stuff, as she used to work at another store in the same company but not anymore. Regardless, now she works at a gym (I noticed because she's wearing her uniform). Anyway, at the end of the conversation she looked me dead in the eye and said ""if you come in, I'll give you a mad discount"" in regards to her gym, and I giggled like a school girl and said ""I'll think about it"". 

Its been a couple days and now I'm thinking, hey that's actually not a bad deal because her gym has a sauna and mine doesn't. I use saunas but just pay the upfront fee which is tanking my bread money.

I wanted to vent/give out my story which I wanted to talk about and feel like I need help with, maybe as closure, maybe as reassurance, maybe as logic but I just need help understanding.  


Ok I knew a girl since over a year (it's an internet thing) but since February, I started feeling attracted towards her and around July time, I really felt alot for her, I genuinely liked her alot. So I plucked up the courage to express how I feel towards her, now originally she told me she always saw me as a good friend but later said that she needed to sort herself out, which by then she would consider a relationship with me because I was a nice guy for her etc  


Despite all of this, I never really brought it up again, the occasional flirting here and there from me but nothing heavy. She also shared similar interests as my own such as being a streamer, so I supported her out on her goals and even gave her a birthday gift of getting her a custom art drawing of herself, which she absolutely loved because it contained things that she really liked.  


However, I noticed she would flirt with a few people and even hanged around a guy that she liked in the past, which made me uncomfortable but reassured me that there was nothing going on her end and feelings but she would keep calling him cute to her friends etc while she never really flirted with me at all.  


Recently, I asked her the question of how she felt towards me and the thought of us dating, because she started getting stuff and her life together but it felt like no progress was being made, she refused to answer the question which came across as a red flag to me, so I waited to talk to her properly the very next day, which she wanted to talk to me but in a group environment, which I felt she was avoiding the question in general and a ""avoidant"" way of telling me she wasn't interested as something more than a friend  


So I sent her a very nice letter, saying that I really enjoyed my times with her and I'm not mad or anything at her, but maybe it's best for me to be distant until she tells me how she feels about me/us because the dynamic between us was very confusing, but she could message me on a certain social media platform if she ever needs anything or needs to talk to me about something important. I told her to enjoy her birthday, keep the gift that I gave her but I have to stay away because I internally felt like I was being ""led on"" because she would always avoid flirting/relationship questions that I would occasionally bring up and I feel like it was her of trying to keep me around in a soft manner  


The next day, she joined a stream of a friend of mine (which I was in with even a feature on the title of myself), to which she was acting super nice towards him and another person she barely knew, to the point she asked him to chat in the comment so she can follow him, then she left while being overly friendly with everyone while completely ignoring me (which can be understandable), but I saw that she blocked me on everything while still being friends with my friends.  


So r/dating, why is she acting like this way? Please help me understand because I still think she's a genuine amazing girl, but I needed to respect my own feelings/value.

I've had significant emotional trauma myself from all of my childhood which I've made peace with, so how she acts is not too unfamiliar to me. Some stuff she mentions in passing signals she's emotionally stunted. At the same time, I don't want to waste my time with someone who will never open up to me romantically and emotionally.

I accepted it and about 3 days later she sent me a pic that she took of us the night we met which opened up conversation. I was already not super interested bc the first interaction was bland but i continued the conversation a little just to see if we have any common interests.

She immediately started talking about her ex and how they still live together etc which was already a no from me. Then I opened her message and read it so I could think it over and respond later, but from her perspective I left her on read. She then asked if she was a bad person for talking about her ex. I responded a day or two later reassuring her that she’s not a bad person for that but that it was kind of a lot to vent to a person that she just met. 

At one point she liked literally every single one of my posts on IG In the span of 3 minutes… this was to me a red flag and borderline obsessive/a lack of self awareness.

I tried responding slowly to passively show my disinterest but that unsurprisingly didn’t work.

The other day she was very Frank with me and said something like “I find you attractive. Do you find me attractive? If not I’ll leave you alone” which I haven’t opened yet.

It seems simple as just saying no and ripping the bandaid off but I feel like that’s being mean. I find her kinda cute physically but the interactions on IG turned me off completely. I want to turn her down without hurting her but I also want to let her know why I’m disinterested so she can learn from it? So should I be not passive and tell her “no”?
