I just wanted some advice I've recently started getting friendly/flirty with a work colleague at work she's flirty and sends me some pretty flirty messages. I set up a date in December just before Christmas and she flaked on me on the day of the date and said she didn't feel well ( it could have been a lie but who knows) I didn't see her physically until January as we had both broken up for Christmas holidays but I said to myself ""she obviously isn't in to you ..don't text her now"" so I left it 2 weeks later she reaches out and texts asking how my Christmas was etc I said great etc and keep it short and sweet.

We get back to work in January and she starts flirting via text at work again .. she is always the one instigating this by the way.
A week goes by and we agree to meet and grab a drink at the weekend but she gets covid ..so there is really nothing I can do about that one ..she's off work for about 10 days.

She comes back to work &amp; it starts again we set up a date for last night she tells me the time on Friday we agreed 7pm on the Saturday.
On the actual day of the date I text her about midday saying ""are we still on for tonight ?"" I get nothing back - later on I get myself ready etc Nothing..no txt at all .

Now if this was online dating etc I'd be like fine whatever screw them their loss, but I work with this person and I have to go round helping members of staff should they need help (I work in IT).

Obviously I'm annoyed that she didn't even have the common decency to txt me to let me know she's not coming I would have been fine with that.

Should I txt her today and say ""what gives"" ? Or leave it and not give her the satisfaction? 

Ignoring and being a cold dick at work isn't an option as I could get fired for not being a professional how would you guys deal with this should she need your help at work etc

Even though I had been always thinking that long distance relationship has no change to work, I‚Äôm in one since September.

We met on Mallorca during our vacations and even though we‚Äôre from different states, we decided to try it.

I went there after my breakup to clean my head and I didn‚Äôt want to even date with someone, but yea. It happened. 

The thing is, that my new bf, even though he‚Äôs such a handsome guy and I feel really lucky to have him, he treats me great and I know he really loves me, has also a lot of mental issues. 
I mean, who not. But everything I‚Äôm doing is a problem for him.
I moved to Spain, without any plan, so my life is little bit mess, but I love it. I just started my biggest adventure of my life and everything here is working for me. He lives in the same village his whole life and it‚Äôs hard to imagine for him everything I‚Äôm doing here (but it‚Äôs nothing really crazy, just searching for a work, new flat, I‚Äôm not even hanging out with people that much, because I‚Äôm kinda asocial)

He‚Äôs dramatizing and jealous and every Friday and Sunday he gets drunk and then calling me that he hates his life. 

I really want to help him and I understand him (not that much the part why the hell he‚Äôs getting drunk every week when it‚Äôs only making him feel worse).
 But I also feel like to be in this relationship is just a another big things I have to carry and that‚Äôs kinda stopping me from living my life (yesterday/today at night we had 2 hours call, he was completely fucked Up and I secretly hated him)

We also had a date last week and we both agreed it went well, so we  decided to arrange a second one.

First you need to know a bit about her. During the whole chatting she anwers rarely and short. She hasn't asked a lot of questions. When we met she was a different kind of person. She spoke very much and showed me some trust, but still few questions. I'd say she was pretty nervous (what I could really see) whats the reason because she didn't asked a lot questions and spoke more. After the date we hugged each other and send us a message that the date was great.

As I said few after we arranged our second date on this friday. At thursday we chatted a bit about video-games (she's also into it) and then i send her a message that I look forward to our date tomorrow (in other words though). She answered that she's also looking forward, what gave me a good feeling.

On friday morning (i had to work and she has her day off) I wrote her, if everything is ok with our date. Unfortunately she wrote that she has to postpone it because she has something very important to do for her mother. Stupid how I am, I wrote her if she still wants to see me and if not she should tell me the truth. She said, that she assured that she want to see me again!

After that I asked her if she wants to meet on saturday or sunday, but she declined both (what was pretty obvious because she already told me that when we arranged the second date) and said that she can't say when she has time the next week. In Fact this was also a thing when we're looking for the first date, because she works in retail and has shifts she doesn't know until monday.

Now I'm quite insecure if she is still interested in me. You have to know I have some trust issues and I'm afraid she doesn't tell me the truth. 

Since friday I didn't received any messages from her, what doesn't look like she still is interested. But on the other hand she assured me that she want to see me again and she's not the chatty kind of girl especially via whatsapp. But when she's not interested anymore, why should she tell me that she is? I don't think she's that kind of girl who plays with other peoples feelings. Also she told me that she doesn't have much experience in relationships and dating in general, so maybe this could also be a reason she's behaving like this.

On top of that she said that she is really shy and nervous around strangers, which I can definitely confirm.

He was tagged, so I checked his account and his story was with the same girl I was talking to, and they were drinking in the same glass with two straw for each. They were really close actually.

To top it all off she‚Äôs in a sorority, and she went to a frat party today and she tells me that she loves this frat because apparently all her good guy friends are in that one and that she feels ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to get drunk around them. So it sounds like they‚Äôre her friends, but she just sent me a snap saying ‚Äúhey :)‚Äù after the party and in the background there‚Äôs a goddamn frat flag‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking but what the actual fuck, did she really fuck some dude and decide to snap me?? So I‚Äôm stuck. I know I have a tendency to exacerbate things and I let my mind wander a lot to stupid conclusions so I just wanted a new perspective on this.

I (17m) was in a long distance relationship for about 4 months with a very amazing girl.  We met through playing video games and really were in love.  We talked everyday, were super lovey dovey with each other, and it felt like we communicated very clearly.  

Everything changed on news years though, she seemed to randomly just get distant.  She started messaging less, then we started talking less, she started to make excuses.  The way I found out is because one morning she said she couldn‚Äôt talk because her car broke down but then when I messaged her later that day about talking she said she had to drive her co-worker home, so we couldn‚Äôt talk in the afternoon either.  I really didn‚Äôt know how to process what was happening, I‚Äôm really getting anxious and I can‚Äôt stand what‚Äôs going on.

The next day I message her good morning and she just says she isn‚Äôt feeling it, I respond with alright not really knowing what to do, the reality crashing down upon me.  We don‚Äôt message again that day and the next day she completely ghosts me.  Doesn‚Äôt open my good morning message, and until the next day when I know she goes into work.  And she leaves me on opened, I get pissed, I have no fucking idea what I did, what‚Äôs going on, nothing.  

I‚Äôm in school boiling with rage and I message her, we need to talk. nothing again, delivered for 30 minutes, I send a message saying it‚Äôs really important.  She pops into chat a minute later and I‚Äôm crying, during the period i‚Äôm in Im in a separate room where I grade papers.  I was crying so hard, I send a message to try to stop the pain.  are you happy with our relationship?  she asks why I ask and I just say that she doesn‚Äôt seem into it. she says yeah she isn‚Äôt happy with our relationship right now.  I ask to take a break or break up entirely thinking whatever the fuck and she says that‚Äôs probably for the best.  10 days pass and I message her asking if the break can end but she leaves me on opened.  Another 5 days pass and I can‚Äôt take it again, I send a really pathetic message asking if we can get back together and end the break.  

This is the end of our relationship here, she gets mad saying that I couldn‚Äôt give her the space she wanted and says that she wants to be single.  I try to tell her that I can‚Äôt wait for her to want to try again and she said to be free.  We ended it there I said ok I feel like you‚Äôll never come back so goodbye.  

The thing is I couldn‚Äôt move on, I‚Äôm a bloody mess, I couldn‚Äôt stop crying.  She started this relationship and now it‚Äôs all over.  She said she‚Äôd heal my pain not make it worse, she said she‚Äôd take me away from my shitty life and give me the world.  I message again, begging to know the reason why we couldn‚Äôt be together, she said I didn‚Äôt trust her and give the space she needed.  I ask what the real reason was because I said why would you need space.  She just said she wasn‚Äôt happy with her life and can‚Äôt keep making others happy while she suffers.  I ask again saying she doesn‚Äôt have to lie, and she says ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs fucked up I told you the truth but apparently that what enough for you,‚Äù I tell her I don‚Äôt understand.  She tells me she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore and doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me.  I breakdown and say that i‚Äôm completely alone with her and shes the only person I really like.  She just says I‚Äôll find someone else, but I‚Äôm a fucking idiot and say that I tried.  She says that makes her want to block me and to leave her alone.  I keep trying to apologize but she keeps saying it‚Äôs okay and it‚Äôs fine.  I ask If we can talk once a month and that‚Äôs basically where we ended.

We do talk again a week later, I sent a yolo message because I was getting suicidal.  I sent it on the 31 because of a technicality that it was once a month.  she just said she couldn‚Äôt talk, I sent a message saying what I did wrong and that I just wanna fix this. she tells me that i need to work on my issues and genuinely give her space.  I say I promise to and she said thank you, I tell her to have a good day and she‚Äôs says it back.

We agreed to talk on the 12th but I can‚Äôt stand how we are, I feel it‚Äôs over and everyone tells me to move on but I can‚Äôt.

We went on a nice date last sunday as I picked her up, went on a road trip, ate somewhere, came back had a glass of wine before diner and dropping her off. This made me feel really good because I couldn't find the strength to meet someone for the past two years as I've gotten out of a 7y relationship. Over the date we discussed a lot of each other interests and since my life changed drastically with the breakup and covid mixed in I didn't pick up anything interesting yet where she has many friends, horses, likew snowboarding and all sorts of winter activities. I do photography/ videography, hiking and gaming during the weekend. My strength is in the summer where I golf, camp, i love to go away with my sailboat, spend times on islands/beaches cook etc..

From there I didn't know if I should've chatted with her on the daily or not. I noticed she wouldn't really engage in a conversation and only answer with hahahahaha* or sentences not leading to open conversations. I still sent her a couple more messages but felt ghosted. Didn't invite her on a second date yet as I had a family weekend planned.
We met at work cause she's doing a internship before finishing another class for her career. We also did match on tinder. I went to check the all this morning cause I'm getting uncertain and she unmatched me.

Can I interpret that she might not be interested? I was planning on asking her out just so we can see each other again next weekend, letting her know to feel completely comfortable with her answer because I value communication and honesty but maybe it's already too late? What can I do? This also makes me feel as I'm gonna have an harder time next time I try to date again. She was really joyful and interesting the way I love...

I am looking to embark upon a long term and serious Female Lead Relationship. I long for woman to travel the world with, and to spend the rest of my life in complete subservience to her. 

Under Your Complete Control -
My purpose will be to give up my life in matrimony for you, to behave as you prefer and to submit all control to you. 

If it pleases you, I would like to embrace your control in as many different ways as possible. For example: 

* I would emasculate myself for you by wearing feminine underwear and keeping smoothly shaved as you convert me into a sissy. 

* I would submit to your control and welcome your dominance over me when you pegged me. 

* I would remove myself from your devine presence and into a sissy pink bedroom if you have a real man in your company. 

* I would be thankful for your regular humiliation and degradation. 

* I would be grateful when you allow me to accompany you for dinner, and when you choose from the menu for me. 

* I would enjoy a packed lunch you force me to endure, containing a bottle of your piss and left over food. 

* I would demonstrate my devotion to you as you make me wear your worn pads when you‚Äôre on your period. 

* I would permanently mark my body for you, by having a tattoo stating that you own me. 

* Eventually, the ultimate humiliation would be you ordering me to go male to female with a sex change lower down. 

A Special Relationship -
If it pleases you, I will remain in chastity at all times. I will support you in seeking sexual partners during our marriage, and if you desire to get pregnant I will raise the child as our own. 

Serving Your Alpha -
Being lowly and worthless, I will do my utmost to clean up the mess your lover has left inside you. I will do this with my tongue, without fail and with eagerness. 

My tongue will be yours to use as many times as you wish to make you cum with oral, whenever you wish. And, if you need sex I will strap-on fuck you if you would allow it. I will be thankful to taste you whilst forever being in suffering that I am of no other use to you. 

My Commitment -
I will endeavour to please you, and deprive myself in order to do so. I will accept that you will never allow me to have sex with you; even after marriage, and that I will eternally sufferer in desperation for you.

However I noticed he would try and make me jealous by telling me he had girls after him, I‚Äôm lucky to have him, he‚Äôs getting lots of attention. I never used to react I just would say I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre telling me but no problem. He started mentioning we should go out for a drink and a weekend away which I never agreed to.

He then had to go work in Dubai for 4 months so messaged me saying there was no point in our arrangement as he wouldn‚Äôt be here, I agreed and removed him from social media. He had a huge go at me and said why would I do that and not let him finish what he had to tell me. While he was away I was told by friends they seen him partying with girls etc on social media, so I mentioned it as a joke he called me a psycho, told me to leave him alone then he apologised for being with the girls but I ignored him.

A month after this I start dating a new guy and my friends with benefits comes back home and sees I‚Äôm in his area and wants to see me, I told him I‚Äôve moved on and he said I bet he‚Äôs ugly, his an oap (my new guy is 12years older), you will always like me then blocks me.

I don‚Äôt have plans‚Äù he replied back to the snap not saying anything about the caption but saying ‚Äúyou picked a nice colour!‚Äù I think. I said ‚Äúthanks, they kinda look shitty on the camera though, they look better in person lol‚Äù he replied with: ‚ÄúAha maybe I'll get to see them soon‚Äù

Since then which was just yesterday we‚Äôve only been exchanging snaps and not much more, does anyone have any advice? Are my hints too honest? Should I not rush into this?

I hope that this post won't be too weird or anything, haha. Because it's not driven by any sort of ""MILF"" or ""Cougar"" fetishes. It's literally will just be me expresing my view on dating.

So, to start off, Im 25 years old athletic dude (actually playing pro sports) who receives quite a lot of attention from ladies. All the way from 18yo to even late 30's. And I'm gratefull that I can actually attract some attention. Because I know how dating can be really tough for some guys. But it's another topic for another day, haha.

However, I've noticed that many women around my age (~22 to 25) are still mentally really immature and it's kinda tough to take them seriously in terms of long-term dating. No offence to girls of this age, who know what they want and are actually mature. It was just a very broad generalisation. So, because of that, I was actually thinking of trying to date someone a bit older. Like 27 to 33 or something. Ladies of this age just seem way much more wise and confident. So, I guess that they would make way better partners for long-term relationship.

Until one random late evening I was invited to a social gathering by a friend and I met a girl that left a positive impression on me and we exchanged contacts.

Over the course of a few months since our first meet, we exchanged messages and met at a few house parties her friends organized. I was happy for that brief moment whereby I could connect with people once again and also see her. That was until I mustered the courage to ask her out on a date which she happily said yes to. I was elated.

We went out for 2 dates in total spread across 5 months (she has a hectic work schedule). Mid way we slowed it down because she was hospitalized and had to undergo surgery to which I visited her to cheer her up. She got better and we agreed to see one another on a 3rd date soon after.

After the 3rd date I began to notice that we texted less but brushed it aside that she was busy at work as usual. Fast forward to new years eve, I texted her if she wanted to spend time together but got no reply but again, I brushed it off thinking it was work that got in the way.

This week I messaged her to ask if she had plans in advance for Valentine's day and she responded with a weird, ""Is it a date? &lt;insert excited emoji&gt;"" to which I replied ,""Yes, it'll be a fun one!"". My stomach sank when her following message read, ""I don't think you ever asked but I have a bf now. I can go out as friends though"".

That was when I responded, ""I feel stupid that I'm asking you out for a date and finding out only now that you were seeing somebody else without me knowing. Let's not do this as it's not right."" As courtesy, I politely asked how long they were together which she replied ""around 6 months"".

As angry as i was with myself for not asking her the question earlier if she wanted to be exclusive on the 4th date and sensing something was off in Dec, I replied, ""I want you to be happy even if it isn't me who's there by your side. Goodbye.""

All I got back in return was a poorly crafted, ""Thank you. Please still be my nice friend?"". I replied, ""No thank you. I respect yours and my time so please don't contact me again. Take care"".

So here I am feeling bitter and angry that by sending that last message, it will mean losing both her and the company of her friends whom I enjoyed their company in one fell swoop. What did gain in return? Self respect and courage to never be somebody else's Option B or being strung along with the false hope that she may change her mind. 

**TLDR**: Never assume when somebody you're romantically interested in is ""busy"" because it may not be the case, communicate clearly upfront what you are looking for so expectations are managed &amp; lastly, you don't owe anyone your precious time if they don't have the decency to speak up and sub-conciously play along when clearly your actions and words demonstrated that you were going out not as friends but as two people having a feel if we're a good match.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157521,public,self,I lost two things but gained one important life lesson,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/slwbfa/i_lost_two_things_but_gained_one_important_life/,no_ads,0.0,,

We went on a nice date last sunday as I picked her up, went on a road trip, ate somewhere, came back had a glass of wine before diner and dropping her off. This made me feel really good because I couldn't find the strength to meet someone for the past two years as I've gotten out of a 7y relationship. Over the date we discussed a lot of each other interests and since my life changed drastically with the breakup and covid mixed in I didn't pick up anything interesting yet where she has many friends, horses, likew snowboarding and all sorts of winter activities. I do photography/ videography, hiking and gaming during the weekend. My strength is in the summer where I golf, camp, i love to go away with my sailboat, spend times on islands/beaches cook etc..

From there I didn't know if I should've chatted with her on the daily or not. I noticed she wouldn't really engage in a conversation and only answer with hahahahaha* or sentences not leading to open conversations. I still sent her a couple more messages but felt ghosted. Didn't invite her on a second date yet as I had a family weekend planned.
We met at work cause she's doing a internship before finishing another class for her career. We also did match on tinder. I went to check the all this morning cause I'm getting uncertain and she unmatched me.

Can I interpret that she might not be interested? I was planning on asking her out just so we can see each other again next weekend, letting her know to feel completely comfortable with her answer because I value communication and honesty but maybe it's already too late? What can I do? This also makes me feel as I'm gonna have an harder time next time I try to date again. She was really joyful and interesting the way I love...

Does this guy sound lazy/unmotivated or am I just overthinking things?

Rule 3 Violation

Ive been on 2 dates with a 37 yr old guy that I met via OLD. When we were still in the chatting stage he mentioned that covid took his ""proper"" career and he currently just has a part time job a couple mornings a week doing admin work from home. I didn't think anything of it at all because that's the times we're in.

When we met though it became clear that his previous job was only an entry level job with no skills or qualifications needed (he does have a degree) as all his jobs have been. Also he's just drifted into them by coincidence. I was a bit surprised. Its not about money for me (I'm a nurse!) but more the potential lack of direction, interests/passion.

That Sunday I was messaging him and he had basically spent the whole day in bed, stating that's common and it made me further concerned. I mean it's not like his week is so work full that he must be too tired to do something on the weekend. Finally our third date he asked to rearrange as he had spent some time helping a family with some paperwork and he wanted to spent the next day ""recovering"".

It's a bit of a turn-off for me and I'm not sure if I want the 3rd date or to end things here. But I don't know if I'm just being hyper alert to potential red flags? Im not some super active person myself but I do like to try and use my time well to enjoy it.

Would you be concerned? He's been quite visibly nervous on both dates and indicates he feels I'm out of his league and really likes me. Still I can see he's intelligent, sweet and seems to have a humour that could click with mine. I felt like I could talk to him easily although his ability to carry one is hindered by his nerves",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157530,public,self,Does this guy sound lazy/unmotivated or am I being overly critical?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/slxc7w/does_this_guy_sound_lazyunmotivated_or_am_i_being/,no_ads,0.0,,

I've noticed that in so many cases, it all disappears after having sex. Yes, I do enjoy it so much, I'm very kinky and open-minded and if I like someone, I want to give my best to satisfy them. But if I do my best, suddenly everything changes. They stop taking me seriously and start seeing as a hook-up instead, even though they won't admit it and in the end I feel played. Nice conversations stop and everything becomes just sexual. If I tell them how I feel about it, it doesn't make any difference - they continue acting the same until I put an end to it.

Little freak out moments where I'm just really scared. It's nothing about her. No red flags (or at least none yet). We have been very open and honest and everything seems really great. However I just have these fleeting moments of panic or fear based around the situation I guess. It's weird. 

To put things in to context, I have had these feelings before. For example, last year I had to buy a new car. It was in my price range and I felt comfortable buying it, but for like a solid month I would have these little fits of panic when thinking about the money I just spent. 

I have a lot of great things in my life, and maybe I'm just worried about getting emotional and then getting burned? Or just thinking about worst case scenarios? I don't know.

I gave him my number through the app and he replied a few hours later.

I really like him. I regret not texting him straight away! :( I would have asked him out on a date. It's been 2 days since I texted him. I feel like I have messed things up. I could send him another text and ask him out on a date. However he has not texted me back and I don't want to be seen as desperate. Maybe he thinks I'm not interested in him.

I never really gave him a chance the first couple weeks he was texting me; because I wasn‚Äôt insanely physically attracted to him but he was so persistent and adamant that he wanted to take me out and be in my life long term that I thought why not. (Btw he was WAY better looking in Person so I‚Äôm attracted to him now) Started giving him a chance texted everyday for a week. Since We‚Äôve  been on two dates over two weeks; third one tomorrow. 3 dates in 3 weeks is a good sign. Right? He continued to text me everyday even after we slept together on date two. He treats me so nice sometimes it scares me that it will one day it‚Äôll just stop. I‚Äôm scared sometimes it makes me wanna push him away or self sabotage. We live in different cities. He usually takes an 1hr 30 min train to see me. 


Now I like him; but I don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs going; and that scares me. I did physical things with two other people this past week, and I don‚Äôt know if I should tell him or if I am even allowed/meant to feel guilty. I still use my dating apps to talk to people. I mean we aren‚Äôt exclusive or even discussed that. But I feel like I betrayed my emotions by allowing myself to be physical with &amp; talk  to other people knowing I like him.  Then I wonder do I really like him if I can do that? Or am I just being realistic by keeping my options open and not closing myself off too quickly? I don‚Äôt want to end up hurt by putting all my eggs in the wrong basket. Then I wonder what if he is doing the same; why should I be loyal if I don‚Äôt even know if he is? He is probably still chatting to girls on apps too right? So is what I did wrong? Or am I trying to justify this to myself? 


There is this other guy I used to briefly sleep with, mind blowing passionate sex, crazy physical attraction but we never explored anything  more to be honest. I‚Äôm so tempted to sleep with him; but I know I shouldn‚Äôt. Simply cause we are looking for different things. Honestly the sex was so good I was scared Id fall for him and he didn‚Äôt want a relationship so I cut it off basically 1 week after we slept together. It‚Äôs when me and the guy ended that I gave new 3 date guy a chance. However he (old fling) picked up his hoodie from mine on Thursday and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about sleeping with him. He is texting me trying to convince me to go over and I know I shouldn‚Äôt . But it‚Äôs so tempting. I won‚Äôt though; but gosh I want to. Why do I wanna go over there? Why can‚Äôt I just think about the guy who is treating me good ? Should I be loyal without having discussed it? Am I wrong for being physical with and talking to other people? Am I self sabotaging?

I've known her before, but only as an acquaintance, you don't often talk to. Throughout some weeks of texting, we started doing things together once in a while. We went to a restaurant twice and visited an art gallery. We had long and quite deep conversations, too. The last two months I got ill pretty badly, so I couldn't plan on asking her out or meeting her again. One thing though is that she's a very slow texter, and chatting does not make sense in long term -&gt; I want to see her again. Throughout my absence, we lost contact and I tried to start with it again, still waiting for a response. As I said, I'd like to meet her again but after some reconsiderations, I'm now facing this problem:

\- Our meetings have been fun and interesting but there was no real romance.

\- I don't know whether she knows how I feel about her or if she's just been meeting me to keep up in contact?

My question:

\- I think I must make it clear what my intentions are and let her know how I feel about her.

I'd like to know whether I can possibly do that when we're meeting again, just for a talk without a real chance of some romance, etc.

What do you suggest to me? How should I approach her to clarify my intention without making her feel overwhelmed? And what would be a good start to find out how she feels about me?

I'm being assessed for it currently and I'm just waiting to hear back from the specialists.

I feel as if this has gotten in the way of me dating and forming a connection with people because my brain is wired differently.  I don't always pick up on some things like when I'm talking about something I don't notice if someone is bored or not listening/interested. I can't tell when someone is joking or not about something, and so I need people to be upfront with me.

The worst thing is I'm unable to understand when someone is upset. I basically need it spoon fed to me.  I need people to tell me what I've done, and how and why it upsets them.  I don't know how to help if I don't know what I've done. Twice it's happened to me where a boyfriend I had would show me a screen shot of something and I genuinely didn't understand why they were upset by it. The other instance was quite recently where the guy was irritated with me and when I asked why, he just said ""you know why"".  This doesn't help. No, I genuinely don't. I asked what he meant when he said the things he did and he thought I was just playing dumb and manipulative.  It honestly makes me panic and go into panic mode, and I spiral and get manic because I come across as being unsympathetic and have no empathy. But that's not the case. I genuinely feel bad if I hurt someone, but I get ten times upset when I don't understand why.  

I don't want to be a bad person :( I don't want to come across as a narcissist or sociopath. I want to be good in a relationship. But I want someone to also have patience with me too.  

Can anyone offer advice or at least let me know I'm not alone?  I'm taking a break from dating to concentrate on whatever the hell is going on with me, but when I return I would like to know how to handle things.

I was feeling down and he came along

At First he was talking normal and getting to know him. 
We sent normal pictures and he looks like a normal nerd not extremely cute but decent and someone I thought I could get along with. We also sent each other gifs, memes, TikToks. 

Around 2 months he asked me to do a long distance relationship and I was scared at first and felt like it was too early and I haven't even heard or seen his face in a facetime yet. So, I didn't flat out said ""no"" I said along the lines of ""let's get to know each other first and then let me think About it"" 

After that in towards the end of the 2end month into the 3rd month, he sent a better picture and  I finally got to talk to him on the phone and hear his voice and to me he sounded cute
And I was hooked, I really wanted to spend time knowing him even more.

I held off the FaceTime because I thought maybe he was insecure and I didn't mind he never asked for nudes or money so I thought this was a real person.

So I thought about the long distance relationship And I asked him in the 3rd month if he still wanted too. 

And he said, ""No,""

I was upset about it because he asked me first and now he didn't want too. He said he was busy and the time difference and distance and that he wanted to focus in school. He lives in Europe 

And we got into an argument and I was about to cut him off completely, but I had no friends at the time and didn't want to be completely alone. And confused because like I can manage my time and figure something out and it wasn't long ago that he asked me.

So we stayed friends but I still wanted to FaceTime anyways, but he always did a maybe later 
So we kept things normal until now  in month 5, however I will add that he always gave compliments and was still sweet and nice. 

But now in month 5, I only heard his voice twice but never seen him in a facetime yet and I still press for it because I am paranoid and I wanted to make sure it was him. The pictures were consistent but still I want to make sure
Anyways he started to be more flirty and said things like 
""I wish you were here"" 
""You should come visit""
Things like that, and I thought as friends, tho I was still hoping for something more 
This was confusing me, like it seemed like he wanted me or liked me back and was still confused like does he want me as a friend or a romantic partner.

But then I really started thinking,
He knows a lot about me, but idk much about him 
Like after the first month he was open until our first argument then he was vague really.

And then I twist the question cause I know he would dodge it if it was direct and said 
""You know you could've told me that you didn't like me,"" 
And he replied ""I know""

And then it spiraled into so many more questions because he never really liked me, he never put as much effort as I did 
He became more vague 
It felt like I was talking to a stranger really 

So I pressed him and tried to get more answers and I felt hurt and mad and really wanted to know why say all these things and not mean it, even as a friend wise how am I supposed to be a study partner if he never did some form of a facetime 
And he dodge all of my questions didn't answer a single one. 

And now he left, he blocked me and I blocked him. 

idk if he was a catfish cause I did try to reverse image and tried to see any social media, only things I when off was his picture and voice, he claimed to be a college student and 24 years old and says he lives with parents but idk cause I never seen him. 

Idk about his life like he could be real, but maybe trying to be sneaky cause he's in a relationship And is emotionally cheating idk I'm just speculating 

And it really hurts for someone to manipulate my feelings and confusing me into thinking that this was something but it never was 
I have pictures of his face and at times I would hug my phone or pet his cheek on my phone to wish I was his or to wish I was there, maybe some type of 90 day fiance type story that actually ends well

But at the same time I put more effort and he never reciprocated back and he knew I was a bit lonely and he played on that
I'm still hurt by it all

I met a person on a dating app who shares the same values interests, qualities and doesn't live far from me (most of the guys on the app do). We spoke for a week and got to know each other a little. 

I gave him my number through the app and he replied a few hours later.

I was in a bad place at the time (had many issues with my family and my mental health). I did not want to mess things up. I replied to his text 10 days later. I explained I was unwell and had lots of things going on with my family and asked how he was.

I really like him. I regret not texting him straight away! :( I would have asked him out on a date. It's been 2 days since I texted him. I feel like I have messed things up. I could send him another text and ask him out on a date. However he has not texted me back and I don't want to be seen as desperate. Maybe he thinks I'm not interested in him. Advice would be great please?
