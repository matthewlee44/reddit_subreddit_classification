0,r11kdt,1637747249,Going on a city break 7 days after meeting,"(We live in the UK)

My friend met a girl on Saturday the 13th of November at a gig. She bassically didn't leave his apartment for the week that followed because she's off work on annual leave and he works as a musician at the weekend.

I went on instagram on Monday and saw that he had an Instagram story up of the two of them in the airport going on a city break together.

Her insta handle was tagged in the story so I clicked on her page and she already had 3 grid posts with detailed blog like entries that mentioned things like how her life seems so perfect now/ she met a new guy and he is really special.

Obviously I'll be chuffed for the both of them if they're both happy but I feel a bit worried for him, like this is love bombing and she could be a bunny boiler?

We have great synergy, and I've already had my romantic experience liking her and telling her so. (For clarification, I found out her orientation before I told her, so when I did, I said something along the lines of ""You're a great friend and I've fallen for you. I know you're not into me, but I thought you deserved to know how nice of a person you are""). best moment of my life so far.  


Skip 3 or 4 months and now I continue to stay strong friends with her. We study together from time to time and see each other several times a week.  But, even then, I still get romantic thoughts and feelings that I genuinely still love her for who she is. most of the time these feelings re-surge, it just boosts the happy coffees or afternoons I have with her. I don't have a realistic want to go out with her anymore but at the same time, I don't feel comfortable removing a source of happiness by moving on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had friends tell me that I need to move on so I can have a love life or because there's potential future issues. Others have said, ""Continue what you're doing and enjoy the time that you have"".

5,r1299m,1637750056,I think I might be getting mixed signals from a coworker.,"I started to notice some (what I perceived as hints) from a female coworker. Lots of eye contact, she started standing closer when we talk, she would kind of seek me out if we are in the same area (factory work so it just depends on where they put you if you even have the chance to do something like that) and so decided to see if she just wanted to hang out sometime. She ended up sick it got rescheduled for a few days later (next two days off) and the last day at work before we were going to hang out she'd come over to where I was about once an hour and just stand around and talk for like 10 or 15 minutes sometimes. The only thing that seemed like maybe a bad sign to me was she does not reply much to texts but likes to come talk to me at work.

The night of hanging out at my place she texted she was running late but still wanted to hang out for an hour or so. She ended up staying for 8 hours and all we did was talk. It was probably 70% her and 30% me. We talked about work, coworkers, a little politics and life views. She talked about some darker stuff she dealt with growing up including a dead parent. She also talked about her ex quite a bit at times, they had broken up no so long ago. So I felt encouraged she hung out that long but was not sure what to think about some of the conversation.

Also similar to work there was a lot of eye contact, she would nervously play with her hair a lot, touching her face frequently at times, got seemingly super nervous when she showed me some of her art on her phone and I briefly moved closer. On the other hand we were sitting on a sofa most of the time and she seemed to king of lean slightly away a lot, never made any attempt to move closer or anything.

7,r12opr,1637751810,At my age (33F) is it true I need to settle? Esp with the wanting kids situation?,"I don't get to socialize much these days with my focus on my career as an administrative assistant, but I still definitely want to have kids and get married. I'm fact, I've even signed up to purchase sperm from a cryobank and undergo artificial insemination...but sadly there's apparently a huge wait right now, as sperm are waitlisted. The wait is projected to take MONTHS or longer, given the pandemic and the previous shutdowns related to that. I'm 33 with preexisting fertility problems that will only get worse with time, especially now being in my 30s, when fertility decreases even for ""normal"" women with no preexistings.

In the meantime, I'm looking to date. I am on multiple dating sites, although I have learned the hard way to tread very carefully with that, because I've been embarrassingly recognized and outed before by people who knew me at one point and recognized me. It's to the point that I use a picture that hides part or all of my face, and I sometimes even fib about small details on my profile (such as listing my town being 20mins away in the neighboring state, or being nonspecific about the type of work I do) to try to avoid people recognizing it's me (including one very malicious, predatory a-hole who dumped me last year but has ridiculed me periodically since but will then say I'M the ""obsessed stalker""). As a result, I've tried using lesser known dating sites but there's far, far less people on there, especially people outside India. (No, I'm not interested in being contacted by some random guy who lives in India or Bangladesh) I've been trying to date with very little success.

There's one who I have seen a few times this month who I met on such a lesser known dating site right at a time that I worried no guy would ever want to actually take me seriously enough to meet in person. He seems okay, is nice. So far the few times I hung out with him it's mainly watching TV, and conversation, with no dates yet or hookups or anything, and I should be very thankful and appreciative for that, but I don't know...I'm really, really serious about the kid thing and I'm not sure if he is...is it wrong for me to second guess things or question to myself his level of interest as far as kids? I worry that he might think I'm crazy if he finds out how I signed up with a cryobank and am awaiting sperm for IUI. Or he might not want to date me if he finds this out. Also, he says he likes kids and is open to having kids in the future but he's also turning 40 in a few months and still has children-- ""undecided"" on his dating profile. Does this mean he'd be interested? Is it worth waiting on the sperm thing (once it becomes available) and see if maybe a guy like him might become interested in dating me or pursuing future kids with me? Then again, what if I wait around and end up losing my slim window of fertility? Or worse, what if I wait around and then nothing ever happens with this guy or any of the other guys on these dating sites?

I have expressed my fears of missing out on childbearing online before and have gotten some totally cold,nasty, even cruel responses. Things like ""you'll never have a baby by your age with your infertility medical history"" and ""there's no guys left at your age who want kids and don't have kids already, and of the ones who do, they don't want an infertile like you"" and ""you're crazy, who wants to conceive with THAT"". I am beyond hurt every time I reread these comments. Should I just give up and focus on artificial insemination for kids like I was already planning to do before this stupid sperm shortage hit? At least then I'd have what I want most, a baby. Is it true or guys my age (33) would want me, being infertile and mid 30s wanting a baby? Is this why so many online dating app guys ghost me or won't hook up? Please help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r12opr/at_my_age_33f_is_it_true_i_need_to_settle_esp/

9,r12x23,1637752716,How to get him out of my head?,"I am 21 and recently broke up a 5-year long relationship because it was quite toxic. I felt like I have to fight all the time for my basic freedom which my parents already did give me. 
He used to not even allow me to go for a walk in my locality. 
Anyways, I was young when it started and he also raped me, so I felt if the deal is done, it's better to stay, I was young so probably didn't understand what was going wrong. 
This year, I got connected with a schoolmate, we talked a lot about school and other connections. He's a poet, so he wrote a poem for me, nothing sexual, all about how I crave power. And I liked it. 
Then it all changed to what we can call ""romance"" and he confessed later on. So did I. 
We didn't start dating right away because we didn't know if we'll be together or not because we had different mains and so different colleges for higher studies. 
But that didn't stop us from expressing the love we had for each other. 
We used to talk like couples but didn't have a tag. 
I felt so happy, because he wasn't a bit like my ex, and he loved me the way I always wanted to be loved. 

Soon our conversations turned sexual, and the original plan for a coffee date changed to a place that was quite private. 

And so when we met, we fucked. And then we knew we did ruin it for the next dates, but we didn't regret that. 
He gave me everything on that one date which my boyfriend couldn't in the last 5 years, we danced together, we did cute stuff and a lot of things, so I felt blessed. 

We met on our second date at his place, he made pasta for me, he lit up a candle, poured us drinks and I was happy again, we fucked again. 

For our third date, he said we won't meet in private, and he wants to take me out on a proper date, and I agreed. 
So we did go for a coffee date and clicked pictures and I came back home happy and thanked the universe for letting our souls collide. We didn't even kiss on that date, but we were happy. Together. 


And then, we talked for a few days, not on the phone, and I could sense something was wrong, he wasn't communicating properly, he was leaving me on reading when asked, he said he was in a weird phase and figuring out a way to get out of it. 
I was just being supportive, and so I said he can take as much time as he needs. 

That time converted to days and now months, in that time, I said a few things, he said a few things and the connection turned bitter. 

In October, I texted him to give me closure because I did have a lot of sleepless nights, and I wanted to sleep peacefully for once. 
And so he said he'd call me, he called, and he told me how he felt useless and couldn't figure out what to do with his life, he was in a weird place and he felt miserable, he didn't like the way he looks, he was conscious about his height and so finally he realised that the thing he needs to do is go for masters abroad. 
He apologised for what he put me through and also that he wasn't able to love himself and so he really couldn't give it to me, he fell off. 
And it did hurt a bit because I wanted us to work out, and now I don't know what to do anymore, I can't force anyone to love me, that won't do justice to me or him. 
But in that 3-4 months, all I had on my mind, was him. 
And I still do, maybe I still love him. Do I want him back? No. 
Do I want to move on and forget him? Yes. But I can't do this to me all over again. 
I can't trust anyone so much and then be okay when they leave. 
I know I'm not alone going through a phase when you can't get over someone. 

Recently, we talked again, on the phone, and he told me how he wrote a poem for a girl who didn't appreciate it enough. And so I knew he was seducing other women online, and that made me jealous, and I also felt bad, that I misjudged him. 
That what he did to me, he probably does that to everyone else and that I wasn't special as much as I thought. 

I write poems now, and all of them are on him. 
I filled up 4 diaries, all for him.

17,r142ad,1637756783,First love and how I cannot forget,"Hello Reddit. Throwaway account. 

I have a good female friend (24F) that I (24M) consider one of my best friends, and we have been friends for almost 7 years. We met on a dating app, but we lived across the country from eachother so nothing ever happened and we became good friends instead, although I did catch feelings eventually and thought she did the same. Years go by. Nothing happens. But she's the first girl I was ever truly interested in, and every woman I have met since we met at 18 has been compared to her. Even actual girlfriends. On and off we will be talking a lot, and I will sort of catch feelings but then they fade away. I visited her once and we tried, but it turned out bad. I was a dumb 19 year old that chickened out of actually doing anything lol. 

Years go by. We talk, but both have partners. We are never single at the same time.

Recently, we started talking again a lot. And it is deeper and more personal than ever. But this time it is different because I'm in a hellish period of my life with extreme stress and overexhaustion. I'm catching feelings again, and I can't do it. Not again, not for something that will not happen. But she is one of my best friends, and I am not sure what to do. I recently composed a letter (it's a translation from our mother language, which isn't english) that I wanted to send to her, which goes like:






""*Hey, hope you get to read this soon. It's something I feel like I owe you.*

*Every time we become close again and start talking long and deeply and get invested in eachothers lives, ambitions and struggles,  weaknesses and strengths, dreams and failures I cannot help but get romantically interested. Ever since we met, I have always felt like you were an extension of myself. You were funny, smart and ambitious, down to earth and genuine. But also lazy and stubborn. It was, and still is, pretty fascinating to me. That someone is so similar, not that these are unique go us. But even the sense of humor and intrerests. Everything aligned. But I wasn't experienced or brave enough back then to act on it even though I know you might have felt the same. Timing is also a thing.*

*Ever since then I have not met someone like that. Someone as similar. Girlfriends and flings were all compared to you in my head.  But I know you probably do not feel the same today. Why would you? It has been years since that spark. People move on.*

*It is exhausting for me, and is something from me personally.  You haven't done anything wrong, but I can't deal with it again considering what my life looks like right now. I need to care about my health.*

*I had to get this out, but something tells me you've already felt this about me. Be it now or during these past few years. It's not a love confession but something I feel like you deserve to know, something I owe you.*

*Talk to you soon, later or whenever. If you want to talk about this, or anything else, you have my number.*


*Yours truly,
My name*""





How do you think this letter will make her feel? I don't want to hurt her. But it's a struggle for me. This is more honest than I have ever been, and feels tough to write. We may never speak again. There's also the question of saying it on the phone or a hand-written letter.


TLDR: I (24M) catching feelings for female best friend again (24F) but cannot deal with it, too emotionally fragile currently because of other factors.

There are women who are unattractive, too. You must find someone who you don't \*find attractive, who probably won't be attracted to you either, and develop a relationship between you both. This is what they mean by ""attraction can grow"".

Yes, the woman you're with would probably much rather prefer to be with a tall guy, but then, you'd feel the same about her.  
Yes, it's unfair. Life isn't meant to be. But, you can't really sit around complaining, can you? You have to do something. Get fit, get well dressed, groom well, get a good haircut, be giving in bed, don't be sexist in any way, get a stable financial situation, be hygienic, have a clean and well-furnished apartment, get rid of any insecurities that you have, and develop a good personality.

32,r1681f,1637763520,What happened?,"So I (35M) met a girl (32) at the gym. We would talk here and there, small talk mostly. One day she found me on Instagram and added me. We started talking more on Instagram and then I got her number and began to talk/text pretty much daily. We figured out that we had some common interests. She is a nurse and has a child from previous marriage. I’m ok with kids, not a deal breaker. Since she’s a nurse, she works mostly overnight and with her child it’s been hard to date. We’ve only gone out once. 

We made plans to go out one night, a few days in advance. The night before she texts me and she’s at a family dinner. She says she’s bored so we text a for a while. The next day is our date. I get a text about 3hrs before our dinner that she’s not feeling well. I’m like ok, no worries we’ll just go out another day. So we plan to go on a hike the next weekend. I plan out the date, what trail to do and plan out to have a picnic with her. We text/call each other pretty much all week. Come Friday she says she’s got a hair appointment In the afternoon and that Saturday she is going out with her girlfriends. Our hike/trip is on Sunday, I said ok no problem get your hair done and hang out with your friends. Saturday night I get a text that she’s had to many drinks and not feeling like he hiking tomorrow(Sunday) and wants to do something else. I’m a bit upset, we had planned this out and now she’s backing out. She says she wants to hang out and do something else. I text her sure and to let me know what she wants to do. I don’t hear back from her for the night. Sunday morning I wake up, still no call or text. At around mid day, still nothing. I got in my car and took my dog on the hike. It felt a bit petty, but I took some pictures of me and my dog and put them on Instagram. The next day I get a text that she was sorry for not getting back to me. She was hungover and not feeling well and then that her child wanted to hang out with her so they just went out to eat and stuff. I told her that I get it, she works crazy ours and she rarely sees her child. But told her at least a text would’ve been nice. She apologizes and we move on.

The next few weeks she’s working overtime and doesn’t really have time to go out. During this time she kind of stops texting me and when she does states that she was busy with work. Out of the blue, she tells me that she’s got vacation time and she’s going on a trip to Mexico. I was a bit surprised. It’s almost her birthday so I figured she was just taking a vacation for her birthday plus she works hard, deserves a vacation. When we initially met she stated that she likes to take last minute trips. We talk/text day before she leaves. She states that she wants to go out when she gets back in town.

I have not heard anything from her since Sunday. Yesterday she put some pictures/stories on her Instagram. Looks like she’s relaxing having a good time. 

The last story really got to me. It’s her clinking drinks with another person. The other person in that story is wearing a mans watch. I don’t know what to think about this. 

Part of me says she went on a trip with this other person and not interested in me anymore. But if so why drag me along? Just tell me up front. Other part of me says maybe just a person she met and had a drink with. I’ve had drinks with people I don’t know when traveling.

I don’t know what to think. I’ve been nothing but supportive and caring to her. Am I just being insecure? I mean we have just been talking, not really official or anything.

Lots of eye contact, we were relatively close, and she asked me a lot of questions and seemed invested in the conversation. This was on friday.

Since that day we haven't talked yet. I saw her alone on Monday, but didn't talk to her. I was trying to see if she would come talk to me, which I already know it was a dumb move. Yesterday and today, she was always around a small friend group that I don't know, so it's kind of intimidating for me to just approach the whole group.

I was thinking that, tomorrow, I will try to leave the classroom alongside her, and ask her if she has a few minutes and then ask her if she wants to do something with me one of these days. Is this a good way to ask her, or should I do it in any other way?

The reason why i am here today is because I need help trying to figure out how to start. I’ve been using Tinder and Hinge (not really tinder anymore) but I find myself having a hard time finding people with similar interests to me.

I'm not a very good looking guy and I am rather overweight at 320lbs\~ 6’4”, id guess id be somewhere around a 3/10 if being honest with myself. I like videogames, history, fantasy/sci-fi, marvel/dc, and other things along those lines. Where would be a good place to start? Are there places I could go in public to try to find someone, like a bar or other recreational place?

I've started going to the gym recently but obviously I'm not going to be hitting on girls at the gym like some creepy dickwad, but I would also like to find someone who is also going to the gym so we could do that together.

Because of my lack of experience I get rather nervous and I have a hard time trying to approach people I've never met before and I'm not sure what I should do.

Any advice will be welcome, that of course goes with criticisms as well, thank you for taking your time to read this.

41,r17ebd,1637766759,"Confused with this guy, please help me!!","Hello, 

So I met this guy about a month and a half ago at the strip club I work on weekends.  He was there one Saturday,  we had drinks and it turned out we live really close, basically neighbors,  so he asked my number.  

After 1-2 weeks comes back and I told him to have a dance, he said preferes private. In the end he ended up paying me for sex, which was good and he asked me out on a date few days after. That night he asked me whether i have done sex with other guys too in the club, and i told him it has happened a few times.

So 1st date was good , I showed up 20-30 mins late ,conversation floaded well, he was keen on getting to know me , asking about my previous relationships and told me that he is divorced ( he is 7 years older than me). After we went to his house and we had sex, chemistry was really good and texted me afterwards that he had a great time and wants more of me . He seemed really sweet towards me .

We arranged to meet few days after( it was friday), but he told me that early at night has to attend a company dinner and cannot make it and I also told him I would be at the club later at night.  The night after he booty called me late at night,  asking me if I was at the club , I said no as I was working in the hospital ( I'm a nurse too). He wanted me to come to his place which was not possible for me,  so we arranged to make it on Sunday.

But Sunday came and it was a disaster for both from the very  beginning . I showed up again late and he was really angry about to leave. I considered it as a red flag, I excused myself for being late but I found his approach really disrespectful.  So I entered his car and told him to go out, it was a rainy day and told me he preferes at his place . The whole night we were both distant with each other and I totally turned off. Few times he tried  to touch me and approach me, I avoided him cause I was not feeling it, from the moment he was about to leave me at the beginning of the night.  He asked me whats wrong and I told him that I'm afraid we are not compatible characters , since he was so easy to abandone me and this has never happen to me again . He said that hates when people get late, but again said he feels sorry for his behavior. Anyway he kinda pushed it to have sex a bit later, initially he took of his tshirt, telling me to touch him,  then he started rubbing me, I was not feeling it so much.  

We ended having sex again, I didn't came and asked him to finger me which he avoided as he said doesn't trust me  and wants me to get std tested . He said we can have sex again and last longer,  I said no and got dressed as i found him disrespectful and told him that he only cares for his own satisfaction and there are no feelings, no trust and better to break it off. He said trust is building with time.  I noticed his eyes got a bit red, a bit sad maybe not sure. He also was a bit distant and avoiding kiss me, I noticed, it was really minimal kissing. He simply told me in order to do more things in bed I have to get tested.  I even told him that my ex was way better in bed and was doing everything to satisfy me. I had enough and left his house, he told me many times to take me back home,  but I turned him my back and left. Arriving home i blocked his number. 

As the week passed I started missing him and so unblocked him and talked to him again explaining my complaints.  He excused himself and explained his part and his complaints,  he said that he felt attracted and connected to me but not ready for a relationship but we can always see each other.  I said ok better for both to keep a sense of freedom.  Then after days he suggested me some casual invitations which I declined. Anyway I maybe changed my mind and told him that I'm looking for something more meaningful,  emotional, effort,  time and not an empty sex. I did std tests and were all clean and showed him. Few days after came by the club asking for me, at the moment i was having drinks with a client who was rubbing my shoulders.  He showed this and just left. Then asked me to come to his place saying that he craves me and wants every inch of my body but also respects me and looking me in the eyes put him in peace. I explained that I'm not into sexual invitations again , he agreed to just come there just talk and cuddle.  

Actually it was nice seeing him again,  but I'm a bit confused since he has stated he is looking for a sexual relationship but I felt for him something more. At times has asked me to stop with the club and I was just wondering if in the case I was stopping he would want to actually date me or his intentions would be always purely sexual.

Please help me , I need advice on this !! How should I approach him? Should I ask him out? Let him go? Give it time or stop working at the club? Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r17ebd/confused_with_this_guy_please_help_me/

45,r17lyf,1637767352,Should you approach in such a situation?,"So today, I (19 M) was on the train on my way back from university. When I first entered the train, I noticed a really cute girl so I sat on a seat parallel and adjacent to her on the other side of the train so we would be in each other's fields of view and I could try initiating some eye contact. But this girl had her earphones on, and during the whole ride which was at least 35 minutes she was constantly looking out the window and would not look at me, or anybody else in the train as a matter of fact. I thought that since she wasn't giving me any signs, and since she might not even have noticed me she was not interested. Usually, I only approach whenever a girl shows signs of interest, like decent eye contact or positioning herself in a certain way that's obvious she wants me to go talk to her. But with this girl it was none of all that and approaching on the train is far more delicate than doing so on the street or something, so I simply decided not to approach. But now I can't help but picture her in my head, she was so beautiful, exactly my type... and looking back, I do wonder if maybe I should have approached anyway. Now regret is taking over of me.

I have been seeing this girl for about 2.5/3 months and it initially started off as a hookup and developed into something more. We really had a connection and i asked her out on a date. That went very well and we continued seeing each other. Halfway through, on one of our dates, I brought it up and asked her to be my GF. To this, she responded saying she wasn't ready to commit but wanted to take things slow and see where they went. She said she really likes me and has feelings for me, and said that I was someone she could see herself with. I agreed to wait a bit and see where things went but i also told her i wouldn't wait around forever. At this point, we  agreed to be exclusive with each other. The period that followed was fantastic, we saw each other every weekend and did cute stuff together, she'd stay over multiple nights and I even met all of her friends (she told me once that they were rooting for us).   


However, fast-forward to about a week ago, i noticed she was pulling back, and a bit distant, i figured something was wrong but I brushed it off thinking she was busy and that she didn't need to text me all the time. Here's where things went down, she calls me to meet her and tells me that she can't see herself waking up and committing to a relationship soon. She said that she gets overinvested in relationships and loses herself and didn't want to lose herself again (she's been in 2 long term relationships in the past and wasn't treated the best). She told me that she wished she met me a little later in her life.  


I thought about it and decided to break things off with her because I didn't want to be with someone who didn't want me back that way. Now, I find myself thinking and re-thinking this situation. When i told her I was ending it and couldn't see her anymore, she said she understood and that it was one of the reasons she respected me. She sobbed when I hugged her the last time. And probably cried on her way home.  


 I don't know, I'm really confused and don't know if i did the right thing. Personally, I feel like I shouldn't be looking for a commitment this early in my life too but I really liked spending time with her.

I have a really good relationship for 1 year and my boyfriend is amazing and almost perfect. Almost.

I’m not going to break up with him because I love him and except this thing everything is perfect. I would like to compromise because everyone has flaws. 

Unfortunately, I cannot express to him that it’s a big turn off for me because then it would be a turn off for him too. I don’t want to ruin my relationship because of it. It’s not worth it.

All those random hookups I’ve had in the past and here is a girl that I might actually see myself long term with (we have been speaking with each other for 2 weeks). I thought to myself: “Hmm, that promise I made about not wanting a girlfriend. I might reconsider that”. We really had similar vibrations.

But anyways, we spoke today on the topic of drugs etc. She was very curious regarding the whole psychedelic space. She had only tried marijuana before so she was unfamiliar with that. 
Since I only use psychedelics as a means for meaningful experience and not to simply get high. I told her about the positive benefits of it. She was very inquisitive and wanted to try DMT for herself after I explained all pros &amp; cons of psychedelics . I told her I knew a guy that could hook us up. 

She then proceeded to tell me that she would ask a friend of hers for a pipe. 

A couple of minutes later she said this: “Sorry, I can’t speak to you no more” I asked why. She told me her friend didn’t wanted her to date someone who uses drugs. I told her that this friend barely knows me. And besides. I don’t use psychedelics in a recreational way. I exclusively use it for self-development purposes. 

She then proceeded to say that this friend told her she wasn’t ready for dating. I told her that she is a grown women (mind you she is 24 years old) and can make decisions for herself. 
She was adamant. But that actually raises some flags. I told her that it was very toxic of her friend to go and tell her what she can do and not do. Be she told me that her friend only wanted what was best for her. She then removed me from snap. 

Honestly I see this as good thing. I couldn’t imagine how it would be like to be in a relationship with someone like that. A person that on a whim, literally on command can change their opinion because of some friend. I see this as quite immature and her being unable to think for herself. 
This would have been a three party relationship and honestly I already got experience from past relationships on how that ends.

56,r19bcd,1637772079,Dating someone who has gotten around.,"I (F21) started seeing this guy recently and it started off weird. We were strictly fwb and that was 100% my fault because I had just had some bad stuff happen with another guy and I did not feel I was ready for more heartbreak. I then stupidly caught feelings for this guy and he says he has feelings for me too. We are together all the time and enjoy hanging out. There are two problems I am having though and I am not sure how to feel about them. 

1. Now that feelings are involved, he never wants to have sex. We started going to church together as we are both religious and he claims he just doesn't see me the same as when we first met and were fwb. He says he has a lot of respect for me now so its hard to get it in on and see me like that. 

2. He's really known for getting around. I knew he wasn't great in that sense because he even had a history with my roommate, which caused a little tension when she found out. Every time I'm with people who don't know we are seeing each other they talk about how they can't stand this guy because he has been in so many girls' pants. I knew it was bad but maybe I didn't understand HOW bad it was. Which makes me worried why we aren't having sex anymore. 

I guess I am just looking for some general advice on the situation from either gender perspective. Have any other girls been in this position before? How did it work out? I would love to hear a guys perspective as well, especially if they were the ones that got around.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r19bcd/dating_someone_who_has_gotten_around/

58,r19efx,1637772316,Dumped because he thought he could do better,"Hello. I hope this is the place for this. If not, please let me know but I guess I just need to let this all out 

I was dating this guy for a few months. We spent a lot of time together. Things were going well and he went on about how special of a person I was and that he really liked me. Out of the blue one day he says he doesn’t want to date me anymore and aired out all of his grievances.

I’m a pretty bubbly person but I know when to be serious. He says he is a very serious person and prefers me when I’m serious and wants a more serious personality person 

He makes six figures and I don’t. He says that he doesn’t want to worry about financially supporting me in the future and wants someone that makes around the same as him. I work in tech and have my own place and pay my bills and am good with saving my money. I’ve never had to rely on anyone and we always took turns paying for things. I’ve been at my company for a while and I’m constantly working to grow at my company. I anticipate that my income will increase in the future.

I casually brought up that I think tattoos are cool and that it would be cool to get one one day. He says he really doesn’t like girls with tattoos (I don’t have any currently)

He says that I make him really happy and his actions showed that he wanted to spend time with me so I guess this kind of took me by surprise. He says he made a mistake asking me to be exclusive with him after a few months. He says that he really likes me and that I’m a really special person at the same time wants to see “what else is out there”

I know that dating involves meeting people to see who is a good fit and rejection happens but for some reason I’m feeling especially hurt with this rejection and really heartbroken I’ve been crying for two days straight.

I liked him for who he was and I didn’t want him to be anyone else besides himself and I wish I got the same back. I really tried my best. At this point I’m just trying to be kind to myself and take it easy and chalk it up to just not a good fit for each other.

I've had luck before (met ex bf from Tinder) so I know it's possible, but god is it hard!

Maybe it's my age group (23-25 yrs) but even the older guys (28-32 years) seem to be the same. It could also just be my luck. Every guy I've asked hasn't wanted something ""serious"" (basically wanting the benefits without the commitment). The last guy I was seeing said he'd be open to a relationship but when I asked him a month into seeing each other, he wanted to keep it casual. I guess you could leave this to ""you shouldn't be looking for a relationship on Tinder"" but I do have faith I'll find someone eventually.

What are your methods are for weeding out the people who aren't serious? I have ""looking for a relationship"" on my profile but that doesn't seem to be too effective.

A little bit about me.  I am 175cm (5'8 feet) tall male who is 20 years old. I am an absolutly extroverted person that is not afraid of blaming hisself in puplic or something. I dont have any problems to talk to stranger or making a phone call :D.

So but why I need advises?
I am kinda into girls that are taller than me. So now I am just asking me two question:

1. Are girls even interested in me? Like everyone knows that most of the girls want a tall boyfriend. I think there few exceptions. I dont know if I really have a chance. There a guys who actually are shorter than me and even have more struggle to find someone. (Maybe there is a compensation like I look for a girl who is 181cm tall and a shorter guy is looking for a women who is 175cm? 
乁( •_• )ㄏ)  Does I even have chance?

2. I dont why but when I see a taller girl I am becoming very shy (・–・;)ゞ. This dosent happend when I talk to a girl who is tall as me. For an exampel: I was at a Halloween party a few weeks ago (everyone was vaccinated with mask of course). It was a very big party with a open bar and dancefloor. Then I saw I taller very cute girl. I couldnt bring my self up at first but the I just tried. I walked to her and said: „wow this is a very cool costume you look very nice. It fits you well."" She smiled at me and said: thank you very much"". And then I walked away. In this moment I thought to myself: „thats it? Why I didnt ask her name?"". (╯ರ ~ ರ)╯︵ ┻━┻

If she said no or something I would have left. But I didnt even asked.

So maybe you can help me with some advises or you had a similar situation and tell me how you reacted.

68,r1abmg,1637774734,Guy I'm talking to forgot that I can't have sex at my house,"I've been talking to this guy that I met on tinder for a few weeks. We seemed to have good chemistry over text and both like each other. He's called me cute and hot and smart, and said that the reason that other people I've talked to haven't wanted to date me is that they weren't as smart as me, and that he might be my perfect match.


We planned a first date but we were texting the night before and the conversation somehow got to me talking about a date I went on last year where the guy tried to have sex with me and how it made me uncomfortable because I don't have sex on the first date.

He said that we seemed like too different of people, and should probably cancel the date and go our separate ways. I said that that's probably for the best, as I don't know where we'd have sex, seeing as my family lives with my stepdad's family and he doesn't want any of his kids or me or my sister to have significant others spending the night. He said that we could have sex at his house, and that his ex stayed over and his family didn't mind.

So we went on the first date and it went well, and I asked him if he wanted to go on a second date. He said yes and I suggested an aquarium near me, and he said that he's never been to an aquarium. We kept texting for about a week after the date. The other he texted me ""What are we going to do on the second date? Are you going to take me to your room so we can fuck?""

I reminded him that we couldn't have sex at my place. But I think it's weird that he forgot considering that him saying that we could do it at his place is the only reason that we're still talking and went on the first date.

We had a nice conversation and found out we had a lot of mutual friends. Before we went to out to the bars, she said she wasn't feeling well so she ended up going home before we went out. 

The next day I saw her again at a day drink with the same group of friends and again we chatted some more. I ended up making some joke to her about how ""she didn't like me"" and she said ""no I like you, I was so sad last night I wasn't feeling well because I couldn't hang out with you."" I thought she was interested after this but me and the friend group ended up going back to chill at her apartment after drinking but she seemed a little cold. I ended up leaving for dinner but she followed me on Instagram later that night. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, I see her out with the same group of friends. She comes up to me and we start chatting and she whispers something in my ear saying ""I told my friend I think you're cute"". After that I bought her a drink and we started making out. She was playing a bit hard to get after making out though but I ended up getting her number later. 

She texted me first the next morning saying she was ""really glad she ran into me and she had a really great time!"" after this I thought I had this in the bag but this is where it gets confusing. I texted her after saying I had fun too and we should try to hang before I moved to another city later that week. She didn't respond for like two days and never really answered my question. Anyway she hit me back the weekend after I had moved with a picture of her and a friend of mine that she had randomly met. She then texted a long apology saying she was really busy the past week but she would be down to hang next time I'm in town. 

Anyway the next time I was back in my hometown I tried to hang out with her but it didn't work. I told her I was gonna be out on Saturday and we should try to link up if she ends up going out. She agreed and told me she was going out at xyz place. 

She texted me later that night asking ""where are you"" but when I texted her back she never responded. She then texted me the next morning saying I was asleep when I texted her (around 11:30pm on Saturday)

Anyway we had been chatting the past couple weeks before Thanksgiving. We agreed to grab drinks and got drinks a couple nights ago. The date was decent but even from my end I could tell there wasn't this instant ""spark"" but I was still open to trying it out again. She told me she would be visiting my city and also told me the exact date she'd be there so I figured I'd see her then. 

After our drinks I offered to walk her back to her car, at first she said I didn't have to but our cars ended up being in the same direction so we walked together. I stopped at my car and attempted to go in for the kiss but she said she wants to take it slow and that she didn't want to mislead me because she was ""really drunk"" the last time we made out (which she wasn't and even if she was why would she say she had a really good time the next day while being sober?). 

Idk I'm pretty blown about this situation because I had been trying to get her on a date for a while but I feel as if she lost interest. Did she lose interest because the date wasn't really ""sparky"" or is she just not as physically attracted to me as she was before?

85,r1blwz,1637778173,Met a guy for a hookup,Met this guy on bumble and need advice for how to move forward. We hit it off and he asked to hookup and I said yes. We’ve sexted a lot the past 2 days and really clicked. Unfortunately since it’s thanksgiving we’re both busy this week and can’t find time to actually meet and hookup. So it’s this awkward thing of really wanting to jump each others bones and not being able to. Anyway he hasn’t texted me yesterday and I’m new to having hookups. Is it ok if we don’t talk to each other for the whole week until we’re both free and text plans to meet up? Or does not talking at all mean we’re not interested? Should we send each other some random texts sometimes? If he doesn’t text me the whole week is that bad or is that just how hookups work? Not sure so really just want to hear your opinions. We both seem to really like each other from what we’ve said to each other but now I’m not sure how to move forward or if it’s bad that he isn’t texting me. I can provide more context if needed.

First of all I’m clinically depressed, have low self esteem and anxiety and I’m also suicidal. I go to therapy and I’m 24 and unemployed I’ve been looking for a job but my anxiety is handicapping me. Anyways, she was really supportive, she wanted me to get better but tbh, let’s face it I was a parasite, sucking away the life out of her with my negativity. She’s the first girl I’ve done so much with. I’ve never had a girlfriend so everything I did with her was special and new to me. She ended it and she told me I have no dreams or goals and I’m not working. I told her one time she deserves the best and she brought it up last time when she ended it and she said I was right she does deserve the best and that wasn’t me. What I’m trying to say is tho is that I fucked up big time cause she was so amazing to me and I don’t think I’ll ever find a girl like her again. What I’m also saying is that I think I was never meant to have a relationship. I wasn’t enough for her and maybe I’m just not enough for anyone else. Whenever I feel lonely, I’ll just remember that I can’t be with anyone cause I’m not good enough for anyone and that’ll make me feel less upset.

90,r1cbiv,1637780079,"my crush seems to give a lot of signs that she's interested, then didn't text back","Sorry this is long, details are kinda necessary (tldr at bottom tho).

We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I start to think I have a crush on her, so I start paying attention to her. I notice she stares back a lot too. There were times where she would glance over after laughing with her friends, her eyes would linger when she turned her head, and she looked over her shoulder when I was working in the hall and she passed by.

I only looked at her out the corner of my eye, we would make occasional eye contact but I only looked if she was looking first.

She sat at a table with a few of my friends in the other class, and we could move around for worksheets so whenever we had a worksheet I'd go over to my friends. Usually, we have to present how to do part of the worksheet to the class. The first day I'm over there, I ask if I should stay there to present with them, or go back to my group and she is the first one that tells me to stay. There is another girl at that table, and whenever I listened to the other girl, she would repeatedly glance at me to see how much I was paying attention to the other girl. She'd pay attention to stuff like if a sub said my name wrong, even if I wasn't at her table and she'd bring it up later. We do have a good bit in common, we both play soccer, we have a lot of the same classes and I could get her to laugh.

She's normally a shy and very quiet person, so I took all of this to be a good sign, and I asked for her number after class one day. I immediately texted her so she had my number, and then I texted her that weekend. No response. At this point I figure she's not interested, oh well.

But then that week she's staring even more. We were in the hall for a class and I was behind her, and she was repeatedly looking over her shoulder back at my group. I moved behind her other shoulder, and she repeatedly looked over that shoulder. In the other class, when she was giving thoughts on a poem she was looking towards me out the corner of her eye, and not towards the teacher who is on the complete other side of the classroom. She did that anytime she spoke in that class that week.

The issue is, we moved seats on the class where I talked to her, and she's no longer by my friends so I don't have an excuse to talk to her. I did manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I asked her why she didn't respond. She said she got the text, but was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back. That doesn't really explain why she was staring more than usual during the week, as she seemed to be thinking about me enough to pay attention.

A few days go by, she's still staring, but I don't get a chance to talk to her. I don't want to wait to figure out what's going on, and it's not imminently likely that I am going to have a time to talk to her alone, so I decided to text her again. I asked her if she didn't respond the first time because she didn't want me to text her, and again no response. I talked to a mutual friend about it and she said she sometimes doesn't get a response either, but infrequently.

The weird part is now she's staring EVEN MORE. In one of the classes she has to turn her head past me to look at the whiteboard from her desk, and every single time she looked from her paper to the whiteboard or vice versa she paused for a moment to look my direction. I know it sounds like I am exaggerating, but from where I sit, I can see her in the corner of my eye while looking at the whiteboard. She would start moving her head, stop when she would have an angle to look at me, and then keep turning her head. She also was messing with her hair a lot.

That was last friday, and this week nothing changed. She was staring a lot, and there were times in the first class when she would sit with her shoulders facing me instead of forwards to towards the teacher, she touched her hair a lot, and it seemed like any time I put my leg on my knee or hand on my head she would be doing the same shortly after.

Usually she leaves the first class with her friends but we walk the same direction. I sit closer to the door, so usually I leave first. Monday she quickly walked over as I was leaving, but then saw I was talking to one of my friends and she then stopped, looked at her phone and waited for her friends. yesterday, she left with her friends just a bit before me, but after they left she slowed down and ended up in front of me alone, and was walking really slowly. I didn't want to be weird and approach her from behind, so I also slowed down. In the second class, I also sit closer to the door, and I was getting up to leave but a few people I know wanted to talk about a recent test. She was about to leave too, but when I stopped, she stopped to look at her phone and waited inside the classroom. She knows one of the people in the group, so as we started to leave, she joined the group and walked over by her friend, but was staring at me the whole time. Usually, we go the same way but everyone else doesn't, so I just figured I'd wait for them to leave and talk to her then. But, she left early that day and went with the group. So I feel like an idiot.

She's giving really strong signs she's interested whenever I see her, but a really strong sign of disinterest by not responding. I don't want to call her, i doubt she'll pick up if she doesn't text back. I'm just really confused on the situation and need other thoughts

92,r1cfuf,1637780395,Girlfriend's Dad Slapped Her,"So I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a few months now. We met at a workplace (she works to support her family since her dad lost her job).

She had a crush on me. She asked me out. We went on a few dates and eventually got into a relationship and fell in love. It's her first relationship (including first kiss everything) while I've been in both casual and serious relationship.

The lack of experience and age gap did make me feel I might have an undue influence on her and I've consciously worked hard to not let that come into play. Things are great between us and it's mutual and fun.

However, her family is pretty conservative. Her mother is somewhat chill. My girlfriend has introduced me to her parents and they like me. Her parents have even taken me out to functions like an engagement party of one of their relatives.

Since the last week however, there's been constant fights in her house. My girlfriend had been working from home and she was called to office. Her parents forced her to ""work from home"" and said something along the lines of ""You're getting out of our hands. You want too much freedom etc.""

Sad part is, her mom is extremely independent. She goes out alone and returns pretty late at night. Yet, she doesn't allow her own daughter to do the same.

Today, me and gf went out (her parents knew). I dropped her home at 11pm. She told me ""her dad slapped her for returning so late"". It made me really angry and also guilty that because of me somewhere she got late.

Yet, I don't know what's the proper solution for it. I can't interfere too much since it's their family, yet I wanna do something for my gf.

Moving out isn't possible. We live in a conservative society and she isn't financially independent enough to do it. Plus somewhere, she does love her parents.

But she's getting tired of putting up with their shit eventually too. What could be the best solution to deal with it?

We also have a few friends in common. 

We both take mental health seriously. I have anxiety issues but mostly have the ability to self soothe and move on but he says he has OCD episodes that can last for months.

My past relationships haven’t necessarily been too healthy. I have always given more than I get and I just do not want that dynamic for myself ever again. I want an equal dynamic where we can take care of each other and our own selves. Before I invest further in this person, I would like to know the pros and cons.
