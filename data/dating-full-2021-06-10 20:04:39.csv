Or
2) The girl who is busy should counter to suggest another day

As a guy (m27) with some integrity I wouldn't suggest another day as I think if the girls is truly interested they would. However I understand that some girls might not be confident or forward enouth to do so. 

The way I see it is the girl has said they are busy and don't suggest a different day it's probably because they don't fancy another date but don't want to hurt the guys feelings/or just rather take the easy way by fading out

I'm interested to hear what people's opinions are in the situation and if they have been in the same place, so if you don't mind including your gender and age so we can see how it differs from person to person.

Met through a friend group. Talk pretty much every day. Watch shows together on discord several times per week. Every Wednesday, the group meets to play online games. Laughs, good times. Obvious connection between us. We are 3 states away (at least a 4hr flight).

Anyways. Told her I started to get these feels (kept it light, playful and humorous) and I got the following phrases....

""um... Let me think about it."" ""I appreciate your candor."" ""oh wow, I didn't expect this, you're really putting me on the spot here."" 

Now she admitted she enjoyed my company and there is obviously something there, I'm not  crazy, but the distance thing. She's done it before and she was weary. 

I'm no dummy. These are not good things to hear, even with the admission that I wasn't crazy and there was something. However, those phrases and the pauses with which they were said.... my initial instinct is NOT GOOD.

I'm old enough to know the routine. It's usually pretty cut and dry when you hear that shyte phrase.

My bias right now is the fact that there is literally something to think about... the distance. That's a legit concern. It IS something to think about. Is it a blow off or does she really need to think about it? Never had this experience long distance before, so I have nothing to compare it to.

Having said all that though... does it ever go in the positive direction when you hear that phrase? My instinct is NO or very very very rarely.

Just wanted to get some thoughts on this.

Overall... I'm still super glad I did it. I would have regretted not doing it more so than the rejection itself. I can now stop thinking about it. And if it is a rejection, I can just put her in the friend category and pursue other women and move on.

After a solid two weeks I haven't had a single match... I'm not going to lie it's a bit of a blow to my self esteem and I just can't figure out what it is that I'm doing wrong? This isn't the first time I've tried online dating but it's always the same, few, if any matches...

Let's put this into context shall we? I'm 22, Scottish, living in the United Kingdom. I have it on good authority that I'm alright looking, not the best but not the worst either... I'm pretty confident, intelligent and funny (no trying to blow my own trumpet here). I'm fit and healthy, I run and hill walk and I'm a healthy weight and I've got an interesting and well paying job (I make rugs by hand!). I've also returned to the Army Cadet Force as an adult volunteer.

So, I've filled out my profiles completely and honestly, using the best photos I have. Good quality photos including a selfie where you can see me clearly, smiling and you can make out my eyes which I'm often complimented for, me up the hills, making a rug, in a suit and me in my Army uniform.

Not a single match, on any app... It's a bit of a body blow and it's always the same, every now and then I'll make a new profile but I don't get any matches!  The thing is, I really want to get into a steady relationship and I know that Tinder isn't exactly the place where I'm supposed to be looking for ""the one"" but living in a small town, you quickly learn that none of the lassies who are available are interested in you, nor you in them...

So, I'm at the point where I haven't got a clue what to do other than *being patient.* I'm desperately lonely, I was so before lockdown but I've only gotten worse. I've felt myself slipping into alcoholism and this is the main source of my pretty severe all be it functioning depression, I fear that the longer I go alone the more damage I'm going  to end up doing to myself through drinking.

Is there something I can do to get more matches online? Is there something I can do to meet new people who are interested in dating? I've tried online dating as mentioned, I'm a regular at the pub and have a decent social life but in a town of 8,000 you always see the same faces, and as you can tell by turning to reddit for help you can see I've exhausted all options and am quite frankly desperate...

-no deep talks

I‚Äôm sadly barely experienced in relationships/sex and so I wanted to take the plunge and make an effort in meeting women and so it feels like online dating has opened a door for me, since I‚Äôm usually somewhat introverted/shy. Now I wish I started sooner.

Looks-wise I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm somewhere above average but not a 10 either, and I think I‚Äôve got pretty good pictures of myself on the app, which definitely helped me get matches/dates. Thing is these are like 3-4 years old now and I more or less look the same now, maybe slightly older. 
And I feel like the last year and a half my hair has been thinning, slowly but surely, and for me at least it‚Äôs becoming noticeable. Its tearing my confidence and makes me feel down bc its something I care about, not that I had an amazing set of hair to begin with but because I considered it to be a part of my looks/style‚Ä¶ 

What sucks is I never had much luck with girls and now that I ‚Äôdiscovered‚Äô online dating and its going somewhat ok, i feel my ‚Äôlooks‚Äô are fading. And I know looks isn‚Äôt all but to me it mattered, since I‚Äôm not great on the confidence front. Would love to hear thoughts on this! And how I should proceed. I feel like I would lose any appeal that I had, and I assume a majority of women prefer non-bald men‚Ä¶ tinder is kinda superficial I guess, it would be harder to get dates/matches? 

And also please can someone explain the looks vs condifence thing to me, i want to get a better understanding of this.

Also for the record, eventually I think I‚Äôll have to start shaving my head and update my pictures and so on :/

Both are 19 years old.

One of them is kind of an introvert. She is cute, very short and slim, dresses like a boy, has a boyish hairstyle, sounds like a boy as well. She has no curves, and no boobs at all, yet there is this submissive femininity in her behaviour that makes me want to dominate her. She would make a good friend and a good girlfriend. She even cooked for me, prepared food for me twice, and praises me rather often, and quite openly. I do not know why she is so short and slim and has no curves and boobs, because her sisters are not like that at all, but her personality is sexy enough and more, to reel me in easily. She is studying media sciences, but she loves listening about scientific stuff, and I love talking about it, so that will be very good.

The other girl lives in a different country, she is tall (5'9, I am 5'10), small boobs but curvy with a big butt, I like that. She is rather classy, has a lot of followers on Instagram, she has won beauty paegents, knows kickboxing, has worked as an actress, and may compete for the title of Miss Turkey (I really really want her to win that, if she actually goes for it), quite the achiever at 19. She has ADHD like me, so there is a lot of understanding between us. She praises me a lot as well, is a kind person but with an explosive anger like me, she is kind of crazy as well, but in a sexy way, I like that. She loves being dominated in the bedroom, and I love dominating, she has a cuckquean fetish, which I think is hilarious but also rather hot, I would love to help her enjoy that. She is also good at helping me resolve emotional problems, like she is good to talk to in that way. She is kind of insecure too, and thinks that all she has to offer are looks. I suspect she is rather rich as well, but I am not sure.

The problem is, both of them are so damn perfect, and I cannot resist them. I want the both of them, and if a third girl like them pops up, I know I will fall for her as well.

I (21M) met this girl (19F) late 2019. We became friends, started studying together, went to the same church and was just spending a lot of time together, we were seeing everyday. I fell for her as we connected so well, we opened up a lot to each other and she was just someone I loved being with. I found out she was already in a relationship all this while and was shocked because I didn't expect someone in a relationship to be that close with me. I wanted to cut things off but she continued relating as if nothing happened. During the lockdown, I couldn't take it anymore and I told her I wanted a relationship and since she's already in one, it would be best if we cut things off. That didn't last as we started talking again. We talked everyday, started doing things in common, and she would share with me every detail of her day. There was just no boundary with us. After about 6 months, I brought up wanting a relationship and she declined, giving a reason that I know she's in one already. I cut things off, and after about three days, she texted saying, ""Really, I like you. Talking to you, everything, but not in that way at the moment. To be selfish, I want you to stay but if you feel the best thing is to leave, I understand."" I decided to stay and I hate myself for it. I interpreted this as her telling me she was interested in me and that I should probably hang around in case a break up happened with her bf. I knew I wasn't okay with being friends and I stayed nonetheless. I don't know if I can forgive myself for that.

We were basically acting like couples after this and we were vulnerable with each other. She basically tells me everything. I've never been in a relationship and I am someone that hardly socialize and open up but with her, it just came naturally. She was my person and I believed if there's anything like a soulmate, she was that for me. We started learning Spanish together, her idea,and it was like our thing. I was always the first one she'd talk to if anything was wrong, and if she sees anything she thinks is cute, she always snapped and sent to me. She just made me feel special in a way no one has and really cared about me. February, this year, I raised it up again... And this time, she asked me why I was still talking to her and went on to say that we were only still talking because she thought I was okay with being friends. I couldn't believe it cos nothing about our relationship implied friendship. I have told her on numerous occasions that she was more than a friend to me, I basically treat her as my girlfriend and in no way could she have thought that I didn't want more. I was hurt. She then said she knows what I want but she doesn't see it happening anytime soon, and that she asked why I was still talking to her because it's either I'm waiting for something that might not happen or I'm okay with it not happening. I told her I was not okay with being friends and knowing that she's with another person just hurts me and that it's best if we just let each other be this time. A part of me understands and that she should be loyal to her bf but it doesn't make it hurt less.


We've tried to keep the distance but it's just hard as school has resumed again. We attend the same church and I still see her at least once a week. I've deleted her contact and all her pictures from my phone. I was the first to contact after our result was released, just to ask her about her result since we studied for it together. She texted me back after two weeks to ask for my advice about a decision she was to make. We didn't contact each other for up to a month before she texted again and this time, it was to check up on me. When I see her in church, sometimes we greet, sometimes we don't. I still don't know how to handle all these. And when we greet, it's just a handshake, or a wave and just an ""how are you doing?"". I texted her like two weeks ago, we're on a common WhatsApp group, so I can get her number anytime. I just really missed her and wanted to talk to her... I asked how she has been and what she's been up to lately.. A few days after, she texted me because the football club she supports won the champions League. We have a common friend who had his birthday party this Monday, I was going for a handshake, but she hugged me when she saw me. It's the first time we've hugged since we stopped talking and I just had mixed feelings about that. I wasn't ready. 

Now why I made this post, I was really stressed out today and while walking around campus, I was just thinking about her and how I'd tell her how stressful today was if we were still talking. And as I looked up, i saw her walking in another route. I was shocked, felt like a pure coincidence. I don't know if she saw me or not, but stupid me wasn't thinking, I changed my route and went to hers, called her name and waved, she waved back and continued going, looked like she was in a hurry. Seeing her react that way, like I was just someone casual, felt really bad. It dawned on me that I might not actually mean anything to her again, I felt stupid and embarrassed. I mean it's been 4 months since I decided to break things off. But I haven't moved on. I thought things would be better now, but it's not. I still think about her every single day and sometimes it's like I don't want to move on. 

She was such a big part of my life. She's not in my life anymore but she's still in my head. I really miss feeling special to her and the access I had to her and I long for it again. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired. I'm embarrassed because we weren't even in a relationship and she has this much power over me. And obviously, I'm nothing to her now. I just want to forget her and move on but I'm starting to think I won't. I'm a medical student and I've tried to take my mind off it with studying but it doesn't work. I end up thinking about her most times I'm studying. And most times, I don't have interest in anything. I sometimes wish I would just sleep and not wake up.

Hi, I'm Luce.and I am 15 yrs old. And my crush is also 15. 
I meet him before the last day of school. 
And managed to get his social media through a friend.

I've never been in a serious Relationship before (mainly because of my fear of getting hurt,) Most of the guys that I like or manage to ""Date"". I usually just break up with them. Cuz I don't  want to get hurt. 
Also, I never had any connection with those guys. Or barely got to know them. And we didn't  have anything in common. And most of the guys I would get in a Relationship  with would just use me to show off to their  friends that they have a gf. Or the relationship  would be akward cuz we don't  have a connection.

In 4th grade, I had a crush on this one kid, it hurted but to put it worst, he rejected me cuz I was To ugly to be his type. 
So in order  to block myself from feeling this pain, I would just dump guys before they dump me. Or just rushed into a  relationship  just for show.
I never did anything intimate with those guys. And most of them that I showed affection too, Ended up moving on the last minute. (But that was middle school)

Fast forward, To high school, Were I met my crush. 
I got his social media from a friend. And he added on snap. He start talking, He is super nice and we have things in common. Out of all, of my crushes in the past, He was the only one who I actually was connected too and rush into dating simply because they just wanted a gf. Nothing serious. 

It just felt like I was getting to know someone before anything happens. I enjoy talking to him. But now, I start second guessing. Should I continue this friendship and see where it would take us or should I just end the friendship or stop liking him before I get rejected. Or get him hurt.

I‚Äôd say we got along great and had very good chemistry. I wanted to be in a full blown relationship by February but he was apprehensive due to his work schedule during the summer. 

There were red flags galore with him and I‚Äôm no angel and I can identify *at least* two things about me he could classify as red flags. 

I mostly ended things because I straight asked to see him more often but he couldn‚Äôt fit it in, however, he said he would try harder. Long story short there was no extra effort made on his end within three weeks. 

I emailed him a direct, yet not rigid, message how I needed to move on because my needs and desires are not being met and I‚Äôve been unhappy with our arrangement. I said all good things about him and didn‚Äôt throw anything in his face. 

He hasn‚Äôt responded. I‚Äôm shocked honestly. We texted every day but it was mostly just some variations of ‚Äúhave a good day‚Äù in the mornings and a ‚Äúhow was your day‚Äù in the following a couple random texts. Not really anything special or noteworthy. 

To be honest if anyone were to have read our text conversation dating back to November by all accounts it would be declared I am way more in to him than he is in me‚Ä¶

He has my house key (he never returned it when I let him stay at my house to recover from a minor medical procedure) and I have his expensive game system. 

I offered to meet him halfway between homes Friday to do the exchange which is why I figured I would have heard from him by now but seriously nothing. 

I trust him not to use my key maliciously but do I send his game system in the mail or hang on to it?

She‚Äôs been a close part of my life for a while now but there‚Äôs a good distance between us and our conflicting work schedules mean that we‚Äôve only been able to see each other 1 week in every 6. 

Earlier on we‚Äôd compensate this with calls long calls and lots of messages. These have died down a lot. 

I‚Äôve made it clear that to progress any further, we‚Äôve got to solve the issue of seeing each other more, and she‚Äôs been working on that and I‚Äôm thankful.

I‚Äôve recently become acutely aware of the fact that I‚Äôve avoided dating over some deep rooted trust issues that I‚Äôm working on. 
As she starts to enter into a more normal social life, I‚Äôm finding it hard to trust her through issues from my own past.
I don‚Äôt ever want her to stop living life for me but when she drinks she loses all consideration for how I feel entirely. Tonight simply telling me that she‚Äôs very drunk and won‚Äôt even be sending me a single message (I don‚Äôt expect her to sit on her phone all night, just a quick hello is enough every couple of hours) this, just freaks me out and she knows it.

i've been wanting to make a post about this for a while but i wasn't sure how to word it, i'm still not honestly, but i'm giving it a shot since this topic has been living in my head rent free. ***please read through before hitting the comment section up with some angry retort/response, i am asking a genuine question here because i am confused and disturbed by this trend. i'd love to see some civil discourse about this topic as opposed to he said/she said/arguments about gender.*** 

i recently read a comment on here regarding the term ""future faking"", i am not exactly sure if that commenter made up this term or if it's a widely used/known term, but it's basically a phenomenon where a prospective love interest will offer you this, that, and the third and make a variety of promises, primarily during the initial stages of talking where you're just getting to know someone. it can be something as small as promising to take someone to x place for a date or getting them x as a gift or making grander promises like promising to  take someone on a vacation to x country and doing a, b, c. sometimes, in the case of my last experience it was ""i'll win your heart/i'll take care of your heart"". that one especially hurt.

i have had the misfortune of encountering men like this who, in addition to future faking, adore tossing out the terms of endearment (love, gorgeous, darling, etc.) pretty early on. they appear to be enamored, and everything is going relatively well (at least in theory). that is until the first or second date is over, then the script flipping is put into action. ***a quick note here: i am saying men because i've only had experiences dating men. i'm sure women do this as well, but this is my experience.*** 

i do not sleep with people with whom i am not on an exclusive basis with, and i make this known. this is not only a morals/values choice, but a physical health choice and a mental health one for me as well. i also make it clear that i am seeking open communication/openness in terms of intentions/goals. the men that i've spoken to who display the aforementioned behavior often verbalize that they understand where i am coming from and state that they're ""the same"" and ""also seeking a genuine connection"". 

it's interesting then how they then flip the script after the first or second date once they realize that i actually mean what i said and sex won't be occurring. just like that, the terms of endearment are removed, the future faking stops, the interest fades away and they either vanish or provide some half-assed excuse, either ""i don't know what i'm looking for"" (despite claiming they're seeking a genuine connection) , ""i'm still not over x, y, z person"", or ""i'm not ready for a relationship right now."" 

why do people do this? why do so many people love to test and play with and experiment with a person's boundaries? why lie about what you want and promise all this shit only to flip the script once you realize that they're serious about their boundaries? 

one might say ""well it's because i can't commit to someone i haven't had sex with yet"", which okay, fair enough. but if we're following that logic, why are you making all these promises and flooding them with terms of endearment/speaking as if you're in a relationship with them if you know that you need the sex component to decide? additionally, why would you claim that you too need that ""connection/exclusivity"" or are seeking something similar when you're clearly not?

this behavior strikes me as incredibly predatory/selfish and borderline antisocial. if you don't know what you're looking for, don't advertise that you're seeking ""a genuine connection"" to someone who states that's what they want. if you're not over an ex, don't use someone else in order to get a brief escape. if you're just seeking immediate sexual gratification, don't advertise yourself as seeking ""something real"". there are plenty of people who are just looking for hookups, don't drag someone who isn't in your games. this behavior is incredibly hurtful/damaging and can inflict lasting pain/trust issues in someone. please remember that you're interacting with a fellow person, not an android devoid of thoughts/feelings/desires.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,829861,public,self,those who future fake and bombard w/ terms of endearment then flip the script: why?,0,[],0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nx2pk8/those_who_future_fake_and_bombard_w_terms_of/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

An important thing to remember is that there are men who will have sex with women that they don‚Äôt have relationship interest in.

Some will ignore a woman‚Äôs desire for a relationship and still take the sex if she gives it to them. And that‚Äôs why this advice is self serving. It gives a woman hope that if she provides sex, it‚Äôll increase her chances for a relationship but it‚Äôs false hope if the man has already decided that he doesn‚Äôt see himself in a relationship with her. 

Both women and men hold off certain things such as money and sex in order to make sure the person they‚Äôre dating is actually interested in them and not what they provide.

A recent example of this happened a couple of months ago. While I was in class one day the professor paired us up with a partner to review our essays, I got paired with a girl that I've never seen before. We got along really well on our first interaction. I asked for her snap and we would talk on a regular basis, things got interesting when she introduced me to her roommate because the first thing she said was ""oh that's the guy you was talking about."" At that moment I thought that maybe she liked me. I tried to invite her to hang out with just the two of us but something always came up but she would usually invite me to do something but nothing came of it. I remember I went to a party that she mentioned to me, I went because I wanted to see if anything could happen between us but to my surprise I see her with another guy. I talked to her while we were there and I didn't do much because it was too crowded so I headed back to the dorm and felt like an idiot (kinda felt like I was a third wheel who came along.)

I could use another example but this post will be way too long and you'll get very bored lmao.

I (24m) recently was followed on Instagram by a girl (20f) who I know thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúcute‚Äù. 

I know this because I work with one of her best friends. The woman of note and a few of their other friends came into our business one day and briefly met me. Anyway the girl told my coworker that she thought I was cute and she told another one of my coworkers who then told me. 

That sounds extremely juvenile as I type it out but that‚Äôs the background here.  

Now my problem is rooted in the fact that I dated my ex for 4 years before breaking up only a few months before the pandemic.

Until she told me she didn't want to date me because I'm still emotionally and mentally damaged from what my ex did. 

Thing is, I don't know if that feeling will ever go away. People keep telling me that it will over time but I just have this gut feeling that it won't. It's so bad that I've seriously been considering that I shouldn't date at all. Whenever I think about it my mind races and it gives me a ridiculous amount of anxiety. And the thought of possibly getting hurt yet again just doesn't sound appealing whatsoever.

My biggest problem is that even though I'm scared to get hurt again, I also have a fear of dying alone. Which lately feels more and more like a reality. I realize I'm only 26 and that I'm still young and have time but as the days go by I worry I won't heal emotionally and mentally fast enough. 

I guess what I'm saying is I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. Either I go back to dating even though I don't feel anywhere close to ready, or I risk never feeling ready and the possibility of dying alone.

Z!

So I have this feeling that we might not have a moment alone on your last day, so I wanted to write this just in case. I‚Äôd like to take you on a date - to celebrate completing your internship and perhaps to discuss Avatar in more detail (I may or may not have all 3 seasons on DVD). If this sounds cool to you, you should text me #####

Anyways, it‚Äôs been awesome having you as an intern at [work], you‚Äôre going to be a great doctor.

Perhaps the reason is simple‚Äîwhat makes first love unforgettable is the enchantment that comes right after the estrangement: too intense to be forgotten.

When you fall in love for the first time, it's always pure. You're not carrying any doubts; you aren't haunted by traumatic experiences; you're not held back by any emotional baggages from past lovers. You are widely open to embrace and enlive this brand new world and as such, you give your emotions on full rein. You love openly and completely; no suspicions nor expectations. You just allow yourself to immerse and enjoy this new intoxicating experience.

You've invested yourself heavily into love to the point that when it ends, it'll slice your heart open. It's like flying an aircraft above and beyond the clouds‚Äîthe higher you soar, the harder you crash.
