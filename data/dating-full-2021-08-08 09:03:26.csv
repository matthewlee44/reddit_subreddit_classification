I gave her my honest opinion and calmed her down. But from some quick google foo, it seems like this may be a huge red flag.

It has gotten to the point where I avoid romantic situations because I'm scared of being a burden. There's not really a dating scene or app for the mentally ill so it feels like when I first start talking to somebody I should hide my mental issues. The problem is I know if I hide it eventually it will become a issue in the relationship. The cliche advice I keep getting from loved ones is I should wait to date until I'm more stable. I agree with this advice somewhat but with my disabilities I wonder if I will ever actually be ready and stable enough for a relationship. I know these issues are something I'm always going to struggle with for my entire life. This is heartbreaking to me because I'm a hopeless romantic and want to find a meaningful relationship.

I am talking in the context of dating. I am seeing this girl today, I feel really sad and I have two options whenever she asks me how I am:

1. Be open about it and say to her that I‚Äôm struggling. Not in a very in-depth way, just say that I‚Äôve been better but have exciting stuff looking forward to. Which is true.
2. Just say that I am okay and move the attention away from me. Which is what I usually do with family and not very intimate friends. 

In other situation I wouldn‚Äôt make a big deal of it, because if I am sad or going through depression it is what it is and there is no reason to hide it. But I wonder what the effect on the other person would be if I just openly say it.

A short background story: 

I've never had any kind of self-confidence for pretty much all of my life. I'm 21M and for all of my school life, I've never felt equal next to my friends, especially because I was by far the youngest which was even worse through all of puberty. I also had never liked my own body. Since then, I've finally come out of my shell and found wonderful new friends to get the social life I've needed for so long. 

When it came to relationships though, I was still just as inexperienced. I'd get into my first relationship but fail at making a move and we stopped dating after awfully long months of sparse texting. One year later and I'd finally want to change that.

Fast forward to a month ago:

I met up with a girl 23F for studying and everything kind of clicked, but I only realized that in retrospect, realizing a few signs and hoping they meant what I hoped they would. I was incredibly nervous thinking about texting her and felt she'd be too shy to do it herself. And after I finally mustered up my courage to write a first message that was neither too awkward or too little, she replied that shed love to meet up again sometime. 

Since then, wed ""meet up"" aka go on a date twice and I was thinking about making a move the second time around, but was too scared to pull through. I wanted to change all of that on the third date before we'd sit down in the park later like we always did, but I didn't. I was still stuck thinking about the worst ""what if""s in every situation and not pull through because of those, even when a neutral person wouldn't see any reason for them to fail.

So there we were, sitting on the park bench, and it was just like you'd stereotypically think about two shy people trying to find words: We'd happily talk about something for one or two minutes, then remain silent for a minute, rinse and repeat. I really wanted to break the ice, but didn't know how. I had prepared a nice gesture to bring her her favorite sweets, that she only mentioned briefly on the first date and was surprised to see I'd noticed. But that too kind of happened and we went silent again. I also really tried to lean in a bit and move close as to show comfortness, but her body language was still way more passive.

And then, when I felt like all hope was lost, she quietly said something along the lines of ""you like me too, don't you?"" (as in ""i like you and you like me back"") and ""breaking the ice"" really is the perfect description for what that did. I confessed as well and all of that relief made it really easy for me to move in closer, hold hands and cuddle comfortably in a matter of seconds, after what had been over a month of uncertainty. We spent some time the same way, talking in short turns and then being silent. But I told her just that and that this time around, it felt right. We also held hands on the way back to bring her home and I'm really looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.

It was also after breaking the ice, that I learnt that all of my insecurities about her had proven to be exactly what I hoped theyd be: just held back by being as shy as I was. for example, shed almost text me first, but still be happy answering my messages. (when I was already thinking about the worst reason why that was the case)

It was the biggest emotional rollercoaster I've been through in my life, but also the greatest relief. I don't even have a good moral to share for the story as I didn't even make the move in the end after all. And if you too are struggling, then remember that the other person will appreciate even those little steps, because I want to think that the small gestures along the way made a big step towards the conclusion.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,943493,public,self,We're both awfully shy and finally confessed &amp; held hands,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p0dpq3/were_both_awfully_shy_and_finally_confessed_held/,all_ads,6,,,

(33m)

Recovering from a scam on tinder I decided to try bumble, I don‚Äôt get hardly any matches at all but decided to take it very seriously because I don‚Äôt want to be hoping for woman to woman at my age, my profile is great, photos bio if I say so myself. 

I match with a girl and she started talking to me, her profile said ‚Äú looking for genuine conversations. Not in a rush, one step at a time‚Äù‚Ä¶ red flag. 

She also had ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give out my number right away‚Äù this was my first communication point with her, she explained that guys wanted her number off the bat and she says no then they ghost her. I explained putting that on her bio is a bit negative and suggested a better way she can manage it, so she updated it. 

Anyways we hit it off great, we had lots in common and the conversations was flowing to the point we had to much to say over text, it was frustrating for me as I wanted to have a conversation and she stated she‚Äôs not down for number swapping, 

so I asked one day ‚Äúare you looking to date on bumble?‚Äù
She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs not my time for dating :)‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what is your goal on bumble if not dating?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI just wanna have conversations and not define it.‚Äù

I got very frustrated and gave a lengthy reply:

‚ÄúI see, I‚Äôm looking for something a bit more and putting a lot of effort in to it :) for my self worth it wouldn‚Äôt be right for me to accept anything but, I have been in this space before. 

Just saying, bubble also have a friends section I think would fit you better? You can match with like minded people, no one wants to date, match with male and female. 

Being on the dating section, matching with only guys then saying you just want conversation is a bit trolling and not healthy for my mindset, I am trying to change my prospects on women and become a better man.

Things like this happens a lot to me on dating apps, why do people think they can get away with this? It‚Äôs very cheeky.

I had a friend that told me her friend was struggling from loneliness because of covid and her suggestion to her was to ask the guy she broke up with on tinder if he wants to be just friends, I blow up and explained to her just how selfish it is, at first she generally didn‚Äôt get it and thought it was a great idea but she dropped the convo because of how mad I was getting. 

How do I address this without being a dick, I‚Äôm trying to change my prospective but this really gets under my skin and it‚Äôs highly acceptable.

She also texts him a lot too. They used to text and walk and talk here and there since they live in the same neighborhood, but now they text a lot more since I've been seeing her.

We've gone out all together twice out of the 6 dates, and my best friend would lift her back home (since he lives super close), so they would talk a lot about how things are going between her and I, etc.

I trust my best friend and she's so far trustworthy as well, so them having one-on-one doesn't bother me, BUT her bringing him up a lot and him bringing her up a lot too (and even texting/calling her when we go out to invite her to our plans) has made him the mediator and the relationship kind of revolves around him now.

I'm worried about how her and I are getting more sexual now, and I don't want to make a mistake and get into a relationship where my best friend is a mediator for the relationship. Although, it's honestly inevitable I think, they are good friends since before she's known me and I can't impose on the friendship they already had.

I understand that nothing in our lives will never be perfect and if anything is somehow even close to being perfect, it won‚Äôt be to long before it falls apart.

It seems as if having a bf or gf is just like any other thing in life: an achievement and it is to be parroted around like a trophy. And I can personally speak for myself on this because I fell down that same trap.

Can be incisive when too many options are present

Will settle for the exact criteria for their desires

Will be make it obvious when they want attention

Will usually lock themselves when they do not have proper options

\--------------------------------------------------

No matter what you sign up for on an online dating app, one thing you always do is look at other people through the screen. You see their profile pictures, sometimes the hobbies they state or their taste in music. It‚Äôs the same old story: a largely fruitless cycle of swiping, matching, initial interest, and near-inevitable disappointment. It makes you wonder: What makes the dating experience so bad?

It‚Äôs looks and bad algorithms.

Not very surprising, when we‚Äôre swiping through profiles, we pay the most attention to how potential dates, friends, and spouses look. Although we tend to describe our dream partner in terms of personality traits rather than appearances, I guess we‚Äôre not entirely honest since we don‚Äôt want to come across as superficial. Thinking back to my online dating years, I remember the stress after countless dates, misses, and dating disasters finally came to a close. The stress of looking great, finding the right pictures, and writing the correct bio. After a while, I was so frustrated with the dating app world, I asked a date to improve my Tinder profile.

Before each date, I‚Äôd always stress out about what to wear and what to do with my hair and makeup. Then, shortly before the date, the obligatory sending of the mirror selfie to my best friends. Call it the need for affirmation or fishing for compliments; whatever it is, it has definitively to do with looks.

The disappointment after countless dates and weird matches must be due to something else, right? Honestly, I blame algorithms. When it comes to dating, they‚Äôre doing a lousy job.

Looks and bad algorithms are a powerful potion

Experts say physical beauty is necessary for a love relationship to thrive; it‚Äôs an important building block for what follows. However, Robert Kurzban and Jason Weeden were able to show that when it came to dating, visible characteristics like beauty, height, and age were more significant than harder-to-observe characteristics like religion, education, or the desire to have children in the future.

According to a study, the less attractive online daters are, the more likely they are to improve their profile photos and lie about their physical characteristics (like height, weight, age). However, with the pandemic, it seems like this is shifting. According to a new survey by dating app Bumble, it seems like five dating trends have been established during lockdowns that have a future.

For example, about 36 percent of respondents describe themselves as ‚Äúdeepdivers.‚Äù Their focus is not small talk but getting to know each other on a deeper level before even meeting in real life. ‚ÄúActive dates,‚Äù where people do something together instead of meeting in bars or caf√©s, and ‚Äúsober dates,‚Äù i.e., dates without alcohol, are also very popular. And it seems like looks have lost in popularity as a criterion.

Is it the loss of desire or bad algorithms?

During the pandemic, online dating was strictly online for quite an extensive time, thus resulting in a loss of desire. Although online dating wasn‚Äôt only for sex before the pandemic, the excitement of meeting in real life isn‚Äôt there when it‚Äôs excluded. When online dating is no longer the vehicle for real-life experiences and meetings, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be used less. Still, it seems to be significantly less fun. No one is on a dating app to get bored and meet people they can‚Äôt form deeper connections with. On the contrary, everyone on the app is looking for special moments.

However, to hear that Tinder and Grindr rank in the top 10 of apps most likely to leave users feeling sad is not a surprise. Most dating apps use a combination of stated preferences. That‚Äôs what you tell the app you want in a partner, either directly in your settings or implicitly via interaction and collaborative filtering. Although most companies are notoriously cagey about how implemented algorithms work, according to WIRE, the apps try to find patterns in the data collected and make predictions based on these patterns. Unfortunately, however, these algorithms are doing a terrible job.

One of the reasons for this is that the complex weighing of preferences that occurs while determining whether or not we like someone isn‚Äôt a transparent process. People may be embarrassed by something they‚Äôre drawn to or even completely unaware that the preference exists, even as it shapes their behavior. However, if we are being honest with ourselves, usually we know what attracts us. We have ideas about the appearance and what values our partner must represent.

However, computers are bad at predicting non-negotiables and why we change our minds about what we think we like and actually like. Furthermore, there are various other factors when it comes to who we find attractive. It starts from how well we can talk and exchange ideas with a person, how often we see someone, to how ambitious a potential partner is. These qualities greatly influence how attractive we find a potential partner and qualities that are hard to compute.

Engineering the difficulty out of something that‚Äôs not meant to be easy

There‚Äôs something fundamentally unromantic about the narrowing of options embedded into collaborative filtering, and therefore, most dating apps. By finding out our so-called non-negotiables and locking them in, dating apps facilitate bias and repeatedly show the same type of person.

Therefore, the trick could be instead of looking for patterns in extensive databases, dating apps perhaps should use fewer data. Why? When it comes to attractiveness, sometimes we don‚Äôt know what we want before it‚Äôs right in front of us. What if dating apps, therefore, would operate more randomly? Why not show various faces, lives, and world views randomly, just the way we meet people in real life? Could that potentially change the online dating experience into something less draining?

The past 18 months have profoundly changed how we live and how we stay in touch with people. Hopefully, it gave people space and time to figure out what they want from their love life. Although the algorithms of online dating apps haven‚Äôt changed, their users have. As a result, perhaps the months of self-reflection have assisted us in being more precise about ‚Äî or at the very least conscious of ‚Äî what we truly require from our partners.

Love is chaotic. Finding love is unbelievably complex. There are many factors that apps can‚Äôt grasp, such as whether we feel ready, talk well with someone, and how our world views intersect.

PLZ HELP

Hey guys, 19 year old college sophomore guy, talking to a 19 year old college sophomore girl. We met like a month ago at a bar and rly hit it off. She lives by my school, and goes to a CC nearby, but I live like 90 min away so I was just visiting. I‚Äôve seen her once since then.

We talk all the time on snap. About our lives too. It‚Äôs not just the uniform ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ‚Äúhow was your day‚Äù. Like if she has a story from last night she tells me first thing in the morning. She answers quick, i answer quick, and we just got the ‚Äúyellow heart‚Äù (#1 best friends) this week. I also got her number a few days ago

I think I‚Äôve played it pretty good, I‚Äôm not being annoying but I‚Äôm definitely showing interest in her, and so far it seems to have worked out.

We made plans to see each other soon (before I go back to school) and she is always telling me she wants to come over my house when school starts. 

All good right? Maybe.

That brings me to yesterday, when she told me about how she had gotten into a fight with her ex about a boy she got with 3 weeks after they broke up (we met 2 weeks after they broke up). But the reason I include this in my story is because she specifically said (about the boy) ‚Äúhe‚Äôs irrelevant tho I haven‚Äôt talked to him since‚Äù. 

Last night, we FaceTimed for the first time and she was talking to me saying ‚Äúyea I‚Äôm just so excited to be single‚Äù and other stuff like that. Then followed with, ‚Äúoh so you are coming down Friday, good‚Äù

I catch feeling quick and this is an example of that and I‚Äôm trying to see where this goes (aka take it further). Idk what she‚Äôs thinking cuz sometimes she‚Äôs hard to read.

I find it impossible that she just sees this as a potential hook up (cuz we haven‚Äôt yet but plan to).

I have a lot of questions, but I‚Äôll try to narrow it down:

1. Is she telling me these things (about boys and being single) to get me in my head in an effort to play a game and get me to like her more?

2. Ultimately, is this worth it? I like this girl and I know she feels SOMETHING about me.

I also don‚Äôt know if I see a future with him (because of cultural, family issues) and I‚Äôve discussed this with him but my feelings are really strong that I just wanted to continue seeing him and he thinks we can see what happens over time. 


I like him a lot but in my head I know it‚Äôs so soon and it‚Äôs also the first person I‚Äôve dated after quite a while so it might just be the affection and attraction which is driving my feelings. He‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs exclusive and he wants me to be aswell and he‚Äôs asked me to wait for him but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs too soon to commit. And it‚Äôs mainly because I don‚Äôt know if I see a future, I just don‚Äôt know whether to continue this. Have I just fallen for the first guy who‚Äôs been nice? As time goes on, some days I really miss him and some days I don‚Äôt care, so I‚Äôm just confused on how I feel about him. I don‚Äôt know if I should date other people and compare because I also feel quite new to the dating scene again? I feel like if i knew him longer I would probably be ok with being exclusive but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs too soon and It‚Äôll end up being a waste of my time down the line.

But the kicker is ghat they are actively changing some of my thoughts and motions for the better.

And they looked at me and said that‚Äôs a normal, happy feeling. 

Then there was one night they complimented me and I guess I made a face. Then they opened a dialogue and I was able to say how my ex body shamed me along other things.

Here's a rather long post that would also act as a brain dump of sorts to organize my thoughts. I'm writing this on mobile, hence the probable bad formatting. Starting with some context. 

My parent's relationship was always a rocky one, constant bickering, low compatibility which sort of stems from the arranged marriage paradigm that exists within the Indian society. Growing up with such a dynamic and dysfunctional relationship has seemingly crippled me in forming long term commitments and giving things a complete shot as I'm constantly trying not to turn out like my parents. This also has laid an important focus on practical compatibility for me, rather than larger than life romantic gestures. 

My first relationship was a fairly long term monogamous one. Lasted about 4-5 years, on and off and ended when I sort of realized that the fundamental compatibility isn't there anymore and it suffers from the same issues that my parents did and I just cannot picture myself doing that forever. This along with the fact that it was partially long distance caused more issues than perhaps a sense of comfort and belonging and sensibly the decision was not to take it forward. I also had a lot of self created mental barriers in saying the L word and that seemed to be a sour point as well. I just couldn't get myself to say it even though I did confess the same at various points in the on and off relationship. 

Post the long term engagement, I developed a deeper dislike of commitment which started out as a way to keep people at bay but slowly turned into a major hick up where one of the first things I told people was that I would not commit to an exclusive dating paradigm under all circumstances. I dated a few people here and there and it went decently, I had some feelings for these people and while I tried to be honest, I always had a feeling that I'm disingenuous to them if I overly profess my feelings or validate theirs. 

Right now, I feel caged by own nature and seemingly self caused problems.

 I'm dating two people, one of them is absolutely amazing, lives closer to where I live, is genuinely into me to the point where she says the L word to me and while I feel fairly similarly, I've held back and not let myself feel as much or dive deeper into the possibilities of a proper relationship. It's still a vague engagement primarily because I don't want to give it tags, sometimes I do and I just cannot. 

The second girl and I get along very well, she's incredible too and I really like her but she's like me, practical and emotionally closed to a fault and I don't see any possible future for her and I even though I'd really want to date her. She's into me as well, and so am I but given no prospect of dating I don't want to over engage into the feelings because shutting off would be harder later than it'd be now. She also lives very far away and LD just isn't an option in my eyes or theirs. 

My dilemma now stands at this point, why can't I accept the love that comes my way, commit to people and see things through even though I really really want to be with someone. I feel I'm a romantic by heart but what started as a defence mechanism (namely, not processing emotions, the commitment issues etc) is a real large problem at the moment. I feel emotionally numb at times and I hate it. 
Is my view of love and dating skewed or am I just thinking too much about everything? 
Sometimes I just wish to close up, distance myself from the whole dating thing and take like time off off people.

So I am 17 and never had a serious relationship, the issue is I have trouble talking to girls at first.

And I believe I have finally found a girl who might slightly be interested in me?

Yesterday, we chatted for a bit but I've been following her for a while and have liked her. The problem is, how do I start up a convo in DM's or what to say, I need some tips on chatting. After, how would I go about asking her out to meet each other?

We had some really good conversations. lots of eye contact and some 101 conversations. Shared a meal at a restaurant when hanging with other friends.   


Then I was going to get more flirtatious and see if I could get a date. Next event she wouldnt barely give me eye contact. We had one conversation that seemed good, but she wanted to get something and after that was out of reach the whole night. No eye contact and I felt I was invisible. So I didnt know how to take it.   


Then today I saw her again and I asked how she was doing and she didnt even answer, just kept walking. Then later when talking with a group, I joined in on the conversation. She was like the only one who didnt really acknowledge me. Then said she needed to get something. I tried to put myself in a position for her to acknowledge me, but each time I felt invisible.   


At that point I was just irritated. I have been trying to read her, but whats the point. I felt like she didnt even see me today. I could think she might be nervous, but its probably better to just decided she doesnt like me? Seems like she must have decided to give me the silent treatment and I there is no way I can really be sure why. Other then its her way of saying no..  


My brain is telling me to move on, but I'm going to need work on that a little, because I keep have ""what if next time"" pop in my head. But screw that, that is what I thought that last two times.

I don't like dating apps but I thought it might be my best option. I don't have very good pictures of myself, just a few selfies. However on CMB I am getting a fair number of matches anyway.   
    

The trouble is, once the conversations start things seem to go downhill for me. I'm a pretty good conversationalist, and put effort and thought into the messages. I've tried asking everything from silly things I happened to be thinking about to deeper questions about family, faith, philosophy. A few people have shown interest initially, but really quite minor levels of interest. I feel like even when the other person engaging in the conversation, I am still doing most to all of the work. Few women I've matched with have asked me any questions about myself or shifted the topic in an interesting way. Many of these are highly educated, sometimes even ivy league educated women who can CERTAINLY teach me a thing or two, but don't seem interested in that. That is probably a hint that they just aren't that interested in ME and not interested in meeting up for an in person date.   
    
  

I am wondering if anyone has tips for getting from MATCH to DATE, because I feel like my in person personality can shine through and I'll have a much better shot of capturing someone's interests at that point :) I think most of the women get a lot more matches than me, so they are probably less interested and invested in our text convos than I am.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,943930,public,self,Having trouble with dating apps,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p0j7e0/having_trouble_with_dating_apps/,all_ads,6,,,

She's younger than me, still in college, and can't legally drink yet. She's 20 and I'm 23 with a full time job in finance and I also play in 2 bands. 

We had been talking since the end of March so a while. We went on 3 dates. Should've been on 6 dates but my mom had a heart attack so I cancelled, then the girl I'm talking about got covid 19, and then the one we had planned last week had to get cancelled because the girl fainted 2 days before &amp; had to see a doctor. She posted about it so I knew she was being truthful about that 

For the last month, she has backed away a bit but is responsive whenever we do talk. Hell she even accepted my date plans for last week before she fainted. 

I got a little tired of this limbo feeling. I have feelings for this girl and was tired of this uncertainty I was getting. 

I flat out asked her where her head was at before I initiate anything else. I was tired of always making the first move especially when our communication patterns weren't one sided before. It was hard for me to tell if she was dropping a hint or not since she was responsive and even accepted a date when she started creating space. 

4 days ago I finally just put it on her, I had to. We had talked about hangin out this week and I told her I wanted to see where her head was at before I initiated anything.

She said it was hard for her to come see me since I live an hour away and that she is content with her friends in her life and is traveling for the next few weekends. So she isn't even gonna be in town.  

She then told me she ""needed space from this relationship for a little"" but I don't know what that means, since we didn't date exclusively. I told her thank you for being honest about what she needed. 

I told her if she didn't wanna talk at all it was cool &amp; understandable, no harm no foul. I wanted to know if it was space or if she wanted to cut ties completely. I told her I didn't want any energy wasted on either end and just wanted to know, so energy isn't wasted.  

She got angry and said ""I've literally said it so many times now. I just need space rn. Thank you"". 

I didn't reply and haven't talked to her in 4 days since this conversation and I don't plan on it for a while. I had feelings for this girl but knew I wasn't ready to full on date her. However I did think about her and no doubt was interested in feeling his out more with her. 

She just moved to the state I live in less than a year ago. She's making new friends and she's also younger so I get it. Just feel a bit lost and confused and blaming myself.

I used to be handsome but I really think recently I did not age well, my face is fatter, I have a stomach, and I still have a missing tooth I did not replace but my dating profile attracts hundreds of hot women. When I meet them they often seem disappointed, although I did post recent pictures.

I went on a date with a very beautiful woman two days ago. She was even hotter than on her pictures. Super cute and very sexy body. When we met I was waiting in front of the restaurant and she texted me asking what I was wearing. When I told her she disappeared for 10 min. I though she was ghosting me because she saw me and thought I was ugly but she ended up showing up.
When she showed up she was very respectful but it felt like she looked disappointed. We had a drink or two. The conversation was ok but not exceptional, she told me I was handsome but it did not seem genuine.

I really felt like she did not want to stay in the restaurant so we took the bill and I walked her back to her car. Her car was parked where I parkef mine.

I am not rich but my car looks good. When I stood beside my car she asked me: what are we doing now? I was surprised by the question. Long story short she got in my car and we drove to my place.

On the way there she told me she just got out of a long distance relationship and was annoyed by dating apps and the 21 questions because she just wanted to fuck. I was surprised because she looked like relationship material.

Arrivred home we had drinks, we talked but after a while she clearly lost interest and said she needed to go back home. I tried to get closer, kiss her but she rejected me.
Right when we were at the door, she was standing and I was sitting on a chair and I asked her: didnt you say you wanted to fuck? We are now, let's just fuck.
I had my hands below her dress and I was grabbing her ass. I told her: ok let me go down on you, I am just gonna make you cum, no need for sex. She accepted. We went to my bed and of course I madr her cum because I am good at it and we had sex. She told me I was amazing in bed.

So a couple of days after, I text her. No response. Ghosted.
Why? She said she wanted a friend with benefits. She was impressed by my sexual performance. But she ghosted me.

So I have this feeling every woman I meet finds me ugly but fuckable. How is that possible that women do this? Do women really have sex with guys they don't find attractive? I don't understand it.

Any woman out there can tell me what this is about? I need to say the woman was a black woman and I am a black man, and yes I do have a big d** and she liked it. But why not coming back if that's what she likes? I don't get it. 
I also have a good personality so i am not a dushbag etc. My impression is that she is afraid of falling for me because i had many women before tell me that. But what is wrong with me and they arr afraid of ending up with me? Is it because I am fuckable but not as hot as they want their partner to be? Is it because i am kinda broke for my age? I am trying to understand because I dont want to go on more dates now, was it pity sex? 






 I don't own a property, just an apartment and I don't have a wealthy job, I also have an accent. But I have a nice car, I am an entrepreneur and I have lots of matches on dating apps based on pictures from years ago and some recent ones. I used to be cuter when I was young but now I am uglier but more muscular.

The only problem is that when I meet my matches they seem disappointed, almost like I go from a 8 to a 5.
