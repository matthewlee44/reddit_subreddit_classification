0,qe8cts,1635007211,Tip: Adding a video of you talking to your Tinder profile can really boost your matches,"I previously used Tinder with just regular selfies of myself. I got matches, but it was maybe 2-3 per day at most. I decided to make a new account, but make a video as my main for what people would see when they swipe. I went from 2-3 per day to 30-40 matches per day. I asked quite a few of them ""what made you match me?"" and each of them said it was the video. Hearing my voice made it feel more personal and set me apart from everyone else who only had pictures.

In the video, you have 15 seconds. My video was simple. I used one of those Snapchat question games that gives you a random question, answered it, and then added it on Tinder. They seemed to really like it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qe8cts/tip_adding_a_video_of_you_talking_to_your_tinder/

I’m not opposed to dating someone who has seen a therapist or is currently seeing one. About a year and a half ago I was in a pretty serious relationship that ended badly. I was devastated so I started seeing a therapist and took myself off the dating market until I felt like I could be emotionally available to someone. Now that I’m back in the dating field, I have noticed that within the first few dates people unload their trauma often through no prompting. I’ve been accused of being too kind and that someone is going to hurt me. People have projected their experiences onto me and I don’t really appreciate it. I’m not them and they are not me. I’m not opposed to dating someone with a traumatic past at all but I just feel like most of the people I am going out with have such emotional baggage that even trying to get to know them is hard. That’s definitely not someone that I want to settle down with or have kids with if they have trouble letting me in from the start. Has anyone else ran into this?

3,qe8tdb,1635008593,Successfully got eharmony refund,"So I've had the subscription for three days. This website is ridiculous. Obviously, I'm not naive enough to think their algorithm is literally 'scientific' or whatever, but I did assume that if I paid some money I'd be more likely to find serious guys looking for a real relationship. I still think that might be the case, but this is by far the worst matchmaking service I've come across, and they were going through charge me $50 on a monthly basis.

As far as relevant demographics go: I am a gay man, late 20s, right outside Albany, NY. I'm a manufacturer interested in nearby dudes with similar occupations, but I have very few hangups otherwise (e.g., race, height, etc. are all left blank in search parameters). I'm really not being picky or weird here, just looking for somebody who lives in more or less the same world I live in.

I got 5 matches my first day. Of those, one was located in another state. Before I paid for my subscription, I had a free account in that other state, so I'm not surprised that it wound up being ""carried over"" into my premium matches. However, his was the only profile I was remotely compatible with, as he was an assembler and a handsome dude.

One of the other 5 matches had no photos whatsoever—well, I am neither naive nor new to the wonderful, wonderful world of online dating, and I am sure as hell not interested in anybody who can't put up a single face pic on a paid dating site. The other three were all from white collar backgrounds, with interests and backgrounds that bear no resemblance or relation whatsoever to my own. Over the next two days, I received exactly zero new matches.

When I first emailed to complain, I was told to modify my search criteria in order to cast a wider net. Specifically, I'm now expected to go galavanting across the country to go on dates—because, again, the only actual search criterion I had was distance.... and I live in the friggin capital of New York. I don't have the time or the resources to be taking weekly trips to Virginia for coffee dates that probably won't lead anywhere. Nor am I interested in a long distance relationship that we all know is not going to work out.

I have had WAY better luck with Tinder, Plenty of Fish, and even Grindr. It is absurd to me that eHarmony has been able to get away with charging obscene amounts of money for such a lousy service, all while boasting that their algorithm is the divine Logos immanently actualizing the eschaton one preordained match at a time.

I'm glad they gave me my refund after a few emails, because I was about ready to start saying some very nasty stuff. But I am still pretty frustrated, and I decided to share this here because it seemed like a better idea than having a stroke on my couch. On to the next one, I guess.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qe8tdb/successfully_got_eharmony_refund/

I went to a party last night because my season just ended. My friend wanted to help me talk to some girls. He told me to follow him around while he talked. Even that was too scary. I was worried that one of them might try to talk to me or even touch me. 

At one point I was sitting on the couch. Two girls came up to me and introduced themselves. Honestly they were kinda okay looking but not my type at all. They asked me about my sport and asked me what class I was in. I said I was a freshman and one of the girls said she’s a freshman too. I didn’t really know what to say so I just said “that’s crazy.” Then they asked me where I was from and told me where they were from. Again, I didn’t know what to say so I just said “that’s crazy.” I didn’t want to talk to them they were really intimidating and the conversation was boring and I couldn’t think of anything to say. I was really pissed off after this interaction because I was shaking so much and I was so boring and lame. I put them off. 

I truly am at my wits end. I have tried everything. I can’t initiate conversations with girls and I can’t hold one once it’s started. I think I’m the only person on earth with this problem. At least I’ve never met anyone like me. I case you still don’t understand I’m gonna make an analogy. Imagine trying to run without legs. That’s how I feel talking to girls.

He always told me that he liked me but the problem was that he is having a rough time. If I get upset that he is not giving me attention, he will call me sensitive and emotional.

I met a girl on tinder 3 weeks ago, we had some small talk and I asked her out and she agreed and we exchanged IGs. I told her that I am very busy this week and would take her out next weekend. I didn’t texted her for a week as I was very busy but last weekend I did asked her for a date that Saturday. 

On the day of the date, we both wanted to try this amazing Italian place so we decided to go there. I asked her if she would like to walk around the area before the dinner as I didn’t wanted to get in a formal dining setting right away (it’s a very nice st with lots of shops and outdoor seating restaurants). But then due to reservation timing issue, we had to directly meet at the restaurant. I felt that the date went pretty great. We drank, we ate a lot, we laughed, at one point I changed my seat from across the table to next to her and we were having a banter about music choices and I made sure that she was comfortable by the change in distance. She is just so sweet, smart and adorable that by the end of the dinner I was much more attracted to her than I was going into the date. Then we walked around the place for a while she tried to remember where she parked, we were still having good conversations and laughing. I really wanted to hold her hands by this point but she never removed her hand from her jacket as she was feeling quite cold, so I didn’t try. She offered to drop me off as I don’t have a car and we simply hugged and exchanged numbers. 

After this we texted each other on a daily basis but as both of us are quite busy on weekdays it was not long conversations but we were connected and sharing daily events and sharing some banter. We made plans to meet again this weekend. We specifically chose Friday as she didn’t have to go to work on Saturday (she sometimes work on Saturdays) so that she is not worried about office early morning the next day. We decided to meet on this one street in downtown and try out some bars and then maybe go for ice cream . As Friday came, I was very excited about this date as I thought I could have a great connection with her. 

2nd date: We decided to meet at 7. And she texted me on time that she has left her place. As I am a very punctual person I reached there at 6:50 and after waiting for like half an hour I got a text from her that she is unable to find a parking and has been circling around the area for like the past 20 mins. I get into the car with her outside a parking garage and we decide to park at this really shady lot. At this point she is noticeably irritated and is clearly not in a mood for the date and saying “she will leave early”. I understand that she has had a long day at work and then the parking situation really pissed her off (she had expressed concerns about parking situation in downtown before the date). I thought it was partly my fault as well as I did not plan well. That’s why i didn’t made much out of it as I understood her frustrations completely. I hoped as the date might progress when we eat and drink, she might feel better. But now she is not in the mood to eat or drink anything. We walked a bit and then went to a outdoor seating bar where some live music was playing. We talked but it was nothing too interesting or we just reiterating things about first date. I was so hungry but I didn’t wanted to sit and eat a pizza while she watches me. When the server came, she just asked for water and I ordered a drink for myself as I didn’t wanted to sit there and just order water. I am still trying my best to engage her but it doesn’t work very well. So of-course this date went pretty bad and she decided to leave after 1.5hr as she is now feeling sleepy, i suggest that it’s still quite early and we can checkout the ice cream place, but she is not in the mood. Again she offered to drop me off even after I insisted that I will take the uber and she doesn’t need to go in the opposite direction. 

By this point, I was a bit frustrated as well as I had imagined this date to be even better than the first one as she seemed interested as well in the messaging. When she dropped me off, she nicely said that “it was nice and thank you” and I replied with the same and after a very awkward hug I went back to my building. (I was back in my apartment at 9:15 🥲). She did suggest that we could hang out again and i asked what’s her availability over the weekend but decided to discuss it later over text. I was not sure what to text her after this kind of date. By the time i was thinking she texted that she has reached home and she had a nice time. To which i replied that I would love to hangout with her again sometime and she should let me know if she’s available in the near future. And also said sorry about choosing downtown. (I don’t have a car, so i really don’t know about these parking struggles).

29,qebhmz,1635016718,What should my (30F) preferred age range should be?,"Let me just start with saying that I’ve tried it all and now looking for some input from others. 

My true preferred age range is 30-37. And I get the least amount of likes from guys when I set it to that. And yeah yeah yeah someone will say it so here it goes: it’s cause these guys all want 20 year olds. K thanks. 

Anyways moving on. 

The very few likes that I do get from guys in that age range are not AT ALL what I’m looking for. And I know people are gonna say I need to just accept “what I can get” but I’m talking like MAJOR lifestyle discrepancies (among other things) between myself and these people to the point where I wonder if being single is even that bad when compared to dating someone you have to compromise on literally every single thing on. 

So one day I was like okay you know what I look a lot younger than my age, like by 5-6 years - due to my lifestyle but mostly genetics (both my parents look a decade younger). So I was like I’m open to dating a younger guy (one who’s mature and has his life together). So I changed my age range to 25-37 and my phone blew up with likes from SUPER hot guys, like all USC grads and everything and I was like ok wow! Some were trying to be causal but most were open to a relationship. 

I’ve tried setting it to older too like up to 40. I don’t typically get likes from guys 37-40 though. I think it’s probably cause there’s fewer guys in this age range on dating apps or maybe they’re also trying to get with 20 years lol, who knows. But it’s fine cause I don’t even desire guys in this age range anyways. 

I still feel really bummed out that I can’t attract guys my own age or what is believed to be appropriate for me. 

I know people are gonna tell me I need to stop complaining because I’m getting likes and matched anyways but like…. It’s not from what I want. Like I don’t understand what’s so unusual about, for example, a 34 year old guy with a 30 year old woman?? Why aren’t guys in that age group interested? 

Does nobody just want a 30 year old woman anymore???? Women in their 30s date and marry allll the time lol with guys their own age too. So what’s going on?? If I’m so “undesirable” how am I getting hot, educated 27 year old dudes trying to date me but can’t do it with someone who’s just slightly older.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qebhmz/what_should_my_30f_preferred_age_range_should_be/

Two months ago we started dating, and we have had a few bumps but things have mostly been amazing, I feel like we usually have great communication and I usually feel comfortable talking to him about anything. We are doing long-distance at the moment and we haven't seen each other in just over a month, but we a lot of our initial bonding happened after we stopped being in the same place. Earlier in the week, I got to meet up with a mutual friend for the first time in almost 7 months. He is like a mentor figure to me and my boyfriend and has been a great support for us when one of us was struggling. Since my boyfriend is in another state right now he seemed a bit sad he wasn't able to meet up with this friend and me. I was texting him about it after the fact and he told me it wasn't my fault or anything he was upset it was just his own feelings which I understood. Then he just left me on read. I checked in two or three times but he just ignored me for over 24 hours which is super abnormal for us. Especially since that is one of the only ways we have to connect is over text/call. We usually text pretty much 24/7 with gaps when someone is sleeping/working. It has been that way long before we even started dating so I thought it was very out of character. He eventually reached out and told me he had realized something ""huge and staggering"" and was angry at everyone. He also told me to please not go find another partner but he was going to need time and he didn't want to hurt me while he was processing. I understand sometimes people need space but it's hard not to take it personally when he was capable of posting on his Instagram story but could spend two seconds to text and tell me he couldn't talk. He told me he would reach out when he was ready, and I feel like I don't want to put my life on hold for him because I don't even know what is going on.

35,qeco9n,1635020400,Unpopular opinion: I think modern dating is actually wonderful. People just have the wrong expectations about what it's supposed to be.,"Whenever I hear people talk about how modern dating has ""destroyed relationships,"" and how we live in a culture of endless options and people being disposable... I get that perspective, but often feel the flip-side is missing. 

*Traditional dating was far worse.*

This concept of thinking all of our grandparents stayed together because Instagram didn't exist does not tell the full story. My grandparents are in their 80s and have been together all their lives. He was an abusive alcoholic who beat her, cheated on her, and demeaned her but she stayed with him because she couldn't afford to leave. On top of that, divorce was shunned.

I'm not saying that was *every* traditional relationship, but it was many.

We're in an age of so much opportunity, and I genuinely feel our culture likes to shift the blame instead of looking inward. LGBT+ people can now get married, people into alt relationship structures can find their people, hell farmers can even find their people! Women can financially support themselves, people don't have to stay in physically/mentally abusive relationships because of religion, family shunning, or finances. 

Are there issues? Of course. Have we over-corrected in some areas? Yes, absolutely. But this is the most opportunity we've ever had in human history to actually improve the quality of our lives. Mental health is not stigmatized, you can create at-home workouts, information on events/meetups/hobby groups are a few clicks away. The opportunity is there. 

Despite what people think, most people are average and most people are not living their entire lives online. Most people find love, most people get married, most people aren't out here only dating supermodels or rich people or famous people.

Everytime I've read a post here about someone's dating struggles and they've said they ""tried everything,"" I often ask some follow-up questions and turns out, they've barely tried anything.

Keeping it real here, the problem isn't (just) people's standards. The problem is people aren't leaving their houses. They're not socializing. They're not trying. They're not starting conversations with people, *in person*, yes, *not just online*. We *all* know that dating apps have lopsided experiences, make people more superficial and aren't the best way to find lasting connections. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing *over and over and over* again and expecting different results. 

(I'm not saying you can't use them or they can't be a backup, I realize they work for some but my only point is that if they're not working for you, you might have to try other avenues where your more attractive qualities can get extended interaction)

* Here's a possible experiment I encourage anyone to do over the next week or so: Go to a few new places alone. Maybe happy hour at a bar, or a workout group, or an open mic, whatever you're into. Make it a goal to strike up random conversation with anyone who looks open to it, could be the weather, hobbies, what you're drinking, music, sports, etc. 50% of those people have to be people you're NOT physically attracted to. 

See how easy it is. Try. See how receptive many people will genuinely be to casual conversation. Don't just do it once and give up. Try 20 new people. Then take that same casual energy, and apply it to people in the future you find attractive. Report back with the results.

When you break free from this toxic internet word making you believe everyone is and thinks a certain way, you'll realize that as a culture, we are overcomplicating this and despite the flaws with modern dating, this is the BEST time ever to be living.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeco9n/unpopular_opinion_i_think_modern_dating_is/

40,qed2ax,1635021631,"Is she interested in a longer term relationship and if so, should I continue to take it slow?","So here’s the deal: I (24 M) met a girl (21) at a bar in late June through a friend of a friend. A bunch of people showed up who neither of us knew so we wound up talking all night. Before she left, she asked for my number and then texted me when she got home. I eventually asked her out for a drink, it went well, and the second or third time we got drinks she said that she wasn’t looking for anything serious because she had gotten out of a 3 year relationship 3 months prior and they were very co dependent. I said I understood but we continued to talk and got drinks a few more times. We were both living with our parents at the time so neither of us could really invite the other inside. After getting drinks like 5 or 6 times over 2 months, I moved to the city and immediately invited her to stay over, an offer which she enthusiastically accepted. She works like 20 minutes from my apartment so she came over right after work, so at around 4pm, and we spent the rest of the night and following morning together. This was the beginning of September. Fast forward to now, she has come over almost every Friday after work, with us either making dinner, ordering takeout, or going out to dinner. When we’re together, she’s clearly very into me and obviously I’m very into her. When we’re not together, she takes an annoying amount of time to respond to simple texts (like sometimes 24 hours). It’s not like I’m inundating her with texts, as I want to give her space, seeing as things picked up pretty quickly. Plus, she has a lot going on in her life right now. I try not to let her lack of responsiveness bother me, as she is a genuinely nice person, but it does and causes me to overthink every little thing I send.

As I said, I’m very into her and she’s clearly very into me (when we’re together), and at this point I can say I would want a more serious relationship with her in the future. When she’s not around, my friends and roommates have referred to her as my girlfriend and I’ll always clarify that she is not my girlfriend. A few of my friends have expressed shock/confusion when I say that I haven’t talked to her about being exclusive/the status of our relationship in general. This is another thing that has caused me to overthink.

So, I guess the point of my post is: how should I interpret her lack of responsiveness over text and how should I move forward in regards to the status of our relationship? I’m thinking I should give it another few weeks before I address it.

41,qeda4s,1635022339,This was a date right?,"So I went out with my highschool crush, which is pretty insane to begin with bc I’ve known her for like 4ish years but never hung out, but we went to dinner, walked around, and we were out for around like 6 hours or so. I was somewhat touchy although she had some like major procedure done and I accidentally touched a sensitive spot and she screamed in pain lol, so I was scared after that but she said she didn’t mind it as long as I was careful. It was lots of joking, I complimented her, let her know that I found her attractive or whatever, and she even gave me some compliments that I’ve never gotten before. 

I paid for the dinner too and she offered to pay, but I just told her she could pay next time or something. She said yes to going out again next week and she was really thankful for everything, and she said she almost cried bc where I took her was so beautiful. She took pictures of the view and of her food bc she said she was gonna show her family which I thought was cute. 

Overall, it was a pretty good date but I’m just wish I would’ve made some solid moves but it is what it is.

Anyway, on this second date we were gonna do dinner then a movie. She was late getting ready so we went to the movie first and it was clear she put a lot of effort into looking good. It was kind of awkward at the beginning bc the movies were really crowded and we didn’t really get much of a chance to break the ice again bc it was loud and hard to talk. She was really quiet too and texting her friends a lot during the commercials before the movie. 

Anyway after we got out of the movie, we were walking over to the restaurant to have dinner (like a 5 min walk) and she pulls out her phone and calls back her friend that had been texting her. As she’s talking to her friend she’s like “oh no he broke with you??!!” And then she whispers to me “I have to go.” She gets off the phone and says her best friend just got broken up with so she needed to go and comfort her. It was obviously a way for her to get out of the date.

I walk her back to her car and she’s like “I feel so bad!” And all this bullshit when it was clearly fake bc she didn’t even text me the day after. I don’t know the whole thing just pissed me off. Ya it was a little awkward at first but I wasn’t rude at all, I told her how great she looked, and tried getting to know her a bit more but she was just so quiet.

I'm 21, I'm working on myself and my confidence, I'd say I'm above average in looks and social skills, but I didn't have a man figure in my life, and I suppose that's the problem. My girlfriend told me I was being needy, indecisive, not leading enough and sometimes feminine even though I tried my best to improve. Sadly, I wasn't masculine enough to make this relationship work, even though I tried my best with this girl.

My sister had introduced me to a guy about a month ago. They were pretty good friends. Great guy, super nice, successful business man and super successful. Everything was going very well. He was out of state working on a business project so things were very busy and stressful for him. He’s an active Bitcoin trader, very confident, and even helped my grow my savings an extra 10k in the matter of two weeks. Later on he told me that when he was struggling financially with his business he took out a loan in upgrades to trade Bitcoin, paid it off within a month, and started making huge profits. He kept suggesting that idea to me so I could pay my mortgage early but I told him I was a bit uncomfortable. We had this conversation three times, the last time I tried to nicely explain my situation, that although it makes sense to him, it’s too risky for me. English is his second language so maybe he couldn’t really understand it through text. He let it go but the next day he ghosted me mid conversation. Never texted me back. My sister, who was good friends with him was trying to check up on him sent him a message. He ended up blocking us both! I’m left so confused, is he really going to stop talking to me over something so minor? And stop being friends with my sister over this? He didn’t make any money from helping me trade, it was purely out of his kindness, so I didn’t think he was trying to scam me. I don’t want to make any excuses for him, if he’s maybe stressed with work and wanted to block everyone out, but that doesn’t justify it.

We've always known of each other but never really interacted because she's a few years younger than myself so there just wasn't really any reason for us to interact when we knew each other as kids. 

At the party I felt we really hit it off and just had a great time catching up.  She stated that we should ""hang out more"" and then basically texted me her number. When she left for the night, she told me ""don't lose that number"" in a way that I honestly can't tell if it was flirty or just friendly. I should add I was also pretty intoxicated at that point. 

I'm very much attracted to her and I definitely enjoyed speaking with her. The next day I thought about asking her out but ultimately pretty much just erred on the side of the caution and assumed she was just being friendly. 

But a few hours ago, she texted me a picture of us that I don't remember taking. I'm not sure if right now would be a good time to ask her out or not.

her friend then comes to my dept n questions me for 5 mins if it is actually a date or no 😂

I met my GF 5 years ago while we were both pursuing a very challenging career... We bonded through all the shit that this career path put us through and we honestly wouldn't be where we are today without each other. She would literally do anything for me and I'd do anything for her...and I honestly couldn't see myself raising kids or growing old with anyone else... 

During all this time, something's that been tough is how much she hates my family. My family is very different from hers or that of her previous relationships and this has led to a lot of problems over the years. 

While her family openly shows gratitude and is very giving, mine is reserved...so she doesn't get those things with mine. As a result, she's builds resentment over things like them not openly thanking her for what shes done for me... I understand how this sucks for her, so through the years I've tried to mediate any misunderstandings. There was this time two years ago when her and one of my family members talked things through and it finally seemed like everything was going to be okay...this was the happiest I'd felt in a really long time, but a week later she was already bad mouthing this family member. It just really sucks being caught in the middle, especially when nothing seems to change... She still refers to them as my shitty family. 

My family is far from perfect and I do acknowledge their wrong doings but her hate for them is what's toxic. It affects her too, I know she doesn't want to feel that way, but she does and I know it affects her mental health. We may be doing wonderful but if she stumbles upon something that reminds her of a certain family member, she'll distance herself from me because I'm associated with them. 

I honestly don't know if there's any mending this. I am either happy in the relationship or happy at home but not both. My parents have sacrificed a ton for me...and I hate pushing them away, but this relationship has caused me to do that. I hide texts from family members as if I was hiding an affair... I wasn't there for my family in critical times when I know they needed me because I was too worried to pick up in front of her...

I just want to feel at peace, that's really all I want...as much as I love her and care for her, I don't know if continuing on is the best. I could really use any words of advice.

TLDR; gf I care for very much hates my family, idk if I can fix, makes me distance myself from family, idk what to do",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qefiqg/she_hates_my_family_and_its_draining_me/

89,qegagl,1635032321,Called a guy (19M) a POS (20F) for leading me on,"Over a year ago I (20F) met this guy (19M) on vacation. He and I live in different countries, and there is a small language barrier between us, but we still got along really well. We hung out for multiple days for several hours at a time. While on the trip, he met some other people our age, and they would go to the bars at night. He invited me to come, and so I did.

I met the other teenagers, and they were all really friendly. One guy (19M) in particular was very friendly, and we'll call him Guy B to avoid any confusion. I had to sit down on a couch because I was getting a bit drunk, to the point where I was almost falling asleep, and Guy B sat down next to me. He put his hand around my waist and placed my head on his chest. I left early, but everyone else was still there. Guy B started talking about how he wanted to get with me. Guy A got mad at Guy B and pushed him, telling him that he couldn't have me. When Guy B asked why, he told him that it was because he liked me.

And of course, as any teenager would, the next morning, they all told me. They did nothing wrong; that's what teenagers are going to do. But I got really excited because I liked him too, and before he left, I asked him if he liked me. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the whole time.

I was bummed out that he was with someone else, but I hoped that we could be social media friends at least. I sent him a request on Instagram, and he left it pending for about two weeks before rejecting it. That's when I knew that he didn't want me in his life. I have to admit, it really hurt, but I understand that he was trying to do the right thing for his girlfriend. Even if he did like me, he needed to distance himself in order to fight for his relationship. I just wish he hadn't gotten my hopes up like that.

Two months after he and I met, he broke up with his girlfriend. He then started being all over my social media, watching my Instagram stories and my TikToks multiple times. He still hasn't reached out to me, though. But the reason why I know that he still likes me is because he still talks to the other kids we met on vacation. They tell me that he thinks about me everyday, and that he's sorry for what he did to me. And that he fantasizes about having a future with me. Eventually, I had enough. Why couldn't he tell me himself that he likes me? I told them that I think that he's a POS, and one of them ended up telling him. He was crushed that I thought that about him, but that he still hopes for a future with me.

I know he felt badly about leading me on like that, and he still likes me, so I wonder if I'm wrong for calling him that or if I should be happy to call him out on his BS?

Tl;dr: guy I met on vacation led me on, only for him to have a girlfriend the whole time. Because he liked me, he cut off all contact with me. He broke up with his girlfriend, and now wants me back. He tells a bunch of our friends to tell me that he still thinks about me.

91,qeglb9,1635033363,I (21M) am interested in a coworker (19F) and looking for help.,"I work at a fast food restaurant and this girl recently transferred to my store. I found her attractive but we went around 2-3 weeks before talking to each other. It was random, but one day we both started talking and really hit it off. We talked for a majority of our shift and she eventually decided to give me a nickname. Ever since then we both talk a lot when we are working together. We have now been talking for around 3 weeks.  I have a lot of fun and I am very comfortable around her. She also makes sure to say hi to me whenever either of us clock in. One time I didn’t say hi, cause we were extremely busy, and she found me later and complained that I didn’t say hello. She also seems to be comfortable around me. She randomly will speak in accents or do little dances when she is around me. She also will say my name in funny ways when she sees me. I also recently learned that both of us are going to the same university, which is why she transferred to my store. On top of that, both of us are interested in the same major/careers. However, her school workload is way more than mine, she is taking 20 credits and I’m at 13. Which means that she only works 2-3 days of the week, so we don’t work together often. One day when I clocked in she asked me about my day, and I went disc golfing earlier at our campus. She said that disc golfing seems interesting to her but she is really bad at throwing discs. Now in my head I really wanted to invite her to play with me but in the moment I decided not to. I was really kicking myself later on, but it is what it is. I really want to ask her to hang out with me outside of work sometime, but we haven’t worked together in a little over a week. I would just like some input on a couple things. She is a really social person and talks to a lot of people, but the stuff I mentioned above are things I think are unique to me. I was just wondering if you guys think she might be interested in me? I think there is a chance, but not entirely sure. Also, I was planning on asking her if she would be interested in joining me for a round of disc golf when I see her next. However, I know that it might not be the most ideal place for a first time hang out. I was just thinking that since she said she was interested and the course is within walking distance from where she lives, but still not sure. I just don’t know where else to suggest as a hang out spot. Lastly, I am going to a Halloween party and was considering inviting her. It would be mainly my friends, so mostly guys, and a few of the girls that live around my apartment. I wasn’t going to invite her unless we hung out before the party, so we can get to know each other more first. Also, I would also invite any friends that she wanted to bring. Sorry that this wasn’t the shortest or most well written piece but I just need to clear some thoughts. Also another thing, I don’t have a ton of experience with dating. Most of my previous ”relationships“ lasted about a month and the longest being back in high school at 4 months. Looking forward to your input! Let me know if you have any questions or if I can clear anything up!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeglb9/i_21m_am_interested_in_a_coworker_19f_and_looking/
92,qegnql,1635033585,Should I ask her what I did wrong?,"So last weekend I went on my second date with this girl. We have been texting for about three weeks previously (almost on a daily basis). On the date, it seemed like she had a great time! We laughed, joked around, and she even gave me a BJ and complimented how I looked downstairs. On the drive back, she kissed me goodnight and, when I texted her after I got back home, she said that she’d give me an even better BJ next time. 

But, suddenly, the messages stopped. It’s been a week since i saw her and she only messaged me 3 times. Plus, she turned off her location on snap maps (which she had on before for me). 

At this point, I’ve come to terms that I did something wrong and she’s not interested in me any more. I get that. But what exactly I DID that made her not want to see me has been driving me insane this past week. I keep on wondering what I said, or didn’t say, that made her suddenly seem disinterested.  So, I was thinking about just reaching out and asking her for some clarification. 

Honestly, I’m trying to get back out there after a 4 year relationship and I just want to know what I did wrong so I won’t make the same mistake again. 

Do you think I should reach out? I’d love some advice",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qegnql/should_i_ask_her_what_i_did_wrong/
93,qego5a,1635033612,How do I ask out a girl that works with me?,"So I’m in love with her unfortunately. And I want to ask her out so bad, but the thing is that I don’t want her to quit her job because of me (since she’s been there for over a year and likes her job), or be awkward with me to the point of avoiding me all the time. I also kind of need that job in the mean time because of the flexibility of going to school. I asked out a girl who worked with me in the past, but she rejected me and she quit because of me (it was literally a few days after I asked her out). I don’t want that to happen again, and I’m so traumatized. I’m a really nice guy, so she didn’t see my value till I stopped talking to her. Then a few weeks past by, and she was finally into me. I’m just scared from my past events with that girl.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qego5a/how_do_i_ask_out_a_girl_that_works_with_me/

I've (20F) been crushing on a classmate (21M) of mine for the past few months, and I would really like to spend some alone time with him. I can't be 100% sure, but I feel like he might be catching onto how I feel. Because of this, I'm not sure if I should just come out and ask to get coffee as a date or if I should frame it as getting to know him better. 
I have no experience with this personally, I've only confessed to 4 people and have never dated. I feel a little disingenuous not telling him I want it to be a date, but I also don't want to scare him away 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you~",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeh0r9/hang_out_vs_date/
96,qeh2zm,1635035064,Will working with my (19f) “ex” (20m) bring back old feelings?,"

Hi everyone! This summer I (19f) met a guy (20m) at work, and we became close. I started crushing, and two weeks before I left for school I told him about my feelings. He was very professional about everything and we agreed to talk about it more when I left. After leaving the job he asked me out and we went on about 6 dates. Everything was going great, and I really fell for him and vice versa. However, once school got super busy I started to be really hot and cold with him. I was really stressed with school and my mental health definitely started to suffer. That resulted in me being constantly busy and not communicating with him as much. I realized that it isn’t fair to him to keep this relationship going so I had to break it off. But I made sure to clearly let him know that it was all on me, and that it was nothing about him. I let him know everything that I was going through mentally, and luckily he completely understood. He took it as well as I could have hoped and we ended things on good terms.

Here’s the thing, in December I’m gonna go back to work with him just for a couple weeks. I need a job when I’m on break from school, and that job pays so well I have to go back. When I broke things off with him I let him know that I’m looking forward to working with him again, but I would understand if he didn’t want to be around me at that time. He said that he wouldn’t avoid me if we do work together.

While I know we can be professional at work, do you think working with him will bring back those serious feelings? I still have feelings for him, but I realize that I’m not in a headspace to date right now. I assume that my feelings won’t be too strong by then, but could being around him more often again cause problems?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeh2zm/will_working_with_my_19f_ex_20m_bring_back_old/
97,qeh86l,1635035578,can we talk about expectations for one minute? i'm not trying to bash anyone but i want to point out to women how high some of their expectations are.,"lets do some math here. let say u want a guy who is tall, attractive, confident, intelligent, has a stable job and is not a womanizer. seems pretty basic right, but lets consider that essentially every woman is looking for these qualities and now lets do the math on how many guys actually fit this criteria. well it depends what u mean by tall if u want a guy above 5'10 thats 60% of guys your eliminating off the bat if u want a guy above 6'0 thats nearly 85% of guys your eliminating off the bat. but he also should be attractive well most men arent exactly attractive so we'll say 25% if men meet this criteria. and u want him to be confident hard to quantify but most men arent exactly confident i would say so we'll say 40% of men meet that expectation. and he cant be dumb and should be at least a little smart well id say no less than 75% dont qualify as smart. most men have a stable job but if u want him to also have a high paying job or a college education then thats again like 75% of men being eliminated. so lets do this math here. .4x.4x.25x.25x.25=.0025% yes a quarter of 1% of men meet this criteria and this does not include personality compatibility either, and thats using generous numbers. the amount of men who meet the criteria that most women are willing to settle for is outrageously small and i dont think most women totally understand this. for every guy you see in society some women will end up with him. unless ur an incredibly attractive woman there is simply no way u can expect what a lot of women seem to. im really not trying to bash women im just pointing out this to women because i think it is holding a lot of them back from finding a serious relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeh86l/can_we_talk_about_expectations_for_one_minute_im/

Fast-forward 2 years. Reconnected. This meeting happened last weekend. It was planned a week in advance, met up for food then coffee &amp; walk by the waterfront. Lasted only a couple hours. Laughed a lot. Talked about life updates. Casual conversations. Anyway, what are some things that when discussed during a meet up would absolutely rule out it being a date? Or actions? Or follow-up? Not trying to overthink, but just looking for some thoughts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qehfha/how_do_you_know_its_a_date_and_not_just_friends/
99,qehqp8,1635037485,"Second date went well, but third date ‘maybe next week’…","In short,
Had a fantastic second date as 39M with 27F, we were touching each other a lot.
She teased and let me feel her tummy asking if she was fit enough.
She suggested that we should go and see an art exhibition for the third date.
We didn’t kiss but I hugged her saying that I like her.
She said multiple times that she is looking for ‘an intelligent guy of my age’.

The day after ofc I fucked up and sent a message saying again that I really like her and that I think she’s special.
We exchanged friendly messages with some flirty emojis included.

I asked her out for next week but she replied today that she was really busy but that maybe next week she would be available.
Did I move too fast? Has she lost interest?

Edit: we exchanged some more friendly messages.
Turns out she had a major headache this morning and that she was super tired.
However we still haven’t spoken about a third date.
She did end or conversation with ‘good night, sleep well and sweet dreams 🤗’ though
Still not sure if I’m friendzoned…

Oh well, life sucks 😂",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qehqp8/second_date_went_well_but_third_date_maybe_next/
