We had dinner then over to my place to watch movies (wasn't my original plan but decided I wanted to spend a bit more time with him). Anyhow we ended up having a 20 hour long date and were going to go fly his plane but I was absolutely too exhausted.

He just left for a work trip for the next two weeks, but his birthday is this coming weekend. I don't want to get some huge present and I AM okay with just a happy birthday text, but I like him enough (and think he does too) that I don't mind getting him something small. I'm not really sure what to get though. 

He likes hockey, flying planes, he'd mentioned that he and his friends come to town to play Top Golf. I was thinking maybe a $50 gift card to Top Golf, but don't know if that's too much money lol.

7,qkoyt2,1635804025,How authentic are you in app messaging?,"When I text message my friends (of both genders), it's pretty much us sending each other sarcastic jokes / observations about our day-to-day lives. A sentence here or there, and lots of non-sequiturs. We don't really talk about anything too deep over text, but I talk to my closest handful of friends about once every week or two on the phone (or I see them in-person), so I know what's going on in their lives.

However, when I message guys on dating apps, I can't really be authentic with my normal texting personality because the tone could easily be misconstrued when I don't know them. I tend to just go for the usual small talk-type questions until we have a video-chat or meet in-person (e.g., ""So where are you from originally?"" or ""What did you do this weekend?"" or some detailed follow-up question about their profile). I don't want to seem like I'm negging someone if I make a sarcastic comment, but also, EVEN I am pretty bored by the topics I'm asking about. It really seems like a necessary evil at this stage of getting to know someone. I try to set a timer and only stay online for 30 minutes per day max so I don't go insane.

I just logged in to Bumble, and currently I have 22 message threads that made it past the ""you each get 24 hours to respond"" deadlines. On 12 of them, I'm awaiting a reply to a message I asked that contains a question. 10 of them say that it's ""Your Move,"" but this is pretty untrue because literally only 3 of these dudes have asked me a question back. Of the other 7 guys, I'm having pseudo-interesting conversations with 2 of them, but these guys are still pretty bad at asking me questions even though we are writing paragraphs back and forth. After I didn't reply right away within 24 hours, one guy sent me a GIF, but still no question about me (after 10 messages back and forth with each other).

Of the 3 dudes who did ask a question who I haven't responded to yet, 2 have the opposite religion/politics to me, and the other one sent back ""hbu?"" to something I had asked him.

How does everyone else text on apps? If a person isn't asking me a question back, should I...

1. Send another question back to him 24 hours later as a last-ditch effort before unmatching?
2. Write back something sarcastic the way I would to a friend in real life?
3. Unmatch?

p.s. Is this normal that this many people don't participate conversation? I know guys will swipe right on women they aren't interested in, but are the odds really THIS bad? Are all 22 guys just uninterested? How many days do you guys give someone to respond before unmatching? (I do tend to find more normal-seeming people on Hinge, so maybe I'll give up on Bumble.)",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/qkoyt2/how_authentic_are_you_in_app_messaging/

First on the app then about a couple of weeks texting. Last weekend our texts turned very sexual and we‚Äôve been heavy sexting the last week, along with other texts about our lives and such. He even mentioned me meeting his parents, although we hadn‚Äôt hung out yet. We did talk on the phone for a couple hours and face time. Unfortunately he lives an hour and a half away. He had planned to come over last Wednesday, but plans fell through due to a family emergency on his part. I believe he was being genuine in this reason. We had a date planned for Friday which again fell through because he got called in for a work trip and had a lot to do to prepare, like help with the family emergency fallout. Well he ended up coming over to my place yesterday on his way out and we hung out for a couple of hours. It was nice and we had fun, I enjoyed his company and felt a connection and of course, due to the sexting, was hoping to be intimate. However when it came time, he couldn‚Äôt get an erection. He blamed it on all the sexting we had done the week prior and said it was ‚Äúnumb‚Äù. I tried not to act to disappointed but I‚Äôm afraid I made him feel bad. We ended up fooling around and had a good time, he said he wanted to see me again and asked if I wanted to to which I replied yes. Although he said he didn‚Äôt seem which I sounded sure, I guess I was being a little shy. He left straight from my house to his trip and we kissed goodbye. We texted a little after and I tried to make a few jokes. He responded. But I‚Äôm just feeling a lot of anxiety about everything. I don‚Äôt know why he couldn‚Äôt get aroused and I‚Äôm afraid he wasn‚Äôt attracted to me. I feel like I tried to play it too cool and maybe he thought I wasn‚Äôt into him and I only am interested in sex, even though I mentioned before that I wasn‚Äôt. I was just really hyped to see him. Should I worry? Is this okay? Is it normal he couldn‚Äôt get an erection ? I texted him earlier today and asked if he made it safely and he said yes then I made joke that I hope he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a hoe lol. Hoping it would lead to more of a conversation that I tried to jump his bones and we can take things slower next time. Any advice?

11,qkqi3v,1635808409,"Have you ever experienced ""acceptance"" that you have no control over being single?","I feel like I'm starting to experience this. And it's kind of odd, actually. For most of my 20s, I was essentially a wreck of a person (at least that's how I view myself now). So I had a lot of work to do on myself. Plus people always said work on yourself, find hobbies, love will find you when you stop looking yada yada.

So I went to therapy, found a million hobbies, dressed better, travelled and all this stuff. And honestly it did do a lot for me. And I'm in a really good place emotionally now. Like so good my therapist told me I didn't need to see him anymore.

But none of personal growth I've done has to resulted in me meeting someone. I've put so much effort into myself and also being open to dating different people and making sure I communicate well, etc. And it just hasn't led to meeting someone.

And it hit me recently that I just don't have control over this. Nothing that I do on my own will cause a relationship to just appear in my life. Which is obvious, but everyone is always saying that I just need to put myself out there or try dating different people or do whatever they did to find their partner. But there's just nothing else I feel like I can do to somehow cause a relationship to become part of my life.

I used to be exasperated by this, but I'm kind of just learning to accept it. It sucks, yeah. But it's also just true and there's some peace in that. It's a weird state of mind to be in because I guess I've been used to just feel sad and heartbroken about being alone for so long.

18,qkt2xz,1635816385,ADVICE: Dating after health issue caused break 42M/34F,"TL;DR: Health problems caused a two month break in casual dating. How to know if it's over or to re-engage?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I (42M) met her (34F) about 6 months ago OLD. It was the first dating either of us had done since the start of the pandemic, and I suspect for her the first dating she had done in a couple years. Our first date was end of May and we went out every week or two through August. The dating was what I would consider casual (no discussions about relationships or ""us""), though we were texting daily, and there were some weeks we'd see each other more than once.

At the start of September through now, there's been a precipitous decline in the frequency of our messages. We both went through a period of ill health starting in September that went into October, so this was partly to be expected. My health problems kept me homebound, making it impossible for us to go out (though she could have visited me if she wanted), and her health problems were both physically and emotionally taxing so I didn't expect that to happen. So, I tried to continue to check in with her and see how she was doing, and how things were going, sent her some flowers, but the time between our conversations has increased.

Our last conversation (via text two weeks ago) basically entailed me asking if she was ""okay"" (such as it is nowadays), she saying that she was, but that she was really busy with work and taking care of herself. At which point I asked directly if she wanted me not to contact her. She didn't answer that question directly, but replied that she had ""no emotional energy"" and wasn't even communicating with her friends atm. I replied that I just wanted to support her in the way that she wanted and respect her space.

Normally I would have interpreted her reply, and the subsequent lack of messaging as a defacto ""I don't want to see you again"", but previous to this she had always been extremely direct about communicating things like this. (If she was too busy to go out, she would just say she was too busy; if she wanted to come over, she would just say that, instead of angling for an invitation.) I also have been criticized by past partners for not being demonstrative enough in expressing my feelings, so I worry that I might not have directly communicated clearly my desire to date again now that our respective health issues are more or less behind us.

And so, I don't know what to do. The more logical side of me thinks that everybody has been clear enough, and it's just time to move on. The other part of me would prefer a clear resolution, since I would genuinely be interested in dating again if she's up for it. I also have been ghosted/the ghoster in the past and don't really want to participate in that.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/qkt2xz/advice_dating_after_health_issue_caused_break/
