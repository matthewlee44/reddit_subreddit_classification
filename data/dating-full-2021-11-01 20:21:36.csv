I heard you like drama, and boy do I have some! This is my first post, apologies in advance for how long it is. Alright, a little background: I'll be 30 in a week, and a few months ago I was tragically dumped, which as is normal, resulted in going some pretty dark places in my head, and I am still trying to fully recover from it. However, within the last month, I decided to try and get back into the dating scene, can't just be depressed and lonely forever right? So I asked a crush of mine out for dinner, and she agreed. She's a few years older, and has kids, which doesn't bother me at all. The date was perfect, I didn't push to take it further, and we scheduled a second meet for the following weekend. I hadn't felt so excited for anything in a long time. Fast forward to second date, at her house, kids are home, but they have friends over, so they're preoccupied. So I kissed her, well out of view of the house. Everything was perfect, except we may have gotten overzealous, and the younger kid saw us kissing, and proceeded to freak out and call her dad. He's out of the picture, and lives far away, both him and the mom are done with each other, but for some reason he still trys to get involved by way of having the daughter more or less spy on her mom.... And I certainly didn't intend to step on any non-existent toes. Here's the kicker, the dad was also a friend of mine, but we haven't exactly kept in contact at all in the last year or two, so as me and the mom are outside still kissing it up, he calls my phone. ""Wow, that's awkward timing to get a call from him"", when I didn't answer, he calls the mom, who also didn't answer. She then realizes her daughter saw us and called him, and proceeds to go inside and try and de-escalate the hysterical kid while I stay outside feeling more awkward than I think I ever have in my life.  It didn't stop us from continuing to fornicate the rest of the evening, though, and we talked about seeing each other more often, which was great and I was excited about. I spent the night, in a different room, and other than a bit of unexpected drama, it seemed fine. The next day I go home feeling both triumphant and also deeply terrible. I genuinely care about the mom and the kids, I've known them for years, and I feel like I've traumatized the poor girl... I'm sure she thinks I'm the devil, now. So I talk to the mom and apologize, even though she said it wasn't my fault, I know it was. Now she wants to take a step back until this situation is resolved. This is the first time I've been with someone with older children, am I effed? Is that the end of something that had potential, simply because of a bit of kid drama? And believe me, I know how important kids are to their parents (at least when the parents aren't shitty people) but I don't think I really did anything wrong, we are adults after all, however, I still feel terrible about it, and this is all new to me.

Me (23f) and my new bf (24m) of a few months went to a party of my friends so he could meet my friends.

It was going wonderfully. He gelled with everyone. There were a few girls that showed up that I and my girl friends didn’t know. One of them I noticed was frequently walking up to my bf and talking with him, and he was being friendly. At one point I was away outside and he played a round of beer pong with her as his partner. I overheard bits of conversation and there was nothing obviously crossing any boundaries. 

Her body language was clear she was being flirty and was into him and I pointed this out to him later in the night but he brushed it off. But the insecurity in me gave me a sick feeling in my stomach. 

Yesterday, we were chatting and he stated that that girl was hitting on him. I said thanks for acknowledging that she was in fact hitting on you. I made a joke that that girl was not even invited to the party. He then brought up that she asked him to follow her on insta, which he agreed to do. I was on my phone at this time so I looked her up and they did follow eachother. Then I noticed he had liked one of her pics. I asked him why and he said they went through her feed together and that’s when someone liked that pic.
 
This kinda gave me a gross feeling. I told him I would have rathered he had shut her down and not added her, cuz clearly she was flirty and trying to find a way to keep in touch with him. He said he was drunk, just being nice and had no bad intention. He added in that she isn’t his type and wouldn’t have done anything physical (which was not my point at all but he added that). I said I know, but I found it disrespectful. He apologized at this point, and went to go lie down. I could tell he was a bit frustrated. 

I am a chronic overthinker, and can get jealous easily although I don’t act on it. 

Then I started thinking, and I thought maybe overreacted, and I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. When he woke up I apologized to him and told him he didn’t do anything wrong. I said I know he was trying to be friendly in a new party environment where he doesn’t know anyone. I even said it is a small insecurity of mine to deal with this stuff. He thanked me and said he understood where I was coming from.

Now I can’t help but feel embarrassed. I really care about this guy and I feel like I picked a fight over something immature and it will cause him to think differently. I’m also a little torn because the idea of him entertaining another girl makes me sick to my stomach. 

My friend and mom who I both asked for their opinions said my feelings are valid, but likely not a red flag in terms of his actions. I also liked how respectful he was towards me when I brought it up and when I said sorry. 

I looked at her profile this morning as I was doing my morning insta creep, and noticed he unliked the pic, but still follows her. Not sure what it means but I’ve decided to let it all go.


I guess I’m looking for an external opinion on the situation. Has something like this happened to you before? How was it handled? Did I make myself look stupid?

We’ve been together for 3 years, and engaged for two. 
Our relationship is boring as heck. 
We are hardly sexual or even affectionate. I’m not happy, I don’t feel loved and at this point we just act like good friends. It’s awkward and weird. 
But he’s such a great guy! He’s nice, and he’s done so much for me personally and professionally. 
We got two cute as can be kitties and a beautiful apartment and we both work for the same company (he’s my boss)
But we both don’t get what we need from this relationship. I’m bored, he’s bored, we both don’t want to make effort for each other because we both just don’t want to. We’re still in our 20’s, me mid 20’s him late. But I feel like we rushed things. 
I’ve recently expressed I do not want to marry him, for other reasons (parents kind of ruined the whole idea of marriage for me) 
And he was fine with that. I’ve expressed I’m bored and unhappy and nothing has changed. I’m a very honest person and do not keep secrets, if I have an issue we will discuss it. But how many times can we communicate and not change anything?
I want to be single again. I miss that feeling everyday. But again, besides being boring and basically just friends I have no reason to leave. 
Plus, as I stated above he is my boss at work and I love our cats SO much and I don’t want it to be a messy breakup, if it happens. I love him a lot, but I don’t feel IN love with him anymore.
I don’t know what to do. I just want to be happy again…

Lastly, let me know if I should try anymore AT ALL post this.

1. I share music with her and so does she, I'm the little idiot that keeps on sending more music than she does. On days I've gone quiet on chat she sends me something. (I'm guessing she's just tryna string along cause she knows I'm gonna text?) She's quite complimentary about my music taste tho, says stuff like ""This might just become my favourite genre."" (but that doesn't mean shit I guess)
She sends me songs by Cigarettes After Sex and other emotional-esque bands and also some dance songs.
2. When I invited her for a few gigs and etc she makes some kind of excuse. (Basically politely says that she ain't into me - - is what I read about this)
3. She randomly texts me at times about some dress or shoes shes gonna cop and yeah.
4. Sometimes she leaves really long texts about something we spoke about but is otherwise a little close to mum on most things.
5. Tells me that she likes my sense of humour.
6. Calls me ""Dude"".
7. I'd asked her out twice - - once she said yes and once she said she wasn't looking for anyone.  
(This was a year or more ago though)  


So I guess she just likes the attention?  
I mean I've tried.

So many of us are just trying to get strictly to the end game, which is usually a happy relationship and being comfortable. I think this is the wrong way to go about things. 

Lately I’ve been going to a lot of meetups, bars and joining clubs. What an absolutely breath of fresh air it is to actually go out and meet new people regardless of intentions. When you put yourself in the company of others you’re constantly making new connections which could lead to something else down the road. 

The more people you know, the more likely you are to be invited out to parties, social events and potentially meet the love of your life naturally. Trying to force conversations on dating apps and hope they stay interested long enough just for someone else better to come along is so dreadful. People you would of probably swiped left on the app, found me quite charming and easy to talk to in person. 

You’d be surprised at how easy it was this past weekend to talk to total strangers and have meaningful conversations. I made 3 or 4 new friends in the span of 2 days. Imagine how many more connections I would of made over the years if I had been going outside 😂

I really do like him. I think his personality is amazing, and I absolutely love his style. I think he's very handsome too. We went out again and actually initiated touch this time.

When we hugged at the end, instead of feeling butterflies, I literally slumped into the hug and closed my eyes because it literally felt so nice and comforting.

Like guys are too prideful to double text and that she'd expect or appreciate a double text even though she didn't reply. 
So naturally I told her she was full of crap and how I, at the very least, deserved someone who is interested enough to hold a conversation and much more interested enough to be considerate to at least cancel a date or say they aren't interested. 

I left that girl alone and she never bothered messaging me back she ghosted me, whatever. She didn't seem all that interesting or interested anyways so I didn't fight it.
Though that argument got stuck in my head.

M24 here. I recently met a girl I really like (F24). We get along well and we've been exclusive for a few months now. Everything is going really well. I can really see something long term with her, and I can tell she feels the same.

Recently though, something started bugging me. It's my body count. Covid really ruined my dating life the past few years. I really wanted to go through a party phase and just sleep around for a bit, but Covid put a stop to that. I met her really quickly after I started dating again after I got back into the dating scene.

What's bugging me is that if I stay with her, I probably won't get to do the things that I wanted to do like picking girls up at clubs. Her body count is about double mine (in the 30s), which doesn't bug me in the slightest. But it makes me wonder if we're on the same page. I feel like she's had her fun and wants to settle down, but I'm starting to think I might not have had my fun.

TLDR: I feel like I've met someone who's great for me, but that I met her too early. I don't want to break it off with her, but at the same time I feel like I'm missing out on all the fun of being single.

I'm struggling to know how far to push it.. is he a bad texter or just not interested... My inclination is that if he was interested, I would know about it. 

Should I just leave it and risk missing an opportunity or in the next week or so suggest getting a date booked in for him to come to me? 

I don't want to be too pushy or too keen..! Are men just a bit more shit at texting? (Fyi I don't think he is much of a phone guy.. he didn't check it at all during our date/meet up).

I can see us becoming serious if I wanted to do that, but I am having a hard time figuring out my feelings. This guy would be the first guy I would have ever been serious with, and this would be after I spent nearly a year failing continuously at online dating. I mean, wading through a guy who lead me on for 6 months, ghosters, guys who only cared about hooking up, and guys who just stopped replying.

I feel lucky to have found this guy, but my head is filled with doubts. While I like this guy and I am attracted to him, he's not my usual type. I typically go for white collared guys built like soccer/tennis players while this guy is more blue collared and built like a football/baseball player. Still good looking, but not the guy I'd usually look at twice if I were just out and about. There are other little things about him that make me question things, but not enough to stop seeing him.

I don't know. I think it's because I have so little experience dating (let alone being with someone seriously) that I am questioning why I'm not feeling as strongly about this guy as I usually did about my crushes and that guy who lead me on for like 6 months. I was seriously like obsessed over that guy. Felt giddy over-the-moon getting a message from him, was heartbroken when he would leave me on read, and like cried when I thought things were over and we weren't even dating!! Like, I am so used to being goo goo gaga over guys that I was never even with that I feel weird not having that intense feeling of infatuation and pining over this incredibly sweet guy I am dating. Like, I'm attracted to him, I feel like I can 100% be myself around him which I have never really felt with a guy before, I think about him all the time when he's away, and I get excited to see him when we have plans. But, when I think about how I would feel if things were to end now, I can 100% say that I wouldn't be heartbroken. Like, I can see myself moving on relatively quickly, which scares and confuses me.

We both still have the dating app we met on, but he's made it clear that he's only seeing me, which I believe. And, I am only seeing him too. I do occasionally look at the pool of guys who have liked me on the dating app, but I never match with anyone. I am planning to bring up the exclusivity talk pretty soon, which would lead to us (hopefully) removing those accounts, but before that, I want to figure out my hesitation here.

Is it because of my inexperience with dating? Like, since I never really had anything serious with a guy who completely falls in line with what I typically gravitate to in a man, my mind is stuck in a what-if scenario and hesitant to commit due to FOMO?

Or, is it my lack of really getting to know any of the men I dated, which means I fell for the idealistic version of them and what things would be like in my head? And now, that I have something real, it can't live up to that imaginary perfect relationship, and so I am seeking something that does not exist?

It can be either of those two things or anything really. But, it could also be that in real life, it actually takes me longer to attach to a partner than I originally anticipated. I am so used to attaching to my imagination of things, that the real thing feels weird maybe lol? That's something for me to figure out myself, but that's not really what I'm here for. 

So, that brings me to my question. How long does it usually take you to feel that feeling of attachment to a new partner that goes beyond just missing them but actually feeling like you really want them in your life and you want to work hard as hell to make sure that happens? I'm sure it's different for different people, and it probably differs even amongst the same person with different partners.

I’ve noticed there’s always a trend; consistent texting and interest shown prior to date 1, then after date 1, I either get ghosted or softly rejected. It makes me question what I’m doing wrong. First of all, I’m a pretty big introvert and have mild social anxiety while meeting new people, but not to the extent that I remain overly quiet and detached during dates. I usually try to show interest by asking questions and making some light hearted jokes. Unfortunately, I’m also not the life of the party. I’m still reserved and I suck at small talk, but I always end up opening up more after some time passes. I like deep conversations and can get pretty immersed in them. Sometimes the topic of mental health can come up in conversations and in these circumstances, I have the habit of revealing too much about my struggle with anxiety. I don’t go too far into detail and I make sure I don’t talk about it too much, yet I still can’t help but wonder if it’s the reason people lose interest after meeting me in person. Other than that, I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. I avoid touchy subjects like politics and religion and if I ever ask a personal question, I always preface it by saying things like “you don’t have to answer if you don’t feel comfortable with it.” I also make it clear to these people that I’m not looking for hookups or casual FWB situations. I don’t think I’m unattractive and I doubt my hygiene is the problem. I’ve been told I look pretty much the same in my photos as I do in person. Only thing I’m slightly insecure about is not having super white teeth, but again, my teeth are pretty average (not overly yellow or crooked). I don't play any texting games (i.e. waiting a certain period of time before responding to someone) even though I find that most people do.

The main contributing part of our relationship was the time we spent studying together. He gave me the impression he was interested in getting together and often said he had plans after graduation that could see our relationship continuing. I was unsure at the time because I didn't know what the future held and we most likely were going in different directions. Still we maintained contact. Recently he started to reach out more often saying he thought we had a good schedule and saw our relationship as a positive within both of our lives. I agreed. It could have to do with holding each other to some kind of schedule or plan that ended up converting into successful plans, or it could be the fact that we got along very often and maintained enough of a distance that each other moved forward perfectly fine in our endeavors. 

I can't help but notice that he has not called me as often as he used to. I think this could have to do with either of us being at a busy time in our lives with lots of decisions to make. For this reason I haven't asked him about our relationship or where it could possibly go as I know he will get back to me when he feels comfortable and this can happen at any time. 

I wish he gave more information on what he was doing more often. It doesn't seem like there is enough time to cover all the details and we are reaching for a patch of possible outcomes from our relationship, so we have streamlined our topics these past few weeks. Is this a sign our relationship is changing as we are moving into the new year? 

The only concern I have is if this rate continues, is it possible that our conversations will become less frequent or should we make a consious effort to prioritize each other?

It started off in the workplace. She had a crush on me. She asked me out. We went on a few dates and eventually got into a relationship. We're pretty attached now.

While things are decent, I have started noticing an emotional void and wonder whether it's because we're incompatible or I have unrealistic expectations.

To give you a context, it's her first relationship. She just had distant crushes before, Everything, right from our kiss was the first kiss of her life. I've been in serious as well as casual relationships before. Right after we kissed, she said she loves me. I realized it must be due to the excitement of first kiss, and lack of maturity when it comes to relationships. I told her ""we don't know each other pretty well, specially not the bad sides, so we shouldn't rush"".

Anyway, her being extremely open and vulnerable with her feelings made me open up and fall in love eventually. However, these days, the roles seemed to have reversed. I tell her things like ""I miss you"", ""I feel like meeting"". She does it too, but mostly as a response. Never initiated. I flirt with her and still act as if I'm trying to woo her. Whereas, she somewhere indirectly mentioned, ""Now that we're dating, I don't need to do it anymore.""

So she stays at home with sort of conservative parents. Dad is strict. Mom is somewhat chill. We haven't been able to meet in a week since she doesn't go out of home (and her parents somewhat want us to ""keep a balance"" and meet less. Her dad and mom weren't there and we decided to meet. Even then, I had to ask her ""Should we meet"". She never went outrightly and said ""I want to meet you.""

Anyway, when I'm going upstairs to her place, I realize her mom returned. I heard my girlfriend saying ""He asked me to meet so I couldn't say no."" Her mom said something along the lines of ""Why do you have to meet etc"". More things were said (a bit ruder) so I heard it and left immediately. My girlfriend heard my footsteps and came downstairs. 

She called me up. Her mom and I spoke and eventually, things were sorta fine. I was still upset and left pretty early. My girlfriend said she told her mom ""He wants to meet"" to make an excuse. I got a little annoyed that she's making me out to be the bad person. That it's just ""me"" who wants to meet.

Anyway, while going back, we did kiss but I had to initiate it. Somewhere, I hoped she realized her family and even her spoke things to make me upset (I was pretty straightforward on how bad I felt), and thought maybe she'll hug me or do something sweet. Even after I left, I expected something as simple as ""Did you reach home"". Instead, it was just some random texts.

She did eventually say ""she's sorry"" with many crying emojis but it was hours later. Am I wrong in expecting her to put in efforts to cheer me up considering she was the whole reason I got upset. When I told her this, she said ""Ohh I didn't know you had to do these things in a relationship."" I convinced myself maybe it's not bad intentions but just a lack of experience.

She still does things that make me think she has feelings. She talks about me to her friends and family. Constantly keeps looking at my photos and thinks about me, but the actions somehow don't always match the words.

It sucks more because part of me becoming vulnerable was because of how open she was with her feelings. Now it's become that I'm the ""boring serious talk guy"" whereas she's always ""chill"" even if there are legit issues we need to communicate.

Somehow, it has made me start to lose feelings for her. Is there a way to resolve it?

I’m 20 now- and I can’t say our relationship was ever butterflies and rainbows. But I’ll clearly state- we have a lot of fun together, i have an amazing relationship with all of his family, I trust him with all my insecurities and don’t mind telling him the things I’d usually be embarrassed about and tell no one. He’s my bestfriend. 

But today- I am truely heartbroken. My boyfriend took his dad for a ride somewhere- and I looked on the bed to see my boyfriends extra cell phone- unlocked and opened. (It was also his dads extra phone, for everyone in emergencies). It was honestly a sign to just go for it. 

I opened Facebook messenger and it was signed into his dads account. So I went through the messages between him and his dad. And it was filled with messages about me. And honestly- my money. 

I stated earlier I was almost homeless- I work my ass off every single day. I work Instacart after my job. 

His dad was telling my boyfriend to “steal from her” - my boyfriend was telling his dad when I was asleep to go do whatever they wanted to do. 

My boyfriend even once asked “do you want me to get $80 for “rent”” - i was completely broken. 

I put my shit together , and took a shower to wait for him to come back. When he came back- i told him I was lied to, and used. He acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. He needed everything explained out one-by-one and didn’t fess to anything. 

He gave me the stupid “I’ll change - i need you speech” told me he loved me for the first time. Told me the only reason he got this new job was to take us away from it. 

Of course I’m stupid enough to stay. My literal only choice was to sleep in my car after leaving- and I was going to.

This is gonna be a long Post (no reason, just who I am in explaining my situations), if you don't wanna read it, no problem, but everyone who reads it, your help is really appreciated!

I've got a problem I don't really know how to handle and maybe some of you have got some tips. A few years ago I really suffered from social anxiety. Well some years of therapy, a relationship that gave me lots of confidence even if it ended and some really great friends I've made over the past year make it possible that I've gotten quiet confident about myself and that I can socialize without getting too awkward. But there's still one major issue: I've never approached anyone myself. So what happened? My first girlfriend was the one who started talking to me. Everything that came after this were just some casual things. Friends with benefits or just Sex with some people I met over Tinder or Grindr. Made it really easy and not looking for anything serious. Since my last relationship I didn't feel like wanting anything (it's been 2 years). Nobody seemed to appeal to me, nobody sparked that amount of joy that it made me crush on them. But now this changed. Last weekend an extrovert put me to my limits. 3 parties, 3 evenings. On the third one we went with a gay group to visit a club. Waiting in line a friend was welcoming two guys who would come with us. Unfortunately we didn't make it into the club, because there were too much people. So we went to an apartment of us and spend the evening there. One of the two guys that came later Was... wow. We talked a lot while in the queue. Also a lot of talking the rest of the evening. He initiated a lot of stuff as well. We've got a lot of the same interests (which is kinda rare in my case), same humor... He's well-spoken, intelligent. He's artistic. He has a nice voice. He's really cute, got a great smile. I literally didn't crush on a person this hard in a lot of years. I'm really sitting here and can only think of this cute guy I've only known for a few hours. And I don't know what to do know. We follow each other on Instagram. I know he said he's dating someone, but like only meeting and spending time together, but he doesn't really now if this will lead anywhere. The friend who invited me said that he definitely always tried to be by my side and looked at me. When our group parted between the ones who went to the apartment and the ones who wanted to get some more alcohol he first chose to go to the apartment. When I redecided, he did as well. When my friend and I wanted to go, he suddenly jumped up and said he will come with us. At the end he gave me a long hug. He also made some compliments. Like when I was talking about my ex-gf he asked ""YOU'RE STRAIGHT!?!"" to which I replied ""Nah, I'm bi, no worries"". He answered ""oh god thank you, I was almost disappointed"". When a cat stuck her butt in my direction he said ""I can understand her tho"", or when we talked about both of our Reddit obsession and me stating that I've got a Reddit account for porn he asked if I'm uploading anything and if I would give him my username. I also checked his Instagram and it's the perfect Mix of aesthetic and humor + he seems to have lots of interesting hobbies.

So... How would you approach this? Literally every friend says I should text him. The friend who was with me said that he was definitely interested. But still I'm not sure. If I should do it and even then: HOW!?! I don't wanna make anything awkward and for some reason I'm still unsure if he actually cares (maybe because I'm a really unconfident creature) or if it's just how he is. Maybe I'm tone-deaf to what signals he might have given idk

I (19f) met this guy (21m) on tinder. Usually I would never meet up with anyone from there but he is a special case. We dated traditionally, it wasn’t a hang and bang sort of thing. We went out to movies, hiked, had dinner, etc. it’s all very wholesome and we click really super well. He’s the type of person you’d miss if you never met them. 

He’s in his last year at an extremely rigorous school up north (800 miles away). When we talked about the terms of our relationship, I told him that I wasn’t a fling type of girl and that when he was away at school I wanted to hear from him. He agreed and has kept up his end because we plan to see each other during winter break in December.

We both really do care about each other but I feel like I haven’t been honest enough with him about how I feel. We waited 2 months to have sex because he was my first. He never *ever* pressured me and told me that he couldn’t guarantee me a relationship (he’s in a very hard major, studying for the mcat, and applying to med schools). He never led me on about where the relationship may or may not go, resulting in a bit of a gray area right now. A commitment isn’t really that important to me atm but I want to know that he sees a potential relationship when he graduates and comes home for his gap year. 
 
I know I should just talk to him about it, as I’m flying up Saturday to stay with a family friend for a week so we’re planning to hang out when we have time. I don’t want to lose him but I also don’t want to waste my time if there’s no potential relationship.

I know I'll get roasted for this but I've been into this guy who I went on a date with back in June. Awesome date, he kissed me at the end. We talked sparingly on insta since. Complimenting eachother and whatnot but he was really muted about it, like he was almost afraid to compliment me. He would send me selfies and I would gas him up, but he wouldn't really do the same for me. I even sent him spicy stuff and he said I ""didn't have to do all that"" ??  


So, I got mixed signals. Breadcrumbing was what he was doing but it seemed super unintentional and like he was just afraid of me almost. I'm a decent looking girl and we have an insane crossover with interests and background. we clicked super well, but after the first date he seemed to fall into depression and honestly going on benders every weekend. he invited me to a show last weekend and when I drove all the way to pick him up, he didn't answer the door even though his roommate's dog was going crazy. It was hard to believe he slept through it all. He didn't text me until I was walking to leave, and I think he saw me walking away and felt safe enough to text as I was leaving. He apologized but I kind of saw it coming.   


He is most likely emotionally unavailable. He would watch all of my stories, and one night early on he wanted to come over and talk all night and not even bang. I lived with my ex (then separated) at the time so it was too awkward to oblige. I stayed in his room the night he bailed on the show. When we hung out he could barely look at me, the avoidance was strong. I never saw anything like it. I felt bad honestly because I felt like I understood it, but he slammed three beers back and went to bed only 3 and a half hours after I arrived, he had just woken up from sleeping 12 hours or so. I was so confused.  


I still am. I am not going to pursue him, but I just wonder if anyone has ever been on his side of things. I just can't comprehend it. I was so supportive, encouraging him, trying to be a good friend. I was honest about what I felt. He would change the subject though. It would be too much for him. I am hoping one day he will work through this dark stuff. He even said ""when I actually try, then you'll really like me"" -- so I think he just doesn't feel good enough, and that's where the avoidance comes from.   


I blocked him and then unblocked him because he wasn't really a bad friend, but I expected a lot out of someone who I never even talked about expectations with, or I really unfairly placed expectations on him when he said previously he was going through a lot.

then he would call me randomly all the time, and talk about random stuff ((usually himself lmao)), and whenever i would call him, he would never pick up..he would also ask me to hang out like all the time but it was always sudden and i live kinda far so i would decline. he would get really in his feelings about it and say stuff like “nobody ever rejected me like this, why are you doing this??” but i knew it was just for a hook up so .. yeah i played hard to get. 

anyways he eventually gave up .. and we speak sporadically now and i don’t mind bc i just lost interest in dating all together tbh.. but now: he’s the first to watch my story, he responds to my stories and talks to me for like five mins before leaving me on read??? and sometimes he hides his story from me💀 i guess bc he’s with other girls but i’m like??? i don’t care lmao!! do your thing and live your life king🥳😌 ! has anyone experienced this?

It’s not the smartest thing but I ended up moving in with him after like a month and a half of dating because we both got really attached to each other fast but living together has surprisingly been going well.

My problem is just being concerned that maybe my SO isn’t 100% over his ex. They broke up in August of last year but stayed in contact until May 2021 which is only a couple months before we got together (didn’t know that part until recently). I ended up finding out that he searches his ex up on social media still. I’m almost always home and we are always together yet the few times a week I have to go into the office he apparently was checking up on his ex girlfriends accounts??? I could understand if he only searched her up one time out of curiosity but like it was every week? So when I’m at work missing him and thinking about him he’s thinking of his ex??? 

I found this out a couple weeks ago and we’ve talked about it a lot. I still feel concerned though even with his reassurances. I worry that he’s not over her and I’m just a replacement. I know people look up their exes from time to time even when you’re in a relationship but how normal is this really? When does it become not normal? His psychiatrist suggested deleting all of his social media after this happened to help I guess so he did delete everything but even if he’s not searching anymore does that make it less concerning that my partner *was* thinking about and searching his ex almost everytime I was away from him? I mean we’ve only been dating for 3 months isn’t this supposed to be the honeymoon phase when everything is perfect and great, shouldn’t I be concerned he’s thinking of her that often now at the beginning of our relationship?

TL;DR I’m concerned my partner isn’t over his ex after searching her on social media multiple times in our only 3 month long relationship.
