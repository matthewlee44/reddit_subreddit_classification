We met and you know... things happened. After that, his messages weren't as excited anymore. He is still the one who texts first, I'm trying not to because I'm already hurt and my gut is telling me that he might be trying to cut me off. When we are working he still jokes with me and texts me during the day and yesterday he asked me to meet him if he can leave early from work as he works till 8 pm. Today, another coworker has to leave early so he cannot and he didn't even tell me to meet after when before even at one in the morning he was ready to meet.

If you aren't sure if your being weired or not.......Your probably being wired.....Learn to flirt with body language. Go to the mall. Go to stores. Be friendly with the associates. (Don't hover. they have a job to do and they don't want your dick). Smile.  Pay attention to body language. Learn from awkward situations and don't repeat mistakes. Dress nice, wear a good cologne.

""I don't want to date. I liked the movie. But I don't know how to do anything else. Plus it's just too much rn. I am sorry.

His texting tone changed, when literally two days before the date we were flirting with all the cutesy shit??? What's with his perfectly punctuated paragraphs?

I asked him very directly, why would he take me out if he never had the intention to date anyone. And he said he doesn't know to answer that. We came to the conclusion that we'll be friends. But it's very obvious by his behavior that he's just ignoring me. We are not friends. The label is just for the sake for it. And I hate that. I told him that I don't want to be friends with him for the sake of it. Friends mean actual friends. 

He did not give me any closure. He's not communicating properly? What is wrong? What do I do? This sucks. And I know for a fact, that he's on some sort of stupid vacation by his IG stories.

I (26M) have been trying the online dating thing for over 3 years or so, and nothing has really come of it besides a few first dates that went nowhere. I despise online dating, but I'm just not meeting anybody in person and have no other choice.

Anyhow, I matched with an awesome-sounding woman on Facebook dating (of all places) a while back, we started casually messaging/texting, and I immediately knew I had to ask her out. I'm probably pickier than average, because this rarely happens. I asked to meet for Boba tea, but due to both of us having crazy schedules, we couldn't figure out a time for like 2 weeks. While messaging, she made an offhand comment about volunteering at a VBS (vacation bible school). I was dumped by an ex for not being religious, so this immediately raised the alarm bells (even though it might not even be a big deal), and I stopped messaging her. I also was starting to look for new jobs, and had a vacation planned.

It's been 3 weeks since we last texted, and she came up on another app. I was already feeling like I should have still re-planned that first date, even if it didn't work out (because who knows). Is it too late? How could I apologize at this point?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbc7bp/im_a_dick_and_left_a_great_person_on_read_for_3/

Usually it goes simply like that: ""I expect man to be a gentleman"".

So far so good... except it's not. When I dig deeper, the ""gentleman"" word stands for ""will pay always 100% and we will be dating in nice places always"". Of course, using word ""gentleman"" is safer, instead if saying ""don't expect me to pay anytime"" which sounds rude (even though it probably mean the same).

Maybe I miss the point here, thus asking. What does ""gentleman"" really mean? Since I started considering it as a red flag whenever I see that in a bio.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbc7ey/is_gentleman_a_new_euphemism_for_a_sponsor/

- keeps his beard after she says so
- takes her home to his place because she has to pee
- asks her jokingly if some dude on her Snapchat filter is her boyfriend

- encourages her to stop using Tinder and meeting someone ""in real life"" instead 
- will attend the same event she is going to 
- asks if she can get him tickets to said event 
- sends snapchats of himself asking if they would be appropriate on a CV or as profile pictures

- texts her asking where she went after she disappeared from the bar 
- texts her next day late night again to come there

I'm a virgin and usually don't want to have sex with someone until we're in a relationship for a bit but I really do like this guy. I'm a little afraid that he might just want me for sex, but he's said that he's not and that he feels bad that I thought that he was.

 I told him that I wasn't sure if I'd be ready to have sex with him so soon. He said we could have sex when I'm ready to but that it would delay the relationship because he wants to see how good the sex is between us before we start dating.

25,qbdso9,1634657057,Good luck on your journey,"Rule #1

 

Don't reveal too much about yourself too soon. Remain a mystery.

 

 

Rule #2

 

Girls are not the only thing in life. Have other things in your life that excite you.

 

 

Rule #3

 

Do not become so invested in any one girl that you cannot simply walk away.

 

 

Rule #4

 

Confidence attracts women even more than good looks. This is why you see fat, ugly, or dumpy guys with hot chicks.

 

 

Rule #5

 

Desperation repels women. You will attract more women when you don't care if you're attracting women.

 

 

Rule #6

 

Use the phone only to set up dates. Not to talk about weather, current events, how her day went, etc. Save that conversation for the date.

 

 

Rule #7

 

First dates should be short and creative. NO ""dinner and a movie"". Things involving some activity are best: pool, bowling, roller blading, mini-golf, dancing, etc. Keep it FUN.

 

 

Rule #8

 

Do not give gifts early in the relationship. Doing so makes it appear as though you are attempting to purchase affection.

 

 

Rule #9

 

Girls will test guys to see how much they can skate by with. Do not be tempted to give in. Speak your opinions, stand by your convictions, and don't put up with excessive amounts of BS.

 

 

Rule #10

 

There is no such thing as a ""soul-mate"" or ""the one"". It doesn't exist. There are millions of girls out there, though, and many of them have the traits you are looking for.

 

 

Rule #11

 

Don't put any woman up on a pedestal. You risk not being able to reach her. Women are people too... or so I'm told.

 

 

Rule #12

 

If a woman disrespects you or your time, particularly early in the relationship, don't hesitate to get rid of her. NEXT!

 

 

Rule #13

 

Never be the one that says, ""I love you"" first.

 

 

Rule #14

 

The challenge is part of the fun. Don't short-change the girl. Let her pursue you. The harder something is to obtain, the more valuable it is perceived to be.

 

 

Rule #15

 

If a girl cheats on you, she is gone. No exceptions.

 

 

Rule #16

 

Never date a girl who has more problems than you do.

 

 

Rule #17

 

Do not date girls from work. Work is stressful enough.

 

 

Rule #18

 

Dating is a ""numbers game."" Accept the fact that you're going to get rejected more times than not. Suck it up and get back out there.

 

 

Rule #19

 

Where women are concerned, pay more attention to what they do than what they say.

 

 

Rule #20
Realize that women are tricky, lying, manipulative, devious, scheming, sneaky, cunning, calculating, shrewd, and Machiavellian creatures. Love them anyway.

 

 

Rule #21

 

Bros before hoes. Any girl that can be stolen from your best friend isn't worth stealing from your best friend.

 

 

Rule #22

 

Stay away from your ex. Chances are that you won't be able to get back with her. Chances are also good that if you DO succeed in getting back with your ex, you'll wish that you hadn't.

 

 

Rule #23

 

Women communicate in two modes: the way things are, and the way they WISH things were. Whenever in doubt, assume it's the latter choice.

 

 

Rule #24

 

Women desire attention the same way that guys desire sex. Give attention sparingly. This is your currency.

 

 

Rule #25

 

If you aren't sure about when to bend or break a rule, go with your instinct. If it's wrong, that's a good lesson for next time... and there's always a next time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbdso9/good_luck_on_your_journey/

33,qbee32,1634658780,First bump in the road of a complicated relationship," 

I (male) met an awesome girl online which started as friends. Slowly became more than friends. Talking every day for the past three months, going to restaurants  traveling festivals we've had a real amazing time. Recently been hooking up  and having sex. Told her im really into her, she really  likes me said she would date me but she’s not there emotionally right now coming off a relationship, insists we are friends... we’re both exclusively seeing each other. I know how it can be. Shes is studying abroad  in a few weeks. Ya I know probably shouldn’t be this far already but  here we are. That’s half the situation

We  wake up one morning after a solid date, cuddling, talking. I try  initiating it, she said not in the mood right now. Not a problem. We cuddle /talk there for another 3 hours and a lot of time has gone by. all of a sudden start making  out, one thing leads to another I finger she moans, we start  going at it she’s moaning and saying things in my ear I finish. were laying there and then go get breakfast and i go home. no red flags or anything. 

On my way home she  texts me saying she didn’t want to have sex just then… and now i feel  horrible. she says she was  just trying to get it over with... which doesnt sit right with me anyway. Says  we need space. ok no problem. a few days go by I’m just trying to make sense and  collect my thoughts. First time in months that we go days without  talking. she wasn’t clear at all that she didn’t want to have  sex, and she communicated the opposite to me in the moment, that said her original communication was so many hours before it seemed irrelevant now. 

Says that she is past it and forgives me but doesn’t  know how to pick things back up. honestly neither do I. Is this just  too much of a muddy situation to move past? Am I getting played just  before she leaves the country? Any advice on how to handle this is  appreciated.

I felt like I’m being watched but apparently the older ladies there were talking shit about me for dancing while the men are also on the dance floor. It’s my best friend’s engagement, of course i’m gonna be right there dancing with her and our girl friends.  Anyways, I just kept glancing over at him and he was so cute. It’s a long story but there’s like a 90% chance that he’s not interested in me based on past things. Main one being I know he’s thinking about how awkward it would be if we dated and it didn’t work out. Then we’d see each other all the time at events and get togethers.   He’s a bit older than me but I kinda like it. He’s 23 and I’m 19 which is not a crazy difference but at our current ages, it seems like a pretty big gap.  Anyways, I accidentally bumped backs with him and I turned around to say sorry but he didn’t feel it I think. He was busy dancing. It was so strange because it made my heart stop.  Having crushes suck especially when it’s so hopeless. Yet, I still have hope because I’m an idiot.

Yes, I have been with other women casually, but I haven't developed feelings for any of them and I think the reverse is true...

I hear a lot online about how women have it so easy in dating and its hard to be single as a girl, but I have just not had that experience at all. I'm curious if other women are also having the same experience. I've only dated one guy my entire life (I'm almost 22) and I thought things were going well, but he was adamant about keeping things casual and was sleeping with many girls. Online I hear how hard dating is for men, but he was about 5'8 and average looking and would average sleeping with about 8 girls a year from tinder and cold approach which is a crazy number to me because i haven't even slept with that many men in my entire life. Watching him, i saw how easy dating is for men actually. I'm shy in real life so i use dating apps, but i get ghosted more often than anything else happening which is funny because online I hear about how easy women have it with online dating. I'm just curious if any other women also have had this experience? Ive seen a lot of men that were scared of being single end up in relationships far earlier than women. Not to say i haven't met nice guys who do want relationships, but they are far and few in between and a lot of the times I cant help that I do not find them physically attractive.

43,qbf6b7,1634661050,She wants to reschedule,"So I had a lovely date with a lady from my gym on Sunday. We met for food &amp; just talked for like 2+ hours. We seem to have a lot in common and to me it feels like we have good chemistry. The next day I texted her and invited her over for dinner at my place on Wednesday. 

Initially she said ""yes! Sounds like a good time."" So, that was that. We texted a few times jokingly throughout the day, nothing crazy (had a debate about the whole ""gif"" vs ""jif"" pronunciation) - all seemed good. 

But now today (Tuesday) she texts me ""Hey, so for tomorrow. I'm wondering if you would mind if we did something else. Or maybe we wait for the weekend and can grab coffee and take a walk?"" 

So since evenings aren't great for her (has to wake up early) we agreed to reschedule for the Sunday coffee + walk combo. 

So here's the point of the post; I'm curious if any women could chime in as to why she might initially accept and seem enthusiastic, but then want to not do it the next day? I'm hoping it's just a ""she wants to know me better before coming over to my place"" type of deal - but again, why initially accept? I'm just a little confused/worried.

44,qbf8n3,1634661232,Should you tell new women you're dating that you're still a virgin? (My experience),"There are a surprisingly high number of men who are in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties who are virgins. Some of them come onto Reddit and post questions like “I’ve been dating so-and-so for 2 months and I haven't told her I'm a virgin, will telling her this turn her off?” or “how will women feel about dating me if they know I've never had sex before?”

I was a late bloomer and didn't have sex until I was 23. Yes, that means for my entire college life, I never hooked up with anybody despite going to a school with a very high ratio of women-to-men.

Also during that time, I was trying to remain a virgin until I was married. And, in order to achieve that goal, I thought that if I let everyone know I was a virgin, they would either(a) leave me alone if they wanted sex, or (b) or be turned on by a guy who wasn't going after them for sex, which I kept hearing from a woman as a common complaint about men. 

Oh, how wrong I was. 

Turns out, telling women around me that I was not only a virgin but actively trying to keep it that way AND acting proud of it made them like me MORE. Back then, I had lower self-esteem about myself (probably due to deny myself sex, LOL), but in looking back I can remember the various women either I had a crush on or who had crushes on me that were definitely sending me buying signals indicating they'd be down to take my v-card. 

And it seemed like the more steadfast I was about being a virgin, the more glaringly obvious they would be in wanting to take it. I remember going on a first date with a woman, and when I drove her back to her dorm and got out of my car to give her a hug and say “bye,” she said “hey - wanna come up and see my dorm room?” (Note: her place had a living space she shared with 3 or 4 other roommates; she took me to her room that had a big ol’ bed in it, and I literally kept thinking, “what are we supposed to do in here with this big bed in the way?? I think I should go home…” it wasn’t until I was halfway home that I was like, “Wait a min… d’oh!”) 

Another time, I invited a woman to my place for dinner and a movie (not knowing that that was usually taken as code for “you want to come to my place for a hookup?”). She said yes and actually suggested she could stay overnight… and I turned her down, again by accident, and took her back to campus once the movie was over. 

All of this to say: based on my experience here's my take on telling women you're a virgin… 

The more confident you are when talking about it, the less pushback you'll get. It's not about the fact that you're a virgin; it's about demonstrating confidence in the decision you initially made about it, and/or making it seem like it was a choice you made vs. being a virgin by default. 

In other words, you can have a nervous voice, slumped shoulders, or a shamed look in your eyes when telling a woman you're a virgin that gives off the impression it’s because no one wants to sleep with you; and the energy you're sending to her is begging energy, as if you're saying “please sleep with me - I so desperately want to experience sex!”

On the other hand, if you say it like you were the one choosing to remain a virgin, i.e. “Yeah I'm a virgin - I didn't want to rush it, and wanted to make sure the first person I did it with with someone I really connected with” - you face better odds. 

“But what if she wants someone that's more experienced,” you ask?

Reality check: any time you have sex with a new person, it's going to be a different experience anyway! 

Example: you might have sex with a woman who enjoys you licking a certain body (keeping it PG here people LOL). You spend six months perfecting your licking technique on her, then you break up. You start dating the next woman and think, “she's going to love having sex with me, I have this licking thing down!”… 

Only to find out she’s not a fan of being lick there! Turns out, she likes having her butt massaged, so you learned that for her… then you date another woman, and she hates being touched on her butt! 

The point is, the “being experienced” thing isn't as big of a deal as you being open to learning her and how she specifically likes things in bed. And also, I found when I finally did lose my v-card that the woman I lost it to was more than happy to teach me a few things. 

So hopefully this helps some of you virgin fellows out about this whole thing!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbf8n3/should_you_tell_new_women_youre_dating_that_youre/

The last occurrence was with a girl I only exchanged four messages with.   
  
  
The conversation was like this:  

&gt; Me: I thought your cat was posing with you on your 4th picture 😂  
&gt; She: Of course she does that.  
&gt; She: My cat is on a whole other level ;)   
&gt; Me: I really do know some cats that do listen to commands 😂 What breed is your cat? 
  
She never answered and even recently deleted her profile as I saw.   
And she isn't the only one stopping replying as most did out of the blue after the first 1-10 messages.  
  
I normally write about non-sexual stuff with women when first texting and getting to know them and I'm afraid that this is the reason they stop replying as they maybe experience me as a boring person. The smiley of the women in my example even had a sexual undertone.
  
Do I need to bring more spice in? Is it better when you're at least a bit sexual even if it's a bit inappropriate? Or is it bad luck and I just need to continue playing the numbers game? I have no problem texting with people as long as they show interest too. I even have friends I exchange 30m to 1h voice memos with and that since we met.

51,qbfto5,1634662905,I don’t know if I’m that much into dating anymore…,"I’m turning 26 in a month. 

I was in a toxic relationship back in 2018. The girl I was with had lied to me about having a boyfriend for a long time. She was acting weird at times, hot and cold. And I had asked her if she was taken, and she said no when things started. 

Anyway I ended up finding out she was still seeing him albeit very infrequently (barely once a month) because she was studying abroad. 

At some point, I was sick of the lying and her hot and cold, indecisive approach and hung up the phone telling her I was tired of it. I went completely silent and never looked back. She did send me some emotional texts telling me how hurtful it was to be ghosted but I was done and had enough. 

I then took those bad vibes and let them motivate me to work my ass off at work throughout 2019 which got me promoted and got me my dream job over time.

I mostly stopped going to bars and flirting around since, I’ve been single ever since never going beyond a few dates until I started feeling uneasy again. 

I also started taking investing more seriously and started accumulating capital overtime to become more financially independent.

I met a single mother a few years ago at a bar that was making serious money on her own. We talked and her mindset kinda stuck with me. She told me she didn’t feel like dating anybody anymore, going on dinner dates to talk about herself and all that yada yada anymore. And I feel the same too. Maybe she did flirt with me because she saw I didn’t feel like dating either… which is interesting actually. 

I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been since leaving the ex. My mind is clear and I haven’t been around bad vibes for ever it feels like. I do flirt around though from what friends and colleagues tell me (I was surprised I was since for me it was more of just talking. If I feel that that I’m being inappropriate in the slightest or they don’t want / feel like talking I’m out fast). Like I might strike up a conversation with people (not women in particular as I don’t focus on flirting just like talking with folks in general). I might add a compliment to a woman I find attractive for this or that reason, maybe she works well, has a nice smile, sunglasses whatever and then I’m on my way. 

But when it comes to more I usually don’t feel like anything unless I feel like the person isn’t toxic in the slightest and doesn’t expect me to be prince charming. And so I like not to see dates as dates as well.

I’m pretty sure I’ve developed trust issues since that one ex but I don’t particularly see why I would change my mindset as life is quite good now. I flirt apparently but in a chill and relaxed manner meaning that I just go on about my life right after, I like being genuine and don’t have any agenda if I do “flirt”. I never ask for numbers either so if something happens I’m rarely the one who initiates a date or anything.

About a couple of weeks ago I found out he was watching porn (which is fine because I’ve watched porn before as well). I also have been holding out till marriage (he knows this and is okay with it). So anyway I found out he was watching strap on lesbian porn as I saw a picture in his deleted photos. Still no biggie, although I could tell he was a little embarrassed by it. So I went on the PS’s website and saw she had videos  of her pegging men too and so I asked him about it and he said “oh yeah I saw it, I’d never seen a video like that. It was not my thing at all.” 

I wondered why he didn’t just say that at first. Now I will say that my ROCD has caused me to have intrusive thoughts about my partner concerning his sexuality, features, personality etc. and he told me that because of my recent diagnosis and things I’ve been going through he’s been a lot more quiet with things because he doesn’t want to trigger me but it’s annoying too. I guess my question is:

We have been planning on meeting, but both of us were busy the past week/weekend, so we're hoping to get something planned this coming weekend.

Last night while I was at the gym, I happened to see this person there. They don't belong to my gym, but it looked pretty clear that they were on a gym date with the person they were working out with. I can't say anything bad about the person they were with, as that person more or less has the same workout schedule as me and they seem like a normal fit person doing their thing after work. We didn't cross paths much because we were working out different muscle groups that night, but I did overhear them asking some get-to-know-each-other-questions with one another as they worked out about themselves and their workout, and caught a glance from my match at one point, probably realizing they recognized me.

I'm not naive and believe that all my matches are not talking to or seeing other people, but it was kind of  funny how the next day, I got a message from my match continuing on our conversation as usual.

72,qbhmka,1634668086,Girl I was seeing for 3.5 months ended it a week ago. Case of Wrong Time/Right Person?,"**Context -**  I met a girl on Hinge in June. We saw each other 2-3 times a week and time flew by. In the span of those 3.5mo, we easily had 25-30 dates. Safe to say, we were insane about each other. First time I felt this way after the different women I've met on dates. In hindsight, this probably burned us out too fast..forcing her to end it. 

**Underlying** **Issue -** She got out of a real bad 4yr relationship in April! This trauma still haunts her and told me she needed to work on it. Over those 3.5months she slowly opened up about it to me as we got more comfortable. It was bad, really bad.

Anyway, I think the honeymoon phase for us ended around mid September and she asked for some space to work on herself and process things. (I was stupid and flustered. I was still riding the high...). I waited a few days, and we spent the whole weekend together. I **needed** to give her space but I failed to do that.

**That same weekend, we both confessed we were falling in love with each other. She was incredibly nervous/anxious to say it.** Which makes sense cause she was afraid/scared to be vulnerable again.

One week later she invited me to hang out with her friends for a night out. She was excited/nervous for me to meet them and kept asking me how I felt about them. It went really well but then 2 days later she ended things..

**The last conversation -** She felt that she was stringing me along and it was unfair to have the cake/eat it too. She still has feelings for me but wants me find someone who can commit now since she isn't in that stage yet. She mentioned that if we had met a year from now, we would have been exclusive/serious by now. I have the qualities that she wants in a guy.

I think she felt pressured by me to rush into a serious commitment. That was never my intention.

That day her words conveyed one thing, **BUT** her actions/body language conveyed a completely different thing. I didn't argue or fight it, I accepted her decision at that time. I believe she still has strong feelings for me but pushed me away because I became overbearing. I'm ready to give us both proper space and slow things done a lot more. In my gut, she's absolutely worth trying for.

**That day, at one point, we stared into each other's eyes for 3-4 minutes, no words. It was incredible because up until now we had poor communication but that moment revealed so much..**

73,qbhsa5,1634668526,Many people can't get dates because they can't provide emotional support as well a dance pole can. Be positive so you can provide emotional support!,"The metal pole bar itself would make a better dating partner than many people who bring lots of negativity. It's natural to have little bits of insecurity and negative emotions, but many people have way too much. 

* The metal pole bar will always give you a place to lean on if you need to cry or express emotions.

* The metal pole bar will never tell you that you can't do something.

* The metal pole bar will never control you and tell you that you must do something.

* You never get ultimatums or into arguments with a pole bar. Instead you get loving energy as you feel it's smooth metal texture while hugging it. It can't say ""i love you"" or even express love like a pet, but it can trigger positive chemical reactions!

* The metal pole bar almost never brings sadness. Only happiness, comfort, and joy. After all who here has said anything negative about the x-pole?

The fact is metal pole bars make better partners than many people (of all genders!). My advice is to question whether YOU can provide that emotional support and encouragement better than a dance pole can - this is a huge barrier I have had to overcome before and it's hurt me!

86,qbjbdd,1634672884,Very confused about love and not sure what to do,"I  (M34) think I might be falling in love with a woman who's around my age  and part of my friendship group. I've known her as an acquaintance for a  few years, and didn't really interact with her for a year during the  pandemic. I had a bit of a crush on her to begin with, but nothing too  strong. I think she did for me too. But now we see each other somewhat  regularly again, as part of a group of friends.

Now  she's always on my mind and I can't stop thinking of her. When I go  without seeing her for a while the intoxicating feeling diminishes if I  don't think about her actively, but soon after I see her again it's like  I can't get her out of my head and want to be close with her  emotionally and physically. I don't really know her that well as a  person, but we often make small talk when we meet amongst our friendship  group.

I think she likes me too.  She always seems to come over to me specifically to talk and has a big  smile and glowing eyes whenever we speak. The two of us often chat  together when amongst others, and I never get the impression she wants  to stop speaking with me to chat with others. I do feel there is a  presence and tension between us whenever we interact.

We  walked part of the way to our homes together the other evening after  being out with friends, and I think that's the longest we've been alone  together before. I felt super conscious of everything and hyper-aware  throughout. After saying goodbye, she  text me a few minutes later about  a trivial practicality from earlier in the evening, and said she was  looking forward to chatting with me again this coming weekend (I'll be  in a small group with her again), with a smiley face emoji.

I  feel so incredibly drawn to her, and I can't get her out of my head.  The problem is, I feel in no way ready for a relationship: I got  divorced at the start of this year, following a couple of years of  separation from my ex. I'm in therapy at the moment for anxiety, OCD and  other things. And once this is over, I'm starting to finally feel ready  to explore my sexuality after growing up in an evangelical context,  marrying young as a virgin and enduring a long and very hard marriage of  about 10 years. I want to explore my bisexuality for the first time,  and to have some sexual experiences that most people tend to have in  their late teens and twenties. I also plan to work on my career, move  away from the area next year, and to hopefully move abroad too.

So  it seems that it would be irresponsible to pursue her at this time, or  to lead her on in any way. And moreover, I really want to do these other  things for myself and to focus on them.

But  it really hurts me to be around her and know all this. The conflict is  really hard to manage. I want to pursue her so much, but then I also  want to finally start living on my own terms as a single man and start  pursuing some other goals that would not be compatible with being in a  stable relationship.

I also don't  know if I could be in a short-term, casual relationship with her. My  feelings for her are very strong and I don't want to hurt her or myself.  And we'd still have to to see each other in future when out with our  mutual friends.

I really don't  know what to do with this conflict, and I worry she might ask me out. It  feels like this is what's going to happen if I don't ask her first.  That would be both wonderful and terrifying. I'm finding it really hard  to deal with this internal conflict and my mind is all over the place. I  just want to focus on my therapy and pursue my personal and  professional desires and goals.

89,qbjjs4,1634673540,"How do you get into the dating ""scene"" when you dont really have any experience and low self confidence? (M26)","Long story short: for various reasons, being overweight and awkward as a teen, not really being interested in a relationship and mental health, I have never really been dating much or had more than 1 relationship (6 months, like 4 years ago.) Now After having finally ""won"" a long battle with mental health, I have got a job, I am fit and I have got a good apartment and I have more mental energy now than I have had in ages. In short I have finally gotten my life in order and I would like someone to share it with, but I don't really have any idea how?   


As I said, I am quite inexperienced, the total number of girls I have dated/had flings with comes out at 3, 1 in highschool, that I dated for a bit, which didn't lead anywhere, 1 holiday fling, while traveling/working abroad and my ex from 4 years ago.   


I honestly don't have any idea how/where to start and I kinda suck at writing with people online and find it sort of uncomfortable/awkward, so I don't really know if things like dating apps would be a good fit.   


As a side note: Casual intercourse isn't really me, as I take quite a while to feel comfortable with people touching me, something I am trying to work at, but progress is slow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbjjs4/how_do_you_get_into_the_dating_scene_when_you/

91,qbjm5k,1634673698,Age gap,"So I just wanted to ask a quick question in a short post. I have been talking to this girl a lot recently and we both really like each other. We’ve kinda even hinted to each other that like we would maybe wanna have sex soon. It’s just going really good. I am 16 sophomore in High school and she is a freshman, I turned 16 in September. Up until like basically today I thought she was 15 which I thought that wasn’t a big deal. Though one of her friends told me she’s 14 apparently and her birthday is in September as well. So I am kinda re considering everything, cuz like that means she was 13 like about a month ago and I was 15. I don’t know I think we’re both comfortable and like each other, but I feel like we would be judged and that people would think it’s wrong.

This girl is a  acquaintance of mine but I like her and I think she feels the same.
She told that she will come to my city in the near future to visit some friends and that we should hangout.
I told her that I would like hangout with her and that’s how the conversation ended.
Our texting ended a week ago but I thought about her every day.
Should i text her anything else in the meantime or wait until she decides when she will come?
Will i look desperate if I initiate contact with her again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbjpu8/following_up_on_conversation/

98,qbk4he,1634675123,What did I do wrong? How can I be better?,"Hi, i'm a 20 years old guy. Soon after i gained confidence about 3 years ago i got into a toxic ""relationship"", we were not really together, it was complicated, lasted about 8 months. She used and destroyed me, i got depressed, since then i have social anxiety, zero confidence, i had alcohol problems, drank until i blacked out at every party, i felt that i can't saw her when i'm sober. I lost my trust after one bad experience.
I'm way better now, worked on my anxiety and cut back on alcohol, lost 25 lbs. Still living my life without confidence. For so many months, damn, even years, i was unable to talk to new girls, i prefered not to because i was, and still am, afraid of getting my heart broken again but i'm trying to work on this.
Today on the bus i saw a cute girl, she was gorgeous and she noticed me too, but i was not brave enough to say hi or something. Then we met again in a waiting room, she smiled then sat next to me and we talked for like 20 minutes. She could sat anywhere else or decide not to start a conversation but she did. She finished with her stuff sooner than me and left. She was so cute and nice, after i finished too i tried to find her at a nearby bus stop to talk a little bit more or ask her out but she was gone.
I didn't talked to a girl who i'm interested in for over 2 years, i wanted to talk to, get to know her, ask her out, i was so motivated, not felt this good and alive for a while. I hoped she's interested too, she looked like it. As soon as i got home i added her on facebook but she still did not accept it after 8-9 hours.
I know now that i'm mostly interested in her because she started the whole thing and i didn't had to.
But how can i trust a girl again or approach one if even the one who approaches me disappears?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbk4he/what_did_i_do_wrong_how_can_i_be_better/
