I am F 27 and have been dating for a long time now, I had a few long term relationships in the past but have since realized that the men I dated were always less academically achieved compared to the SOs of my friends. 

I've dated two dudes who just had undergrads and one guy who was in basic retail. They were great people don't get me wrong but I just felt like they weren't that....smart? Talking to them just felt kind of basic at times. They would never elaborate about a subject, just go ""huh that's cool"" or ""oh that sucks, they shouldn't do that"". I just feel like that I was never intellectually stimulated enough. I only have an undergrad degree in media studies but I have a quizzical nature and I'm always eager to learn new things, so I wish my future partner to have the same qualities.

That all being said I just don't where to meet these smarter dudes, I live in a major city in Canada but all the guys I match with tend to just work odd jobs and some haven't even finished college. Other times I might match with a promising dude but they lie about their education and I eventually learn that they just work retail and smoke weed all day.

I have been giving this a go since March between posting in different dating subs on here and with apps. A lot of people have turned out to be fakes, flakes and duds. 

I have only landed a few first dates (this is my first real stab at dating in my life) and one of them I thought was truly it for me and I still think about her. That one apologized for peeling out on me because a family member passed out of the blue and then she basically blocked me until recently when she signed up for a messaging app I am on. I want to message her but I am nervous that it will just lead to getting blocked there so I don’t bother. If you feel to convince me otherwise, please do so. 

And a little background on me… 34 years old, Male, living in Florida (will be 35 later this year)… a lot of me is feeling like that I am just too old for the OLD games and general dating games period. I don’t do well in a lot of social situations because of my autism (which I feel A LOT of women see as an issue… which makes me sad), but I am doing well for myself being self employed, having my own vehicle, and doing most general and basic things. Yeah downside is sharing a house with the folks (want to change that), but you do what you got to do. Of course COVID hasn’t helped and Florida’s real estate market is out of control right now. 

At this point I don’t know if I should just back off since it’s my busiest time of the year for work and just hope something comes about or if my standards I have are too high (won’t post here fully but if you are curious, shoot me a message and I can explain).

I'm not also very tall, about 5'8, and I currently don't go to the gym because i got tired of that routine. I was in a serious relationship between 2012 and 2016 and been completely single after that (5 years). Yea, I've met 1 or 2 girls and we kissed but things never moved on from that. I'm a bit of a loner, introvert, I don't have friends honestly and I live in a small town and I still struggle with depression and anxiety issues. But I'm an intelligent guy, I have a Master's in political science (so I'm no dumb guy, I pay interest to what's going on in the word, I like to read, I like to be informed, not only about politics but about many other things) and I have a certificate in advanced English from Cambridge. I'm writing this post 'cause I wanted to tell some of my experiences with girls (some on Tinder and I've been extremely unlucky with that, and one IRL) so you guys could give me some input of what went wrong, ‘cause I honestly don't know and when I tell my therapist about these situations she can't find a logic explanation for what happened. I'm only going to tell some of the situations that happened more recently, not all of them, otherwise I'd be writing here all day. Note: A notable former portuguese politician used to say that when logic can't explain something, then something weird is going on. That sentence is making more and more sense to me as time goes by.

1. Talked to a girl on Tinder. Conversation went well. Then we agreed to talk on Facebook. Conversation went well for a few days, I invited her for a coffee and she said yes. On the morning of the day when we were supposed to meet, I sent her a message saying: “So we're good for later for our coffee?” She texted me back and said she had met someone the day before (lol) and our date was off. I was like ""what happened?""? and she said she didn't need to explain anything to me 'cause we didn't have any type of commitment, we weren't in a relationship, etc. Yea, ok, but out of the blue doing that in such a cold manner? After that she blocked me on Facebook. This girl was not good looking if looks are all that matter here...maybe a 5/10 or a 6/10.

2. Met a girl on Tinder, we talked for a bit, conversation went well and then we agreed to talk on Facebook. She added me on FB and then she said on Tinder: “i'm going to have dinner but we can talk on Facebook when I get back” and also sent a smile. I said ok and also replied with a smile. After a while I said hi on Facebook, 1,2,3 hours passed and she didn't reply. Then I asked: “Are you still having dinner? Ahahah”. Then she did a like on my profile picture and I noticed that she had read my messages on Facebook but didn't reply...The next day I texted her asking if I had done something wrong and nothing. She never messaged me back until this day lol. Same as above. Not very good looking.

3. This one is tricky. I was still in college finishing my master's and I was invited for a dinner party with other undergraduate students, some were freshman. I was sitting at my table and in the table right in front of me there was this girl which was always eyeballing me (I'm not stupid, I know when it happens). Honestly we were eyeballing each other for a while. I asked my friend if he thought I should go there and make conversation and he said: yea, go ahead. So I went and the conversation went fine. Just a casual conversation about her opinion about our college, our course (she was a political science undergraduate), I told her what I was working on in terms of research for my thesis and she seemed pretty interested. Then I went back to my table and after dinner I went there again to talk to her. Her attitude was completely different, like cold, giving short answers and stuff. I didn't know what was going on but I don't like to insist when I feel that someone doesn't wanna talk to me. After the party was over I tried to find her once again, I didn't see her and then I asked her friend what was going on. She said: well, she has a boyfriend, etc and even this friend of hers who was real nice to me the first time I talked to her, was completely cold to me this time. I just said: ok, she has a boyfriend, so what? Is it forbidden to talk to her? Did she need to talk to me like that? Her friend just ignored me and left. I felt really horrible. When I got home I found her on Facebook and I added her. Well she blocked me right off the bat lol. After a few a weeks I saw her in college and I tried to talk to her. I was completely ignored, she didn’t talk to me at all and her friend literally told me to get loose. Wtf happened here? A bit more good looking.

4. I met a girl on a party (she was a law student) and actually she was the one hitting on me 'cause I was talking to a guy and she came, said I had pretty eyes and stuff, then she went back to her friends, then she came back again and asked for my name. I said it to her and she asked me if I wanted to go somewhere else to dance. I said ok lol. I wasn't going to say no, the girl wasn't bad looking and had a decent body. We drank, we dance, we kissed, etc. I was pretty wasted at the end. We went to her house but I was too much wasted to do something lol so we just kissed for a while and then we slept. The next day I asked for her Facebook 'cause I'd like to have a coffee with her or something. She added me, I accepted and then I said I'd text her later. She said ""ok"" and I left. Her facebook profile was a bit fishy (I'll explain this later) but I didn't give too much thought about that. We talked for a few days on facebook (she usually took hours to reply) and eventually she said that she had broken up with her boyfriend recently and wasn't ready to have a serious relationship with anyone at that point. After a while her profile had been deleted. A few weeks later I found out her REAL profile on facebook and it all made sense. She was in her 2nd year in law school but she was doing something that some students here do (it's like a tradition) of going undercover as freshmans. So they attend some freshman classes, create fake FB profiles, etc and basically that's what she was doing. She was toying with me. I added her real profile on Facebook and I just asked her why she had done that to me. I'm not going to tell everything she texted me back 'cause what she said was like a punch in my soul, not in my stomach. It was really really bad. Like saying that I didn't matter, that she didn't know me from anywhere, that she didn't have to justify anything to me etc. So basically I was just a toy to her..Then she blocked me (like I was expecting).

This kind of stuff really makes me broken. After many attempts with girls (i don't approach women every day, I'm not like that) I feel like it's better for me to give up at this point or I'll end up more broken with rejection after rejection. I don't approach women anymore. I appreciate any inputs.

Well, when the time came, she was not making any indication of pulling money out of her bag. So i ended up paying for it. 

This really turned me off. I dont think I want to go on another date with her because I should not have to pay every time. Is this normal? I know she is not broke despite having no job. I also wont go out with her simply because I need a women who has her stuff together but thats not the point. The point is, do women in 2021 still expect the guy to pay for everything?

I need help with this amazing girl that I really like.

I'm M 30, had a date with this 36 year old woman. Never dated anyone older and she never anyone younger.

We had a date over 3 hours. Sat with drinks and went for a stroll after. However, she wanted to pay for the drinks which I found a bit... unconfortable. I didn't let her pay.

She was very friendly and interested. She askmed me many questions and told a lot about herself, too. I noticed she talked a bit more than I did, though.

I gave her the opportunity to wrap up the date by asking whether she had to catch the train or be back home but she wanted to stay.

Eventually we headed to the station, I said I had a great time with her and that I want to meet her again, she said she thought we had good conversations and that we 'can plan something'. She then wanted to give me a hug - I hugged her.

I asked her to text me when she got home. She did and wrote:

**I got back home! Ready to go to bed! Thanks so much for a lovely evening! I really had great time! Hope you'll arrive home soon too.**

Then I wrote her I'm happy she enjoyed and that I hope to meet her again and wished her good night.

She then replied by just wishing me good night. Maybe because it was very late at night.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she already said she willng to 'plan something' but she didn't reply by repeating that again on text. This makes me insecure.

That she wanted to pay for the drinks and hug me, make me feel friendzoned. Yet, her text was quite positive.

I'm having trouble finding the right approach now. Should I wait for a day or 2? Or propose the 2nd date very soon? Or wait for her to text me again?

All I've ever wanted was a boyfriend and a stable friend group of people who actually cared about me. You know, because I never really had a family. At my age it's not going to happen. Everyone's already taken it or paired off. That's just how it is. I also got out of a relationship with a very abusive individual decided to destroy my reputation because they were confused that I was trying to cheat on them. I wasn't, I didn't even know anyone in the area. I'm not the kind of person to cheat anyway. But they decided to ruin my reputation out of spite and now everybody hates me. And because of that I don't think that I'm ever going to have the opportunity to date or have friends again. Everybody left. That relationship also really screwed me up because it turned out the other person was just scamming me basically. I was used financially. And they told me that when we met online that they never liked me.

 I am irreparably screwed up because this person pretended to be my best friend for years in order to get my guard down. Pretended to like everything I like. All the while secretly resenting me because they thought that I was popular. They said I reminded them of the popular artsy kids that used to bully them in high school and tgat was how they came to hate me. I'm not popular by the way, I never was. And then they pretended to fall in love with me, support me, helped her me away from my abusive family....all so they could destroy my reputation, isolate me,use me financially, gaslight me so hard I don't know my ass from a hole in the ground anymore, all throughout the first and insult every aspect of my existence all throughout pretty much the first half of quarantine. 

I have fully isolated myself from everyone since they moved out and I broke it off with them. I have stayed away from Humanity for about 6 months now and I've only just started going outside again. You know,, because before this person destroyed my reputation so bad I couldn't bear to show my face outside. Just hiding away in my apartment.  People ironically say I should try explaining the situation to my old friends,  make new ones, find someone new and stop moping around. And I'd love to. I really would. 

As a matter of fact I made 3 new friends,  one if whom I really like who seems to be attracted to me. Who I also really attracted to. If not romantically at least in a platonic fwb type way which also sounds nice. After all the controlling behavior and paranoia from my ex, if thats what a longterm committed relationship means (constant accusations of cheating, going through my phone, controlling what i do and how I dress, demanding I don't talk to any of my friends) I don't think I can handle something like that even though sometimes I think that if a committed relationship didn't involve controlling behavior like that that it would be nice. But...a FWB type thing where neither of us try to control the other and we both like each other platonically but we also fuck and there's no strings attached so no one tries to control what the other does or who the other talks to? That sounds pretty nice.

 I am not still in love with my ex. I fell out of love with them the moment they started being controlling and guilt tripping and insulting me constantly. But was too scared of them to leave. I'm not attracted to them, but I am bitter at them for the damage they caused to my reputation and the friends I lost from my involvement with them. And I have been away from other people for so long that I no longer feel like I can relate to anyone adequately. Which is not good grounds for any sort of relationship be it platonic or otherwise.

We always have something to talk about but as far as our hobbies go, we don't have that much in common. We are both students and can't really afford any elaborate dates. All we can do right now is hang out, talk, watch movies, study and have sex. But I think that is not really everything it should be...

So my question is - How did you proceed with your first partner? What did you do at the start until you figured out how the relationship will work? Any insight is welcome however I would most appreciate your stories of how you started and how you managed the first few weeks/months.

My boyfriend is 45M. My marriage ended in May 2018 because of his severe chronic alcoholism. Exh moved an hour away shortly after he moved out.

I did not date anyone or do any dating for a year after that because i knew i had nothing to offer. I had to heal. So i stayed single and worked on getting divorced.

After my one year was up in May 2019, i started online dating for the first time in my life. What an eye opener. I'd rate the whole experience about 6/10. The only benefit to OLD is access. I am a busy professional in a rural area. So yeah.

I went on about 10 dates with different people. Of hat 10, i dated one for 6 weeks, another for 3 weeks, and then one for 4 months. One ended up annoying me and was too intense, one wasn't over his ex, and the 4 month one, he simply didn't have the time for a relationship and I ended it because 1) he wouldn't and 2) i didn't care about him because of the lack of time investment.

So a year of online dating was up in May 2020. I reflected and decided that it was more toxic than healthy and adjusted accordingly. I got rid of all my profiles and started using ONLY Zoosk at the suggestion of colleague. It's not free so people have skin in the game, and it skews older. I got far less matches, but the ones i got were decent.

so in May 2020, my only profile was on zoosk. The summer of 2020 i became disillusioned with it all and by September i was ready to delete that one remaining profile and cancel. I was just done with it all and decided that anyone i met, it would be organically IRL.  If that never happened, I was 100% content regardless. The reason was that i created a fake profile to see how people lied about their intentions. And gosh, do people lie about their intentions.  That was the final straw for me. The abyss looked back at me. My Zoosk membership was up at the End of September and i decided i wasn't going to renew.  

During this time, a few people had messaged me. I did not reply because i was DONE with it after looking into the abyss. One night i was in bed on Sept 25 2020, and this voice popped into my head. It said ""You aren't being fair"".

 So i logged back in and looked at the messages 2 men sent me. They were decent messages and they had clearly looked at my profile. I messaged both back. After talking to J for about a week, he took me out to nice restaurant and had a great time.

That was a year ago come October 1,and we have been happily together ever since.

The lesson i learned is that you and them, have to want the SAME thing, at the SAME time and WITH each other.

Hello everyone! Tomorrow, me (21m) and a girl I’ve been dating (19f) will be going on our fourth date. Our previous dates were an arcade, bowling, and a movie. So this will be our first romantic date. On our movie date she put her head on my shoulder, so I put my arm around her. And we stayed like that for the last 20ish minutes of the movie. 

After the date we were texting about the “touch barrier”. She said that she is very touchy feely with people she “really likes”, but she’s been hesitant because she didn’t know if I was comfortable with it. She said that she wanted to more of that with me, but “just the little things”. Of course I told her I was and I told her that I appreciated that she asked me first.

We agree to go on a picnic date tomorrow so I’m super excited. We’re gonna get sandwiches and then we’re going to a park with a great view of the city. I’m gonna pick up her favorite cookies also. Does anyone have any tips? I was gonna bring a speaker for music, but I’m not sure what else. I was thinking I could bring drawing tools cause she’s artsy and I like to draw (badly lol) in my free time. I’m also gonna bring my film camera to take photos of our surroundings (I’m a photographer). Anything else? Also, how should I plan on being more touchy feely? I wanna hold her hand at some point, and maybe even kiss her if it seems right.

So here’s the whole story. I met this guy 2 years ago. We chatted and got to hung out twice within those 3 weeks that I’ve known him. He seemed really decent and not push/creepy at all. There was a time he hinted that he wants to sleep with me, but I wasn’t ready so we just kind of mutually faded one another. 

Fast forward to winter of this year, I was looking for a hookup/ fwb. He was the first guy that came to mind to ask because I was really attacted to him. I didn’t wanna go back on the apps anymore since I felt lazy doing so. I don’t have a lot of friends to meet someone through friends. Anyway, I asked him but he turned me down because he said he was in a relationship. But then a week later, he asked me if I was still down to hookup because he’s “single now.” By that time I didn’t think too much about it so I told him “I’m still down.” But then the next day, he apologized, telling me he didn’t wanna do it anymore because he was worried about covid. 

A week ago, he texted to ask me if I was still down to hook up to which I had said yes. We had a plan to meet up tonight- he was supposed to pick me up and do it in his car. I gave my friends all the details about this guy. One of my friends said something along the lines of “he had turned you down a long time ago but when he texted you recently, you immediately said yes?? Why did you do that? He’s gonna think you’re easy. He’s gonna tell his friends about it and they’re gonna make fun of you. I feel like the covid thing was just a bs excuse. And why did he only text you now?” I told my friend that it’s because he was in another state for a few months during the summer. I feel like by the time he got vaccinated (idk when exactly, but it was probably around April-May?), he already had plans for a summer internship and he just recently got back last month that’s why it took him this long to text me. I was also telling my friends that I was the first to turned him down 2 years ago, so I guess we’re even now (?) LOL. They’re also worried about the fact that he turned me down bc he was seeing someone else then suddenly he’s single a week later. “He’s untrustworthy and who knows? He might do something and use it against you”

When we got into my car, we started making out, and it became very clear that we were both really into each other. We had sex at my place, and afterwards, she spent the entire rest of the day with me. We went grocery shopping and cooked dinner together, and she decided to spend the night. We had long conversations about life while cuddling in bed, and it seemed like we had a great physical and emotional connection as well. She told me that she ""really liked me"" and I told her I liked her as well. 

In the morning, we had sex again, and I offered to cook her breakfast, but she said that she had to leave. I walked her back to the bus stop, and we made out again before she went back home. I got a text from her an hour later saying that she was home safe and wanted to see me again, and I told her I felt the same. On Tuesday, I sent her a message telling her that I really enjoyed hanging out with her and I wanted to know if she was available on Friday. And... no response whatsoever. I also noticed on Tinder that she had unmatched with me. While there are definitely explanations as to why she unmatched with me (she could have deleted her account), the fact that she has failed to respond to me over the course of 2 days and I'm unmatched from her on Tinder tells me that it's highly likely she will not be responding to me anymore. I could be wrong and she might still respond, but I'm not holding my breath for it.

In the past, I might have gotten desperate and started blowing up her phone, but I'm not going to do that. I've tried to reach out once, and the ball is in her court. Whatever her reason for ghosting me is irrelevant; all that matters is moving forward. All I have to do at this point is put my energy towards worthwhile investments; working out, eating right, seeing other girls, and not giving her any more of my attention or time unless I have a VERY compelling reason to. For those who have been ghosted as well, just know that the best thing you can do is to not consider being ghosted a reflection of your own self, but rather a reflection of the person who is ghosting you. Someone who completely disappears on you does not deserve your precious time, and in fact, the ghost will most likely end up fading out or getting faded out by others as well.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,997872,public,self,"Ghosted after a great first date, but I'm OK",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl1koi/ghosted_after_a_great_first_date_but_im_ok/,all_ads,6,,,

So here’s the whole story. I met this guy 2 years ago. We chatted and got to hung out twice within those 3 weeks that I’ve known him. He seemed really decent and not push/creepy at all. There was a time he hinted that he wants to sleep with me, but I wasn’t ready so we just kind of mutually faded on one another. 

Fast forward to winter of this year, I was looking for a hookup/ fwb. He was the first guy that came to mind to ask because I was really attacted to him. I didn’t wanna go back on the apps anymore since I felt lazy doing so. I don’t have a lot of friends to meet someone through friends. Anyway, I asked him but he turned me down because he said he was in a relationship. But then a week later, he asked me if I was still down to hookup because he’s “single now.” By that time I didn’t think too much about it so I told him “I’m still down.” But then the next day, he apologized, telling me he didn’t wanna do it anymore because he was worried about covid. 

A week ago, he texted to ask me if I was still down to hook up to which I had said yes. We had a plan to meet up tonight- he was supposed to pick me up and do it in his car. I gave my friends all the details about this guy. One of my friends said something along the lines of “he had turned you down a long time ago but when he texted you recently, you immediately said yes?? Why did you do that? He’s gonna think you’re easy. He’s gonna tell his friends about it and they’re gonna make fun of you. I feel like the covid thing was just a bs excuse. And why did he only text you now?” I told my friend that it’s because he was in another state for a few months during the summer. I feel like by the time he got vaccinated (idk when exactly, but it was probably around April-May?), he already had plans for a summer internship and he just recently got back last month that’s why it took him this long to text me. I was also telling my friends that I was the first to turned him down 2 years ago, so I guess we’re even now (?) LOL. They’re also worried about the fact that he turned me down bc he was seeing someone else then suddenly he’s single a week later. “He’s untrustworthy and who knows? He might do something and use it against you”

Anyway, I'm taking her bowling tn, and hopefully if everything goes well, we'll either end up at her place or mine. I'm not sure if she actually wants to go all the way yet or not, but if she does, I'm not sure if I should tell her. I wouldn't lie if she asked, but I also think saying it right before would probably be kind of a turn off. The one thing is that I am kind of anxious about it, because it's been built up for so long. I'm anxious about it for many reasons, one being that I don't want to do bad, or be too quick, etc. I figure the best way to alleviate my nerves may be to just be up front about it, that way she knows why I'm nervous about maybe not so confident, and don't know what I'm doing. I think I appear confident to her, but of course when it comes to something I've never done before I'm not. I figure if she knows, then I've got nothing to hide really. I'm also worried like I may not be able to even get it up if I'm too nervous. These worries make me even more nervous and it's like a vicious cycle lol.

As the  title says, I'm looking for some people's perspective on a few things that are bothering me about my relationship to see if I'm just overthinking things

I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl I really like, when things are great, there great. However I find myself in a situation where she refuses to tell any of her family we're in a relationship (we've been together for 5 months). This really limits our ability to communicate, as I work full time, she studies full time and is always around her family, whether at her house with her parents or going around to her brothers house most evenings. Due to this we can't facetime or talk on the phone in case someone hears us. she claims it's because they will all judge her, but I can't help this feeling that I'm some sort of secret.

The other thing bothering me is that she never defends me to her best friend (the only person who does know I exist), Her best friend 'hates me' because me and my girlfriend once had a chat, very early days, about whether or not she would be better off with someone local, as she really values physically intimacy. This means that whenever she is with her best friend, which is basically all the time she isn't with her family, he best friend is constantly criticising me, we can't talk as her friend takes her phone away from her because 'she doesn't need someone like me who doesn't want to be with her' (which obviously isn't true). She says there's no point defending me because 'she won't listen anyway' which again just feels like an excuse.

It’s been a while now and I’ve been scared to ask her out but I promise next week I will ask her out when I see her when we are both alone. This is my first time ever asking a girl out which is why it’s taken a while to build up my confidence, and she’s also my first crush. This girl has been sending mixed signals and I can’t tell if she’s into me or not so I want to hear you guys opinions on Reddit I know you can’t read minds but reading opinions on reddit helps me calm down as right now I’m so nervous to ask her out. 

Good signals: 

1. Firstly we were in a group watching friends. The theme song comes on and she starts singing it and pointing at me. I’m so confused and then she saids this song has the potential to describe us. I couldn’t even response because I was so in shock plus I didn’t know the lyrics. Went home and I searched the lyrics and the lyrics seem very romantic it’s talking about always being there for each other etc. After reading the lyrics I think she was hinting at romantic future between us. 

2.  I was in a room with the girl I like and 2 other people. I was talking to these two people and the girl was cleaning. I then tell a story about how this girl approached me and complimented my hoodie and asked for my snap. This girl completely stops cleaning and I see her watching me as I’m telling this story and she frowns her face so she’s obviously Interested  in my other interactions with other girls otherwise she would have kept cleaning as for the previous topics she never showed any interest till I brought up another girl. 

3. She also told me we have never been on a date when I asked her a question about the date (day month) which she misunderstood for a Romantic date and she really seemed like she wanted me to ask her to one she didn’t even seem in disgust.

  Some bad signals 

1. We are in a room full of all her girlfriends and I’m sitting by myself chilling on my phone as they are talking about dating guys (not my type of convo obviously 🤣)  and she saids she could never date Mediterranean people and I’m from the Mediterranean she was obviously sneak dissing me. 

2. Then as the conversation continued she saids some crazy stuff like I don’t remember where I spelt last Tuesday but I know it wasn’t in my room sounds like she was implying she had sex. I’ve never in my life seen a girl admit to having sex especially in a group setting normally girls are very lowkey  about there sexual life’s since girls are judged more harshly for having sex etc. I truly believe she was bluffing and trying to get my reaction like how do you even forgot where you sleep in the first place. I even asked her how do you not remember and she give a cheeky smile and said I don’t know. 

3. Then she said she wants a boyfriend that has a black car which is obviously hinting at a specific guy in the collage that she occasionally hangs out with and he drives her. I hang out with this girl way more then this guy does. This guy still scares me because he’s Pakistan and she always looks at Pakistan models on Instagram so she clearly has a preference for Pakistan boys. She also said I bet my Bluetooth is already connected to my future boyfriend car. I don’t know if she’s saying this stuff to see my reaction or she if actually likes that guy with the car. I feel like she might be using this guy name to let me know time is running out and is challenging me to ask her out

For context, the walk was long, so we probably got a good 45min or so of chatting that day. From past experience with other girls at school (including the semester so far), we seemed to hit off really well. Of course she could have just been really nice, but it went well enough to where I'd really like to meet her some more. The problem is that in following classes three classes since, I haven't gotten more than a few minutes with her, and no chance to get her number. The first time she was said she was busy, and the second time she disappeared pretty quickly, though she was very pleasant both times.

As additional context, I have a close (male) friend in the class, and apparently they have several classes together (they don't know each other previously, and also the friend has been staying aside when I tried to talk to her). He said she tends to disappear after classes, and from what he's told me, the workload is heavy so I do think she's actually busy and I don't feel like she's just brushing me off.

The question: Would it be weird to send her an email through the school system to try to connect? (connect, not ask out) What I'm thinking is something short like ""Hey XXX, it's YYY from ZZZ class. I enjoyed meeting you last week, and would really like to meet again, maybe to get coffee. And of course, I'd be open to doing any class projects. If you're interested, here's my number. Best, -ZZZ.""

I know someone will ask ""Why don't you wait until the next class?"", I can (and have 3 times...), but my first reason is that I think it will get more weird if I wait too long to move; and secondly, just from past experience, I'd rather roll the dice early and move on rather than let things drag out too long.

A little bit of backstory, I (22M) live next door to this girl (22F) and we’ve been off and on hanging out for the last 6 months. We had a ‘what are we looking for from this’ talk about 2 months into getting to know each other and she expressed interest in seeing other people as that’s the way she’s sorta been living throughout the pandemic. I told her I was looking for a relationship (long term or not) but she seemed hesitant on the idea and I’m wondering if it’s partially due to that I haven’t had any relationships  survive longer than a few months. 

So last night I go to a party she threw for and all of her roommates and close friends that I know seemed to be egging me on to ask her out. The odd thing is some of them mentioned that I should make this happen ‘within the next few days’ as if there’s some sort of timer ticking. 

The thing is there’s a bunch of things about myself I’d like to work on such as gaining weight, trying harder in school, leaning off drug usage. I can’t see myself going through this “together” with her as it’s my own journey. It’s not that I’m not willing to share my life with her, I just know it would be hard to do all these things while also focusing on creating a healthy relationship VS taking each thing one at a time. 

I need advice, should I just send it and ask her out and risk not completing any of my goals before the new year, or should I gamble the chance of missing my opportunity to date someone that has already told me they’re both looking for exclusivity.

Were in a separate departments so we dont to get to see each other a lot except on breaks these days which gives me time to be focused on my high demanding job. We have been out on lets call them “dates” and carpool rides where we jam music and talk about stuff and its awesome I genuinely think he is a great guy inside out although there are some things that do put me off which makes me confused whether I want to give it shot (aka if I really see myself with him,maybe I am being overly critical but I cant help but think about those things and i wanted to share):

1- I’m an introvert and he is too, were both reserved and very similar in some ways except I feel like I am more outgoing as in I like to take risks and step out of my comfort for growth and more opportunities either career or life wise, meanwhile its very hard for him to to step out and I try to have talks cause he tells me his struggles sometimes and I try to help him by giving him solutions/ideas on how to make things better cause I genuinely care for him but he is sometimes too reserved that it scares me for later on if i ever give it a shot. I feel like he hides so much and sometimes lies to himself to avoid “dealing” with things. Maybe if we ever get together it might be a struggle maybe I am overthinking idk

2- There are times where he is a little innocent for a 27 year old man it feels like he doesn’t seem to understand sexual and adult innuendos which are fun sometimes between my close coworker. Here’s how the scenario went: My female coworker showed me a meme at break time and part of the joke had the word “coochie” and he was there and he legit asked my co worker what is it, I was kind of shocked and also surprised? She looked at me super confused and said to him “I am so done with you” she kept laughing and he kept saying “cmon whats a coochie” loudly and I told him: “listen you need to keep it down, and told you’re too innocent sometimes try to google it” and then he just gasped and said “oh I understand” knowing and seeing him he just didn’t google it and just went with the flow after literally everyone gasping. So I ended explaining to him on private chat.. although general talks about sex have slipped in our convos and I know he understands it but I cant help but worry a little


3- Were both highly sensitive people but for him its extremes sometimes that if he comes to me while working to get my attention  I respond with: “sorry I am just busy I’ll get back to you” I feel like he takes it personally and it shows so he starts acting cold and distant sometimes. 

4- He might be a homophobe and its an issue because I have LGBTQ best friends and I am concerned if he gets to meet them at some point how will he react. Back im June we were taking about how Its amazing to see people coming out and finding their strength etc and his response was “ooh well i dont know what to say but sometimes it disgusts me I dont know what to tell you” and he paused with a semi-straight face and never continued and I just felt annoyed and asked to myself (maybe he is having a bad day or something) still its not an excuse

5- There are days where we used to carpool when I didn’t have my car because he lives a building away from me. So we agree that we will clock early to avoid salary reductions and so I am dressed ready to go on time meanwhile he would take 30 mins and he wouldn’t say anything and his excuse “well sorry I am just not feeling things atm” completely discarding my timing as well. 

So by the end of that month They deducted half of my salary (be reminded that both of us are underpaid and its sad also not cool). I keep telling him that he needs to care about time or he will lose his job and he has no other choice (based on his field and the market in covid these days in where we live) not to mention we were warned by the HR already and my manager noticed my tardiness. I did tell him that they deducted my salary from last month and you should check your message too and replied “I am really sorry I didn’t mean to”

I really dont know if he just is selfish or inconsiderate but I get it there are times its hard to get out of bed but discipline at where we work is important and he should be more considerate and all. Then he just complains well you know this and that happened.. and in my mind: well maybe because you keep coming late and I dont blame your manager for being furious when he wants to work on something quick and you show up 30 mins/1 hour late since you’re his associate. 

Thank you for reading this, I dont know if its enough for me distance myself cause I already feel like I am not as drawn to him cause of his actions and its stressing because I thought I had found my person after a painful 6 years of being heartbroken by someone who got away. Maybe I an expecting too much? Should I give it time? Maybe he is inexperienced too?

I took my computer because I value my privacy… and because I have a long distance “flirtationship” with someone else that I didn’t want to be a conversation piece. 
He played off his persistence to get my computer back as curiosity.
After a little back &amp; forth where I was adamant about him not looking, he ended up locked himself in my bathroom with the unlocked computer (apparently the default is to wait 5 minutes after closing 😒).. &amp; read my messages…
Which were… spicy lol
He came out the bathroom acting passive &amp; claims he doesn’t care what else I do and didn’t care to begin with.
He also said that I’d have an issue with him doing the same thing, but he personally doesn’t care &amp; it’s just funny to him.
Lastly, he made a comment about how I would’ve invited my long distance friend to see me if he hadn’t been with me recently.

He said no when I asked if he was upset…. but doesn’t want me touching him &amp; he hasn’t talked to me much even though he’s at my place.
He usually goes home when he’s upset (he’s also an introvert so he loves being at home anyway) but he went to sleep here. Barely touched me when I laid next to him.. which was weird because we usually hold one another at night. He’s pretty distant &amp; passive aggressive.
I don’t understand why he’s acting different. Or why he went through my mac. Or what he wants or expected.
I’ve asked him but it’s all been brushed off or met with silence.

Background:
I’m 25, 2 kids; he’s 27, no kids
He doesn’t want to be official, last time I checked.
He’s told me to find someone else for the things he wasn’t interested in doing before (FaceTime sex, for example)
He spends time around my kids with &amp; without me present.
We spend the night at each other’s houses… sometimes he spends a couple of days over mine.
We have never said I love you.
