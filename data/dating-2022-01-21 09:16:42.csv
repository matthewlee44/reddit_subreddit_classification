4,s9dbpp,1642779051,Should I tell her my feelings,"So, I'm going to the same international school with this girl, I'm 17M and She is 16F. After all my efforts, I got her number, and during winter break we went out, but we didn't name it as a date. I think this was the biggest mistake here, the first date went good, we talked and asked about each other. For second date, I suggested for playing sports. She first agreed via text, then when I tried to schedule in school, she said she don't know, there are bunch of tests, but it sounds fun, my friends would like it too. Initially, I was pissed off as she just changed to not go out, but now I think it's because I did not say I like her(although it might look pretty obvious that I like her). That was last week, and there was no texting from me and her. I thought to just move on, but today her being incredibly gorgeous in new clothes made me think about it again. I'm an athlete who tries to turn pro, I always feel kinda lonely because of so much training and I thought she would be the perfect one to share feelings and support each other.

5,s9dce7,1642779097,"He asked for exclusivity, I said yes but now I have so much anxiety","The guy (24M) I (20F) have been seeing for the past month and a half is seemingly a great guy. He is the definition of a nice guy--super caring, thoughtful etc. The only issue is I'm not fully attracted to him physically and he's super invested in me without really knowing much about me. I am a conventionally attractive woman who doesn't struggle to get attention from men, it's usually just an issue with the quality. Most men I meet are online and I met him online. he's more average and he's not someone I see and instantly want to jump his bones. We did have sex once and it was fun and he was attentive (he finished, I didn't). When we're together, most of our conversations are surface level and I require something deeper. He also doesn't seem to make much effort into asking me more about my past/aspirations/personality etc. I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style and I've never been in a relationship so this is the furthest I've ever gone with someone.  so during this whole thing I've tried to end things with us twice because I just wasn't ready and every time, we end up coming back together. The most recent time was about a week ago and after reconciling, he asked for exclusivity. I said yes and went to bed. The next morning I woke up with extreme anxiety, like full-on panic attack mode. I'm scared that I'm boxed in and that I'll have to commit to this now that I've agreed. I'm someone that really values freedom and he wants a commitment but I don't think I like him enough to get there with him. I try to rationalize it by thinking that it takes time to get to know someone and I need to give him a chance. However, I can't help but feel like we aren't the right fit and now I don't know how to end it. When I last tried to end it, I was planning on blocking him after so I wouldn't be tempted to respond to his messages and get right back to square one, but I didn't block him. And now here we are. I don't know if I should just block him now or just not respond to his messages or send him one last message. Either way, I'm the shitty person in the situation for not trusting in myself enough to end something that I don't 100% want and leading him on unintentionally.

6,s9dcw2,1642779132,"Please, I need advice.","This is about my girlfriend, 24 and I (25M).

A little background, it is necessary, we've know each other for 14 years now. Out of which I've liked her romantically for the past 8 years, and I let her know about it. Our dads being in Navy were transferred and we had to part ways. For some reason I couldn't shake off the feelings I had for her. When I let her know about them, she said she doesn't believe in long distance relationship. So I backed off. Though for her, I remained a friend and did not push anymore. 

In the last year for my engineering school, in a chat session, we grew a little to intimate details and I had told her that I wasn't dating anyone and I knew she wasn't dating anyone either. Then she asks if we could try LDR. I was overwhelmed and though I never mentioned to her, I was hoping for such a chance and I jumped on it. Precisely 3 days into the 'LDR' she buckles and says she wasn't thinking straight and it was an impulse decision. She called that off. It hurt. It fucked up a few chances at school professionally. So I went to do my masters, recovered from the phase and for some reason we started chatting again. A year goes by and I'm kinda tired of hoping anything would happen and I let her know the same and when she wasn't able to decide, I shut off from her and backed out again. Threw myself into academics. 2 months go by and I recieve a text from her asking how I was and we chatted again. Then she proposes this idea of getting back together. I declined. She was understanding, but deep down we both wanted to give it a genuine shot. I could hold any longer and let her know my concerns regarding our past and we believed we could work past them and be happy together. We got back together. 

We're nearing 2 years together. Everything is good. We've met anytime we could, anytime we could find for ourselves. Living 4 states apart isn't easy. She lives with her family and they don't know about us. So the calls are scarce. We mostly chat through the day. 

The issue is I am more involved romantically in the relationship than her. She knows that. She's afraid that she couldn't reciprocate at my level. She is romantically very unresponsive. Like no romance from her at all. I am the one who always initiates the romantic stuff and mostly get ignored. She says she doesn't like to chat over texts as much as she once used to. I try to be very careful of talking to her about our past. We decided we w could make a fresh start. It has been good. We have good and long chats. But these are the kind, one would have with their friends. I am always afraid of freaking her out with my thoughts about our relationship and the future. She had told me once that she panicked when I told her what I had in mind for us. She says she's making efforts, I respect that but what I fear is,

 would I be selfish to have some expectations in the relationship? Would I risk our relationship in the fear of bringing stuff up to discuss about our future? 


She's a gem of a person, really very good at heart. She really isn't a romantic type of person and always says that she to broken to love somebody. But I love her. Very much. I can't shake this feeling of uneasiness. I want to talk to her, but I'm too afraid to lose her. But I also know that I am not happy with this arrangement. Is it wrong to carry expectations in the relationship?

10,s9e7xo,1642781464,I (24m) recently when on a date with a wonderful woman(20f),"Since it was our(we been talking for about 1 month and this was my first day off in a while) first date I told her to not think about to hard and just go with the flow of conversation. We got coffee, and then got some sushi. We spent 6 hours together but due to her age I couldn't take her to a bar as at that time it was the only businesses open. We still wanted to spend time together but it was also freezing so I jokingly suggested a hotel room to get out the cold and so that we can talk alone and get to know each other better. She agreed and we got a room some water and some snacks. 

Once inside we started talking but the sexual tension became very apparent and we started making out and ended up having sex and it was great, we match sexually very well,we both have similar kinks . She text me the next day telling me how insecure and overwhelmed she's feeling about the whole thing and how we should slow down. We talk and text each other everyday since and are meeting again today, she wants to come over to my job and chill while I finish my shift, my boss doesn't mind at all since I've done it before and every one there does it.

Me and her are complete opposites. She's shy and quiet and me due to my job (bartender) I'm very confident and loud. I show my affection through touch like hugs and kisses and clearly sex. Now I respect that she wants to slow down. And I do too, since I'm kinda tired of the hooking up and want something real, so her asking me to slow down made me happy since it makes me think that she wants something serious. 

My insecurities comes from me being a very flirtious person I don't want her to feel insecure about us, but I also gotta earn my tips.

15,s9ef0b,1642781988,"I don't get dates, but most of the time I myself don't feel fulfilled with my options, do you have perspective for me?","Hey guys, so I (23m) wouldn't say that I'm unattractive. Im fact I get many states by women (especially in summer, wearing short trousers). I'm also very confident, goal oriented — would even call myself an alpha, a leader type. I'd say I'm very experienced in life due to my difficult past. 

At the moment I've hit a weird spot in my experience with ""dating"". Basically most interactions didn't lead anywhere. Many women disqualify themselves rather quickly, mostly through immaturity or too much focus on sex. Often I am not enthusiastic about meeting them, except if they make me horny, but I don't feel that's my thing. At the moment I feel my approach in general is totally wrong. 

I feel rejected, even though I myself know they act different to what I would tolerate. I also feel like I don't attract women my age or experience or attitude, while also feeling that I am inexperienced because I seldom meet anybody that falls into that category. As a graduate student studying at my age I am older than most of my colleagues. 

I also recently have noticed, that women in the train sometimes look at me and notice some opportunities to chat some up. I always think what a suitable approach would be. Before I never traveled by train, and this option will fade in ten days too, often they look too young. 

Well I maybe am very picky and should just hit it off, even though this idea doesn't seem right even if I'm horny, since I'm a focus driven person and want to achieve my goal by dating a woman I think has potential. ... I'm also thinking, maybe I am too picky, and I'll just prioritize meeting up with them, even if they don't impress me too much. But then this also seems ingenuine and a waste of time 

I don't feel so lonely anymore, but I crave connection and intimacy. Also want to improve my style this year, to look more mature and be noticed by women who are more mature. I don't know, but maybe I should also transition to improving my chances in talking to women spontaneously to have more mature conversations. I know I am a high value man, my psychologist (f,~23) admires me, when I'm done with therapy I of course have to hit her up.

Do you guys have some tips or encouragement? What do you guys think? I am so busy with my love of physics and don't have a lot of time to really dig deep into what's the direction I need to go with dating, but maybe I should, to know what to focus on.

19,s9eqvd,1642782839,Is he loyal?,"Heads up: 
This story might be a bit long 

I met a guy online this summer through a talking app with strangers. He had a kink or a fetish that I was low-key into. He would ask to send feet pictures to masturbate to and sent his private pic. 

We both agreed that everything will be anonymous, neither would be able to know who they’re talking to and it was all under our consent. Keep in mind that my friend was the one who found him and shared his account with me so we could talk to him. My friend and I made a fake snap account to send pictures and chat with him and he has an account out of the talking app in snap chat that he uses with everyone he met through the talking app just like us.

Fast forward him and I started talking more than just sending pictures( I never sent my feet picture or masturbated it was just my friend and him). He started calling every day from 12-1 am till 4 am. A month after we got to know each other so much , deep talks got us sleeping on the call together and checking up on each other in the morning.

He told me he had a couple of relationships. They weren’t all healthy, got cheated on and fell out of love in some and some ended in good terms also one blocked/ghosted him and it didn’t really sit right with him. 


The second month of talking my friend stoped talking to him as much. She tried telling me that I’m going on the wrong direction and this is not the right person for me. It was too late at this point because I was already invested taking for 8 hours a day on the phone and the rest through test. 

We argued a lot since the calls would be at midnight or ams. He’d be online for hours and then call me at night to end his day with me. I confronted him about it and he started calling at night and texting or calling during the day. 

My friend disapproved of all of this, she found his insta account his real name and his pictures without me knowing about it. She dmmed him with a fake account and started talking to him, he flirted back but said he has a girlfriend when he was asked. Told the girl he’ll show her around since she said she moved to the area he’s in recently. My friend then told him she did all of this to show me that he’s not worthy and he’s not the right person since I was full on invested and loved him. He told her he knew this account was fake and treated it like so. He asked to call her to explain why he talked like that. She told him I’m not going to be the one to break the news to me and he will. 

He called me that day sounding so devastated, explained everything and said he knew the account was fabricated that’s why he talked to that girl in that way. 
He told me to take my time to think about if I still want this or not and he’s apologetic. 
This all happened when we didn’t meet in person all online and he doesn’t know how I looked like and who I am. 
 
I lied about my age, name and where I’m from. Right until our first date I told him everything. 

Fast forward I decided to forgive him and we had our first date. He saw me for the first time but I did see his picture on insta since the flirting event happened. He’s big on words of affirmation, he promised to love take care and we had a lot of deep talks. We talked like we’ve been hanging out for years and I don’t think I can describe how alive I felt that day. 

He told his best friend about me and a couple of his friends, and turns out we had a lot of mutuals too. 
He doesn’t like going out much so we have dates every once in a while ( once or twice a month). I called him out on it and we had huge arguments because of it. I also talked about how he calls at night only and would be online for hours and not reply to my messages. I hinted and asked who he’s talking to, he told me he’s not cheating if I’m trying to refer to that. His snap score was rising tho we weren’t talking there anymore. He said he made friends there too and he wanted to keep his identity and so do they so they wanted to only talk through the fake account.

About 2 months ago I found out that he has a TikTok account that I didn’t know of. He followed only one account and that account followed him back so one follower and one following. 
It was a girl, I asked who she was he said this account is really old and she is a friend from university. He quickly changed his account from public to private. When I asked he said he didn’t want his contacts following him cause he doesn’t use TikTok much and didn’t want to be spammed. Though his best friend said he never heard of her name ( the girl he follows). 
I gave the benefit of the doubt and decided not to dig in. 

On a date he was using his phone infront of me and though his most recent calls the contact he was talking to was “the girls friend letter of her name” the initial. I didn’t ask because I didn’t want to seem like I’m all up his ass. He showed me his female friends ( he’s an exovert and loves talking and meeting new people) on his phone and explained if they met through uni or school or family friends. I asked to see the girl when he was done he’s said she doesn’t post pictures and she’s not as active on socials. 

Ps. His outings are either with his family or me and barley his friends. So if there is a girl he’s talking to he barley goes out with her. 

Whenever I find myself overthinking though I don’t have any type of proof that he’s cheating but why would he be acting like that I feel guilty. So I find myself trying to always push him to the edge or corning him to talk and that I don’t believe the reasons he mentions. I start to hold grudges and treat him like shit, not answer his calls, reply late or reply half ass. 
I wouldn’t confront him on whats pissing me off or why I’m talking passive aggressively. He’s patient and would try to know why I’m pissed never cussed me out even when I did. And always had a very calm way of confronting or talking to me. 
Our dates are nothing but a fairytale every time he’s such a gentleman in public and private. Always told me I know how to love and everytime I asked to break up because of my overthinking and I’m jumping to conclusions he’d ask if we could work on this relationship together promises to change habits I hate, and he did work on it alot. 

Today marks our 7 months he makes me happy, though my brain is eating me trying to know if he’s cheating on me or not. 
Is him being online and not replying to me on time means that he’s talking to her? Though he calls me every single day and showers me with love in every phone call? 

Does me not having any type of proof of him cheating means that he’s not?

Am I overthinking and if is a female friend as he said ?

Does he only want to be with me because he knows I would be there and he knows the girl he’s talking to will leave him at some point? 

Or does he actually love me hence he actually worked on himself and this relationship when I asked him to change habits that I hate and showers me everyday with love and can’t go a day without talking to me and asking me how my day was?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9eqvd/is_he_loyal/

Her last words were “ although you’re one of the nice guys, you’re fat, not very good looking and poor”. Essentially, began working out - got fit, somehow ended up working a job that pays well working with world leaders and made many changes. I obviously also dodged a bullet - no matter how In love and heart broken I was. Nevertheless, today I still struggle with the psychological effects of those final words. I feel that girls still don’t find me attractive and fear that women just want to be my friend as I’m un-datable. The few love interests I have, I never know if they’re flirting or not, feel nice about it and then they call me pal - so I move on, but still hurts.

During our fling she would come visit and we went on some dates and had sex, but she said she didn't feel a connection. I was kind of upset about it because I wanted to continue and see where things went but I understood. Plus, distance kind of sucks anyways.

Well, we started talking last week and she was like ""this guy I'm talking to '*blah blah blah*'"" clearly frustrated because he likely broke things off. We kept talking and kept talking and now we are planning on catching back up, this time in my hometown. I know, I seem like an idiot driving but we're flirting pretty hard.

26,s9frnz,1642785491,How can I start approaching girls despite my anxiety? can someone overlook my flaws?,"I am a young guy who really has been only talking to girls online. I live in NYC and I match with some girls, most of them ghost me however and I haven't met up with any of them. I've recently been asking people to give me face ratings because I wanted to know where I stand and they have all told me I am above average. I just have very bad anxiety along with depression and even some agoraphobia (not severe) but it physically pains me to leave my house. When I do leave the house though I find girls staring at me. When it's happening my mind always gets scared because I'm not sure what they are thinking. Then later I think they probably found me attractive otherwise they wouldn't of been staring that long. My life has been in the gutter, and I've been working on it the best that I can. I'm very lonely and am thinking that my best bet is to just do cold approach because everyone is a stranger until you meet them and online just seems like a waste. (Online would be ideal due to anxiety but I'm just not seeing any success)

I used to have a girlfriend actually (pretty and popular) and go out most days like a normal person but around when covid first began a lot of terrible things happened. I lost my girlfriend, my parents told me I should off myself, my friends stopped being my friends, the lockdown happened, and I stopped leaving my house completely due to all of this. I have done some therapy mostly over the phone. 

The reality is that for me to build more of a life I will probably have to start being around more people in general and so that somewhat goes beyond just approaching girls but I really want to feel someone's love so badly.

Do they even want to be approached? How can I start? And would they even want to be with someone like me? 

Whenever I see girls in person they are always with their friends, and it increases my level of anxiety thinking that I would have to perform socially in front of three pretty girls when they probably reject 10 guys like me for breakfast. Or arguably worse when I see a girl with her parents/family. I could just imagine introducing myself only to get my lights punched out by daddy. I hate myself because I always find a reason or found reasons like this in the past.

If I find someone that wants to be with me though would they even be able to like me?

And keep in mind my generation is the tiktok generation.

I am very different and that's not necessarily good. I can imagine that if a girl did find me attractive enough to call me her boyfriend that she'd want to meet my parents (which can never happen), my nonexistent friends, know how perfect my life is...All I bring to the table is my looks, passion, and intellectual mind (aka myself). My ex was super extraverted as well and everyone is more extraverted than me. The more people I'm around, especially new people it's like my stress level just rises exponentially. I start to feel a lack of security and control, and a need to perform. I'm more comfortable with someone once I know they are part of my tribe so to speak but strangers who are not part of my tribe yet are danger to my ape brain.

Pros:

Tall, good face, works out, intellectually smart (maybe not socially), deep voice, dress well, have interests like photography (I'm pretty good with cameras), acting, music, I can cook, unique sense of humor, old soul, deep, open to doing lots of things

Cons:

Not a lot of money, no status, socially inept, you can't meet my family, anxiety, depression, very little to boast about, not a solid rock of masculinity, no friends to introduce you to, no parties to take you to

27,s9fwyp,1642785864,Please help me it’s my first time real dating,"So we were Friends before (since summer last year) and met a few times.
I liked her from the beginning but I thought that she was out of my league / no interest. I moved back to Germany for a while and when I came back we started talking again we did go out like 2 or 3 times and it was great.. as Friends. We did go to watch a sunset at a beach and it was great after that she texted me that she thinks we should go on a date. We did that we went to a restaurant and did. also go to to the beach we did hold hands briefly but then she like stopped 😂 and made it obvious that she didn’t want to anymore when I talked to her if there would be a second date she surprisingly kinda said yes though and we went to study this week together.
I did not text her after the date anymore as I didn’t want to put pressure and if she wanted to break contact she could’ve totally at this point.

But like I said she asked me if we could go study together at Starbucks and so we did I asked her if she wanted to do something this weekend and she said yes

I am confused I don’t know what’s happening she is giving me signs but at the same not. She asked for a date though.

It might be that it’s because we are both teenagers (17ish) and she never had a date before that I don’t understand her.

I had dated before and girlfriends before and it went so much faster but maybe it’s just that it’s her first date and she is kinda shy sometimes .

What do u think should I still pursue something ? I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable or something but I really like her..

And if so what would u recommend as a second kind of date ?

Or should I just wait it out a second time until she asks

*update so I did. ask her and she agreed to go to the movies this weekend although there doesn’t seem to be any good movies she said she will come back to me if she finds something 😂 idk just some helpful advice from outside would be great.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9fwyp/please_help_me_its_my_first_time_real_dating/

(I'm not talking about people who use this excuse as a cowardly, guilt-free way to say ""I don't want anything serious with YOU,"" that's a different breed of annoying.) **My issue with it is that it takes away my agency. You've removed my power to make an informed decision on whether or not to invest time and energy in you.**

I just explained this to a guy who pulled the old ""not looking for anything serious"" after 3 months of dating. We met on Hinge, which, for those not in the gay community, bears a certain implication of being used primarily by people looking for something serious, as opposed to a hookup or FWB situation. (We have Grindr for that.) I had listed in my profile that I was not looking for a casual arrangement. So he was very clear at the outset on what I was looking for. Needless to say, I felt somewhat deceived, and the indignation was eating away at me after we called it quits. I don't like that feeling. So I texted him and said something about it.

He called me back. The confrontation went ... surprisingly well. He apologized, explained he didn't want to disclose his intentions at the beginning because he thought I'd reject him, and admitted it was a selfish, short-sighted move on his part. I thanked him for his honesty, hung up and promptly deleted any and all traces of him from my phone and social media. I got the closure I needed, and I'm reasonably confident he's going to change the way he deals with romantic prospects going forward.

Before I start, keep in mind I’ve already resigned from this company.

To be exact, I'm a bit shy introverted. I want to love someone unconditionally and explore the little time on this earth. Earthly things don't attract me. ( I read Franz Kafka a lot if that helps). I sit on my 6th-floor balcony on cold nights with some cigarettes and hallucinate about life, death, and her.

As much as I know about her, she's beautiful. She's spent most of her time at home. She reads a lot of books. She smiles when she talks, and she doesn't give a fuck about me (what I think).

She's my classmate. I told her that I liked her in my first year and she replied she's not interested in love. Then we had a little message chat, she tried to carry our conversation, but I sucked. Didn't go far. I don't get the point of texting someone. I can be silent for hours and still be with her in real life, but that doesn't happen when texting. Then pandemic happened.

I’ve (24f) been seeing this gentleman (24m) for the past couple months. He’s occasionally in town to visit his mom for the weekends, but whenever he’s here, he ends up spending a lot of time with me. There have been instances where he’d told me that he wouldn’t be available because he’s having dinner with his mom, but then spent that time with me since his mother got mad at him “for some reason”. Also that his mom occasionally snaps at him unprovoked. He’s told me that his dad is abusive and mentally ill, but hasn’t said such thing about his mother. 

He has been nothing but sweet, caring, and considerate with me. But I’ve been in a simile honeymoon/love bombing phase with a narcissist who was showing me a good face, so I know better than to believe him unconditionally when he plays it off like his mother thinks he’s a bad son for no reason.

59,s9k9rp,1642797392,I(M24) am struggling to date again after past experiences,"I wanted to preface by saying that I'm non-religious, and my family raised me with traditional values regarding relationships and marriage. My view on sex has always been that it's something sacred and special, not for any religious or spiritual beliefs, but more of the connection that binds two people together.

I've always been the relationship type, and when I wasn't in one I was focusing on myself. I didn't hookup with random strangers or have meaningless flings. I got into my first relationship at 18, and that lasted 2 years. After that, I decided to try out dating apps since they were very popular. I made the mistake of using tinder the first time. I was well-aware of it being infamously known as a hookup app, but I naively believed that it was just the snobby dudes that were looking for that, whereas the girls were more open to relationships. While I had no trouble getting matches, I was careful to only swipe right on girls who wrote in their bios that they were looking for serious inquiries only.

The first girl I ended up dating after my first relationship was from tinder, we were both around 20-21. We really hit it off, and she kept telling me how she herself was very relationship oriented. She was very kind, was studying to be a nurse, and had an amazing family. She kept telling me that I was so much kinder and more respectful than some of the previous guys she met off the app. Then there came a night a couple months into the relationship where we were having deep conversations. And she trusted me to the point where she revealed that the summer prior to us dating, she had a gone through heartbreak with an ex and decided to seek validation from men on tinder. She admitted that she had slept with 20 guys over that summer, most of whom she described as ""assholes"" and ""fkboys"". I didn't think anything of it until she revealed something else; she didn't use condoms with any of them. I asked her if she was on the pill and she said she wasn't, and she told the guys to pull out; there were 2 instances where she needed to take Plan B. I didn't react at first because I didn't want to upset her, but the next day I felt nauseous and sick. I understand that all these events happened before we even dated, and that she confirmed that she was clean, but I knew that I couldn't pursue a serious relationship with someone that had made reckless decisions like that. I understand many would say ""but the past is in the past"", but I knew that it wasn't something that I was able to overlook. To me, safe sex is a huge deal. I respected the fact that she was honest with me, so I had a conversation to be honest with her the next day, and I broke up with her. I wished her the best because I knew she was a good person, but I knew I had to move on.

I gave up on apps but when the pandemic hit, I was 22-23 and eventually got back, this time on Hinge. I had heard that it was more relationship-oriented, so I was relieved by that. I ended up dating a girl who was very career driven like me, and was doing her Masters. Months later, that conversation came up again and she had a lot to tell me as well. She had been in 2 relationships before, and in between relationships or after them, she had tinder phases. Similar to the last girl, she would sleep with random men and invite them over to her apartment the first time. However, she told me that she had been on the pill since 17, so she would willingly let them go raw and finish inside of her She too said that a lot of those guys were ""fkboys"". The same feelings came around as last time, and I had to make the decision to break up with her. It was a difficult decision to do because she was a great person overall, and I hoped she'd find someone for herself.

Since then, I took a break on dating and started reflecting on myself. I know some might argue that you shouldn't know about your partner's past, bit after disclosing my experiences with my cousin, she told me that it's important to trust your partner. She herself had an experience where she dated a guy who she found out with sleep with multiple women (unprotected) while traveling the country, and she was extremely turned off by that. Even though it was in the past, it made her question his ability to commit to a relationship, and his lack of safe sex practices was a complete turn-off.

I realized that I shared some of those aspects as well. My 2 recent exes had made decisions in the past (before dating me) to have non-safe sex with a bunch of strangers off tinder, and for the most part \*knew\* that most of them were ""fkboys"". Personally, I know there are girls out there that don't sleep around with those ""fkboys"" and certainly don't forget about using condoms when sleeping with random hookups (or letting them finish inside them just because it feels better).

I want to be clear with something: I'm not here saying they should or shouldn't have done what they did. That was their past, they made those decisions before getting involved with me. I respect the choices made by others. But I can also make the choice to not pursue them because of those choices, It doesn't mean I think they're a bad person by any means, but just not the right fit for me. Similar to how I won't tell someone to not smoke because I don't like it, but I can choose not to pursue a relationship with them. I just wanted to address this. I thought they were great girls, which is why it made breaking up with them harder. Am I missing out on something great? Possibly, but I know that there are girls out there that share the same values that I do. And before I get this comment, no I don't want to date a church girl haha (pretty sure as an atheist I would NOT get along with a christian family). I don't care how much sexual history a girl has, I care more about if she made smart decisions AND didn't settle for guys who treated her horribly. I really apologize to those that might be triggered by that, but

Now my struggles lately have been about trying to date again. I've been feeling really uncertain about how I want to put myself out there again. I don't want to go back on the apps, but I'm still a little traumatized by my past 2 relationships and how they ended. I made the same decision as my cousin who stopped dating the guy who slept with multiple women while travelling, but to me it seems that (even with a small sample size) I seem to run into the same kind of girl.

What should I do to reintegrate myself in today's dating world knowing how much the hookup culture and apps have influenced dating and relationships?

He then just says this weekend wont work and asks how I am doing. I try to continue the convo based on something he said during our date but he seemed to not be following and then never responded.

I feel it’s odd since we were having good banter the previous week before the date and during the date and because he followed up with me after the date to re-establish he had a good time but when i ask him out he doesn’t provide another time that will work for him and just falls off texting.

I assume now that the quietness during the first date and not feeling up to going out is because she's the type that stays at home a lot interacting with friends over the internet and playing video games and she probably doesn't feel as comfortable going out to places, especially with someone she hasn't known long, which can already be an anxiety-inducing situation.

79,s9mfno,1642803086,I literally cannot tell the difference between friendship and romantic feelings. Anyone else the same?,"Disclaimer: I’m autistic, and I KNOW this is related to that. But knowing it doesn’t make this easier to deal with.

Essentially I don’t feel any difference when it comes to friendship or romance. I’m not aromantic. I very often form bonds with people that are much closer than ‘traditional’ friendships are meant to be. But for me it’s just a sliding scale of closeness, rather than this big separation between friendship and romance. I don’t have any kind of possessiveness or jealousy, or want a person I’m close to as my own. I don’t care if they’re just as close to another partner/friend.

When it comes to sex, it feels almost entirely unrelated to anything else. Often i’ll enjoy having sex with someone a couple of times, not want to sleep with them anymore, but still feel closer and closer to them and end up having a very close relationship which is neither a friendship nor a traditional romantic relationship.

I’m bisexual so these feelings don’t differ by gender. It makes it very very difficult not to lead people on. And it’s also quite lonely as I ultimately know that no-one will want me as a long term partner.

Does anyone else feel like this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9mfno/i_literally_cannot_tell_the_difference_between/

She told me that she wanted me to be rough with her and I don’t really understand why considering her background. Like she wants me to tie her up, choke her, and spank/hit her hard enough to leave marks on her.

She had a physically abusive father that abused both her and her mom which led to her parents divorcing when she was 9. So I don’t really understand why she would want to do anything even close to resembling what she experienced as a child that she had to have years of therapy for.

So we’ve just been talking about it and I agreed to do it with her tonight. We’ve come up with multiple safe words and everything to help her feel comfortable. 

So just wanted to hear your guys insight on this situation as I’m still honestly confused why she would want this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9mvks/confused_by_my_gf_and_her_sexual_desires/

86,s9mw5b,1642804291,Is having no male friends a red flag? (20F),"Tl;dr
I struggle to make/maintain close platonic relationships with guys and I’m worried my lack of male friends might be considered a red flag


I (20F) have generally tended to make long lasting friendships with other girls throughout my life rather than with boys. I didn’t intentionally do this, it’s just how my friendships have formed over time. Would this be a deterrent for a potential partner?

That’s not to say I don’t get on well with guys. I currently live with 3 other guys (and 3 other girls) in my uni house and get on fine with everyone, but I definitely wouldn’t consider the boys close friends like I do with the girls that I live with.
I think I’m more “in my shell” when I’m around guys and generally just click better with the girls.

But when I’m on a date with a guy, I find that I’m much more confident - maybe because I’m interested in them romantically and there’s more topic for conversation (especially if we had only met). But having platonic conversations (for example with my male housemates) usually feels awkward for me and I just don’t make a connection with them. Like I get on fine with them, we never argue or anything but I wouldn’t say I’m close enough to ask for advice or vent to.

But now I’m worried that my lack of male friends might be considered a red flag if someone wanted to pursue me romantically. I don’t want to give off the wrong impression",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9mw5b/is_having_no_male_friends_a_red_flag_20f/
87,s9n5ez,1642804981,Why does it seem like such a challenge for guys like myself to get a girlfriend but it’s super easy for girls to get a boyfriend??,"Okay so here is my question.

Why does it seem very hard for most guys like myself to get a girlfriend??

I’m 19 years old and is really into things including video games, movies(Action, Super Heroes, Kaijus etc. to be more specific on the genres), and some other things.

My dream job is to be a game maker and game enterpenuer.

Heck I’m even looking for courses at the time being and is also making bios for video game characters who are just figments of my imagination at the time being.

Also I’ve never worked a job but will soon, I’m just going to take drivers Ed first and try to get my license before I start taking interviews.

I also don’t really go to public areas a lot and usually when I do, I go to school, shopping areas, restaurants, movie theaters, and amusement centers.

(Also just a side note about school, I graduated last year but I’m taking a program at a high school that is teaching life skills including cooking, paying bills, budgeting, writing resumes etc. but since it’s ,well, a high school, most of the girls there are minors and I don’t want to end up on the sex offender list over a kiss or something. So yeah I just wanted to state that. Also just keep in mind that just because I’m taking that program, it does not mean that I’m immature. I’m overall just not confident about my financial skills and overall job skills yet and so I’m just trying to learn those things by taking this program. I mean I am on the spectrum just FYI but I have overcame alot of my autism though to the point that people just would not notice)

Anyways, with that out of the way.

I just can’t seem to ever get a girlfriend especially since I don’t really go to areas where I can easily set up a date with someone.

I do often get told to go to areas like comic con and what such since I will be able to find girls who share the same interests that I do but what I tend to ask people on here alot is how exactly do I talk to them and when is the best time for me to approach them without making it seem random or creepy.

I just feel like people never really come up with the answer that I want to hear.

Another thing that I will state is that I’m actually going to the mall tomorrow to get my haircut, and not going to lie, but whenever I go to the mall I see young cute girls all over the place.

And I would really like to walk up to them and have a conversation with them but at the same time I don’t want to creep them out or seem desperate.

But yeah I just wish it was more simple to just “get a girl” but yet it’s not because you have to worry so much about making “a good first impression”.

Anyways can someone please help me out??

Because if I get the right advice, I may even Atleast have a good conversation with someone and get their number tomorrow.

I think as someone who is an introverted gamer who is 19 years old with zero dating experience, I tend to have a painful time giving  a good first impression to a girl that I’m attracted too.

Also how can I find out that a girl doesn’t have a boyfriend without asking her??

Because to be honest, I feel like girls tell guys “that they have a boyfriend” as an excuse to not go out with them which pisses me off.

Like seriously why do girls fear so much about telling a guy the true reason for not going out with them??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9n5ez/why_does_it_seem_like_such_a_challenge_for_guys/
