3,mmd8mk,1617833236,Modern Women don't seem to be self improving the way men are.,"Correct me if i am wrong , but average men have to improve a lot to even enter the dating market and even more to get a good, healthy (mentally/emotionally/physically) partner. But women don't seem to be doing that same work, men are just supposed to accept them the way they are , fat, uncooperative, disagreeable, with a child from wedlock, unresolved traumas and insecurities, unaccounted for past issues and behaviors (promiscuity).

I mean the bank doesn't give you a loan on your word that you have changed ,they give you loan based on your credit score. So if it's bad then either improve or forget.

5,mmdhjh,1617833983,"I’m a 25 year old male virgin who’s never had a girlfriend, and all of these 30-40+ year old virgins just make me feel like they’re confirming my fate.","Why? Because I’ve already went through life being told that I’m ugly by a ton of girls.

Now at 25, I’m not even functional for my age, I’m plagued with mental issues, even some physical issues. 

My experiences throughout life have given me NO REASON to NOT believe, that I won’t turn out like these other late adult virgins. I already have a less than even average record. Why wouldn’t I end up like these other guys? Especially when some of them even claim they’ve done **EVERYTHING** and still nothing worked for them. Even guys who ARE fully financially independent, even guys claiming they’re in great physical shape, great career, blah blah blah.

People being significantly older than me and still never succeeded in something so basic (or even if they HAVE, but not until significantly older than me) don’t make me feel any better, just makes me feel even more hopeless that my fate will be the same, if not worse.

I don’t believe that getting a girlfriend and having sex is the main point of life, I also don’t believe it’d “FIX” me. It’s just one of, if not **THE** most basic parts of life, that for **MOST** people, just happens naturally. I’m not saying that they don’t put in any effort at all, but it’s just like, a natural byproduct of their life? 

Most people don’t have to read a ton of self-help books, or watch a ton of dating advice videos, or pay a dating coach, or just put so much conscious effort into it. It’s just a normal part of life.

It doesn’t take most people until their 30s or 40s to have their first experiences either. For most it happens in their teens. Even for those who didn’t make it in those years, most make it in their lower, definitely not later than mid-20s.

Teens in highschool don’t have to be financially independent to get into relationships and have sex. Young adults? It’s more important, if not necessary. I get that, I understand why it’s more important once you’re an actual adult, I accept that, it’s reasonable.

But I also don’t see how I can establish a real career before 30 either. I have so many hurdles, and contrary to what a lot of people say, time/age DOES MATTER. It really does get harder as you get older, because more is expected of you, so it becomes harder to catch up if you’re still behind. In regards to dating and career, just life in general.

Our bodies age goddammit. I’d give anything to at least stop biologically aging now, so no matter how long it takes to become successful, I’d still be young to enjoy it. But I’m not counting on age reversal/pausing treatment ever being accessible to me.

I wish I could make a living writing articles, I’ve been told I’m good at writing. It can be challenging coming up with creative fictional material, but I wouldn’t mind writing articles about facts/data too.

I have reason to believe I may have yet another disorder, undiagnosed Aspergers/Autism. Even more hopeless. That means being even less able to act how an adult is “supposed” to, both in regards to dating and working, and just life in general.

6,mmdog0,1617834577,"After dozens of girlfriends, I ended up with an obese cranky lady who vapes all day","Two of my girlfriends tried to kill me, both through poisoning. Those two women (most likely sociopaths) were late in my dating life (last seven years). 

Most of my girlfriends were great but had too many flaws to be wives. I've lived a hard life. I'm in my early 50's now. Looking back, I can say that I know what I did wrong. I didn't intelligently look for my women. I just let life deal the cards, big mistake. I also thought too much with my little head and went with women I was attracted to.  

My current gf has huge blue eyes and blonde hair. She is about 5""4 and weighs 206. When I met her in 2017 she was 145 pounds and pretty for her age (early 40's). 

Back in my late 20's and 30's, I dated extremely attractive women by anyone's standards. Two were runway models. One was from China and the other was Jewish with the most exquisitely golden eyes (not brown GOLD). Another of my girlfriends was recruited by Hugo Boss to model as a teen. She turned down the offer. She dated me, wanted me to knock her up, laughed in my face when I suggested we marry if she got pregnant, and then she moved across the nation after a year and a half. Later, flew back to my home town to approach me to be a sperm donor. She even had a long legal contract and everything. I have a genius IQ and I've done some things in my life that are impressive on paper, and so that was probably part of her motivation, aside from the fact that I am fairly good looking and physically very strong.  

So why am I posting this? I'm sad and I feel like I need to hear from people who either have been through the ringer like me, or can offer some kind words. At this point, I'm feeling like I'm at the end of my rope. I have a dead end job and enough savings to last about five years without working. I'm thinking of quitting my job. But I can't travel the world now with Covid. I was going to travel the world and then maybe just you know what. Now, I can't travel without a ton of red tape and the passports are coming out. I can't get the vaccines. I just don't trust them. 

So I'm stuck at home working online with my obese live-in girlfriend who has a rough voice like a belt sander and isn't in the best of health. She has some very nice qualities though or I wouldn't be with her. But she doesn't have much in the way of empathy. She is ""empathy free"" as a person. And she reads new age books when not working or surfs conspiracy theory websites that drive me nuts to hear about. she refuses to exercise and eats mainly carbs, all frozen meals. Her idea of exercise is waddling around the block slowly while pausing frequently to smell the flowers or puff on her vape. I work out every day for about thirty minutes vigorously. I also swim about five days a week for an hour. I'm in fairly good shape still. But I feel just too worn down to date during Covid. It's just too exhausting dating online and it's very hard to meet women in person with Covid. 

One of the reasons that I settled down with my current gf was due to being poisoned twice and almost dying both times. My current lady is definitely not a sociopath and she is ""safe"" (not vindictive or a gold digger at all). 

Being almost killed twice has made me nervous to date. It's hard for me to do now. I met one of those ""deadly"" girlfriends on CL and the other on Match. I just can't computer date any more. It's too traumatic. I don't think I would have met either woman organically in real life.

7,mmdqra,1617834777,Why do guys want to be with women if they don’t want to communicate?,"I’ve heard this a lot from previous friends about how their boyfriends don’t want to have conversations about their problems and feelings. I’ve had similar issues with guys I’ve seen in the past and it confuses me. Guys say they want a relationship but fail to put effort in communicating. And when they do it’s one word responses. 

There have been guys who were good at holding a conversation but of course I manage to choose the ones who speak cave man. I’m not saying that if someone is inherently bad at communicating they shouldn’t reach out and find themselves a partner. I’m just acknowledging the fact the partner will be dissatisfied as time goes on and nothing changes. 

It’s a noticeable distinction between men and women. Women talk more openly about their feelings and men are closed off and unwilling to have a conversation. Or for some reason they can carry on a soliloquy in the group chat on playstation yet barely say two words over the phone. Then they act affronted when someone confronts them about their lack of communication. Like it’s a shock that you expect more than an “ok” in response.

13,mme7kb,1617836263,I want to get back into dating but can't stand the misogyny,"So there's a pattern that I've found with dating men and the main reason I've only ever been in one long-term relationship. 

Let's talk about a few examples.

A few years ago, I got into a relationship after months of dating. It was pretty serious since we were friends for 6 years and we were talking about marriage. At the time, I was starting an art business. I also made it VERY clear that I would only ever live in a city. However, he kept on saying that he ""couldn't afford to buy a house in the city"" like he expected my business to fail and for him to pay for everything. He just wasn't expecting me to make a substantial amount of income from my art. If the gender roles were reversed, I highly doubt he would expect my business to fail. I broke up shortly and I moved countries although he's still trying to get in touch with me. 

I broke up with my last ex because he invited me over to cook dinner at my house. The plan was to cook together. I bought groceries but had some last-minute issues with my roommate so I brought everything over to his place. The minute I started cooking, he went to his bed to watch Youtube videos. I called him out and told him to come to help out. He could barely cut an eggplant so I ended up finishing cutting it while he cut a bell pepper. When we sat down for dinner, he said: ""wow we did such a great job hun.  I responded ""you mean *I* did a great job? You cut up half an eggplant and a bell pepper. You didn't do shit."" Again, I broke up with him shortly after. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've gotten better at weeding out the red flags early on, but this type of behavior always comes up when things get serious. It's a pattern for me to dump guys as soon as the commitment starts due to intolerable behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be single forever, but I can't stand the casual sexism and won't follow along with gender roles. Deep down, ""men"" engage in this behavior because they want to keep their privilege and therefore do not truly respect women on a fundamental level as they want to hold power over us. I can't stand the ""men"" who view themselves as ""providers"" because deep down they feel inadequate and therefore need to have financial control over women. Or the ""nice guys"" who have the bar set so low for them that they know they don't need to bother to be attractive or fun because some woman will settle for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

19,mmfaae,1617839677,Why it's so important to tell the person you're seeing why you want to end a relationship,"I've been seeing this girl for the past 3 months, things were going well, then she started getting very distant, taking forever to respond when it used to be instant, then we stopped having sex, finally, we stopped hanging out completely. I could tell something was wrong. It gave me a lot of anxiety and I felt like it was impossible to talk to her as every time I tried to bring it up, she avoided the question and would talk in circles. 

I knew it over, but I needed closure. I needed her to tell me something and for our relationship to not just fade into oblivion because we stopped talking to each other. Finally, she ended up explaining her behavior more, what's going on in her life and why we can't see each other anymore. While I don't entirely understand what she's going through, it was such a burden off my shoulders to have an answer, even if it was the one I didn't want. 

My last relationship the girl just stopped talking to me less and less until one day she ghosted me completely and I saw on Facebook that she started a relationship with another guy. That crushed me and took so long for me to get over when in all reality, I was done with the relationship too.

37,mmgxy9,1617845294,First date was (surprisingly) amazing,"Met this guy from online dating and same day we decided to be spontaneous and hang out. I recently got out of a relationship so I was planning on waiting a bit but a part of me thought “what am I waiting for? I love meeting new people” so I decided to go for it.

He came to my neighborhood and we had a few drinks. Physical appearance he’s a 9/10. Dark features, on the tall side, athletic, and cutest dimples (I’m a sucker for dimples)

Conversation was 💯 and I felt like he was pretty similar to me in terms of personality (over-communicative and talkative) and coincidentally his family comes from the same village abroad as mine. We were chatting for three hours and it flew by! I think he was into me too because he laughed at all jokes and kept strong eye contact.

It felt so refreshing to meet someone so cool and so soon from a dating platform. Maybe it’s just beginners luck 🍀 definitely going to be taking things slow for now though.

Most days, he’ll spend like 15 minutes with me watching a YouTube video but that’s about it then he gets on his game, or goes to his room to do this own thing. So then I make plans with some friends and then he asks me if I want to do anything with him... is that like a red flag that I’m not seeing? 
Before anyone asks, I’m not trying to shame him or anything but I still send cute paragraphs to him, say good morning/goodnight, ask him about his day, try to plan stuff with him if he likes the idea, listen to him.

40,mmh9p2,1617846426,Should I bring up the exclusivity talk or wait?,"Hi everyone! So I met a guy online in the beginning of the year. We started our “dates” by watching movies through zoom and we made sure we talked every day at least once a day. We were like that all January and we met for the first time in person by the end of February, after I got vaccinated for covid and all. 
March came in and we literally stay doing couple things, we hold hands when we go out, he makes me dinner when I go to his house, rubs my feet when I’m too tired from working doubles. He’s always opening doors for me and we cuddle a lot (and well, have sex). I of course reciprocate with the massages and cooking.

We have plans to take a road trip in the summer but I know we are not in an actual relationship because whenever he’s going though something and I talk to him about it, he tells me he’s happy he met me and that we’re “talking.” 

Last week we had our first fight? Sort of. He basically was on vacation for a week and although we did see each other a lot, whenever we were not together he would take a little bit over 24 hours to reply, even though he knows how important it is for me to talk at least once a day.
He noticed he had been doing this and he himself bought it up and apologized and told me we will make a better effort to be more consistent. He said something (I forgot exactly what) but he said “our relationship” but to me that means nothing since we’ve never had THE TALK. I’m just very confused as to where we stand... maybe to him I’m just a friends with benefits. I don’t even know if he still has his Hinge account or any other accounts, talking to other girls or anything.
I don’t want to bring up the conversation of being exclusive because I’ve done that in the past and it feels as if men just get really awkward after that even after saying yes. To me if feels as if men should be the ones asking to be exclusive to not take away that masculinity from them. I feel like we’ve been in more than enough dates all March to know that I do want something serious with him. Should I wait longer? Maybe two more months of actual “dates” and if he still doesn’t ask then I can just move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmh9p2/should_i_bring_up_the_exclusivity_talk_or_wait/

Anyway, he recently confided in me that he is thinking of joining a "" dating coach"" who advertises themselves as a romance expert who can help mould him into the sort of man women want. Apparently the process involves setting up some dating online profiles and writing amazing intro letters that are apparently guaranteed hits 

He asked me about it and I told him m y honest opinion... they wouldn't tell him anything he didn't already know. I read through their website and it is all just a variation of the ""positive mindset, if you believe it then YOU CAN DO IT"" we have heard a million times before

I read on their site about how they help you wrote great dating site emails to women and it is just a variation of the old ""show them that you read your profile, demonstrate that you are interested in them as a person and not just for sex, show that you have mutual interests, ask questions"" and while none of this is bad advice, he has heard it all before and I told him that, but he seems to think they have some magic key and by joining them they will help him become a dating guru. 

The program costs 2 grand so it ain't cheap and I told him i didn't think it was worth it but he still wants to do it.

54,mmiqhk,1617851490,Dealbreakers.,"Hi! so having returned to the US from different parts Asia and trying to navigate the dating market, I want to see if my dealbreakers are too harsh. 

\#1. religion. I will absolutely not date anyone with a strong connection to their religious  beliefs. Being a dude who think all gods are fake, I don't see a LTR working out because from experience they never stop trying to turn me over.

\#2. Obese. I will not date anyone over 250lbs before having children. After you deliver  two or three beautiful kids into my life, your personal weight becomes completely irrelevant to me. I'm very fit and active and the things I like to do and would include you in may need to you have a good amount of stamina. Once becoming a dad, the kids take priority over my personal hobbies. I might get fat myself lol

\#3. Value Individualism over Collectivism. Living in China and Japan, I learned the value of putting the needs of the group over myself and became willing to make the sacrifices necessary to uplift the family as a whole and this leave little to no room for selfishness. If I'm prioritizing WE and you prioritizing YOU too much, don't see any protentional in the relationship long term.

55,mmiqih,1617851492,"Returning to dating, and I'm a bit worried","Hi, everyone. I've (31M) been single for a bit over six months and as I've started to warm back up to the idea of dating again I admit that a lot of longtime anxieties have come rushing back to me. Some of them are typical online dating headaches like not getting many matches and dry conversations, but some of it is about whether or not I'm dateable.

I've had some insecurity due to the fact that I'm neurodivergent. That insecurity used to be a lot worse than it is now. Normally, it's not that noticeable, but when it comes to dating that's when wires get crossed.

I admit that having lurked a bit, I feel like my situation puts me ahead of the curve. I've had several partners and my last relationship lasted for several years. I don't intend this as a brag, as I still have doubts about my situation all the same.

I spent the last six months working towards a massive creative project that will hopefully open doors for me down the line, I've moved out completely on my own, and I'm trying to do constructive things like improving my self-care routine, work on weight loss, etc. It's slow, but things are at least in motion. I'm not sure how long it's going to take to pay off, but I'm trying.

I feel like most of the time I'm fine, but there are days when I get hit with a depression spike and feel like I'm not going to get anywhere dating-wise. My female friends have assured me that I've got plenty of positive qualities and it's not like I don't believe them. In fact one is pretty adamant that I'll find a partner soon. I guess my point is that even though I think I've come a pretty long way in a short period of time, I still have some lingering doubts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmiqih/returning_to_dating_and_im_a_bit_worried/

I’m 28M and my friend’s gf is trying to wingwoman me and set me up with her friend. Besides her name and number I don’t know anything about her but according to my friend and his GF we would be a good match. I feel like that last statement when my friends said it added more pressure than it should have. I was in a relationship 2 years ago which incidentally was also 2 years long. 

With the pandemic ongoing and another lockdown for us, I’m more nervous than I have been in the past. I feel like my time single coupled with the lock down has made my mind mush, in the sense I don’t even know what to say or how to start. I’ve never had issues talking to women and when I last used dating apps I had no trouble but for some reason this time and this set up is making me nervous. Is this normal? Has anyone else felt this way? 

Any advice on how to msg or keep the conversation going with the person? I’ve always done better in person and even when I used dating apps before I would basically shoot from the hip and say let’s just meet it would be faster to get to know each other.

59,mmjfct,1617853980,1st date post divorce.. I am so confused,Ok so I am recently divorced and a coworker and I have been casually texting on Facebook very infrequently. It has been obvious I’ve had the hots for her but nothing serious has ever happened. I recently transferred to a different location for work and for the past month haven’t seen her and out of the blue I sent her a funny picture and that spiraled into us hanging out with our kids this last weekend and I almost declined because I am super protective of my kids and I know the divorce has been hell for them. So in the course of the weekend she met my kids and I met her son and for Easter I went over and met her family with my kids obviously this was odd for me but it was a blast for the kids and she literally melted my heart playing with my daughter. But we don’t flirt or even talk all that much so I decided to ask her out and she said yes and we went out that night and it was fun nothing too serious just me talking way too much being nervous. So during our date she kept saying things like the next time I go to her parents or hinting at other ideas for things we can do and I want to emphasize I am dense I don’t pick up on things especially signals from women. After dinner we talked for about an hour and she said something along the lines that she would text me more and I should text her more and I made a joke “so I passed the first date” and she said it wasn’t a date so automatically I was confused. We ended the date with 2 long hugs and some eye contact but I didn’t want to kiss or make her feel uncomfortable especially after what she said. So it’s been a couple days and I text and she text back but just very short and matter of fact. I haven’t said anything about seeing her again just the normal good morning or how’s your day text with some varying topics but like nothing regular. So of course I’m asking all my friends like why did she ask me to hang out and meet her parents and all and go to dinner the day I asked her? I have been out of the dating game too long and I definitely don’t understand women but I have had the biggest crush on this woman for so long and I don’t want to fuck this up.

I like her, but her lifestyle is very different from mine in a very negative way. She doesn't work and has no intention of working (she has a disability--mental health problems--which I also suffer from). 

I'm trying to find a job currently and I find her mindset of ""I'm disabled and there's nothing I can do about it"" really depressing and demotivating for my own goals. I'm kind of in a bad place myself right now too so I understand how hard it is but I really don't want to get stuck where I am and I feel like she doesn't have any plans or desire to change her situation. 

I've really enjoyed her company but I just know that if I date her things won't go well. She also has drug problems and I'm trying to be supportive but I also have to think about myself and what I want my future to be like.

I want to do the right thing but I'm honestly not sure what that is at this point. Ideally, I would want to remain friends with her but not date but she says that dating me is the only thing that is motivating her to change her situation. I'm not sure I believe she actually will though.

I’ve know my crush for a little while now, and I recently (a couple months ago) hinted that I liked her, and I think she got it. She has never really “flirted” with me or gave me any hints. What I am really asking is if this is a hint to start really flirting with her, or is if this is just some random thing that she might think is funny or unique.

I want to ask her out, but i got bad relationship anxiety. like super bad relationship anxiety, i get really stressed when im hanging out with someone im dating and usually break up with them because of how much anxiety i get, but then immediately regret it because i genuinely did like them. I think its just the commitment that im scared of, as im only 16 and i havent had a serious relationship.   


Anyways, what im saying is that im really scared to take the first step and ask her out, because my relationship anxiety is through the roof whenever im dating someone, its just so much pressure. how can i overcome relationship anxiety and ask her out? i really like her but im just really scared. sorry that this is unprofessional, i just have a huge crush on her but dont have the guts to ask her out, even though im very much sure she likes me.

75,mmkr0j,1617859225,Right Person Wrong Time is Probably Wrong Person Right Time?,"I (26F) matched with a man (29M) back in March 2020 on a dating app. We talked every single day until February of 2021, and I genuinely fell in love with him. He was nothing like any of the other guys I had ever dated before. We have similar interests, similar family structures and values, similar sense of humors, similar communication styles, and worked in similar industries. I could talk to him about genuinely anything and everything, and he was able to make me laugh like literally nobody else could. I felt like he was the guy version of me, except my weaknesses as a person were his strengths and his weaknesses were my strengths.

When we were together, I felt loved and cared for. It felt natural. I could genuinely picture a future with him. 

Except he only hung out with me twice in that almost year-long period. It wasn’t long distance because he lived about an hour and fifteen minutes away. It wasn’t the pandemic’s fault, because he was going to see his friends, and went to weddings, etc. When I told him I wanted to see him more, he pulled away. When I pulled away, he got mad that I was either not communicating or frustrated that I was calling him out on the fact that I felt like he wasn’t into me, and blamed it on the fact that work wasn’t busy when he did show a lot of effort.

The first time we hung out we went out downtown with his best friend from college, and I ended up staying with him at a hotel. I remember sending him a Snapchat of myself smiling and saying how happy I was and he sent one back with a giant smile saying that he was really happy, too. I remember him saying a comment about how we would absolutely dominate a couples golf league and I was thinking, ”this is the first relationship that I've had that I can actually see a future where he’d fit in with my family and friends”...

Until my best friend sent me a screenshot of his Tinder profile the morning that I left, and I FREAKED out. I mean, my Bumble profile was still active, but I wasn’t using it and the app hadn’t been on my phone since about two months in to talking to him. So I downplayed it originally. But it kept eating at me over the next two week period because he didn't want to talk about it, and he definitely didn't apologize or explain himself, other than the fact that he was blackout drunk and on Tinder the night before we met up, BUT, he didn't text me at all that night and I genuinely thought that he was going to blow me off for our plans the next day.

He got really mad that I was even mad at the fact that he was on Tinder, but by that point we had been communicating *everyday* for five and a half months and had made tentative plans to go on a golf trip!!!!! The next couple months were pretty toxic and included lots of frustrated conversations on my end where I was just trying to get an answer as to what his intentions were. It just got to the point where I stopped putting myself in situations where I knew he was going to tell me “no” because it genuinely hurt and was confusing to have someone say something completely different than what their actions showed. I cut him off during the Super Bowl and was honestly really blunt and harsh about it, and told him that I deserved someone that actually wanted to spend time with him. I removed him from all the apps and deleted his number. And I haven’t talked to him until last week...

My friends all hated him. I realize that I was probably a side chick. Or something to keep him entertained throughout the day. Or a way to feel important. And that he probably didn’t love me. Because when someone loves you they let you know. They show up for you. They make an effort. And he never did. My friends all still hate him. 

But I can’t let it go. I don’t find men that I can communicate with like that very often. I was sexually assaulted when I was 19 and trust issues have very much been a thing. It’s not that I fell in love with the potential of him either. He had issues, we all do. But I told him if this was going to be a real thing then we figure it out together, because that’s life.

Our first conversation since I cut off communication just felt...normal. It was honestly really, really nice, but at the same time I’m feeling pretty hurt. I REALLY miss talking to him. But like I still don’t wanna talk. I want him here. So I’ve been pretty guarded and short with him when we have communicated, although I’ve been honest with how I’m doing instead of putting on the “I AM SO GOOD SINCE WE STOPPED TALKING BLAH BLAH BLAH” schtick. I’ve been working a lot and my life has been kind of a dumpster fire since January. 

I haven’t told my friends that we’re communicating again, honestly because it’s just Snapchat. And mostly because I’ve realized that the right person, wrong time theme that we see in movies is complete fiction. If he loved me, I would know.

TLDR; I fell in love with a man who confused me for almost a year, but I can't hate him even though I'm hurt. I can't decide whether I should just move on completely or leave the communication lines open going forward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmkr0j/right_person_wrong_time_is_probably_wrong_person/
76,mmkssy,1617859435,He flaked. Is he even interested? (LGBT),"I (25M) matched with a guy on Hinge (23M) and he was the first to initiate the conversation. Normally when the conversation dies down, I'd let it go and seek someone else, but this dude is next level handsome which is why I can't seem to just move on (lol).

Anyway we've been talking for about two days about different topics and he was quick to reply to my messages. I complimented him saying he was handsome, and he replied saying I was also handsome. I thought things were going well so I asked him if he wanted to meet up for dessert and gave a time and location (Wednesday). He actually asked if we could meet a day earlier because he had work on that day. I agreed and at that point I thought he was interested. He also asked ""what are you looking for?"" and I stated I'm open to everything, but if I liked the person in real life I would be open to an LTR. He stated he was not looking for a LTR at the moment, but I was still down to meet and get to know him as a person. He still seemed interested to meet at this point and I kept the conversation minimal leading up to the date.

Well on the day of, he messages me early in the morning letting me know that he has an emergency meeting at work. His reply was along the lines of, ""I am sorry I have an emergency meeting today, can we reschedule to another day?"" I didn't want to come off across needy, so replied saying ""no worries, just let me know"" and he replied ""np, sorry about that."" I was the last one to send a message saying ""no problem lol"" which was two days ago. He hasn't replied since. Is he not interested since he did not reschedule, although he hinted so?

79,mml9gj,1617861475,How do y'all date when you're not happy with yourself?,"I'm only in my early 20s, and so that's young in the grand scheme of things, but at the rate I'm going, I feel like I'll only start dating another decade from now lol

I feel like most of the people I've grown up with seemed to always be self-conscious about whether they've dated/kissed/fucked/etc., but I've never related to desiring those things for myself because my self-esteem is tied to what I achieve, mainly career-wise. But the fact of the matter is that achieving things no longer makes me as happy either. I want to explore the happiness that comes with being in a relationship, *however*, because I don't feel like I've achieved much and since my self-esteem is tied to that, I feel like my insecurities would just drag me down even if I was in a relationship.

It just feels strange for me because I feel like this, I guess, inferiority complex of mine is in some whole other dimension that I have yet to understand.

Paused in venting for a moment, but I just remembered that how I've phrased it to myself before is that I don't feel worthy of someone else's love until I'm happy with myself. But the thing is that it may be a long ass time until I'll be happy with myself?

I guess I'm actually just confused about what I want since I hold myself to higher standards than what I already would seek in a partner?

Sort of related, but I want to vent about how I feel when lonely people I've met use me to fill some void. Since my self-esteem is in the ground, it just frustrates me when people appear to like me in spite of my shortcomings? I guess I'm just angry if others have such low self-esteem that they don't have standards which makes me feel worthless, or mad at myself because maybe they do objectively see something I don't, but I can't just flip some switch in my head to change my worldview.

80,mmla44,1617861560,My ex told me that she still likes me after 4 years. What do I do?,"I'll (m 23) start by saying that I love my ex (f 21) to this day. We experienced our teenaged years together in the same neighborhood, and we were really good friends before we started dating. We dated for almost 2.5 years from high school into my first semester of college. I wanted to marry her, got her a ring and everything, but she ended up breaking things off when she started college. She wanted to experience college life on her own. She wanted to have a little more control over her life as she was just out of high school and felt like she wasn't ready to get married. I was clingy and didn't want the breakup to happen, so I made the breakup a lot worse. Anyways, it happened and I got over it after a few months. 

She met me a year or so later to give me back the ring which was honestly really nice, and we left off on good terms. She ended up marrying a guy pretty soon after that, and I just never thought about her too much aside from the rare nostalgic memories that would pop into my head every once in a while. I've stayed single for the most part since then, and it has suited me just fine. I have actually had so much fun just doing my own thing. 

Well.

My ex was good friends with my brother before we started dating. She was really good friends with my whole family actually. After the breakup, she kept in touch with my brother and his wife. They went to her wedding, and they all hung out occasionally. I don't mind either. I'm honestly a very easy going guy, so I could care less that they were hanging out. I mean of course I wish I had someone and we were all hanging out together, but it's fine. Well, I get a text from my brother last Friday: ""she wants to talk to you."" I agreed.

So we met that night. I wasn't expecting anything from her honestly. I was just happy to be talking to her again. It's like nothing changed between us in 4 years. We talked about everything and anything, and it was so nice. I'm super shy and not really great at communicating, but talking with her was as smooth as butter. She ended up apologizing for the way that she treated me over the breakup, and this is when I learned why she broke up with me because I was too hurt to understand back then. I was able to apologize for things that I've always felt bad about and get a lot of things off of my chest. 

I loved being around her again and just shooting the shit and learning about what has been going on in her life. She had separated from her husband about a year and a half ago, and finalized her divorce in June 2020. She's doing pretty well on her own again now, going to therapy and just doing her own thing. She told me that she rebounded a couple times just to get over the whole situation and start living again. Well at the end of the night she ends up telling me that after talking to me and hanging out for a few hours that she thinks she might still like me. She knew that would get to my head, and I got pretty cocky haha. She assured me that it was just a harmless crush because we don't know each other anymore, but the damage was already done.

We continued talking throughout the weekend and hung out once more before she went back home. I am totally down to be her friend. Before I even knew that she liked me I still would've been as forgiving as I have been and wanted to be friends with her. But I can't get her off of my mind now that I know I could have an opportunity with her again.

She was being kinda flirty and told me that she ""wasn't gonna make this easy for me."" I asked my brother and his wife for advice, and they told me to dial back the flirtiness just a little. I told her that, and she told me not to take their advice sooooo. She also told me that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with anyone until this june (a year after finalization) which is fine. It gives me an opportunity to get to know her and see if that's something that I even want. But I feel like because she brought that up, it might mean that she is interested in a relationship?? When she said this, I let her know that she didn't have to explain herself, and that I was totally fine just being friends and she said: ""I can't believe you just friend-zoned yourself."" She keeps saying little things like this that make me question wtf is happening.

We actually have plans to see each other again this weekend, but I just don't really know what to think or what I should do. I know that I am in that excited phase of something new happening, but I don't want to get hurt when I come down from that. I would get back with her at the drop of a hat if I knew her more. There's definitely still something there, but I don't know if I should pursue it. A lot of my friends have given me differing opinions and I guess I just need some more advice. We have calmed down a little bit and right now, I'm not trying to smother her or anything. I guess I just don't want to miss this opportunity that's been handed to me on a golden platter directly from my ex that I still love.

I want to be respectful of the june thing because it's not that far away, but I don't want to get my hopes up, but also she keeps saying little things that kind of egg me on...

81,mmli8j,1617862530,Old fling i have strong feelings for messaged me and said he would love to see me again. (20s F and M),"So we met 2 1/2 years ago when he was in USA, hes from europe. He was just here for summer. After he left i blocked him because i needed to move on and knew i wouldnt see him again. I moved on but the feelings never really went away and i never forgot him. But then i added him again a few months ago on facebook. Then a few days ago, i added him on instagram again because he had asked me about it and i had it deactivated, but i started using it again so i started following him.

After i followed him he liked some of my pics so i returned the favor. Then he messaged me, drunk, saying that he missed me, that he would love to see me again, he really liked me and spending time with me when he was here, stuff like that. I had told him i was moving to europe (spain) and he said ""man i wish im gonna visit spain soon then."" The next morning when he was sober he insisted that he meant everything he said. This basically brought back all those strong feelings i had.

So the next night when i was trying to sleep i was really thinking about it and decided that the best thing i should do is talk to him about how im feeling. So i text him and tell him whenever hes free the next day we should talk, he says ""sure you can talk to me about anything.""

So the next day i just say ""so what was the point in saying that stuff you said, about you liking me and missing me, what did you want from that?"" and he said ""what do u mean? i said it after all this time because i felt like missing you"" and i said "" i wish that you didnt, because now i like you again, and you saying that gives me false hope that we're gonna be together and i know that we cant.""

Then he says ""i still like you, but im aware of the context and know that we're so far away and it would be hard to meet. i didnt mean to make you feel that way. we can stop talking if you feel its bad for you. but i didnt say that we will, i just said that i would love to and i hope it happens""

So then i just tell him that i just had a moment of confusion and don't want to cut him off. and apologized for putting that on him and he says "" you didnt put anything on me dont worry, its ok to speak your mind and clear things out"" So after that i just thank him for being understanding and listening and do a convo closer. But it seemed that he wanted to talk more, so i complimented him on a story he had just posted and we started having a conversation about the most random stuff for a couple hours. The only convos we had had were just 2-3 text exchanges. We havent had convos like that since we were 'together' 3 years ago. It gets late where he lives and he says hes gonna go to bed. I said ""goodnight, good talk"" and he says ""haha yeah i agree, have a nice day, \*kiss emoji\*""

So im kind of confused on how to move forward from here. I'm confused on where we stand, this convo was 2 days ago so we havent talked since. I still have feelings for this dude, should i just keep talking to him as a friend until i move to spain and see if he would be interested in meeting up sometime? He lives a 2 hour plane ride from spain (romania).

83,mmljzo,1617862748,"I had a great connection with somebody, and lost it. I’m very sad.","Please no hurtful comments. I’ve been dating this guy for the past month and I slept with him the second week. I don’t regret it. I felt great chemistry, like I’ve never felt. I felt entirely comfortable with him. It was a decision I made out of pure passion. However, I felt hesitant continuing to sleep with him after this if we weren’t going to be exclusive, at least sexually. I communicated this to him on our following date the next week. He told me he wasn’t ready for exclusivity, even just sexual, and that he had been on dates with others recently. But, he said that he saw this going somewhere and would like to continue to get to know me better as well and we could talk about this again as things progressed. He asked me what other things I would be willing to do sexually because he thinks sex is an important part of the relationship. However, knowing that he had multiple sexual partners at this time, I no longer felt comfortable engaging in that with him. We continued to see each other after this, but I felt his interest decline. I wanted to explain myself to him but I never did, because he texted me immediately the next day asking me out again even after we had had this conversation. So I thought everything was fine.. And last night, we had another date. But it was so different. For starters, it had been a week since I had seen him. He barely texted me at all the entire time we were apart. We went to dinner, and the chemistry was just completely gone. There was just a disconnect. I don’t know what happened, but he was certainly getting me mixed up with other girls he’s been talking to. He kept asking “Wait- did I already tell you that.?” Like he can’t even keep up with the girls he’s dating. I was disappointed but I thought maybe today I would text him and ask him where this was going and try to further explain my reasoning for wanting exclusivity, even though at this point, I was so put off from our date that I wasn’t even sure that was what I wanted anymore. However, he saved me the effort because he texted me first this evening that he likes, me but doesn’t feel like continuing this any further. I guess I’m just kind of contemplating what I did wrong. It makes me feel like sex might’ve been what is he was after in the first place. Which in that case I’m glad I held my ground. I’m just mad at myself. I feel like I screwed it up. We had such a great connection in the beginning. And I would’ve continued sleeping with him if I could’ve guarantee that he wasn’t going to be sleeping with all these other people. So don’t say I should’ve put out because I’m not a prude, I just value my health and well-being. I’m just really disappointed because I saw this going somewhere. Literally the first two weeks were perfect. Like a dream. Like I really thought, wow this could be the one. I guess I’m just disappointed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmljzo/i_had_a_great_connection_with_somebody_and_lost/
84,mmlrm5,1617863668,I’m a firm believer that personality doesn’t get you far,At 31 years old I believe it more than ever. When I’m around friends or family I have an outgoing personality because I know they will appreciate it. When I’m around women I’m not outgoing and I don’t attempt to be funny or charming. I bought into the whole all you need is confidence BS when I was in my 20’s and I set myself up for disappointment. It lasts for a little while but the novelty of it wears off quickly when the woman doesn’t find you physically attractive. Physical attraction is key.

85,mmluf5,1617864014,My clinginess and codependency are severely affecting my mental health to the point of suicide.,"I've been longing for affection so much that I've been thinking constantly about suicide or something, anything really to stop the pain.

But before you read the rest of this post, I want you to go and look at my post history. Ignore the random stuff from subreddits, what I want you to read is the posts I made on relationshipadvice.

Go on. Have a laugh. Really, it's good for the soul.

Now, from those absurd posts, one would immediately assume that I'm trolling, or bored, or something along those lines. That would be true 99% of the time in this situation. Really, it's ridiculous. To have romantic relationships that weird, to find and be absolutely dedicated to another person within 5 days of breaking up with the last one, to do any of the things outlined within the post, would be insane to say the least. But I assure you, it gets worse. 

The root of this problem is that I fall in love with people instantly, the second I see them, hear from them, I don't care. I feel the need to please them, to satisfy them, all these things. I just want to hold someone, or be held, or do anything with another person in order to make them happy. I've been listening to plenty of ASMR but it hasn't been the same. I've been in 3 relationships in my life.

The first one was my most happiest. She was a very troubled person and confessed her love to me until one day she ghosted me because I would tell her every hour I loved her. She was terribly, terribly troubled in the head and she would cut herself in ""tribute"" for me, but I loved her so so much. The days I spent with her were the happiest that I had ever spent in my life. She ended it with me by ghosting me, and every other night I read through our text conversations wondering where I had gone wrong. My heart aches always with her loss.

My second relationship was my most long lasting. She was lesbian, which meant she would never engage with me sexually, the most we really did was kissing and we hardly ever did that, but it was good because I was able to satisfy someone and make them happy. She broke it off with me saying that it could never last. The nights after that were the closest to ending my life then I have ever been.

My third relationship was with this very abusive person who I didn't like much but wanted to see them happy. I broke up with them myself, and now I'm in the situation I'm in right now.

Now I live in a closet sized apartment eating frozen meals (still cold) every day wishing I could just have the satisfaction of holding someone, but I always mess it up because whenever I'm talking to a girl I just want to tell them I love them. So I spend my days wishing I could die, or not fuck up whenever I'm talking to people on dating sites, or something.

86,mmlw51,1617864222,This guy I'm seeing has an ex that still has photos of them on social media.. WHY?,"Okay, so I've recently started seeing this guy, who is an incredible man and I really look forward to hopefully having a relationship with him in the near future. I recently discovered who his ex is from my friends pointing that this girl still has photos of them on social media. These two broke up half a year ago and he has not been with anyone since, and I assume neither has she, there are no photos of his ex on any of his socials. But for her I see that she still has photos of them being somewhat intimate: kissing his cheek, spending time together alone and photos with the caption of ""love you"" and such. I'm currently not comfortable enough to ask him about it because I would like him to be the one to freely open up to me about it. All I know about this girl so far is that she's very shy, introverted and has major attachment issues which caused their past relationship to be a co-dependant based relationship, he was the one to break it off because he became aware of how it was unhealthy. He mentioned that they ""broke up mutually"" because it seems they're all a part of the same friend group, but it really makes me question otherwise but again I don't want to jump into false conclusions until he approaches to me about the situation. I just wanted insight on anyones opinion on why his ex still has SEVERAL photos of them together still on her social media? I mean for me personally I would feel really weirded out if my ex still had photos of me on his socials.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmlw51/this_guy_im_seeing_has_an_ex_that_still_has/
87,mmlwhx,1617864271,"My dad has literally spent $100,000 on international dating and sees nothing wrong with it...","My dad has always been there for me and I will always look out for him. I've noticed over the years that he has been addicted to online dating, specifically international dating. I'm not going to name the website but here's how it works. There are all of these women from different countries (mainly Ukraine, Russia, China, and Mexico) that send him letters in his inbox. If he likes what he sees on their profile, he writes them a letter back. This has been going on for five years now and he hasn't gone on a tour or seen them in person. Meanwhile, he's been racking up a lot of money(we run a business and this is where his paychecks go to). Reading and writing a letter is $7.50. Viewing a picture is another $1.50. You can see how fast it adds up. About a year and a half ago, I totaled up how much money he spent at the time on this website and it was around $80,000. Now, it's even worse. I had him tell one of the women he was talking to that he's been talking to her for four years, so surely it should be time to see her in real life. She responded by saying she wants to keep talking on the website. Sending more letters and wasting more money. The craziest thing is that this doesn't even phase my dad and I'm terribly worried about him. I deleted his account today and he was extremely mad at me, but he was warned that it was coming. I'm just to the point where I really don't know what to suggest for him. He's 63 years old, but he doesn't take good care of his health and rarely cleans. I'd much rather have him dating women that he can see, but he thinks American are only out for your money and aren't as beautiful as foreign women.

90,mmmj1n,1617867077,Online dating for lesbians and bisexuals,"I’m a femme bisexual and I downloaded some dating apps a couple months ago to try to meet women but it seems really hard. I get a lot of matches but Most of those matches don’t message 1st and when they actually do it’s a girl looking for a 3rd for her and her bf. So because women hardly message 1st I message every girl 1st I could see my self meeting up with but half the time they don’t respond and the other half of the time they might send me a message or 2 but then they just stop. Even if it seems like they are actually into me they just stop after a couple messages. 
I have a feeling a lot of these women are either not gay or maybe have some gay feelings but not enough to actually meet up with women but still want to be on apps with their preferences set to women as well.

91,mmmk99,1617867240,Online Dating PSA,"Ever since being acquainted with dating apps I have came to the conclusion that these are worst to best ways to strike up a conversation:
1. Saying something sexual/ complimenting physical appearance 
- can come off as creepy, may be hard for the convo to organically progress from there on 
2. Asking how the other person is/ where they are from/ something about them
- gives interviewer vibes, kind of boring
3. Asking about their music/film/tv show taste
- if there’s no common ground found through these questions it can be hard for the convo to progress, like “I like X” “oh I don’t know them” “oh you should listen to them” 
4. (Could be a hit or miss, but if it hits it HITS) Opening the convo up with something comedic, a comedic remark, or a random funny question. If the comedic tone is interweaved with flirtation even better 
- Finding someone funny makes you more inclined to liking them and wanting to learn more about them
- also if you know that you’re humor is not compatible then there probably won’t be chemistry and that can save you time on not talking to the people you won’t be attracted to

99,mmn9ct,1617870435,"Why might someone (over text) seem very interested in sex, and then suddenly lose interest?","This has happened to me (29M) a few times, with people I've matched with on dating sites. I've come across the odd woman who definitely seems ""up for it"" via flirty texts, sexually explicit messages (or even willingly exchanging nudes) - however, it seems that once I send them pictures of what I look like (by direct messaging or Instagram) they go cold and lose interest, leading to them stopping communicating or using a cover excuse as a reason to stop communicating. This is making me wonder whether I am not seen as traditionally ""good-looking"" (which I am well aware of and trying to lose weight, making excellent progress) or whether places like Tinder are just generally trivial in terms of appearance so that the bar is quite high.

The explanation I can think of for this is that when somebody matches with you on a dating site, perhaps they build up an idealised version of you in their head before they meet you. That idea them might be appealing (sexually or otherwise), and then they find that upon seeing more of you that this idea dissolves. This actually happened to me the other way when I was definitely ""up for it"" with a girl I was messaging from OKCupid, and although we got on well, the pictures she provided did not completely reflect what she looked like in person (i.e. she was a bit larger than I was expecting - not necessarily a deal-breaker for me but just ""different"").
