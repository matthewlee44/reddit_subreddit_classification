0,ounp84,1627661737,Can I live at home and have any success with women?,"So I‚Äôm gonna be brutally honest and real in this post cuz I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any point if I‚Äôm not. 

I live at home and I‚Äôm 27m. Im technically a virgin since I‚Äôve never had piv sex. Strangely enough I‚Äôve had multiple relationships but I‚Äôve struggled massively with my mental and social health for pretty much my whole life. 

In spite of all the issues that I‚Äôve had, you would probably never know something was wrong if you met me. When my mental illness gets bad it causes me to isolate but I can also put on a complete fake persona. Basically just acting like everything‚Äôs ok when it‚Äôs not in my head. Also, in the past few years I was able to work on my physical appearance and I gained attractiveness. I‚Äôm short but I‚Äôm pretty strong and fit and I think I have a good face. I get a lot of matches online since I made that lifestyle change. Yet I‚Äôve never had one date from it and I‚Äôm still a virgin. Haven‚Äôt touched a woman in like 7 years.

I‚Äôm just so insecure about living at home and my lack of real life experience due to struggling with mental illness. I‚Äôm slowly making steps forward. I recently got a small job, something thats huge for me even though it‚Äôs nothing super crazy. Literally just helping out a family member with some stuff they really needed help with. I‚Äôve also resolved to finally see a therapist and give it one hundred percent. It‚Äôs just gonna be a long road ahead. I mean I might not have a place of my own until my parents die, or years down the line. I‚Äôm just being real. This is how my life has gone and it‚Äôll be a while before I ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù. I can‚Äôt begin to explain how much I‚Äôve lost cuz of my mental problems... 

Idk how to go about dating in my present situation, or if I should at all. Cuz honestly I want to. I mean I definitely want sex and intimacy idk about some serious relationship rn. But being alone this long... it gets to you! And idk how the fuck I would explain all this to a potential girl, even if they were attracted to me physically and everything. Even if they wanted to jump my bones right then and there...That I live at home, have problems cuz of my mental health etc. And I feel like if I withheld all this personal info that I‚Äôm a fraud and a terrible person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ounp84/can_i_live_at_home_and_have_any_success_with_women/
1,ounqrc,1627661871,I [f20] don't know how to say that he is not manly enough,"I got introduced to him by a friend of mine, she would always tell me how much of a nice guy he is and how she really wants him to find someone, I jokingly said ""What about me?"" and we then set-up a meet.

He had one of these middle parted hair styles, inspired by korean idols(he told me this). These were the first red flags for me, he likes kpop and that hairstyle is just so unmanly. My friend convinced me to give him a chance and stupidly enough I did.

His personality appeared rather soft and caring, he was overly respectful and never initiated anything. As an example, on our 3rd time seeing each other we just walked around the park where he asked if he could hold my hand, instead of just taking it. I really wasn't into him but did it for my friends sake.

The absolute dealbreaker was when I asked my friend if he ever appeared soft or emotional to her and she admitted to one time seeing him get teary eyes while listening to a song. And she also told me he wears make-up(concealer and foundation). That was it for me.

Since then I stopped replying and now my friend asked me why I suddenly ignore him.

2,ouny5e,1627662509,Advice Needed! Is He Really Over His Ex?,"A bit of a continuation of a previous post I made. I (27F) have been dating a 28M for the past month and a half. He's wonderful, thoughtful,  funny and has the best heart! I've never been happier except with our sex life...every date we've had (8 total so far) has been a sleepover but we've only had sex once.

The night we met we hooked up and would've had sex except he couldn't get  hard - we were quite drunk so I chalked it up to whiskey disk. But it  kept happening! We were finally able to have sex on like Date 5 and I thought we'd pushed past the mental block but it's happening again and  since then we haven't been able to be intimate. He opened up on our last date that previous to me he'd been in a 4 year long relationship and  wasn't super experienced having sex with new people but that he didn't  have anything physically wrong. I thanked him for being vulnerable and  owning up to the issue but I was left with questions that I was nervous  to push to ask and cause the problem to get worse - I'm not sure how long ago this breakup was, he seems so into me but his body seems to not  be able to open up, how can I help so this cycle will stop.

I like him so much that this issue is heartbreaking because I don't see an end point in sight. I'd never had this issue with a guy before. Sex in a relationship isn't everything but it is a human need and I leave emotionally overjoyed every time I'm with him but sexually frustrated. Should I stick it out with him?

The issue is that he began talking to me only a week after he got out of a long-term relationship. He was cheated on, and he told me that originally he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious, but that he never ever expected to come across someone from the same culture. 

I know that he has a lot to heal from. So we‚Äôve been taking things slowly. Texting regularly, some phone calls, a couple of FaceTime sessions over the course of two months. Never saw each other in person because I was living away temporarily (probably a good thing given the situation). I‚Äôm now back in town, however, and we‚Äôre meeting for the first time tomorrow night. 

I know I need to be cautious. I want someone who is 100% ready to be with me and that doesn‚Äôt have any potential lingering feelings or baggage. Some fears are him constantly thinking about his ex while he‚Äôs with me, comparing me to her, or even just using me to mask the pain in the meantime (while actually wanting her). 

If it was any other situation, I wouldn‚Äôt be sticking around. But the fact that we both come from the same culture and have the same values is huge for me.

Yet I've never seen even a single one ask for your weight, even as an optional field.

Why do you think this is? My suspicion is that while many women find all the above ""fair game,"" they somehow consider someone wanting to know their weight ""misogynistic.""

Since dating apps all struggle to get enough female users relative to male users, they just avoid it completely.

12,oupmg3,1627667705,Confused as to why she will not talk to me anymore,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room.

When I first started dating each of them, they were the ones that asked me on the first date. 

After taking some time to myself after my last relationship, I've decided that I'm ready to start dating again. It's been a little difficult for me to meet anyone organically because I babysit from 8 AM to 6 or 7 PM most days and I'm quite shy when approaching new people. I decided to try Bumble.

He have me his number to text him and I did. We made a bit more small talk and I responded to his text Wednesday afternoon/evening and haven't heard anything since. There's a three hour time difference and he's on vacation, so I didn't expect much conversation at all. 

I definitely think I would enjoy getting to know him more in person when he gets back. It's generally easier for me to make connections when I can see the person I'm talking to and I just think it would be more fun to hang out and do something fun than just ask each other questions over text. 

I don't want to disturb him a ton while he's on vacation, but I do want to let him know that I'm interested in getting to know him more.

Yet again have I been played for a fucking therapist. So fuck her.  Next time she decides to hit me up with some emotional sob story she‚Äôs getting blocked with 0 explanation.

And the cherry on top? My best friend (who mind you - I‚Äôm not jealous of in a toxic way, I‚Äôm very happy for him) who pretty much does nothing outside of work and playing video games GETS HIS SO HANDED TO HIM ON A SILVER PLATTER BY HIS COUSIN through introduction!! So now I have to hear on a daily basis how much they have sex and how much they love each other. I actively tried and the one who doesn‚Äôt ends up with a girlfriend.

I feel like shit and ugly as all hell. 21 and probably forever single. How do I cope with this? I‚Äôm hurting everyday, I genuinely am. I‚Äôm not loved, I‚Äôm not cared about. I‚Äôm good enough functioning as an emotional tampon for woman and nothing really more then that.

23,ouqkye,1627670711,How to tell if you'd get on with them or is safe to meet when online dating?,"So I matched with a guy last year and his first response was 'hey beautiful' which I find cheesy but he then asked me about one of my interests so I engaged. Not long after he asks about letters and then says what's my address (to exchange letters). I said that was a personal thing to give out. He said yeah bit dodgy, I'm only interested in long form not stalker form, what about email? I said both are personal info to give out and he said its' not like the old days (meeting someone). I didn't say anything more on that topic, because I would have said well yeah but back in the day you at least knew each other physically to send letters (via school, local community etc). He's then complimenting/trying to flirt like he asked me where I read, and then I asked him saying bet it's in a study, and then he says I bet you're a picture of cuteness (saying seeing me reading outside his window is a nice thought). It then fizzled out and then recently hit me up (I haven't met anyone for a while because I refused to meet up during covid). He said shame I didn't get to send that letter and if I wanted to chat. I said we probably wouldn't have had much to write about since we're strangers. He said quite possibly. So we got talking again but our texting is pretty bland, I know if I'd post screenshots people would be seeing us as boring as hell. He then said do I fancy going out for a drink and that he's local and it'd be fun.

I'm not sure because obviously safety is top priority as a girl, and the lack of thinking about mine when he wanted my address is a little off. Now, having known there is a guy I went to school with on the dating apps (has been on there for a while now) who is literally a convicted criminal (got caught as an adult putting a spy camera in the womens changing rooms and videoing them naked) and it makes me think there are girls out there swiping on this other dude, never knowing his background (and I've been in a classroom as a school girl myself with him and he was the stereotypical odd ball). Because I know the guy's full name (the kid in my class all those years ago) I can read all about his convicted perversions. Yet other girls would be entirely oblivious. So I'm probably a little more weary of meeting strangers online.

Also our texting has been pretty short and to the point (factual stuff), so not sure if that's how it'd be in real life? Has anyone met someone they texted amazingly with and then met them and their in person convo was different, or vice versa? I'm too involved in my own little life so I need outsider's perspectives please.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ouqkye/how_to_tell_if_youd_get_on_with_them_or_is_safe/

In April, however, she cut me off because she and I are from different cities and did not want to start a relationship long-distance. This hurt because I do have strong feelings for her, but I accepted it and tried to move on. However, over the next few weeks she would constantly hit me up when she was drunk and it really disrupted my moving on process to the point where I blocked her on all her socials. 

In June, I saw a post on Instagram with her in it, and I reached out to her to see how she was doing. I was making progress moving on, but seeing her reignited some feelings for me. Since then, we've started talking again and had planned to start building towards another relationship when we met again at school in August. However, this past week, she stated that she needed some time to work on herself and deal with some personal things (which i wont disclose) and did not want to talk for a while. Here we are again in the same spot we were months ago.

I have feelings for her, but this is twice Ive been cut off from her life and its really stressing me out. With school starting in a couple weeks, should I just put all this behind me and move on for good, or hold out thinking she will come around again?

38,ousp8g,1627675146,Case study: Basic social skills,"This will be a mix of **venting** and **advice**. It's not about dating per se, but can be applied to dating too. Ideally, it should be applied in everyday life as well.

A few days ago I have been approached online by a woman. We started chatting and the conversation seemed (from my point of view) always to go smooth. Nothing weird, both superficial and a bit more profound subjects. Sometimes she is quite flirty, and I respond to her flirts (nothing wrong with that, women tend to do that just for self confirmation). First impression: a light conversation that I enjoyed. I have also learned that there's a big age gap between us (me being older) and that she lives quite far from me (1 hour time zone difference) - so definitely no kind of future here except for internet pals.

Last night, around 2 AM (my time - all hours are in my time; it's my perspective), due to lack of sleep, I was awake browsing internet. I get a message from her, I reply, then we switch to a voice call via a chat app. We talk about 16 minutes, the conversation goes smooth again. We have fun, we both laugh. Then the connection goes bad, interruptions... She tells me she is on the street, walking home from work and her battery will run flat soon. She's 15 minutes away from home. I decide we can pause the conversation till she gets home then we continue once her phone is charging. She agrees and tells me to write my unfinished short story that got interrupted by the bad connection. All good, we end the voice call, I start writing, finish the story, and one hour after the end of the voice call I go back to sleep. At 5:30, two and a half hours after the end of the voice call I receive a message from her, but I am asleep and I see it about 2-3 hours later, when I wake up. Her message is just a short commentary related to the story that I have finished in writing. Nothing else. I send her a message telling her that those were the longest 15 minutes I ever had to wait. In the afternoon I get another message from her, telling me she was so late because she got locked outside her house with a flat battery. That's it. I reply that it would have been nice if, at 5:30, when she was able to send the message (so she was able to enter her house), she would have given me a heads-up. ""Sorry, got locked outside the house, I managed to enter only now"". That's it. Then I proceed to block her.

Bottom line is (and this is for everybody, not only for guys or for girls - everybody needs these basic social skills ):

\- If you want to be respected, you must first grant some basic respect to any human being you interact with. You announced a time for the next interaction, try to respect it. If you cannot, let the person know. If you cannot let the other know in advance, then as soon as you can, let them know and APOLOGIZE. You set a time that you did not respect. Assume responsibility. Doesn't matter the reason.

\- If you did not do what is mentioned in the previous point at first possible occasion, and you are confronted later, whatever you say (whether you lie or say the truth) will appear as a lie for the other person.

So, unless you use the first occasion to apologize and present the other person with a reason, you will:

\- appear as an unreliable person  
\- appear to be a liar (and a bad one)  
\- appear the kind of person that avoids responsibility",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ousp8g/case_study_basic_social_skills/

So we all started playing games together because of quarantine.

They both live in the next state over but we're all around the age that long distance will be easy cuz it's not long until collage and we all want to go to the same area. 

So girl #1 is a friend of my cousin, and we started talking talking and expressed feelings last year but after like 6 months it didn't really work out and got all messy... But after like 3 or 4 months we started speaking to each other again and playing games because tensions were never really high between girl #2 and my cousin. And more recently it seemed like we might've been starting back up to talking again because from LD we were kinda both into it.

Girl #2 I knew about along and spoke with a couple times but never really kept in touch at all until just over a month now because all 3 girls (#2 #1 + my cousin) all came to where I live to vacation for 2 weeks. 

And I was planning on seeing how the vibes were between me and girl #1 in person to see if I wanted to do a long distance until I graduated... But we never really clicked at all...but are still currently and I hope to be good friends for awhile.

Girl #2 on the other hand clicked right away like we were always on the same wavelength every second of the 2 weeks. Girl #2 and I did a tone of fun stuff together and really just had a great time over all (both kinda catchin the same vibes that we might want smth together).

Now after meeting both in person we really wanted to start a long distance until graduation with girl #2 but we were both worried about girl #1 because we both knew she was really into me (forgot to mention that girl #1, #2, and my cousin are best friends)

Now it's just big hesitation because the 4 of us all want  to stay really good friends but I feel like my cousin will hate me if I get with girl #2 cuz girl #1 and my cousin are especially close.

I'm REALLY into girl #2 and she seems to really be into me.

But also cuz girl #1 and I got into the argument last year and the blame of that got shifted on me I feel like this would be too... And it would mess all the friendships up.

45,outnie,1627678261,Insecurities about partner‚Äôs body count,"I‚Äôm in a confusing situation personally. 

Some backstory ‚Äî I‚Äôm (28m) and have been in 3 serious relationships which have lasted 6mo, 2y, 1y respectively and have all taken place post college graduation. I spent my younger years working so I didn‚Äôt really have time or resources for relationships before then as I needed to work to sustain myself. I work a remote job so I sit at the computer all day and have gained some weight. I was a pretty active person up until the pandemic though ‚Äî tall (6‚Äô4‚Äù), average build, lil pot belly and small moobs. Maybe I don‚Äôt dress the best but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm unattractive. 

As of August of last year (2020), I moved into a single bedroom condo with my 2 cats and figured it‚Äôs time to get out there now that I had a place to myself so I joined FB Dating. I dated this one person for about 2 months until she broke it off and said we‚Äôre incompatible, fine. Then a few months later, around January, I start dating this other girl (24f). 

She‚Äôs pretty cute, lil chubby, but I like that, I‚Äôm attracted to her physically and mentally. The problem is that like me, she comes from a broken family and has pretty intense immediate family issues. Classic ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù problems that has contributed to her lack of self-esteem/respect.  

Before I continue I‚Äôd like to point out that I _don‚Äôt_ ask questions I don‚Äôt want the answer too and I know personally that the body count question is not one that I want an answer to. 

I know I‚Äôm insecure about my sexual history and feel like I haven‚Äôt had a lot of experience comparatively to others, or so I think. Unfortunately for me, she *volunteered* this information and told me her body count which was 19. To me, 19 sounds pretty high for someone who‚Äôs only 24yro. But she explains that she was pretty reckless at 17; she was suicidal and didn‚Äôt have a high opinion of herself. I then see a repost from her on FB stating ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt make you cum then it doesn‚Äôt count‚Äù, which leads me to believe she‚Äôs had a MUCH higher body count than the one she told me, which makes me even that much insecure about my own sexual history, and to be honest I have a fear of FOMO, like I should have had more experiences, especially since she‚Äôs had all of these experiences in HS and dorm-life in college (which I commuted and never got to experience). 

She‚Äôs a great person, and a great communicator despite her quirks/setbacks but I‚Äôm confused about the future of our relationship, and in that regard, am not as comfortable as I‚Äôd like to be.

62,ouvo8s,1627685140,How do I clam down after a successful date?,"I (M29) was in a long term relationship for about 7 years, we broke up after she cheated about 4 months ago. In these four months I've taken care of myself, lost about 20lbs, I'm about 4 months away of graduating from dental school and I have actually started putting together my own private practice with a friend. So everything is going fine in my general life but, I've talked to  girls in this time, none have really sparked anything in me and I haven't sparked anything in them either probably but that's not what my issue is.

&amp;#x200B;

Before a date I always go in open minded thinking the worst that could happen is that the date is just whatever and we go our separate ways and best case we have a good time and see how things go after. However, yesterday might be the best time I've had with a girl (F24) in my life and all we did was kiss at the end. Holy fuck this girl literally just blew my mind. I can't stop thinking about the date and the girl, towards the end of the date I was literally listening to her speak while thinking to myself ""where have you been my whole life?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

That's where the issue is. Now I can't calm myself down thinking about not fucking this up, thinking about not texting her to much or being boring over texts which is a huge problem for me  or asking for a second date to soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

These chodes are in the gym, the grocery store, all sorts of public spaces now just letting out their stench for everyone to suffer through because they would rather try doing that than being sanitary and a decent person to attract a mate.

77,ouwvdl,1627689606,Christian Couple Struggling,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years. I'm 25 and she's 21. She's been through a lot, lost her dad when she was very young, and her faith has been something she holds onto dearly. We're both virgins though I've had experience dating other women, she has no experience with dating. I'm her first real boyfriend, first kiss, first everything.


The beginning of the relationship took work on my part because she struggles to get close to people, and dating amplified that struggle quite a bit. It took a few months before she became physically affectionate (cuddles, light touch etc.) And even then she was standoffish. Kissing scared the absolute daylights out of her. Needless to say it wasn't a ""normal"" start to a relationship. But I love this girl. So I was happy to be patient and help her become comfortable.


Eventually she started to open up and would play fight or jump on me. You know, cute things to be close to me. Well this would turn her on sometimes and I was the first person to ever make her feel this way. So we talked about sex and I knew she wanted to wait until marriage so we made a pact to uphold that. But, decided that it would be good to still explore and enjoy each other. This also took a lot of time.


She's a modest girl so there was no nudity. On nights she was feeling frisky she'd wear some pj pants and walk past me with a certain wiggle. She knew I was an ass man so she'd show it off or press it against me and she liked the response. We started to go a little further, she'd grind her hips on me and I'd touch her body.


Now I'm a giver, it's what turns me on. So I began making her cum like crazy. I'd rub her clit through her pants and kiss her body all over. The clothes never came off. I even ate her out through her pants, and lemme tell ya, my jaw felt like it was about to fall off. But her pleasure and happiness made it all worth it. A few times she got comfortable enough to take off her pants and let me see her naked and I made those times count.


Now through all of this she has never made me cum. She's a little shy about seeing me, and is scared she won't be good. I reassure her that she'd be great but have never pushed it. Recently she's began to feel guilty and wants to stop. I respected the decision but it's starting to drive me nuts. It isn't the typical dead bedrooms situation because like I said, she's never made me cum and I'm cool with that. It just feels like I can't express my love anymore. I hate feeling like I have to be platonic. She'll still cuddle and put her ass on me. She still enjoys my touch. But I can't go any further than that. So I'm in this awkward limbo where I want to be close, but anytime we are I get stupid horny. But if I try to stay away it feels like I'm neglecting her and taking a step back in the relationship.


The relationship is good. We love each other. She's been very understanding about my predicament. I legitmatley respect her decision and we both want to get married. But we're not going to rush into it just to bust some nuts.

88,ouxkgg,1627692389,Why Dating Apps Are Evil,"Dating apps have no incentive to actually produce results. As far as you know, they secretly don't match people who both swipe right on each other, artificially lowering match rates for men and not women arbitrarily simply to keep people on the app and trying to drive them to desperation.

&amp;#x200B;

This is nothing like the old matchmakers whose incentive was to produce compatible couples who would then have children, continuing the existence of their settlement. Apps have no such incentive, since they merely exist as capitalist, anti-social engines, designed specifically to market to new/returning users, incentivize spending, and prevent you from achieving a long-term successful relationship. That's why, even though they have more than enough money to swing around and pay people who know their stuff, mathematicians and economists who specialize in graph theory and game theory respectively, they don't, because they don't want their app to get people to match successfully by mirroring the same real-life patterns people have evolved around for millions of years, and that society has evolved around for thousands of years. Honestly, the only service so far that even mirrors real-life dating that I've found is It's Just Lunch, which is a paid blind dating service that vets every single one of its users to ensure safety and compatibility, with an emphasis on the first date being casual, and the person/people having the freedom as humans to do what they want from there. But eHarmony tries to sell the pipe dream of helping you find The One (no such thing exists, only people who like to avoid personal growth fall for that), and hookup apps have their sex-crazed self-contradictory snake oil where millennials and zoomers avoid personal growth by skipping straight to the end result of finding a person you really like. Hookup culture prepares you as much for real dating as eating cake prepares you for baking your own cake. So of course Tinder wants to keep selling people their metaphorical cakes, and trying to keep them from thinking about the fact that making your own cake is fun and cheap, and enables you to make it however you want. (when I say Tinder it can be applied to all ""swipe"" or hookup apps and even some casual dating apps like Hinge)

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr the apps have the money to hire experts to fix the problems with people not being able to find a relationship, but they don't because they don't actually want you to find a relationship, because they're just capitalist machines designer to enlarge investor wallets",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ouxkgg/why_dating_apps_are_evil/

92,ouxv04,1627693568,Advice for a dude (19m) working his way up,"Lived most of my teen years in a country where hanging out was a chore and my parents never let me date anyone (or even become close friends w them. By high school I was sick and tired of seeing everyone else get into relationships so, knowing that it would get opposition from my parents I tried it myself.

I was smart and people would ask me for help a lot which is how I spoke to most girls and decided that that was a good starting point. But evidently that wasn‚Äôt enough bc what followed was basically a continuous string of rejections/ghosting. Even after I moved country to where I live now where hanging out is so much easier‚Ä¶ hasn‚Äôt changed much. 

So after 3 years of feeling down and hopeless I decided I‚Äôd try to work on myself and build myself up. Started going to the gym, joined the bike team, implemented a face care routine to take care of my dying skin, quit being the dude with 0 sense of style and started talking to girls more outside academic settings.

It‚Äôs been a year of this self improvement but the results are still the same. While I definitely feel so much more confident as a result of this sometimes I feel down seeing other dudes have success so naturally. People tell me that my really niche interests are a turn off‚Ä¶ idk how to change that I‚Äôve been trying to be open to more stuff but I can‚Äôt seem to enjoy it genuinely. Maybe it‚Äôs my personality? I kinda have issues being close to people and trusting them cuz of past experiences and I have been described as kgb agent before like cold and calculating but I‚Äôve been working one being more open and ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù around people (Altho some say this will get me friendzoned).

So the question is‚Ä¶ where from here? COVID hasn‚Äôt helped things Ofc. I‚Äôve had literally 0 success w online dating apps (I can‚Äôt flirt if you put a gun to my head!) and I definitely prefer in person stuff. What do you guys think I should work on to improve my chances.

TL;DR - dude working up from pathetic to kinda bad situation. What do I do to keep moving up?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ouxv04/advice_for_a_dude_19m_working_his_way_up/

94,ouy78i,1627694979,Confused as to why she will not speak to me anymore,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ouy78i/confused_as_to_why_she_will_not_speak_to_me/

What I mean is that I have gained a few pounds and in order for me to be able to date again I need to starve myself for months and be at the ''most perfect I can be'' or else the other person will wish they were with somebody else. This is a thoughts that is obsessing me and I have turned down dates time and time and time again even though they tell me I am pretty and they have flaws of their own. A few extra pounds on someone else or other flaws? Fine. On me? Updateable. I hope I don't trigger anyone by saying this this is just my anxiety.
