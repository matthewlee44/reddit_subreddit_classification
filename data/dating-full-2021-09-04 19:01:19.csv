But I’ve been seeing a guy for a little over a month. We’ve spent a lot of time together and have spent multiple days in a row together. And within this month we talked about being exclusive but wanting to go slow. He made it very clear on multiple occasions how much he liked me and that he could see us going somewhere. When we started talking he was also talking to an old friend back home that was trying to get at him. Now at the time I didn’t know this I just thought she was a friend. But we met and really hit it off and at first he just told me they were friends and I didn’t care cause we only knew each other for a little. But one night we’re getting ready for bed and this “ friend” keeps blowing up his phone. Apparently she was drunk. The first time he answered it was while I was in the bathroom and took it outside. He came back in and was like “gosh she’s crazy and drunk, she’s crying and just can’t get words out straight” so I just said okay not trying to make a big deal but then she keeps blowing up his phone. So he answered again and took it out of the room. At this point I was confused. Anyway he comes back in the room and starts off with “I know this seems suspicious and I’m sorry, I know you have questions so ask them.” I really didn’t know what to say. Long story short he had still been talking to her in that way but he just didn’t know how to tell her he wasn’t interested in her anymore and met someone else. I told him that if he wanted to be with her then that was fine, but then we’d be done no hard feelings. He said he didn’t want her like that and wanted me. We talked about it for a while and came to an agreement that he would deal with it. Now when we first met he told me he was going home for her birthday. But then like 2 weeks later said he didn’t want to go home and wanted to cancel the trip but he already told his family so he was still gonna go. So he told me that he would talk to her then and deal with it. So flash forward to last weekend we spent three days together. It was amazing we talked about really deep personal things and the future and all the things we want to do together. I talked to him about how I was scared he was gonna get weird while he was gone and come back not wanting me anymore cause that’s happened in the past. And he told me he was nervous that I was gonna leave him and was too good to be true. We got really deep into this and he told me he was gonna get weird when he was home but that was only because he would be super busy and barely be on his phone. So I chose to believe him. But I’m on day 6 of 14 of his trip and he texted me very little since he left. He did call me for 10 minutes the other day while he was driving and we talked a little and joked around. But then after I texted him and he never got back to me till 5pm the next day. And I’m not gonna lie I’m the type of person who will check a snap score and his will go go up a few points while he ignores my message. I know he warned me about him being weird but all my trust issues are flaring up. I really like this guy and we actually click very well.

Sometimes even the casual fling is hard to come by. I've seen so many posts sharing their success stories and how people can benefit from them. So I thought why not put out my life lessons that I learned from making a series of bad decisions and some personal experiences.

KEEP IN MIND THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE KIND OF POST TO READ IF YOU'RE SEEKING INTERNET VALIDATION! HARSH TRUTH AHEAD!

The post is a bit long and you might feel the need to say mean things and I won't stop you. Express your feelings but try not to hurt other people. Everyone is going through something. I promise you these lessons will help you in future and will definitely save you some severe pain.

*1. ""NO"" doesn't mean ""try harder""*

- I'm pretty sure you're intrigued to go all in with this chick that just told you that ""no, I don't see us being in a relationship"" and you'd feel like if you tried harder she'll fall for you (or he'll). But things don't work like that buddy. You need to respect their decision and respect yourself enough to move on and let them be. Allow yourself this, you're not here to burn yourself out for people who don't feel the same for you.

*2. Physical appearance matter, but only to get you though the door. After that your personality helps you stand out.*

- As humans we're wired to form opinions based on looks. All of us find different kinds of people attractive. But physical attractiveness is important to get you through the door... or spark that initial ""zing"". After that you're going to show how good of a person you are and that will change your life. People love someone with a strong personality and won't give two fucks about their looks if you make them feel safe and appreciated. But in order to show them your personality you gotta be presentable. Think of looks as resume, 20secs of brief overview then focus on the actual personality.*

*3. Desperate/clingy behavior is an instant turn-off*

- In simple words... it's showcases insecurities. Everyone has them, but it's our responsibility to work on them. Support each other but carry your own weight. No it does not show how much you love them it shows how insecure and afraid you are.

*4. The ""taken for granted"" behavior.*

- If you're being taken for granted... feeling like your emotions aren't being respected and/or reciprocated then it's time you drop this ""good for nothing"" relationship because it's making you miserable day-by-day. If you're treating someone like that... taking them for granted (which you'll not know, unless you're deliberately manipulating them) and have some doubts that the relationship is not working, break it off. The sooner you get out of this the better.

*5. If you have to chase them, it means they don't wanna be caught*

- Another harsh one, but if you feel like you're constantly chasing someone and they're simply not interested, then you need to GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE! Trust me the amount of pain that you'll save yourself from would decide if you stay sane or not. Sure they're always the ""hard to get"" routine, but after a while it will start to drain you emotionally and you'll feel nothing but empty after trying so hard to get someone to like you which never wanted that in the first place. The ones who choose you won't mentally torture you and that's a fact!

*6. Communication is as important as physical intimacy*

- Physical, emotional, mental intimacy should all be taken care of. If one is lacking, bring that baby up. Communicate, do activities together, relax together, and do it!

*7. You're replaceable and so are they.*

- No matter how good looking and/or rich you are. You're still replaceable. It's a privilege to find someone who'll go against the world and choose you, no matter what... but we all know that's rare. We can only be that person to our partner and if we're lucky they'll reciprocate (which is usually the case in a healthy relationship). And same thing applies for your partner as well. But that doesn't mean it gives you both the right to cheat. Hold on to each other if you want it to last.

.............................

These are some of the most important and HARDEST life lessons I encountered because of my bad decisions and I hope you find this helpful and that one day you'll be the person you want to be and have a good, healthy relationship. Definitely share your life lessons too.

That said there were some sweet moments we shared which suggested more was going on beneath the surface, she made me a nice breakfast one morning, and another time we enjoyed a nice date at the beach together.

I'm not sure what happened after that, I wasn't willing to commit to a relationship partly because I had some warped ideas on what I deserved/needed at the time and partly because I did not see her as a girl I would end up marrying, though I did enjoy our time together. 

I told her I had no intentions to enter a relationship up front when we went for a meal after the beach and beleive I saw hurt in her eyes. We went to her flat again afterward but we didn't see eachother after that. Over the lockdowns I would think about her sometimes and wonder if I had been hasty in my judgements...

Fast forward 18 months from the beach day and completely by chance I bump into her again, once again, we got talking again and things have led once again to our seeing eachother. This time around though I have changed my approach, I'm trying to take her out more and have suggested subtly that in the past I am somewhat regretful for my emotional nonchalance towards her.

I do not beleive in clean slates or 'picking up where we left off', because that is not possible. But I do feel I'd like to explore what I could have with her if I were less guarded with my own feelings now. The only thing that concerns me is that I am not crazy about her like I can be about other girls... it means I am more grounded in my emotions, which is a positive for me, but I wonder if I'm just moving this along because it's a preferable alternative to being lonely which has been an all too present reality for me this past year or so, winning her over again was very easy, like mind-bendingly easy, after many bungled failures in my dating life recently.

Anyway when she sees the sunflowers I've bought she's going to love it. I'm so looking forward to pulling off this gesture. I know she'll love the unexpectedly simple arrangement of sunflowers, and I'll enjoy the thrilling rush of having made a girl happy. I think it  will also show I have potential romantic intentions that extend beyond the sensual needs of the flesh. That said, I am feeling an undercurrent of guilt spouting from my original doubts about how much I want her, if my feelings are not in earnest, I may have to hurt her again at some point and the beautiful sunflowers may come to represent a lie, in truth I am not sure what I want from her yet but my point is I'm opening myself to possibilities I wasn't earlier. Should I wait that I'm certain I want a girl before making such a gesture? or am I just overthinking it all.

I’m a 23M from the UK. The last date I went on was in the summer of 2019. So over 2 years now. Since then I’ve been on and off the dating apps (Tinder, Bumble etc.) and haven’t had any luck. I’m not the best looking guy in the world but I’d like to think I’m not downright ugly either. I do get the odd match (maybe once a week) but it never goes anywhere (no reply, match doesn’t message me within 24 hours). 

Recently I’ve moved into a flat with a friend for university and he’s got a girlfriend who’s over quite often. So I guess I’ve become quite jealous of him. 

I’ve tried listening to men’s podcasts and reading articles online for any sort of advice on dating at my age. Quite a lot of them say that dating in your early twenties is a waste of time and that you should focus on your personal health and education/career. 

I can understand that, but when literally everyone in your circle is dating or has a girlfriend it’s hard not to feel like you’re missing out. 

On the other hand I think a lot of people my age don’t really know what they want from relationships. I’d like to think I’m at an age where I’d want a serious long term relationship (not marriage but certainly a partner). 

I could go on more but I’ll stop myself here.

It's been great: we've had good dates, we've spent the night at each other's apartment, he cooks for me, I make him breakfast, etc.

Since before we met, he's been thinking about moving to another city, so I never really see him during the weekends because those days he travels to try to capture the ""spirit"" of that place before making a final decision.

Sometimes he doesn't go to another city but to his brother's house. The thing is he always comes with another plan for the weekends and he never shares what he does during that time. I decided not to ask anyway because, from my perspective, this is not a relationship yet.

Today, a Saturday, he texted that he had decided to travel again (without even having planned it beforehand during the week). It kind of bothered me, but I only answered ""have a nice time and enjoy yourself!"" with a wink. He replied with a sad emoji and I texted back that if he really likes that place that much, he should be happy to go there. Then he sent the zipper-lipped emoji and that was pretty much the end of the chat.

To be honest, I've felt jealous and uncertain about this situation, but at the same time, maybe I don't have any right to complain because we don't really have a relationship.

Ten years ago, I had a couple rough years in school. Skipped a lot of classes and was pretty depressed for some time. I repeated my last year and so got to know new people. Met a girl and we had crazy connection from the beginning. Just looking her in the eyes was so mesmerising and she seemed like a great person. Never met someone like her before or after. I still had issues I was going through at that time so I didn’t reciprocate any of her advances, just treated her respectfully even though I couldn’t believe someone like her even could exist. But she was persistent as hell and basically stalked me in a very enjoyable fashion for the whole school year. Even though I knew she liked me I never told her what I felt for her because I was just too scared of her rejecting me. This was all felt very movie-like back then. Seems pretty insane today, but that’s what low self esteem does to you. 

We didn’t keep in touch after that until last Thursday. After a couple of weeks of terrible nights of bad sleep on vacation and without work that kept me busy I had to think about her. Always felt bad that I didn’t say anything to her because she really helped me out a lot to get out the hole I was in back then. 

So I wrote her on Facebook and basically told her what she meant to me back then. I thought I might not even get a reply or just a generic one but she wrote me back she I made her day and that she was really happy about my message. 

I thanked her and wished her all the best. Since I wanted to close my FB account (which I just made to write her ) I told her that today and and that she used to be a sunshine for me back then and some other genuine nice things. Truthfully, I hoped a little bit that she would tell me she would like to meet me but I didn’t ask her and prepared to say goodbye to her for good and just give her honest compliments. (Btw, if you’re in the mood for a mental breakdown, present your feelings to someone on Facebook)

She then said that I wouldn’t be able to believe how much she needed those words at the moment and that she would print out everything I wrote her (I was already making screenshots of her replies :p). And then she invited me for a coffee in the city she lives now (a couple of hours away from me)!

I can’t fathom that I got that lucky twice and told her I would love to come visit her sometime. I’m super excited to meet see her again and finally get to know her. 

How should I approach this? This all just seems so stupidly unreal at the moment. Has anyone had a similar experience? 

I understand that I don’t really know her or that she might just go through bad times right now and need someone to lift her spirits but it’s just seems insane to let her go a second time.

I come from a culture where women expect men to pay for everything. 

Some girls I've dated have actually offered to split, or even to pay for the tab and those are the girls I like the most. Not because I don't have to pay as much, but because they come off as progressive women that aren't tied to outdated gender norms.

And then, there are other girls I've dated (including a girl that I'm seeing now) that kind of just agrees to stuff, but might find it hard to be decisive themselves (i.e., where to eat, who's paying for what, etc), they expect the man to make all of those decisions.

And then, finally, there are the girls that expect to be pampered and will judge you if otherwise.

And so, in a pie with three slices, where each slice is akin to the three types of girls described above, the odds are lower to get a girl that is willing to take charge and willing to bring out their wallets. Let's assume I can spot out and avoid the girls that like to get pampered. That still leaves me with the girls that aren't willing to make a move themselves. So, how can I go about suggesting that we split the costs of a date? 

I'll also like to point out that I am someone that is totally fine with footing the bill for the first date, considerate about our income/circumstances and whatnot.

I can't shake off the feeling and it's causing a lot of distress and it's entirely from the shitty culture online dating has permeated.

Every single late reply and my brain goes off and I can't help it. I've lost count of how many people I've had great conversations with, start to get hopeful before... nothing. Sure, you could argue I'm naturally disposed to behaviour like this but online dating has made it so much worse and I'm only seeing it now. Why is this girl any different when I can't remember the number of honestly great, kind women who have disappeared into thin air.

He is the ex-boyfriend of one of my former acting school classmates, who she spoke rapturously about at that time. She thought he was the most wonderful guy in the whole world, and they eventually broke up due to ""personal differences"" even though she still maintained that he was a great guy. Well, he saw me singing onstage during an acting school performance and reached out to let me know that he loved my voice and never ever forgot that performance. 

Since then, we have been exchanging flirty texts and finally he said that he wanted to drive to NYC to spend a weekend with me. We were going to spend the weekend cooking fancy meals together (he is a professional chef, and I used to be one) and hanging out at his favorite bath house in Brooklyn. I felt like this was the perfect opportunity to try to take my mind off this guy in my life who broke my heart last month, not that I ever said that out loud.

So he drove 8 hours down from Vermont and brought all this food with him. Then, less than a day later, he decides to drive back because ""he just wasn't feeling it."" He said we had nothing to talk about, which is thoroughly ridiculous seeing that he is an actor, singer and chef just like me. He was so repulsed by my company that he couldn't even bother to stay and eat the food that he brought, let alone the easy sex that he could have totally gotten that night.

(32M) Allow me a moment for some background. I've used PoF, OKC, and, more recently, Hinge and Bumble (although Hinge was a bust and I don't wish to get off topic). I've never had any success with these. I get matched maybe two or three times a year on OKC, but most of the hits on PoF prior to me deleting my account were bots/scams. Bumble, I get a little bit more attention, but perhaps even worse than on PoF, because at the very least, on PoF the bots and scammers responded in broken English and were good for a laugh.

OKC and Bumble I'll get matches, but frequently, they never say anything. Especially on Bumble. I've had perhaps a dozen matches in the six months or so I've used it at the recommendation of Redditors' comments on this sub, and not a single one, not one, has messaged me. Everyone knows by now, based on it's popularity, that women have to message first, right?

So after a quick Google search, I've come to the conclusion, or perhaps just confirmation bias, that these apps and sites bait you into staying there and continuing to use and pay for their services by creating fake profiles in order to give you the barest amount of attention, thereby keeping you subscribed based upon false hope. Does this theory, for which I have zero proof but anecdotal and my own experience, hold any weight?

It seems a little shady to me that all this 'activity' I receive when I'm offline suddenly vanishes when I login and purchase a week's worth of premium (out of curiosity and honestly a little hope to see who said yes to my page).

So just want some advice on whether it’s my looks or online dating.

I also try to go out and meet women in real life I get numbers but no response or they ghost me 

I get matches, conversations and even numbers. Yet, I get fucked over so much.

Example #1: Talking to this girl for two months, no sex, spent the night a lot, 6-12 dates and ghosted me.

Example #2: met this girl online first date went great, she said she was excited about the second date. We plan the second date, keep pushing it back we were busy , yesterday she says” your a really nice guy and had a great time, but I’m not interested enough to crave out time for you I’m sorry!”

I just wonder am I ugly, I’m going to the gym. I’d love to meet women in real life, but my self esteem kills me not about getting matches it So just want some advice on whether it’s my looks or online dating.

Hey guys, I lately have been overly obsessed with this guy that I hooked up with a few years ago. I’m not sure if I’m posting this in the right sub. I’m going to make this as short as possible. I don’t want to give out too much info as I’m not sure who might come across this post. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Hooked up with this guy almost 3 1/2 years ago. When I was like 18, he was 23 I believe. We use to flirt at work a lot &amp; were both really attracted to each other.. Not to toot my own horn, although I’ve always gotten male attention, it hits different when you’re really attracted to the person giving it… Anyway, we hooked up on 2 different occasions. We both really enjoyed it, he was always really sweet &amp; made me feel really beautiful..  The last time we hooked up I ended up blocking him afterwards because I just KNEW in my gut that he had a girlfriend… he would text me at really weird hours &amp; a lot didn’t add up (found this out LAST year actually, He did indeed have a whole fiancé &amp; a whole child)

That wasn’t the last time we spoke, though. 
I had got back with my ex in the meantime because he was improving a lot, but we had broke up again due to me finding out that he had done a little more cheating than I initially thought &amp; I just needed space.

I thought about the guy I had the hookup with &amp; I messaged him, he was still very much interested months later &amp; I did honestly kind of like him but I wasn’t looking for a relationship- but to him I guess it seemed like I was a little clingy. I think I scared him off though cause he never responded to me after I sent a certain message. 

I finally found out months later on why he stopped replying when he tried to hook up with this other girl that we worked with &amp; whom I was really close friends with, he told her although he think I was “really beautiful” he knows that some women can’t just handle hooking up. I know. He is obviously a douche. 

But for some reason years later I can’t stop thinking about him, it’s like I’m obsessed. Like I literally stalk his socials. I’m ashamed. Its gotten out of hand. I have been doing this since like 2019. It’s like I need closure. It’s like i don’t know why he couldnt tell me hisself instead of never responding to me. Even with me finding out that he had a girlfriend all that time it’s like I’m still desperate for
him to reach out to me for closure. I saw that he messaged me on fb literally months after it happened just saying “Hey” but my page was locked before I could even respond. It’s like how can you say all those nice things to me &amp; the stuff he did to me that night is not something you do with someone that you have sex with for the first time. It’s like he made Love to me in a way. I know I’m so stupid. I replay it all in my head. The sex. How he was talking to me during the sex. The way he use to call me beautiful and sexy. 😩 it’s not like I haven’t heard it before but it’s just the fact that it was him. Like I was doing just fine with me having him blocked back then but I guess him basically rejecting me trigged me or something 😩 Ugh I don’t want to think about him anymore.

I have had the odd week long back and forward with a few but they ditched/ghosted me and when I asked for the reason why, I've had these responses so far (I've had some crazies who gave other feedback, without me asking for it, but it was them projecting so not worth mentioning):

* Me wanting children someday
* Being too smart (I'm smart but not THAT smart, if I was to guess my IQ I'd say around 120)
* Too young to have chosen to be living in that area (quiet Scottish town 30miles from the city)

I put a decent amount of effort into putting together my profiles, not really sure what the issue is or whether this amount of interaction is to be expected and I'm being impatient.

I've been on one date, she was pretty and smart but she didn't show any interest in me (while texting and on the date) so I didn't ask her out again as I thought it'd be a waste of time, I got the impression she was just after sex (she booked a hotel next to the place we went for dinner which really put me off during the date as I haven't had sex for a few years, I was nervous enough as it was!).

All my previous relationships started without any dating with the exception of one (which lasted the least), they started by just hanging out after meeting through work/friends and getting flirtier until they turned romantic.

I reckon I must be doing something wrong, I just can't put my finger on what it is. My social skills were never that great and with the lockdowns they've no doubt gotten worse. I've contemplated just lowering my standards and interacting with the matches I don't find attractive in order to practice but it would make me feel dishonest.

I moved here a few years ago with my ex and my friends live really far away so meeting new people though them isn't really an option. I spent most of my time inside the house, even pre-covid, so I've been pushing myself to go outside to read or walk everyday in the hope that I would stumble across someone interesting; either to get into a new friend circle or just meet someone directly but I'm extremely nervous just walking up to a woman to start a conversation so I've not approached anyone yet, in fact I've had a woman SPRINT away after looking over her shoulder and seeing me which really put a dent in my confidence, I was just leaving the beach and we happened to be on the same narrow path!

I (19F) had been talking to him (21M) for about two weeks before we met up, when he asked to a week before. We both have a lot in common and share similar plans for our futures which really interested me. So we decided to meet up at a ramen restaraunt and go to a nearby bookstore afterwards. 

We met up at the restaurant, and everything seemed to be going pretty well between us. He did drive an hour and a half to meet me, oddly enough he lives in a town I used to live in, but once we sat down our conversations seemed to go well. I'm very shy in general but did try to open up with him during our dinner. We talked a bit about our favorite foods, animes, what he's doing in school and things we'd like to do. It was very friendly and kind of ""surface level"" talking if that makes sense, but I both think we enjoyed it. He was smiling a lot, and so was I, and seemed to avoid eye contact but we did make some occasionally. I don't know if there was any strong chemistry going on but I did feel a little at least, and am honestly really interested in him. He did pay for everything when I offered to go dutch. 

Afterwards we went to a bookstore nearby since we both like to read, and walked around checking out things a bit. But since we got there our conversations kinda became more awkward, not in an uncomfortable way, more so just not knowing what to say exactly. We'd each make comments about certain series we were looking at and joked around about some things but it was pretty surface level I guess. 

Once we were done we walked outside and he said he had a good time and would like to do it again, and I said I would too. He asked if he could hug me and we gave each other kind of a side hug (though I did use both my arms) and then we left. It all ended kinda faster than I expected but that's okay.  I haven't heard back from him since.

Then we had our second date recently- went to a comedy club (which I got the tickets for) and had a few drinks. I though it would have been appropriate that if I got the tickets she'd offer to pay for the drinks. If not the first round then at least the second round. 

Nope, nothing from her. She just kind of seemed to expect me to get everything for her. What I mean by this is when it comes time to pay she just stands back and looks at me making things extremely awkward in front of the waiter so I just pay. 

Other than that I quite like her and the conversation flows well but I consider it a big red flag if a girl never offers to pay.
