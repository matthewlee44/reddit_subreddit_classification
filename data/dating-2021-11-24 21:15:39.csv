0,r1mlm8,1637810333,Dating at the gym.,"I’m just gonna say I’m sick of the mask mandates at my local climbing gym. They say you should find people doing what you love, doing your hobbies. For me I don’t see myself dating anyone who doesn’t share my hobbies since they make up such a large part of my life. However, with these mask mandates it’s like asking out a mystery box. On more than one occasion I’ve asked a girl out at the gym not knowing what her bottom half looks like due to the masks and I find myself continuously disappointed when they aren’t as attractive as I thought they were. It feels like OLD in real life when the advertised goods don’t match what’s offered. With mask mandates all around the city I live in it seems impossible to find someone you’re truly attracted to and you have to take the plunge on incomplete information.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1mlm8/dating_at_the_gym/

2,r1mtxk,1637811063,I need a second uninvolved opinion.,"Okay so I (21F), recently got engaged to my bf of 5 1/2 years. My mother and I are insanely excited and just talk about wedding planning any time we’re together. Well my fiancé isn’t always with us when we discuss stuff. We recently went to a wedding planner to discuss the stuff we need to do. No decisions have been made without him, but the way we talked about options made him feel we had. He kind of got upset about it all and before I could explain just got super emotional. Once I explained the situation he apologized, but he acted super quiet/pissed off in front of my mother and the wedding planner, causing mom and dad to question if he is mature enough for marriage. We are both 21 but will be 22 when we wed. He has an engineering degree and I will be attending dental school in a city hours away from where we live now. I have no fears on the emotional side of things. He is super dedicated and caring. When I request he change something he genuinely tries. Ex. I felt overwhelmed with school and he just stopped everything held me while I cried and then helped me with my assignments. Once it was set up, he just quietly cleaned my entire apartment while I was focusing to make my life sort out. When my dad almost died, I suddenly took on a ton of responsibilities at 18, and he showed up every day, made my younger siblings breakfast while I got them ready and then helped me keep our family business afloat and visit the hospital. Like I have no fears on us or our live, but I don’t share his follies with my family ever because they’re not anything I really care about (ex. Getting a litttle overwhelmed with school, having trouble making decisions). I just feel like they may over react due to their own past relationships ship trauma.

I’m a 25 F, and have been single for the past four years. Finding someone you’re compatible with isn’t so easy. Especially when you really know yourself, and know what you want. 
I go on dates and have periods where I’m actively looking for a partner. But I haven’t found the right person. And that’s okay. But in the back of my mind I think about my ex. Things were terrible and the relationship was too long and abusive. I was very young (18) when we met. So I was trauma bonded with this person. And even after four years away from them I still reminisce about the few good times that we had. I know that it’s only natural. But I do feel imprisoned by those thoughts. I have gone through so much therapy, and still see my therapist regularly. But the emotional scars that are left from something so traumatic do not go away quickly. I wish they did. I really do. And I wish it was easier to find my person. 
I hate that I even think fondly of someone who was so horrible to me and hurt me this badly. I understand why academically, but on just a human perspective it’s torture. So to those who were broken and abused in the past and are living everyday to get better and be happier. I understand. How difficult it is. Retraining your brain is a long and difficult road. 
I just hope one day I am happy achieving my dreams. Making my own little family with someone who loves me as much as I them. Until then we just have to keep pushing. Keep going on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1mx5q/single_dating_ex_still_looming_in_my_head/

But since she originally had plans with her friends that day, she invited me to also come because she didn’t want to sacrifice one for the other. Since her friends knew how to ice skate she figured it would be easier to learn, as it seems she hasn’t had the greatest experience her last few times ice skating. 

Her friends don’t seem to be going now and when I suggested a specific ice rink, she said that she ‘was still scared though’.

I followed up by saying, ‘how about we try for 20-25 min and if we don’t get the hang of it by then, we can get something to eat and drink some hot chocolate instead’, because I wanted this date to be the one I break the touch barrier on. 

She hasn’t responded for 5-6 hours, but she is on vacation right now with family so I’m assuming it has something to do with that. Though she usually responds within the hour.

I feel a little weird/silly asking this, but it's better than assuming.  

I'm kind of old fashioned and leave the pursing to the man. I feel like if he's interested enough he'll put forth effort. If he's not, he won't. And we can just move on peacefully. 

Back story.
It's been at least 3 years since I've had a serious relationship. And only two relationship, both over 10 yrs prior. I took some time after the last relationship to work on myself. Build up some self-love and self-esteem that was lost in my last relationship. As a result, I feel I may have become a bit ""cold"", in the sense I won't chase men anymore.  Maybe I just don't know what I'm doing? But I won't over extend myself, other than being upfront with my feelings. 

I very rarely call, text 1st or make suggestions about possible date plans. Just can't seem to bring myself to do these things. I've tried. I don't want to bug, be overbearing or come off desperate. 

Just curious how men in my age group feel about this? I fear I may be leaving all the work to them. Which eventually causes them to become uninterested after awhile.

My duties are basically walking around and helping people with questions and refilling chemicals when needed. All the grading is done by the prof. I just help out during the lab itself. 

In the lab I’m an assistant for there’s this cutie I’ve been crushing on all semester. We haven’t talked aside from a passing compliment about her boots (complimenting her suggested by my therapist). She seems like the shy type and up until the compliment I had never heard her voice. Even walking by her lab bench it was mostly her partner doing the talking and asking questions. 

I’ve told my therapist about her and she’s wanting me to ask her out before the end of the semester on the 2nd. We talked about strategies and what exactly I’m going to say but it still isn’t any clearer as to what I’m supposed to do. 

My current plan is to go up and say something along the lines of “hey I know we haven’t talked much this semester but (I find you attractive/I feel like we would get along/etc.) and I was wondering if you’d want to grab coffee sometime.” But that just seems too forward to me and one of the reasons I’m in therapy in the first place is because I feel like every time I want to make a move I’m too afraid to do it because I don’t want to be seen as another creep. 

My question is this. If you were this cutie in this situation how would you prefer to be approached? How do I seem as non-creepy as possible? Do I just go up and ask for coffee or do I try to strike up a conversation first and ask towards the end? If I should start a conversation, what should it be about? (Another reason i’m in therapy. Trouble starting conversations.) Is there a third option I haven’t thought of?

So it’s been demonstrated time and time again in research that women tend to be pickier than men. For good reason of course, because they risk a lot more when it comes to sex.

I really don’t feel that I’m as unattractive as the low number of consistent matches I get would suggest and I’ve had things with women irl I did find very attractive before. On dating apps, you can’t really be funny or charismatic or nearly as interesting or attractive as in real life. Plus you’re competing with the most attractive guys out there who are only a swipe or two away for women. It seems like the whole, “Top 10% of men get half the women,” or something like that is even more steep on dating apps because way more emphasis is based on pure physical attractiveness for both men and women and it’s hard to have much success.

21,r1oj2i,1637816530,I am talking to an older man online and am unsure about how to progress in the relationship," 

I (22F) have become friends with a man online, who is almost 30. From what I can tell, he seems legit. But I know that with online dating, people can choose to present a falsified image of themselves and the age gap does present a maturity imbalance. It is possible that I am just naïve and he is manipulating me. He tells me that I am mature for my age and all of that, things that may be a red flag depending on the situation. Nearly 4 months ago he messaged me and we got to talking. It started off pretty friendly and then got more flirty as time went on. We have quite a few common interests and he seems to be a neat guy from what I can tell. He has a decent career, owns a home, and he is pretty close with his family. I have seen a couple pictures of his brother and pets even.

We have very similar hobbies and opinions. We have talked on the phone, video chatted, and text every day. The conversation flows very naturally, however I am aware that when dealing with people...having everything seem perfect can either mean that you are dealing with a manipulator or your soulmate. He has mentioned his goal of marriage, family, and where he wants to own a home. He has made comments about how cute our kids would be and all that. I feel very comfortable when talking with him though. I feel like he appreciates who I am and shows a genuine interest in me and my passions.

He has asked about my family and is trying to find similar interests to make a good impression. He would like to meet me in person soon, he lives a few states over but I am not sure how to work this out or even if it is a good idea. Obviously we would need to meet in a public place. The issue I have is with my family that is pretty overprotective of me, being an only child...even as an adult. They would probably flip if they found out I was talking to this guy online and wanted to meet up. They are more traditional that way and just don't believe in online dating. They care about my safety even though I don't always agree with them. Me and him would have to meet without telling anyone and that does make me slightly nervous because ultimately, we are kind of strangers. We want to start gaming online soon and I am comfortable with this step.

I could really use some guidance on this situation, just a perspective of an outsider. Are there red flags that stick out to you about this relationship or is there any advice you could offer? I am feeling pretty confused about what to do. So far he has been pretty respectful and I do want the best for everyone involved. He always makes sure I am comfortable with the level of contact/communication. I would like to meet him and develop the relationship further but also get nervous about the thought as well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1oj2i/i_am_talking_to_an_older_man_online_and_am_unsure/

Are these just a rare occasion or something that tends to happen often on college campus' ; because I cannot conceive how one could possibly kick someone out of their living space for sexual activities, or even having it in a space where other people are at the potential for hearing/seeing it?! In these cases where does the process of consent go due to the fact bystanders did not give their consent to seeing or hearing the activities. Although I've been living on campus for months I have not been subjected to such degeneracy at the hands of more sexually active others. So I ask the a few questions. 
1. Does this stuff TRULY happen often. ( if so it's absolutely mind blowing) 
 2. When is consent due for hearing/seeing others have sex on campus. 
3. Why would anyone in their right minds do this, can someone please explain the supposed promiscuity of college students.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1p49w/hookup_culture_in_college/

So Eric and are hanging out at his place just chilling, playing games and talking, then he says that me and him don't really ""vibe"" that well. He says him and Alice ""vibe"" more and that she gets his humour but that I don't really. I was like oh I didn't realise we weren't ""vibing"". This confused me because he said an unusual amount of times that he really enjoyed spending time with me and that he likes getting to know me. Then later on he's like ""so we are both on the same page yes? We both don't have any feelings for each other right?"" I was like what because I thought he did. Like why do you want to be exclusive with me if you don't like me? Then next day at night we had a long phone conversation where he basically spilled the stuff Alice told him about me. Made me wonder if Alice actually liked me from the beginning, well we have known each for only 2 months but still. Anyway he keeps talking about how we are doing and like if we are compatible or if we shoukd take things further. We've known each other properly for a week. 

He asked me yesterday do you think it's time see if we should take things to the next level. I told him can I think about it and let him know but honestly I don't know what to say. To me it seems kind of early but I do enjoy spending time with him. But I feel like he wants me to say yes which I don't mind saying.

34,r1p90r,1637818983,"Help, what should I do?","Hey guys so I went on a few dates with one of my coworkers recently and they’ve been great. My last date and 3rd with her was at my place and we agreed to take turns to watch our favorite tv shows. The date was going well overall, we shared a blanket, had snacks and commentated over the show a bit. I was getting excited to make a move so I just went for the arm around her shoulder and got closer. She had no emotional or physical response to it so I was concerned. I asked her in reassurance, “Hey I know this is pretty sudden, are you cool with this?” And she said yeah. I assumed it would’ve been alright with her, anyway since I took her hand one time during our 2nd date at a haunted house in a blackout room. Eventually, I broke off the arm wrap and got her water and let things simmer down. We continued watching the show and got comfortable again, and as soon as I found an opportunity to offer to hold hands she rejected it. “Idk I don’t like getting my hands sweaty.” To cut to the chase, I handled the rejection calmly and watched the show the rest of the night with her and still even got the chance to watch a couple of mine with her too. Made no more moves though. After our date was over, I walked her to her car and she surprisingly initiated a goodbye hug before we parted. 

After a couple days, I messaged her over snap Monday morning, asking what she thought about last Friday. Unfortunately she didn't respond or even read the message. To this day she still hasn't. I got really anxious so I was being nosy and couldn't resist temptation to check her snap score to see if she was still active and sadly to see she was. Here's the thing, she was always good at getting back with replying up until now. 

The next day I worked a closing shift with her so there was no avoiding each other. I was gonna try to see if things were alright between us. When she came in, she said hello and I waved while I was busy with a customer. When she clocked in, she went straight into the kitchen and didn't initiate any conversation (I work at a dine in &amp; takeout delivery restaurant with her). I can definitely tell she was not in a good mood. After enough time passed, I went into the kitchen and opened up some small talk to see how she was doing. I was able to find out she wasn't doing alright and she's been busy with family matters and school of course which was why she hasn't been checking her snapchat. Personally I didn't believe her, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Over time I brought up things like how I continued to watch her tv show by myself to lift her mood up a little. She wasn't very talkative of course, but we started getting really busy that night anyway. When things started to slow down, I praised her for how well she working in the kitchen and she gives me a dismissive response of ""I know."" I gave up trying to be cheerful towards her after that so I just went with the mood. 0 talking to her for the rest of the night, unless it's work related. It was hard for me to not talk to her, so I became more socially active with my other coworkers and customers until the night was over. She said goodbye after I had to leave my preclosing shift while she was the closer, and my friend offered me a ride home. I told my friend about this story since she was interested too. The important part of advice I took from her was that I did the right move to not be pushy anymore, and to give her space. She said that since she's a woman there's a chance enough time she'll miss me and reach out to me. Luckily, we don't work the same schedule for a couple weeks. I'm on the verge of giving up though so I don't get my hopes up. I'm assuming she just doesn't want to continue what we were doing anymore.

In regards to all of this except for the part about my friend giving me a ride home and stuff, what do you guys think? Please tell me and share anything you can.

Thing is, she took like 8 hours to reply to that. She is a really slow texter and sometimes doesn't follow up on conversations. She's been like that since I started texting her.

Does this indicate her interest, or is she just a bad texter? Should I be concerned? I've already been to dinner with her once and it seeeeeems like she likes me. She has no social media or anything- perhaps she's just not into texting?

I actually explained it to (31M) him before we had sex how it could possibly happen, but it usually just mean I love the sex or love how you make me feel during an orgasm. He understood, but told me I shouldn’t say that and try not to catch feelings. I withheld the urge to say it . We’ve been talking for 3 months. He moved 5 hours away recently and said he didn’t want a relationship because of that. I understood and agreed to FWB. Fast forward a month later . I see him for the first time since our last encounter. While I’m giving him head he says “if I say I love you, it means I love the sex.” 

I thought he was just joking because it’s what I said the last time I saw him. But in the middle of sex he really said “I think I love you. Maybe we can make a long distance relationship work out. I want to see you again next week .” 

I felt that was very specific and not just someone randomly saying I love you when things get intense . After that he never brought it up again. It was like what he said didn’t happen. We had a conversation afterwards and he said he wanted to see me actually after the holidays . Which is a long time from now.

I finally brought up the I Love you situation a week later,  he said he didn’t really remember it, because he was drunk. (But the first time he said it, it was before we were drinking ) 

He said  it was because the sex was intense and was the first time he was with a woman in a long time, so he said things he didn’t mean it. He said we both know what this our situation is and we shouldn’t say it anymore to not confuse each other. I agreed. 

But He takes me on dates, we have long deep conversations and we seem to have a connection. He constantly checked on me to see if I was okay when I traveled to see him. I’m very inexperienced with dating and appreciate anyones advice. Does he feel anything 

He’s told me before how he’s acted on his emotions quickly in the past and he didn’t want to do that to avoid anyone getting hurt. 

TL;DR!
FWB said he loved me during sex. While I know people say things they don’t mean during sex , he was very specific by mentioning a long distance relationship.

46,r1qlyb,1637823745,Being careful not to lead on a person hurts me only in the end.,"*Here's what Some other guy does:*

Says to an average looking girl "" oh my God, you are so beautiful. I've fallen in love with you. I want to make you my forever. We will marry, have a nice home in the woods, have kids if you want them."" 

He misleads the girl that he's talking to her only. Creates another dating account to explore his options. Talks to them and gives them similar promises keeping first girl placeholder without her knowledge. Then once he finds someone better or more attractive, he ghosts first girl without putting an effort or having courage to give an explanation. Or gives a made up excuse ""I am suffering from big mental health issues"" or ""my parents are not happy with me being with you"" or ""I recently came to the realization I'm gay"" or ""sorry I didn't tell u earlier. I have herpes"". 

This is even a shittier way to end a conversation. Everyone deserves to receive a proper polite ""No"" and a reason for the refusal so they don't start to get a wrong idea in mind.

Such things also happen inadvertently. Let's say a girl sends a guy a Pic in which she looks much more attractive than normal. He falls for her. But later on, when they meet or he gets to see more of her pics, he realises he was never attracted. So, in such case, it's not entirely his fault for leading her on.

*My methodology :*

I never false promise. I make it clear that I'm talking to more than one woman at a time. I can't afford to close myself to other dating options  and become exclusive with one person while still in the getting to know stage. After we mutually feel a click with each other and accept each other, can we talk about exclusivity. I'm fine with her talking to other men too in the meantime. But if possible, we should be transparent and keep each other updated.

Also, I tell her ""I really like you, but we do have some incompatibilities. And areas where we struggle to understand each other. Realistically, it will be hard to make things work, but I'd love to give it a try. Our relationship deserves a chance. Let's not close the conversation so soon and let's continue to talk. I'm only saying it to keep your hopes and expectations in check.

Also, u should know that physical attraction is important to me. There's a certain type of looks I'm USUALLY not attracted to. But doesn't mean that's the case for every person who looks like that type. There are exceptions when I happen to be quite attracted to a person of that type of looks. ""

Then the girl says that she indeed happens to be that type only.

I reply "" yes. That's why I told you this aspect about myself in the beginning itself. I don't know why I'm not able to be attracted to all types of looks. And my intention was to not create in you high hopes.""

Then the girl says she doesn't want to talk anymore.

I say "" please don't go away. We connect so wonderfully on chat. I'd love to have a relationship with you. Instead of just closing off the possibility, why don't you send a Pic so we know for sure if I'd not be attracted. What have you got to lose? I won't misuse your pics. There is a 10% probability that I find you really attractive  And I don't need too much physical attraction if I connect with person in other aspects. I understand your privacy is important too but I feel it wouldn't hurt much to show a pic. It's not verified anyways. ""

She - "" no, forget it. You already said you are not into my type. I'm not that desperate to be liked. You'll find someone else, someone you like, don't worry. ""

 It was amazing for 1 year. 
Then Joe's depression came out along with his anger. I stood by him for 3 years, helping to build him up, get him help, counseling, anything he needed he got. (I'm going to leave out a huge chunk of this support and our trials because that is a novel itself) 
2 years ago, I made a major career move. I went from working on monday-friday 8-5 job with weekends and holidays off to a very stressful 12 hour per day job with no holidays off,  and 4 months of the year are night shift. It was a mutual decision because by working 12 hours a day, I would, in turn, get 3-4 days off a week. 
This career change and the type of work brought up some unresolved trauma from my childhood. Which he was aware of. While getting myself help immediately, I found out he drunkenly kissed my coworker. While I made the decision to forgive them both, it was a major hit to my battle with depression and set me back quite a lot. I did push him away. I threw myself into working on myself and my career. I sat him down multiple times and asked for his support. He was helpful with the support of the household (cleaning a bit more).
 I finally got on a medication that seemed to be helping. Starting that new medication was perfect timing. I started perking up on my birthday. We had an amazing family dinner with my family, and then his relatives came to visit. We laughed and joked. I finally felt myself again.

1. Whenever i try to communicate my concerns to him about our relationship, he starts to explain his behaviour and turns the whole things about him.
2. He apologises as if he is doing a favour to me by apologising.
3. He always says he'll work things out but actually he only 'says', doesn't do anything or put in efforts.
4. He claims that he is the kind of guy that puts in additional efforts in a relationship but when it comes to that, he doesn't do that.
5. He plays the blame game during arguments.

All these are major red flags to me and i am currently not talking to him. The above mentioned points pertains to a fight we had a few days ago, on my birthday! I don't want to be with a guy that makes me feel for communicating my problems about him. I wanted him to just listen to me and not repeat his behaviour. He did the opposite.

I have a really hard time moving on not because I don’t think I can get conventionally attractive women to like me, but because I’m not attracted to 95% of women. Imagine your average blonde Instagram influencer with the perfect beach body, I am not attracted to that at all.

My ex girlfriend was exactly my type. Blue eyes, big jaw/mouth, bigger rounder nose, big forehead, pale and athletic. 

Almost every girl I see on dating apps are usually blonde or have brown eyes and dark features.

To make this even more difficult, I am very attracted to confident and dominant women, and without it, I literally cannot be attracted to someone. And it turns out, holy moly are those traits rare in women. Most women want to be submissive in bed and tend to want the guy to make decisions/drive the relationship.  I’ve had this preference for as long as I can remember. 


I’m terrified that just like all the years that went by before her, I’m going to go years, like 5-10 year again, of not having attraction towards anyone.

67,r1s67r,1637829879,Feeling worried about meeting a girl,"In 2 days I (M21) will be meeting a person (NB [F19]) (that Ive been interested in) for the first time. We have been talking intimately for about a month over discord voice calls and text. I like this person A LOT and was looking forward to meeting them. But now I'm extremely worried and don't really know why.

They live in the state across from mine and are flying down to see me and their family. They were planning to fly down next Tuesday and we were going to spend like 3 days in the city hanging out (I live in a rural town 3 hours from the city so I was gonna drive there). And I was very excited.

This changed last night when they asked about a party I'm attending on Saturday night when they heard my dad and I talking about it. I told them about it and I think (I genuinely don't remember) I jokingly said ""are ya coming?"". She loves to tease and bully me and was saying things like ""well.... would you pick me up?"" Etc.. I was going along with it thinking that they were just teasing me the entire time until they told me that they booked the tickets for Saturday, and sent proof. I thought it would be something so unlike her to do. Like, flying to a city, getting into a guys car that's she's never met before, and travel 3 hours away from said city to a completely unfamiliar place just sounds like an insane thing to do. And it's happening. Like they told me how they gets SUPER nervous meeting strangers and has had trust issues and now this!?! I don't know what to think.

Now I'm like oh shit. She's coming into the middle of my life all of a sudden, and will meet all of the people I know, and all of my friends. I still live with my parents and am worried about what might happen. The party that we are going to is an end of year event for a community agency I volunteer at, so she will be meeting all of those people. And everyone is going to be drunk. My house is a mess, I look like shit, and I don't even know what she looks like. I am stressing out about everything quite hard.

So anyway. Went out, spoke to 3 different women. 
Attempting to be as obnoxious and free worded as possible while still being respectful! 

Went up to the first woman I liked and said, ""are you into fat guys with beards?"" In which she just kept walking and I had a good laugh! 
Mission successful! 

Second woman I approached. I informed her how she aroused me as my gaze looked her way and it inspired me to talk to her. I then began saying anything on my mind!  I used a slightly subtler wording! 
She was alert at first but quickly relaxed and listened to me with full attention. 
After letting me talk and asking her for her number.  She lovingly said "" I'm actually getting married in 3 weeks"" in which I wished her all the happiness in the world. And continued on. Also having a laugh! 
Mission successful! 

Third woman was an Asian who I found out couldn't speak English! 
I asked her if she was single, and if she'd like that to change! In which she gave me this puzzled look. 
I recognised she couldn't understand me, kept talking anyway as if she could and wished her a good day. And to call me later. 
Also had a laugh! 

All in all, taught me rejection is nothing to fear like i thought. And it can actually be quite fun!

I need Advice on this girl on what should I do. 
We both are 18 years old and we met on Facebook i just added her to friends and we started chatting nothing special. We talked about interests on things we do.. And after a week i asked her on a date. 
Our date went very well i would say, we went to see different places and walked around, talked about stuff.  After 2-3 hours i hugged her ( because she said that she likes long hugs and I tried to listen what she likes and do it) 
After another hour i asked her to give me hand, and she didn't say no. 
(We talked a lot about our friends, and in lithuania a lot of 18 years old hang out in the city with friends when they have nothing to do) 
I was holding her hand and  and she said "" could we meet your friends?"" 
I said no , but she talked me into it 
We went there, everything went fine, we went to the beach at midnight took some photos laughed and got back to city. 
Then everyone started to go home because it was late, and we went to near lake to talk for a bit. 
She said : "" you can put  your hand on my leg as you are driving if you want"" and later on asked me for a kiss.. 
 Then after like half an hour we decided to go home.. 
I drove her home and got out for a hug and kissed her to the cheek. 
 When driving home i asked would you like to go out tomorrow? She said yes we can
But the next day i had unexpected plans and had to go to a family meeting.. And said sorry but we can meet next weekend. 

The next day she writes me some serious signals which hurt me, something about not even talking anymore and.... 
I said could you stop doing that, and tell me whats wrong? 
She said we are moving to fast and I am not like that. 
 I was very confused but I thought okey, lets do it because i understood that, but was confused that she initiated a lot of things and now pushes everything back

 The next weekend she couldnt because??? Said she was going out with friends 

And then she gave again some mixed signals for no reason and she said that she doesnt like what we did and she wants to be friends first. 
I was hurt and said i dont want to be in friendzone 
She said its not really a friendzone she just wants to keep talking??? Cause she needs time to think about everything 
And every question i asked like :
How much time will you need? 
Do I have any chances? 
Do you want relationship 
To every single one of them she said ""i dont know"" 

Is she playing with me? 
Or she just wants to know more about me?

Anyways I end up leaving, she asked me to stay the night which idk why tf I didn’t and once again folded on the opportunity to kiss her as I left. In the moment I enjoyed everything but didn’t really feel as crazy as I do about her now. After processing everything I feel basically in love which I have never felt remotely this way with any other girl as I pretty much have never talked to any other girl. We have texted over the phone last couple days but my insecurities basically tell me she doesn’t feel the same about me as I do about her. Like I don’t feel the same energy. I told her I want to hang out again but she said she’s busy the next couple days. Anyways she’s actually all i can think about and it’s effected my ability to focus throughout the day and my sleep has been terrible too. I feel like I messed up somehow by a lack of affection due to inexperience but I really feel like I need reassurance from her ASAP so I can stop stressing out so much. 


TL;DR First date went really well, haven’t hung out since, can’t stop thinking about her, need reassurance that she likes me. Need help to stop stressing over situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1wl5a/really_stressed_over_if_a_girl_likes_me_as_much/
92,r1wog2,1637847331,What are my chances?,"Met a guy when I was 16 almost 17, he was newly 15. NOTHING weird here. We are and have always been strictly friends. All through our remaining high school years we were very close friends. Teachers paired us together as a couple, our families met and would make jokes or comments about us. Friends and school acquaintances would ask if we were a thing. People *always* commented on how good we were together. He’s a great guy. 

Truth is I developed a crush on him about 6 months after we met and never said anything. Now I’m 23. He has a girlfriend and has been with her for 3 years. During the high school years, he also had a different girlfriend for the 3.5 years I knew him. 

I should’ve said something in high school about how I felt, or maybe as a freshman in college. If they would end things, should I say something? We’re not as close anymore but are still good friends and talk very often. If after all these years he hasn’t said anything can I just assume I’m not his type to date and let it go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1wog2/what_are_my_chances/

94,r1wsvv,1637847739,Is he toxic or just being sweet?,"I met this guy last Friday night, at a game of bowling with some mutual friends. We did end up having a few drinks and then kissing later that night, but nothing else happened.

Since then, we've been messaging, and we get on well. Our senses of humour really work together. But I just feel like he is coming on a little strong, but I don't know if it's just me.

For instance, I'll say something like I'm having a lazy day and he'll say that he wishes he could join me. Perfectly fine, but not really fine given the amount of time we've known each other.

I don't want to become attached to a guy who doesn't want me, nor do I want to be attached to someone who ends up being a narcissist or abusive and was just trying to ""get"" me before he showed his true colours. And past dating experiences and failures have proved to me I *do* want a healthy relationship. I do *not* just want a hook-up or an uncomfortable talking stage - I'd rather be alone. I get invested because a relationship is what I want, and I can't put myself through the heartbreak again of that all coming tumbling down.

Is it me being dating-paranoid? I've only been out with four guys and one girl in total, and it was mutually the wrong timing for most of them, so I've never really had to reject anyone. Can anyone give any advice or reassurance (either way)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1wsvv/is_he_toxic_or_just_being_sweet/

97,r1wwzw,1637848101,Purposely showing self harm scars in your dating profile pic?,"TW: self harm 

So, I have an abundance of old and new self harm scars spanning all over my body. Recently I have an episode where I completely fucked up my arms and they’re heavily scarred with cuts and burn marks. I’m not very concerned about others seeing my other scars because I can hide them well under my clothes and plus I don’t typically wear super short shorts but, now I have a ton of scars on my arms. It’s so evident and it’s currently winter where I’m from so I can hide them with long sleeves but, when spring comes obviously they’re going to be viewable. Now with that being said, since I now have these viewable scars, should I use at least  one picture of myself on a dating profile where my scars are evident (like a fully body pic of me in a short sleeve) so that way they’re not taken aback by me in person or should I just not do that and just not even acknowledge the scars in my profile or in person? I don’t know the best way to go about this whenever I’m ready to start dating again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1wwzw/purposely_showing_self_harm_scars_in_your_dating/

He wants a girlfriend but he get rejected a lot. He think nobody wants him because of he's hobbies. Now i have to say that he isn't really that attractive. He has an old looking skin, a little chubby, balding, and grey.
