1,st1gav,1644926604,I'm wanting to date with the intention to one day marry. I feel like that won't happen while my kids are still living with me.,"To put it bluntly, my kids do not like me dating at all. This is due to my last relationship (to a man who wasn't their father) deciding he didn't want to be in a relationship that involved kids. (He didn't have kids of his own) He came to this decision about six months into all of us living together. It was terrible and messy. 

I understand why my kids feel that way... but it's been over two years and I feel like I'm ready to start dating again and find a long term partner and hopefully one day get married. 

Should I wait until my kids have grown up before dating again? (youngest is 10, so I've got awhile to go still until they're an adult) or do I look to date and just not move in / get married until the kids are all grown?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/st1gav/im_wanting_to_date_with_the_intention_to_one_day/

4,st427b,1644935003,Is there such a thing as a bad texter?,"I (44F) met a guy (40M) over the weekend in real life. 
We both attended a singles meetup group. At some point he approached me, introduced himself and we started talking, ending up dancing, laughing until the bar closed at 3 am!

I couldn't believe my eyes! I mean, finding someone in real life?!!!! After my failed attempt in OLD. (I just encountered ghosters (after months or few dates, sex or no sex the guys just disappeared)). I decided to simply quit dating altogether.

This was refreshing, I went without even thinking I'll meet  someone. We had a lot of things in common, he talked a lot, shared and we seriously had a great time. 

We decided to go out again, first dancing and then listening to some live music for the next date.

He walked me to my car, he was hugging me, holding my hand and then he asked me if he may kissed me 😂 (never got that before).

So we kissed, talked a bit but it was cold and also late. In my way home, he send me several texts just after I left and one with the ""looking forward seeing you in 2 weeks for dancing"" (I have my kid this weekend). He never been married or had kids.

Anyway, texting him it's like pulling teeth. He responds after hours, I mean 5-6 hours... And basically it's just like a ping pong game. I ask something he responds. His interest level went from 100 to non existent. 

I saw he was more of an introvert, I'm an extrovert. I know I  barely know the guy... but this person ""texting"" me (if we can call that texting) is a completely different person I met.

I'm mirroring his interest, I tried to make the texts engaging and leave a door open for discussion. But to be honest I don't think he's interested at all.

And here comes my question, is there such a thing as a bad texter? It's a flat NO for me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/st427b/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_bad_texter/

7,st51wj,1644937763,Where is this going?,"So, I (41,M) have been dating (43,F) for almost 2 months now. Met on Facebook Dating the day after Christmas and went on our first date 2 days after matching. 

She has a good government job,, loves what she does, owns her house and is pretty well off. Kind of has her shit together. Openly admits she was in a shitty 14 year marriage with a guy who didn't want to work, was an alcoholic and abusive. They've been divorced 3 years and she's talked about other past relationships that just didn't work out since then. I don't know specifically what ended them but her last, longest was just about a year. 

I, have a decent job that I moved 18 hours away from my kids for. It's definitely a dream job and love what I do. I'm much more paycheck to paycheck and literally rent a over priced room and am struggling but still manage to make it happen. I'm also divorced from a 17 year marriage, separated just over 2 years before the divorce became final July 2021. 2019 was not a good year for me and it helped lead to my divorce. I've been through therapy and done the work to better myself and try to be a better person everyday. I haven't really dated since my separation. Spent the time focusing on getting back into a better place

Things between us hit off really well. I start staying at her house and almost living together for about a month, only going back to my place to do laundry or nights she went out with her friends. We have good conversations about our days, but thats about it. We don't really have a lot in common other than shared interest in sports and certain TV shows.... 

While staying here I've pretty much picked up the normal dude duties and make real effort to help cook, clean and all the other things that she needs done. I try and help out as much as I can and be the best partner/boyfriend/ whatever you want to call it, I can. 

She has told me, and it's obvious she's very independent. Which I think is great to be honest. She had made a comment on one of our first dates that she can't figure out why she can't find a good guy. I don't know why, but it just stuck with me. Of all the things we talked about that night, that really just sticks out in the back of my mind. There have been other little things like that along the way. 

Relationship wise, I feel is kind of one sided to a point. To save time explaining, she's almost always cold. Won't approach for hugs. Not really showing much affection at all.

 Sex is the same; one sided. It's really about her. I'm always the one to hold her until she falls sleep. Like not even lay on my chest. 

I've tried talking to her about walls and moving forward but it just doesn't seem to be working. I've been open about past and current situations. It just seen so one sided and I'm not really sure what to do next. I noticed the other day she's still getting notifications from FB Dating but I'm not sure if she's replying to those or not. I don't want to come to conclusions or overreact to something that's not there.

12,st7tej,1644944951,How did you know the right moment to move in together?,"So I’ve been dating someone since last year quite seriously and things are going very well. We both know this is a serious relationship with a view toward marriage eventually but are giving it at least a full year together before considering getting engaged. However, we have been discussing potentially moving in together at some point.

Both of us own our own places and we live less than a mile apart. Right now has been on the easier side because I currently WFH with my job. So I’ve been spending the night with him and the weekends with him almost every night. (He has a considerably larger house and I have a smaller condo I like to keep as my space).

Where I am struggling is I had a relationship a few years ago where we moved in together quite early and things went terribly wrong. Granted, my ex was a bad alcoholic (something it took living with him to figure out unfortunately) but in retrospect I really didn’t know him either and went too far with emotions instead of practicality.

In this relationship I’ve spent a lot more time getting to know my partner but lately it is a tad bit frustrating to be going back and forth. Because I don’t want to seem like I’m moving in prematurely, I keep shuttling things like clothes and cooking ingredients and some toiletries back and forth between the two spaces and also dog things. And even though we spend so much time together I haven’t been as assertive about doing MY things (like reading, or projects at my house) and instead doing HIS things, which I feel is a function of more feeling like a guest at his place (because I am).

My boyfriend is a rare gem who keeps his house in order and will not let me help beyond things I insist on helping with like the dinner dishes or making the bed but he has also pointed out all the room he has in his bedroom closet and all the room in his kitchen cabinets where I could leave the things I bring back and forth for cooking.

Lately I’m feeling a little all over the place with this pattern but I guess I’m still so scared of committing to this kind of thing too early. I had planned on keeping my condo even if we do marry as a rental as it’s in a good area but I think also to give me an out. I’m very worried with returning to the office next month and a commute, how that is gonna put additional pressure on the relationship but I’m having a hard time articulating what it is I actually need here.

Has anyone been Ina similar situation where the timing felt kind of too early and yet too late at the same time. I’ve just been feeling dizzy and confused - not necessarily about my feelings for him or wanting to be with him - just knowing how to get over my fears and proceed with this organically",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/st7tej/how_did_you_know_the_right_moment_to_move_in/

Guy matches with me.  Sends “?”, when I say “is that a question or an answer?!” He says that as I liked him first he assumed that meant I had to start the conversation.  I make a joke and say ok here’s a question for you…he answers what his favourite things to do are, I go back and comment on his answers.  

The last answer is “play music in public”…now his profile only said he was a part time radio dj so I ask whether he means dj-ing in public or playing in a band.

This is where it gets laughable.  He literally responds “now that is a bit disappointing as it makes me feel like you haven’t read my profile”.  I bite back the temptation to say “given you haven’t asked me a single question yet I think complaining is a bit rich” and I say “well it says radio dj but playing music in public could mean different things” and he responds “well you could have taken a stab in the dark that I meant dj-ing..”

In the first few months we always spent a night or 2 at my place and he never brought a toothbrush, but his breath wasn't offensive. I also thought maybe he didn't plan ahead to bring stuff for a sleepover. As we are getting more serious, so does his breath. I've brainstormed some ways to broach this, but reallllllllly need advice. I want to make this work, and I feel it should be an easy fix.. but I want to make sure I do this right. 
My options...
- buy him a toothbrush for my place and mention I noticed he never brings one... 
- straight up say in person that I need someone who brushes their teeth
- say it after sex
- text it
- get drunk and ask him why he doesn't brush his teeth..

I've spent a night at his place recently and searched for things.. he has floss and a tiny sample size toothpaste, but no brush.

Two days later he messages me asking if I would like to join him in this activity. We meet and have a great time and enjoy ourselves. Three days after that we do it again and the vibe is the same. After, he continues to message me with friendly texts and continued invitations. This has left me confused.

29,su071a,1645029278,Flirting Over Text - Opinions,"This is specifically after we have been on a date or two and after we have kissed (or more).  I default to keeping things respectful even after a woman escalates things.  I generally don't have a problem in person and don't have a problem ""making moves.""  

In person, I can respond to her signals and body language and that is much more comfortable for me.  Over text, I seem to get a bit stuck in ""don't be a creep"" mode, or ""this could be misinterpreted,"" which I think comes across as more friendly than showing her I'm into her.

Some examples:

If a woman texts me, ""Hey sexy!""  I generally don't reciprocate with a pet name or anything.  I'm still a bit stuck in the mindset of ""women don't want a 'hey beautiful' or 'hey gorgeous'.""  But that's probably not correct if we've already been out a time or two and kissed, right?

A woman texted asking what I was doing.  I told her I was at the gym.  She said she was betting I looked hot while working out.  I responded with some silly workout GIF.  It was either that or a dad joke about them refusing to turn the fans on in the weight room.  Seems like a confident/cocky response may have been more in order (like ""Yeah, I kinda do) or even the dreaded gym selfie so she could see.

If she sends an explicit picture, I'll typically respond with, ""Wow, so hot!"" or ""How am I supposed to get any work done now?""  If she sends an explicit text like, ""I want your \_\_\_\_"" I'll typically respond with something like, ""I can't wait to see you too.  We're going to have fun.""

Anyway, I kind of get the feeling they're a bit disappointed in my responses.  What do you think?  Once there's been some level of intimacy established, do I need to dial up the sexy flirting a bit?  If women (generally speaking) are used to guys getting too sexual too soon, do I run the risk of having her think, ""What's wrong with this dude?""

31,su0zud,1645031311,Is living with housemates a dealbreaker for you? M48,"After my 20-year marriage ended, I found myself sharing a four-bedroom house at the edge of the SF Bay Area with three friends.  I have a daughter and was, until recently, paying nearly a third of my take-home income to child support, so for four years it was the best circumstance I could hope to afford.

It’s a pretty nice set-up, too.  Close to the highway and BART, a washer, dryer, heat/AC, a big kitchen, den, entertainment room, garage for storage, all the amenities.  I have the master bedroom with a private bathroom so I almost have my own apartment within the house.

My situation isn’s perfect, but it allows me to put money into savings while affording the occasional extravagant date night.  Not having to work two jobs to afford a Bay Area apartment means I have time to cook and draw and play music, things which are important to me.

During this time I had a couple relationships, and my partners were for the most part understanding.  But I recently went on a date with a woman who told me afterwards, “I don’t get involved with people who live with housemates.”

She has her standards, and that’s a perfectly valid reason to not want to pursue a relationship with someone.  But it got me thinking, is this a common attitude?

35,sucyts,1645063437,Keeping the peace with manipulative ex &amp; dating - what should I disclose?,"I’ve been separated from my ex (of 8 years) for nearly 6 months.  We had each brought a child into the relationship, so we raised each other’s kids.  I have set clear boundaries since separating &amp; have made it clear there is no future for us romantically, but that if we can be amicable for the kids, it would benefit them greatly.  He continues to cross boundaries by;

- sending texts asking me out for drinks
- sending ‘you look sexy’ texts after we see one another due to kids.
- bought me flowers &amp; choc for vday
- texts me in the middle of the night to say ‘I was lucky to have someone who loved me like he did, but I threw it all away’
- tries pick stupid fights/make passive aggressive comments by text, which I don’t respond to.
- created a profile on tinder &amp; tried to match with me.

He has a temper and gets worked up when I tell him to stop, but ignoring him usually keeps things peaceful and him at bay.  Im trying to set gentle boundaries and keep him calm because he can be an ass, but I know how to ‘manage him’.

My question is, when would I disclose this to someone I am dating a bit more seriously, without scaring them off due to perceived ex-drama?

36,sue93z,1645067081,My date was upset that there were no flowers on Valentine’s day,"We had a wonderful date on Valentine’s day. She dressed up. We walked in the park. Then we enjoyed a romantic evening in a wine bar. This is the nicest date I’ve ever had with anyone. We expressed our mutual appreciation.

Two days later I received a long message. She told me it was a wonderful date. But she was disappointed that there were no flowers or other tokens like chocolate. She said all that in a nice way. But she was also direct. She said it is one of her love languages. She expected it for Valentine’s and was upset about it.

We are still somewhat new to each other. We have been seeing each other about 5 to 6 times in two months. I find her special and like her very much. She has expressed similar admiration.

I have mixed reactions to this. I admit my style falls short on the romantic gesture. While this can be interpreted as demanding and a rebuttal of me, I also appreciate her directness. If it were my ex-wife, she would become sullen and passive aggressive. If I ask her what she wants, she would be offended and shocked that I cannot even read her mind. In contrast, the way she communicates her dissatisfaction is also what makes her special.

Am I just being petty/insecure when I find that with texting, and esp before meeting IRL, many of my matches feel like very one-way communicators? E.g. I ask somewhat personal question (I try to do better than ""how is your day""), then try to build on, but more than half the time I just get the answer plus ""what about you"", then crickets. 

What are your experiences? What is your preference, do you like/expect the guy to hit you up with texts daily/every other day, and do so continuously?

Hi everyone:  I wanted to update this sub after posting my shock almost one year ago.  Before this post, I had grown comfortable with the idea that perhaps I would not find ""the one.""  Sure, I still felt like dating and perhaps developing a relationship, but any idea of finding a soulmate was absolutely out the window.

We are celebrating our first anniversary on Saturday.  Whether this relationship lasts five years or fifty, it is by far the healthiest relationship I have ever been in.  We communicate openly about our interests and needs.  We support each other.  Perhaps \*because\* we met in our 40s instead of our 20s and 30s, we can make this work and be open about what we need to make it work.

I want to share some thoughts and encouraging words for those who might need them:

* Yes, there is someone out there for you.  There could be several ""someones"" out there.
* No, you have not ""run out of time.""
* To correct my original post: No, you are not ""too old"" to find a real connection.
* No, not ""all the good ones"" are taken.  
* If it's worth it to you to look, keep looking.
* Keep going.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/suqgd9/post_update_oneyear_anniversary_approaching_and/

I (45m) met a 33(f) on bumble on Christmas Day. She is originally from my hometown and was here visiting family but lives in another city six hours away. We had a wonderful date and spent the last couple days of her vacation together. Things got hot and heavy and we definitely liked each other and decided we would keep in touch.

So, we’ve been keeping in touch with phone calls at random times and three weeks ago I invited her to a concert that is going to be happening  in a city that is in the middle for us. She quickly said yes and was super excited which felt great. In the weeks leading up to the concert we chatted and both are really looking forward to seeing each other.

Yesterday, we talked again and everything was great. She even talked about staying a second day with me just hanging out in the city. I didn’t expect us to be spending two nights together so I was pleasantly surprised but did not act that way surprised.

Today, I sent her a text message with the hotel information. She quickly wrote me back saying that she was excited. Then, she said by the way I forgot to tell you that I’m going to have to leave on Saturday before 2 PM to because I forgot I purchased a ticket for an event with some friends and was reminded about the event today.

I want to trust that she is telling the truth but my Spidey senses tell me that she may be telling me a little white lie. Truthfully, I didn’t expect to spend tonight so just seeing her one night and going to the concert with her was all I had ever planned. 

A part of me wanted just to call and cancel the whole date because I felt she was being inconsiderate.

61,sv5amz,1645147919,Weeding out those just interested in sex,"
So I am back to online dating . I am a woman and I have seen in many posts and in my own experience there a many men who are on online dating just for sex and will lie about their intentions. My last post on a different subreddit was a post asking when would be the appropriate time to visit a man’s house with dating, and that was very revealing to me as well because many men chimed in on the post and said that they expected women to have sex with them by the third or fourth date. These men seem to have little regard for prioritizing womens safety and comfortability and they were more focused on their own sexual desires. When I brought this to these men’s attention, the men seemed to justify their entitlement by saying that they needed to check for sexual compatibility. 

I think many women would be uncomfortable having sex by the third or the fourth date, Spending three or four hours in total getting to know a person over three dates does not tell you if this is a person safe enough to have sexual intercourse with. It’s just crazy how men have created these rules for themselves that are very self-serving.

With that being said, I believe I have spent a good portion of my 20s dating men who are more interested in my beauty and the sex that I could provide rather than the other things I had to offer and we’re not dating with intention but dating for conveniency and lust. I was able to figure out what they were about after sometime, but it was sometimes difficult to figure these things out and some men were very good at pretending. To give you some examples, there was a guy I dated for two years and after we broke up he said “thanks for all the sex” rudely. Another man that I dated for sometime when I questioned him about his previous relationships he told me that he dated a woman for a year only to realize that she was too old for him. How do you not realize someone is too old for you? It was fishy . I think he found someone else he was more interested sand wasted this woman’s time. 

Another guy tells me that he dated a woman for a year and when she asked him if he had any plans to move in with her he said no my job is here and I don’t ever plan on moving. He also knew that she had no plans of moving since she owned a house with three kids. He strung her along for a year it sounded like. It was clear that he was casually dating this woman and was always commenting on how attractive she was a reason why he liked her. I accused him of being a casual dater and of course he denied it. 

The amount of men that I have encountered with online dating for clearly trying to be something there not just to impress me to probably sleep with me speaks volumes. I am very concerned about wasting anymore of my time and youth on men like this.

One poster on my previous post suggested that I wait until marriage to have sex again. It would not be from a religious standpoint and I am not a virgin, but it would be to rule out these types of men. I am interested in if it would be successful. Some men were commenting on my previous post saying that they believe that they need to have sex at some point before committing to a serious relationship in order to find out sexual compatibility. In my experience men are not very picky about sex compared to women, so I kind of think for a lot of men they could use this as an excuse as why they need to have sex early on or at all. However I have an idea if this is really an issue for men, and I do agree being a woman that sexual compatibility is something that I need for myself. My idea is that I would properly vet men for 1 to 2 months and explain my situation of how I would like to wait to have regular frequent sex until married, But that I would be willing to have sex with them a few times after vetting them for any red flags to make sure that we are sexually compatible. I would then say if we are on The same page and we would both like to find a person that is a life partner and get married, to have regular sex we would need to move on to marriage. Do you think that this is a good way of ruling men who are casual dater‘s and more interested in the sexual part of the relationship?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sv5amz/weeding_out_those_just_interested_in_sex/

I texted him and said we need to talk about something tonight (last night). He asked if I'm pregnant, I said no. I wish that was all it was. He ended up calling me when he was alone and it took me awhile to get it out (including tears because I really didn't want to hurt his feelings), but I said basically... its a deal breaker and I noticed he doesn't brush and it really turns me off. He instantly apologized and explained that he lost his toothbrush in travels and just hasn't made it a priority. He was embarrassed that he let it get to that point. He told me I could have just handed him a toothbrush and he would have understood... but that I couldn't have said it in a nicer way if I tried. I started to over-explain, as I do, and he told me I didnt need to say another word. He understood the assignment. He instantly went out and bought a toothbrush for home, and when he got to my place he brushed with the little man kit I assembled. Today he casually mentioned he has a dentist appt for a cleaning on the wknd. I'm satisfied and I feel really good about his reaction and things moving forward.

First time poster. 
Gonna get straight to the point. 
I was recently introduced to a guy who owns a car repair workshop. Then I also gave him my car to fix.

The first time I met him he mentioned a girlfriend, and then a few weeks later he told me the same story but this time about his ex-girlfriend, so I assume they broke up.

I absolutely have a crush on him. And in the chats we had, I felt like we had a connection. I made some jokes about road trips, he told me about the ones he had been on. And vice versa. It kinda felt like the interest was mutual. 

I sort of told him it would be cool if he came to eat at my friend's restaurant, which was supposed to be a kind of back handed invite, but he neither said yes nor no. I don't actually remember what he said, but it felt non-committed. 

His mobile is on the invoice, until now I only had the number of the shop.

I know he wanted to actually date because he told me and I'm not opposed to it but I said let's just wait and see- because I take dating seriously- if we're a good match. We're supposed to see each other again on Sunday but I don't know how to act like I feel like school girl frozen by nerves- this has been a fantasy of mine for a while but I don't know how to maneuver our in person contact.. the first time was so nonchalant because he was my driver but now it's like AHH PRESSURE! Anyways, I guess what I'm asking is what to expect, be cautious of,  respectful of,  etc. Dating an older dude.. anything helps,  thanks!

73,svo4mz,1645207029,6 months in,"Probably more like 7 months. Anyway, I'm 40m and I met a woman (52f) last July. I'm a dad with partial custody of my kids, so we date once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

She wants more of my time. Between work and kids, my time is pretty limited and it's just not possible. I have a full time job and I juggle 3 kids. I've re-iterated this before a few times, she's acknowledged it, she knew the deal at the start, but she has brought it up on at least the last 3 dates, so obviously she's really not OK with it. I'm starting to get frustrated by it.

&amp;#x200B;

On the last 2 dates she has started criticizing me. Last night she criticized me for being cold, stubborn, having a short temper, and being ""not sweet"". I can admit to being cold sometimes as I have a lot on my plate and I get distracted by my life issues. Hearing that I was stubborn and short tempered was surprising to me, though, because I have purposefully avoided displaying both of those qualities as I find them to be unattractive, and to my memory I have not been either of those things with this person. The last thing, ""not sweet"", I'm not entirely sure but I think it's maybe tied into me being cold.

&amp;#x200B;

So after I got home from our date last night, I thought it was time to do an assessment. I think on the one hand, her asking for more of my time and me not being able to provide would be kind of a deal breaker, but she's said she's ""ok"" with it when she's obviously not. As for the criticism, I can handle criticism but when it comes with no examples or really anything to point to then it just kind of feels unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking general advice as to how to handle this, any thoughts. I woke up this morning feeling like I don't really want to continue this relationship, but maybe I'm being a bit hasty and there is some wiggle room. Any thoughts or observations appreciated.

I see him again currently on dating apps.  His photos have improved.  I want to swipe yes/like him based on what I see and maybe meet him in person?  Who knows if he'll remember me and like me back, but I wonder if I should give it a shot because I feel like sometimes pictures don't do people justice and perhaps I'll like his personality so much that I will be ok with his looks.

""I was interacting online and something happened. Is that acceptable / legitimate / okay?""

It's usually then followed by a bunch of comments where some people say more so and some people say less so because everyone shares their opinion, which works for them.

But it's all futile. They are not you. Everyone is different and has different hopes, dreams, desires, and boundaries.

Some people are highly sexual, open, trusting, happy to flirt and sext early. Others won't have sex before marriage. And everything in between. Humour is subjective. One person's turn off is another person's acceptable point. Tolerance for the other person's negative points varies. There is not right or wrong, there is no accepted standard, life and relationships are too complex to distill to a formula.

Why come to a bunch of Internet strangers to ask what to think about something that is entirely subjective? Virtue signal? Humble brag?

Yes, it's a free world, and free speech, and swapping stories is good. But for me, these kind of posts are usually just a vehicle for the poster to have their confirmation bias reinforced and tell anyone who disagrees how wrong they are. They are bad for the sub signal-to-noise ratio.

89,sw7q7c,1645269003,Had a bad experience with ex’s parents and fear new guy’s may be the same. Thoughts?,"Quick background: I’m Black woman and had a long term relationship with a white guy that ended years ago. I’ve dated Black, white, Asian, mixed race - you name it. My friends are also from a variety of racial and cultural backgrounds. A pain point with my ex were his parent’s very right wing Daily Mail views. They often ranted about Muslims (his mother couldn’t believe I was even friends with one and suggested I ended the friendship) and immigrants (I’m an immigrant but they dismissed me as “not a typical sponger”). I’d always politely try to change the subject or show a different perspective but couldn’t bring myself to be rude or firm with them. My ex never challenged his parent’s views even when I wasn’t around and dismissed them as “of that generation”. I found this quite hurtful - I have always challenged, for example, my Dad’s homophobic views regardless of whether someone is around. I even dumped a friend who turned out to be a massive homophobe.

Fast forward to today: Met a guy OLD and we’ve had a date and clicked. I’m currently away for work and we’ve been texting and planning another date on my return. 

I stupidly made the mistake of Facebook stalking him and came across his parent’s profiles and took a look. Both his parents pages are filled with proud to be British, campaign to make St George’s Day a national holiday and lots of nationalist stuff. To be clear: I respect patriotism doesn’t always go hand-in-hand with racist views but I’ve panicked slightly. I’m worried in case his parent’s are anything like my ex’s. 

I know this may all sound crazy but we experienced a lot of violent racism (eg pelted with stones, bricks through windows) when we first moved to the UK and a lot of pubs in our town with union jacks and England flags were no go areas for people like me.

I also respect that his parent’s are/could be very different from my ex’s but I’m in catastrophe mode.

98,swhd01,1645297653,Having erectile dysfunction is causing me to have a weird vibe on dates,"Edit: I'm in my 30s, but I feel like people in the subreddit have a lot of good advice.

I have permanent ED from a side affect of a medication I took when I was much younger. Been to a dozen doctors with no help. Viagra is hit and miss. There's been obvious damage to the tissues of my penis.

I've had a Bumble for the past year now. I've met with about 20 different women from there. None have lead to sex or a relationship. I've had my heart broken badly twice with this year from women who I really liked, but who broke it off after a few weeks.

I rack my brain wondering what I'm doing wrong, but last night this girl ""broke it off"" via text message who I had two dates with. She said something extremely profound. She said:

""you have this very weird nervous energy about you that you try to hide. I can sense it, and it makes me not trust you since you're hiding something. It then makes me start feeling nervous. Our connection was just very awkward, and I wish you the best.""

I think that people, especially women with dating, are very intuitive. It's like they can just sense something is wrong with me which makes them stray away. I have no idea what to do about this. It's like I can't control that vibe I give off regarldess of how calm I pretend to be.

I feel like my problem goes well beyond words I say, or the way I behave. It's this weird ""something is wrong here"" vibe that I seem to have no control over. I don't know how many times I've had women break it off after a few weeks, and now I'm starting to think it's because of that vibe I have.

To use an analogy: it's like you're in the market for a convertable mustang. You go and check one out. You kick the tire, the guy selling it seems nice, it starts... but you just have this weird feeling you can't shake... so you don't buy it.

That's what my dating life has been like. It's like women just know something is wrong with me and they trust their gut and break it off.

I'm obviously going to hire a therapist, but even then Idk. I'm at the point now I literally just feel like telling my dates right away that way they know what's up. If I would have told that last woman, she probably would have been like ""ohhhhhh that makes so much sense. I'm not scared of you anymore like I was.""
