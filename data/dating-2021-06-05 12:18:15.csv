0,nt0n9b,1622913668,How to play my cards here? Fell for a hookup and now I’m abroad,"Hooked up with this girl twice and caught feelings for her hard, not too sure if she feels the same. Spent the night and cuddled and got real intimate and shit so it’s not fully “just a hookup”.

After the last time we hooked up I found out I was leaving the country for 2-3 months for work, and texted her this. She asked if she could see me before I left and we made plans, but something came up for her/she flaked (not sure). The next day she texted me to apologise and said she really likes spending time with me and didn’t want me to “hate her” for flaking on me like that (kind of weird wording). I said that it was OK and that she should keep in touch and that I’ll see her when I’m back.

No response to that text...

Now I’ve found out that my work was cut short and that I’ll be back in about 3 weeks time. How should I play my cards here? Don’t wanna double text too quick and come off as clingy/make her think I’m coming back just for her, but also don’t want her to forget about me and lose interest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nt0n9b/how_to_play_my_cards_here_fell_for_a_hookup_and/

They are better and more appealing in every single way.

I know that there will come a time when he will leave the country to go back to the US (where he was working before coming back home). That time is fast approaching given that the US is reopening, vaccinations are underway, life is returning back to normal (so I hear). 

I have a hunch (from some online stalking) that he wants to return next year. It’s not really clear when, but it seems soon enough. 

What would you do in that situation? There are ways for me to get there (taking another degree is the main one I’m considering) but when I raised it he seems reluctant to be responsible for such a decision. He says he wants to continue seeing me as long as he’s back home, he says he’s not seeing anyone else, but... I feel that he doesn’t see me as anything more than a passing cloud or way to spend time.

And I respect that and don’t want to lose her in my life regardless of whether she is a friend or something more. This was also back when I wasn’t as attractive and didn’t have much confidence / game.

It’s been 1-2 years and we’re still friends. We’ve kept in touch then and there. I’ve become a lot more fit and masculine looking with more confidence and focus. She texts me now and then to see how I’m doing and often initiates to catch up (willing to make time for any day). She doesn’t seem to call me “dude” or “bro” anymore, is using “:)” and emojis more, and is texting with prolonged letters like “hbuuuu”. I’ve also been less responsive compared to how I was back then.

Part of me thinks that maybe she could be giving me a chance. But another part of me thinks I’m just being delusional and misinterpreting her kindness and comfortability with me as flirting.

13,nt2igj,1622918905,He wants to see me again but rarely answers my messages?,"

I (21) really struggle with sth. I met a guy (27) on Tinder and we texted a few weeks before our first date. I wasn’t around for that long unfortunately, so a date wasn’t possible sooner. I actually appreciate he was that patient. 

A few days ago, we had our first date. It seemed to go well and he checked up on me the same night. The next day he already told me that we could meet up for a second time soon. 

Sounds good and all, but the problem I have is that I am really unsure about him. Not like he wouldn’t be my type and all, but he while texting everything seems so different. I text him and get an answer 5-10 hours later. Sometimes I see that he’s online and isn’t answering back. And that’s a huge red flag for me, since it just shows he doesn’t want to deal with me at that moment. 

He just seems not interested anymore, although he always tells me how nice he thought the date went and he wants to see me again. 

But if a guy isn’t answering me all day, I just don’t think he’s interested or ofc another girl is more important.

15,nt31cc,1622920392,Why is dating so hard (post toxic &amp; abusive relationships),"Some back story: 

I (25f) was in my first serious relationship from 16-21. It was a very toxic and abusive relationship. Once that ended I did the hooking up/casual sex thing. During this process I ended up in a once again, toxic and abusive “situationship” (lasted 2.5 years) I finally ended that 7 months ago and I have been trying to start *healthy* dating again. 

This sh** freaking sucks. I was recently talking to someone and everything seemed to be going so well and then he just flipped a switch. This is exhausting. I am used to toxic dynamics where it is so intense and passionate and exciting at first and then it comes crashing down (I still think I want to chase that “high”). I’m trying to get used to the slow progression of things but for some reason this seems harder? A part of me also misses the toxicness of past relationships. Specifically with my situationship when we were “on” or things were “good” they were so good it felt like I was on cloud 9. I’m having a hard time getting used to what regular dating looks like. 

I truly have no idea how I’m supposed to find someone I’m compatible with, attracted to, has similar goals, has similar lifestyle etc.  

I know this probably sounds very *woe is me* but I really just needed to vent on Reddit.

Bg: I (34F) married my first boyfriend ever and we were together for 15 years.  I was madly in love with him but I did catch him being shady over the years, but never caught him cheating until our relationship fell apart last March.  I found out he had cheated on me extensively throughout our relationship including fathering a child that he didn't see or support.  It was horrifying and devastating.

We have four kids together between the ages of eleven and three.  Yes, four kids.  That's red flag number one.  That's a lot of kids.

Red flag number two: I was going back to school when this happened.  I'm halfway through a nursing degree and a single mom of four kids.  I'm not working.

Red flag number three: I got diagnosed with breast cancer last fall despite having none of the risk factors.  I'm a healthy weight, I exercise, eat pretty well.  I had chemo and lost all my hair.  I also had surgery and haven't had reconstruction yet.  My prognosis is excellent though because I found it fairly early.  This added an extra year to my studies because I couldn't attend in person clinicals while doing chemo.  I am an honors student still though.

I'm not going to lie though, I miss the companionship of being in a long term relationship. I have never dated and the whole idea is terrifying to me.  I want to have hope that someday, it might be in my future.

So I'm thinking I need to wait several years, have reconstruction, grow my hair out, wait until my kids get older and finish school.

42,nt6uze,1622931305,Advice for girl moving forward… agonizing,"There’s a girl I work with I was into before she got to where I work. We hit it off from the get go and have flirted in the office. She showed positive signs and called, texted me, and we are going on a trip for work in a few weeks, just her and I. She contacted me out of the blue to excitedly tell me she got something in order she needed to to go on the trip. I then texted her I like her. I for one wish I waited to tell her in person but what’s done is done. We already agreed on the phone on Friday that we would coordinate the trip travel arrangement on Monday but I texted her today saying to contact me when she gets x item in the mail so we can coordinate. Now I’m super worried I’m coming off as needy and I’m purely agonizing over it and whether or not I freaked her out or drove her away. Haven’t gotten a response yet. It all developed in person and I’ve screwed up countless times over text so it’s purely agonizing for it to possibly be happening again. Whether or not she responds which I’m sure she will at some point, what should my approach going forward be? Should I mention anything or keep texting to a bare minimal? I would like to not play any games but should I wait a while to respond etc? I plan to tell her how I feel in person when I see her the day of the trip (because she’s now on vacation until then) but don’t want to freak her out before then.

46,nt73ua,1622932051,Is he cheating?,"I’ve been in a monogamous relationship with a guy for 7 months. We’ve met each other’s families, we talk daily and see each other a few times a week. He spoils me with love, talks about marriage and wants me to move in with him. In discussing our pasts, he mentioned that he cheated once on a girl after she cheated on him. However in another convo, he mentioned that his last ex who he lived with for 2 years became cold and distant so he went on dates with other girls unbeknownst to her. He’s also asked me how I felt about cheating as if it was a question. We discussed where I stood, and he said he never wants to sleep with anyone else but me and that I’m the healthiest relationship he’s had. We also talked about remaining “friends” with ppl we’ve slept with which he didn’t think was problematic but I told him it bothered me and he said he would not stay in touch with past lovers going forward b/c he never wants me to be worried about things or feel unconfident in our relationship. His phone cover is my photo which would make me think he can’t possibly be cheating, and he never tries to hide his phone around me. In fact, it’s often unlocked on the text messages screen and in the first view of messages, I never see anyone I don’t know.

Well, a few weeks ago, he asked me to check something on his laptop and I’m trying to do so, I noticed his iMessages was open and so many numbers I had never seen were on there. I quickly scrolled (I know this was wrong plz don’t waste your breath lecturing me about privacy, I feel guilty about it as is) and I saw a few recent threads with very flirtatious tones. One where a girl told him “I’d love to show you the vegan spots in town” and him saying “stop talking dirty to me with eye heart emojis” and one where he called some girl “sexy”. I scrolled fast so it was kind of a blur but as much as I want to make excuses / convince myself I may have misread things, I saw what I saw. And the dates were recent.

I kept it together but have since cried my eyes out numerous times. To make matters crazier, his mom recently went to the ICU for an injury and might be paralyzed so he’s been under a lot of stress and I’ve been in his corner supporting him through that which he says means so much to him. I want to confront the issue but Idk how, or if it’s fair while he’s going through this. But I can’t get the feeling out of my head that he’s seeing other people. Yesterday he asked if we could FaceTime early b/c he was getting dinner with his uncle wnd when I asked how it went this morning, his explanation was really short and generic as if he wasn’t expecting that I’d ask. He had messaged me around the dinner time but after my last response didn’t get back to me till this morning.

I don’t know how to move forward. My gut, and what I saw, makes me feel like somethings up. But I know he loves me as stupid as it sounds to say it. We get along very well, never fight, can talk for hours, and just feels like the most special love I’ve ever experienced in my lifetime.

Another curve ball is that he does have bipolar disorder but he’s being treated. He gets depressed / down on himself from time to time and his manic episodes seem mild and he talks very openly about his condition but I can’t help but wonder if that makes him more prone to infidelity from things I’ve heard others say… What do you suggest?

50,nt7kiy,1622933467,25M online dating,"Hello all,
So I met a girl on Hinge and went on multiple dates with her. We were talking for about 7 weeks and never discussed exclusivity. The only time we discussed it was when she asked me if I was seeing anybody else and I said no I am not. I ended up hopping on Hinge 7 weeks after we met and sending a like to one of her friends. Her friend told her about it and she called me and we met up for a beer. She freaked out and called me many names and doesn’t want to keep going on dates anymore. I’m fairly new to the dating scene and was just curious if it was normal to wait until you’re official to delete your apps? Because she made it seem like I did something horribly horribly wrong, when I was always under the impression that it’s fine to keep using dating apps while you are still getting to know each other.

51,nt7oul,1622933855,Dating ideal guy but not attracted to him because I'm demisexual. Should I keep seeing him?,"I (23F) have only ever been attracted to guys I was friends with or even partially friends with. I rarely find anyone physically attractive without knowing their personality. My previous relationships were with friends. It didn't occur to me that I was likely demisexual until I came across this term recently.

Anyway before I knew I might be demisexual, I matched with a guy from an online dating app. We have such similar interests, which is rare and we also go to the same university, which is convenient. My types are nerds and often they don't take care of themselves etc. but this guy is kind and takes care of himself and has friends etc.   

Unfortunately, I am not attracted to him despite 3 dates (he's physically not unattractive). I have kept him at such an arm's length as well that it is probably difficult to form an attraction anyway. At this point I feel like I'm leading him on and maybe leading myself on. I feel like I'm investing time meeting him just because I know technically we should be a match but I don't feel any chemistry. Furthermore, when I don't have a crush I am much more talkative, open and flirty. But I feel like our conversations are becoming a bit stilted. Pandemic means the only dates we have are just chatting in a park.

Also he's never had a girlfriend before so it seems like he doesn't know how to flirt and is a bit shy.

Also, I seem to constantly have this problem with dates where I just back out after a few dates because I'm not attracted. Do I just keep dating him until I feel attraction?

56,nt8ozo,1622937044,Should I date even if I don't want to?,"I don't know how to flair this, this is probably just gonna end up as vent or something, I don't know.

So I'm 20, I've never dated and never had a relationship. The reason for this is because I've never even tried to because I just am not interested in dating, and don't really want a relationship.

I don't want a relationship for a few reasons. One is that I don't think I'd be a good partner, two is that I have some really strange standards that are surprisingly common turnoffs (never want children, never want to marry, don't want to have someone cook for me), and three is that relationships seem to be quite expensive and time-consuming (people joke about not having any savings because they spend all on their spouse). 

Looking at how people view others who don't want romantic relationships shows mixed responses. Some people say don't worry about relationships if you don't want them, but others say that you'll end up wanting one when you're older, sort of implying that you should be dating people even if you don't really want to. It's confusing.

Doesn't really help that I get crushes on people too. I hate having crushes because it makes me question my view and makes me really resent my brain for forming crushes. I also hate my sex drive for how useless it is and the fact that no one will tell me how to get rid of it, it's so annoying.

I guess what I'm asking is, should I date even if I don't want to? How do I handle crushes? What happens when I'm older and for some stupid reason change my mind on relationships? I don't understand anything.

As the conversation went I tried to create conversations but it went out as we talked. So we stopped snapping. At the time she was snapping me every 10minutes.

Now, she has started snapping me again and I have not been as prominent but have tried to start conversations and sendt funny snaps again, she then post on mystory(she has a smaaaaallll vlog, not regularly): Is a ""Pick me boy"" who keeps snapping me, its so cringe, you're probably tired of me, I would be, mf we don't even speak.

I'm pretty sure she talks about me. If she thinks I'm cringe, why does she keeps snapping me all the time and just don't block me or stop sending photo's. I don't play games and I'm direct about wanting to meet/how I feel.

And yes, she seems like a C-word, but I don't have a lot of options and she is really Pretty. I'm personally really bad at small talking over snap that I don't judge people on snap, I rather love meeting up or have phone conversations before I judge.

Story wasn’t adding up to her and I admitted that I was trying to and I chose to not go for that job due to the job position being too far from me. She then asked why would lie to her and I just responded saying I panicked and I thought she would look at me stupid that I would give up that position since it paid pretty decent. I told her I was stupid for trying to lie to her because I shouldn’t lie to her if I’m dating her because I shouldn’t have anything to hide. Now she is very annoyed and pissed I lied to her and does not want to talk to me which I understand and totally deserve it for lying.  Now I feel like I have stressed her out more because she is also studying for her boards exam she has next week. She last texted me saying “I don’t understand why you lied and I’m just really hurt because you know how I feel about lying but did it anyway. I don’t want to pretend everything is fine, but I also just don’t have the time to think or process this...I need to focus on studying”

It's so rare for me to match women around my age or within 5 years younger where I'm in the same place in life as them and more relatable. I don't even look older myself. I'm a fit/muscular guy who usually gets mistaken for a guy who 5-10 years younger than my actual age.

A few times I have matched back with these older women just to see what they're all about, and whenever we discuss our dating lives, a common theme is how they say they can't believe how many younger men are trying to match them up, and I'm just like, ""All I get are older women trying to match me, so clearly a lot of you are out there doing just the same, but in reverse.""

It' all kind of ironic to me. At this stage, dating apps don' feel like a places where you get matched up with people you'd get matched up with in real life. It's like the opposite. If you're a fit, handsome guy with his shit together and who wants a relationship, your options are either women who you aren't attracted to or older women, and rarely are either of them very active or have any relatable interests/personality traits.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntaf0h/observation_women_are_surprised_to_get_likes_by/

My dilemma is that I see her a lot and want to talk to her and build a rapport then ask her out. Problem is I have no idea how to do that. On top of that I have no friends to turn to for advice. 

I’ve probably only spoken with her once and it wasn’t an actual conversation. So please I’d love advice on how to start talking to her and how to build a rapport and eventually ask her out.

Since then I have learned SO much about myself, the reality of relationships, what I actually want in my life and with who. I think the Pandemic (being forced to be alone and apart) also added a whole new layer to some of this hard-core introspective thinking and realizations.

Well this story will put you on a turn wheel of confusion and truth

Let me tell you a story about the one that I meet years ago during my younger years. It's been about 8 years ago, yes more or tell. I was only a young gentleman at the time with the age of 19.

I meet her on a porch she was lying on me after a few stories she told. She then mentioned she never kissed a stranger before. Me being young man at the time as she was the same age.

 We looked at each other for what should have been less than 30 minutes or so. However when her lips meet mine it felt like eternity.

I thought this would be a long decent relationship with a good amount of hope and honesty behind it.

However the story only grows dark and truth breaks through.

Less than 5 weeks or so during the relationship she decided to break up with me. I simply asked why as anyone would. She never really said a proper answer and I was left in quandary. 

I asked around until a answer broke through. A different person I knew about has broken into her whispering eye. 

I was furious as she decided to blame me for the break up. I simply told her that she was full of it and ended the relationship completely. 

Moral of the story. Even if you meet the person who seems to be like you and even seems to love you. You'll never truly be with them. Until the real truth is shown.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntbh30/theres_a_difference_between_a_real_relationship/

86,ntblhi,1622946837,"Bumble Date, but as friends - do I pay for lunch?","Hi all,

Had a Bumble meetup with a white American woman 10 years older than me (I am in my late 20's). We are both fully vaxxed. Although I am Roman Catholic, she was looking for someone more Christian (I do not go to Church regularly). But she thought I was cool so she wanted to be friends. I am at a point in my life where I am cool with that. I needed more female friends anyways. 

I invited her to lunch near her. A 25 minute drive from my house to make it convenient for her. Asian food. We ate, had a good chat, and enjoyed ourselves. Despite being strongly Christian, she has mad progressive stances on a lot of topics.

And then....we get the check.

I immediately ask for us to pay seperate w/o consulting her (not half/half b/c I ordered a drink &amp; she did not). She immediately says she is cool with that as if she was forcing a sentence to get a voice in a fast paced conversation w/ two other people. Or maybe to say it was her idea too. 

But.... on the way out we didn't hug or anything. Sign of the times. I almost think I saw a look of disappointment on her face. Maybe its because I drive a Tesla or something. But most likely it could've had to do with the check.

**When you meet a woman for the first time off a dating app &amp; its clear she just wants friendship, but you invite her to lunch, do you pay or split the bill?**

I don't pay for any of my friends (mostly guys). 

\-------------------------

My only reference experience to this is when I worked at Microsoft two years out of college. A Mexican national classmate worked there so I reached out. We ate at a higher end restaurant on campus. I told her I did real estate on the side. Maybe she thought I was trying to sell her. I wasn't She talked about how Trump made the immigration situation difficult for her to want to invest. Other convo...bill comes and she is like - nope not budging with her body language. I paid for it confused. Maybe this was Mexican culture? She has a husband. I knew that back in college. Maybe she felt entitled b/c she thought I was trying to sell her. I didn't like it. It felt presumptous of her b/c A. I was not selling her B. I was just trying to connect &amp; C. I never asked her for anything or talked to her again. 

\------------------------------

But I digress. Back to this Bumble meetup: 

Paying for her would've been too presumptuous &amp; given the tone that low key thinks its a date. Maybe even sexist if she is a strong feminist. A power move for sure. But to some women it can be interpreted as ""You don't think I can pay for myself, huh?!""

Maybe I should've offered and said, ""Do you mind if I pay the bill?"" But then again we are just friends. Why pay? But then again I did invite her out...hmmm",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntblhi/bumble_date_but_as_friends_do_i_pay_for_lunch/
87,ntbsus,1622947564,Bf calls me really unhealthy skinny and I’m hurt,"Hello, 

Before I start I just wanted to let everyone know my boyfriend does have strong anger and does tend to say what’s on his mind even if it hurts others.


Today we were in the park enjoying the sunset and I wore a tank top and shorts. He felt my stomach and he asked why there was a bone there and so I showed him and my stomach was flat.

I’m around 5’7, 28” waist and around 108 pounds.

He started off by saying in the last six months he’s seen me get significantly skinnier; he was concerned. I asked him why he didn’t tell me earlier and he said it was because he heard that guys aren’t supposed to comment on their girlfriends weight.

He told me that his sister was four years younger than he was the same weight as me and that it was unhealthy but in a tone i can’t unhear.

He then said this 


“Idk man I’m keeping my mouth shut take it up with your doctor not me”


At this point I was ready for tears start flowing down my face like a river. I know that I am skinny and I know that no matter what I eat I will always stay skinny. I have no eating problems, I eat steaks burgers  healthy food , smoothies many things a day.

I eat three meals a day plus snacks , and I digest within an hour ready for my next meal.
But I GAIN NOTHING. 

He knows that I have a FAST ACTIVE METABOLISM like my mother (who was the same at my age) but thought I stopped eating etc.


The whole conversation was awkward I felt so out of place and I felt that no matter what I eat I will not gain any weight anymore. I’m not looking to be muscular but I’m not looking to be skin and bones either. 

I don’t know what to do when I feel like the way he said it in person during this date was very unnecessary and rude. Does anyone have any help? It’s just the tone that he said all of this and was rude aggressive almost like it was body shaming. 
Idk what to do.

* The ""I'm chill,"" or ""lucky,"" and people come to me approach 

The confident/calm approach to dating where something about you just always draws people to you or you place yourself in positions where you are always with super compatible people. These people usually end up dating friends, or get people to set them up.

&amp;#x200B;

* The usually single but sometimes engage with people approach

I’m 24 yo going on 25 this year and I’ve met all different kinds of girls, from 22-26 and it has been nothing but hell.

Every girl I meet in person either wants to have sex, or they say I’m too mature for my age and they want more of a “bubbly person”. And that just ain’t me.

The way I grew up, I had to mature quicker than others. I have a future and I want it to be even better. I had my days of being reckless and partying, it got old quick and I got in legal trouble.

I’m at a standstill. I dream of one day having a family and being able to love and care for my wife, along with raising a child and teaching them, something I never had as a child.

But how do I go about starting a life and romance if my generation just wants to party and have fun?

I can have fun myself, I have several hobbies and I am perfectly okay having a day inside. Everyone I know jokes and calls me a “grandpa”… but even the girls that call them selves a “grandma” don’t see romance in me. 100% of the ones that claim they are a “grandma” are actually behind in life compared to me.

I’m in no rush but it would be nice to create a happy life with someone before I’m 30 and things start getting nutty meeting people.

We have been seeing each other since the first week of January. Three months in I asked what we were/if he saw this becoming a relationship. He said he “liked the way things are now” and wanted to take his time before getting into a relationship.

I called bullshit and pulled away. A couple weeks later he shows up at my place apologizing and starts making more of an effort. Comes around, plans dates, communicates with me, spends time with me and my daughter. 

He asks me and my daughter to go on a beach trip with him and another couple (his best friends) and their daughter in August. I say yes.

The past month I’ve seen him twice. He still texts me every day and keeps in touch but is always “busy with work” when I try to make plans. I also have not had sex with him since the “what are we” talk a couple months ago. 

Yet when I do see him he acts like we are a couple and constantly talks about our beach trip or things we need to go do together. He will apologize he’s been so busy with work but then when we part it goes back to not seeing him for awhile again.
