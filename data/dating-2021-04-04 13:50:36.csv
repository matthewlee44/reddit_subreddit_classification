Anyways, her eyes were very beautiful and I wanted to compliment her, but I couldn't as she was working and didnt want to say it in front of him. We flirted a bit and she did touch me sometimes like brushing my shoulder. After a while, my friend and I left. I found her ig through his story and sent her a message telling who i am and that it is strange that i messaged her like this and i told her that i thought her eyes were beautiful thats why i had to let you know. And ended it with ""Anyways I would like to get to know you more."" Ladies, would you find this ballsy in a good way or just creepy? I did it because I have nothing to lose.

2,mk2qbf,1617563664,How much of an age gap is too much?,"So, looking for a bit of feedback on this. I'm 37, turning 38, male, live in California. I'm a lawyer by training. I spent the past several years building a company, which is starting to really take off.

 For what it's worth, I was born in the US but family from India. Dated girls from different backgrounds, but would prefer to settle down with a fellow Indian American. 

I have dated enough to know what I want (though less the past few years while building our company), and am looking for a serious relationship. 

I guess my question is, how young is too young? it feels like a girl who is 30 to 33 could be a good fit. Under 30 seems tricky to me. Definitely girls who are 25 or 26 are in a very different head space I feel.

 However, 29 or 30 seems ok, in that I find women are more mature than men on average (plenty of exceptions I know). Yet, 8 years is not a small gap.

3,mk2wvz,1617564226,How long do you wait to tell someone you dating you have depression,"Hi everyone, 

I have moderate depression and social anxiety. I’ve told my date I have social anxiety already before the first date. So he could understand why I was a nervous wreck. It’s quite hard to hide that skittish side while dating. But I’m wondering when I should tell I also have depression. He have always been honest since day one and I know a lot about him. 

I don’t want people to define me because of my mental health state. I’m okay functional and some days are harder than others. I take SSRI for my anxiety and depression. But I can’t hide it good when I feel worse because I start to dissociate, space out and talk slow. I have professional help. 

Right now I’m having my internship and also writing my bachelor thesis. I’m also job searching on the side and going to interviews. So I have a lot going on during my days but I stick to my routines I have and take one day at a time. But I’m starting to worry if I get in one of my bad states, he would notice something isn’t right because I’ve noticed he pick up my body language quite fast. He do it better than my friends or family even do. Which just makes me worry because I know a few can have a stigma against mental health.

Should I wait until we make it official or at least wait until we have dated longer than a month. Or would it class like I’m leading a person on by keeping a certain information hidden that could have an impact?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk2wvz/how_long_do_you_wait_to_tell_someone_you_dating/

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months before I decided to move. I thought I'd start dating again but with the risks involved it didn't seem like a good idea at the time. I've spent pretty much the entire last year working from home and only going out for groceries. No social life whatsoever. So right now even after a year here I have zero friends, acquaintances, or even people that know me well. Only my supervisor and a couple of people from work who I have meetings with over zoom. 

I might be overthinking this, but I can't help but think this comes off as a bit of a red flag when dating. It probably would to me if I was on the other side of it. I'm not anti-social or anything had plenty of friends back home. But that's not the case here. I recently got vaccinated and I'm looking to start going out and meeting people again but I'm confused about whether I should go right to dating or if I need to focus on making a few friends here first.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk3g5c/would_this_seem_creepy_to_you_if_so_what_can_i_do/
7,mk3img,1617566086,Dating older women while being a younger guy.,"Ok so I am 29M(soon 30) and I was just wondering if anybody knew how the older ladies(37-55) are when it comes to dating?

Like I'm so sick of the ones in the younger crowd(early 20s to early 30s). From my experience they're mostly IG Disney princesses with a huge ego who are still figuring themselves out. All what they seem to care about is instability and noise because it's fun to them ... and that's all what matters to them. From my experience, they're not really long term relationship material and aren't willing to settle down. They're just looking for an entertainer with a greater banter who will show them the world. Very immature ... I don't really want to babysit someone pretty much ... And to me someone like that who doesn't know what they want is so unattractive ...

So I was wondering. Older ladies seem more mature and have their lives figured out. Like they seem more willing to use dating services and stuff. So put themselves out there rather than wait for a guy to approach them IRL. Any guys could comment on if they have the same insane standards or they are just more accepting? I'm assuming that they have matured by that age. Age is also not really a factor for me in a relationship as I don't plan to have kids at the moment. I just want someone who has a great body and is a great person inside ... That's my only physical requirement because sex is extremely important to me and I could not enjoy someone who is out of shape. Even if she's older, I would be fine with this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk3img/dating_older_women_while_being_a_younger_guy/

10,mk4jmf,1617569315,Months ago my first gf left me for her ex and I'm still stuck thinking about her,"TL;DR: My first GF that I dated for 7 months and cared and loved a lot left me for the guy that broke her heart before and told me she never reciprocated my feelings.

I'm 26, she is 21. She was my first GF and I swear to you guys that I was the best person I could for her. I'm still really hurt and missing her after all of this. I just need some opinions of someone unbiased and if I'm really wrong here.

I met her at work and it was everything so easy and smooth. We had so many things in common that the first time we ever talked we lost many hours without realizing.
She was dating back then. I was a little upset when I found out because we had been talking for a while and we got along like we knew each other for ages.

One day she began to talk about how her boyfriend never seemed to really care about her, that a lot of small things she values he didn't really bother, etc..

When 2020 began, her boyfriend left her. I don't know why or the situation involved, but she didn't seemed really sad. She even started to talk to me more and at the end of February SHE asked me out on a date. 

The date was amazing, I fell really hard for her. She suggested that we should go to my place to continue the night. She was my first gf, my first sex, the first time I really fell for someone like this. 
As time went by, she was discovering more about me and sharing many many personal stuff. She knew how hurt I was in the past with previous flings and people on my life. I was fat growing up and everyone bullied and laughed at me all the time. Girls considered me a joke and even in college they would just laugh when I asked them out.

I'm fit now, everyone says I'm really good looking, I have my successful career, my own house, car, I used to travel around the world but women will would look the other way all the time.

She was the only girl to ever be interested in me, to think I was amazing. She would tell me everyday that I was the most special person in the world and that I was some sort of angel that she happened to find. 
She acted like she was in love with me, and I treated her with all the love, respect and showed how proud I was of the things she did all the time.

We used to spend the weekends having sex, and between each round I would cuddle with her and play with her hair. The way she used to look at me was so passionate and happy. Always on the next morning I would wake up early and make breakfast and cook some things for her. We saw each other only on weekends and I wanted to show her all the love I had inside of me. She was always looking so happy and in love that it made me feel like I was beyond rare and valuable.

I took care of her when she needed most during this COVID times. I knew she had low self-esteem and was having anxiety and panic attack because all of this and I drove to her house (even skipping work) to took care of her, hold her  tight and make her feel safe.
She asked me while crying to not leave her, and to be patient with this whole thing. I told her that I loved her. We were together for 4-5 months and I never ceased to show and tell her how much I wanted to be in a relationship with her and build things.

We were together for 7 months, and on the last 2 months she became really distant and a little cold. She would still say many wonderful things about me, but she would never find time to see me. She started to take much longer to answer my texts until finally she broke things off with me.

She cried so much that day, saying that she needed time to heal from her past relationship and that I was so perfect for her, and that we weren't on the same page, etc..  that she needed to be alone sort things out.

She never stopped texting me though. I thought she was missing me, because she would sometimes tell me so. But after somedays I discovered that she went travel with her ex to the place I always told her I wanted to go with her. She knew how special that place was for me and how much I wanted to be there with her.

When I told her ""really? You left me to be with him? To the place I wanted to take you?"", She cried a lot and basically said that I was the one to blame to pursue a relationship with someone that fresh out of one, and that she never reciprocated my feelings. ( Complete BS)

It has been many many months now since the last time we spoke, but she was my first real thing. I trusted her more than anyone, and she knew that and much more. How can I be left for the one that broke her heart that easily? I still miss her even after all this time and the pain never goes away. She never texted me back or looked for me and I'm still really hurt. I can't quite describe how low I'm feeling this latest months.

I feel like I'm not good enough or worthy of love. It's like I'm a joke that will keep being alone like I was being punished for something. I don't know what to do and my heart hurts. Covid also forces me to stay home alone and not meeting new people. I'm going crazy",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk4jmf/months_ago_my_first_gf_left_me_for_her_ex_and_im/

Might sound odd as to why I'm asking for advice based on someone's career, but from what I understand IB takes up most of an IB's life. I'm used to dating people within my field of study (Biomed background) or through friends of friends and the occasional app date and have never dated someone with a corporate background. I swiped on an IB guy who is very different to me and I've enjoyed conversations/phone and video calls with him for 2 months (lockdown in the UK). He communicates often when he gets the time but then sometimes don't hear from him for days/a week max and I've put this down to work.

I know that IBs work crazy hours etc. have heard of the multiple rescheduling of dates or scenarios where they are late to dates a lot. But also have heard of this IB personality sterotype - i.e., they only care about/are obsessed with money, materialistic, cocky, ""players"" at the extreme side of things, etc.

This may sound stupid, but for some reason, I do feel like I'm nervous to date him because of these stereotypes/fear of being hurt and since he is out of my usual ""type"". So really want to debunk these thoughts/perspectives I've heard from friends/family.

So would love to hear what your experiences have been like! Did it work out for you? Did their personality surprise you? What should someone who doesn't really know much about IB expect when dating a banker? What tips would you give?

I recently met this guy \[28, M\] and we've hung out twice now, however I was transparent in letting him know from the jump that I wasn't looking for anything serious. Fast forward to yesterday after we got lunch, he let me know that he wanted to take me on a ""date date"" if I was open to it. It would really be a continuation of how we've already been hanging out, but with more intention on his end, it seems.

I told him I was open to it, and that I'd think about it lol. 

My dilemma is - I enjoy this guy's company and I like hanging out with him. He's the first person of the opposite sex I've hung out with since my breakup. I could see myself with him. However, I'm not sure I'm at the stage in which I feel fully healed enough to be 100% emotionally vulnerable and available with someone new just set. I also don't want to self-sabotage.

Is it possible to date while not looking for anything serious or leading someone on? As long as intentions on both ends are made? Is it ok to go on a date with this guy if I'm not currently looking for anything serious? Thoughts?

20,mk54a7,1617571087,I let my social anxiety win over me again…,"
This weekend I attended a wedding and the night before the wedding, we all were at a bar drinking. The bride, who I’m related to, was talking to me and then she said right in front of me and her bridesmaid that I’m cute and the bridesmaid agreed….Bride then jokingly made a comment saying “who wants to be my aunt!”. 

I was shocked that a girl who looks like she belongs in sorority (aka way out of my league) said I’m cute. I don’t know if she meant cute as in “I would date you” cute or adorable like a puppy cute. Either way I decided see for myself and told myself to get her number/talk to her at the actual wedding….guess what I didn’t do….

I failed to talk to her for more than 10 seconds and didn’t get her number and I’m kinda sad that I let my anxiety win over me again. Even alcohol couldn’t save me. I think what happened was that I was intimidated by her looks even though she called me cute but I’m still tired of fucking up every chance I have at talking to women.

29,mk61uy,1617574004,Can someone help me understand what I did?,"So one week ago I (25F) went on a first date with a guy (30M). It was pretty good but I ended up staying the night at his house because we both drank a lot and passed out. Nothing happened except for some making out.

I text him the day after (Sunday) and ask if he’s down to hangout again sometime. He says “yes please”. I take this as a good sign. We Snapchat back and forth and make plans for Thursday night. I ended up being a little late to the place we were going so he left and asked me to come to his place. So I do, and we end up watching a movie and having sex. I try to leave afterwards because I have work early in the morning and I’m not a morning person so I knew I would feel like shit staying and having to wake up early to go back to my apartment . Anyways, he asks me to stay and says “you can’t just smash and leave”. I was like, alright I’ll stay. 

We end up having sex in the morning too and whatever. In the morning I told him I was going to go to this historic movie theater by my apartment to watch the Oscar nominated short films and invited him if he wanted to. So he says maybe but that he will probably sleep after work. I text him Friday afternoon and ask if he wants to join. He says yes. We watch the films and then start to part ways(I wasn’t gonna ask him to come over because I figured he was tired and may have seen enough of me for one week). Well, he asks me, before we part ways, “what are you doing tomorrow?” And I’m just surprised he wanted to see me again after spending Thursday and Friday together.

So Saturday rolls around and he comes to my apartment at 8:30. We were drinking (me probably more than him, which was out of the normal since our first two dates he was way drunker than me) and I have to pee. So I go to my bathroom, pee, and realize the toilet won’t flush and my water has been turned off. 

At this point I’m panicking inside. It’s not like that was super gross because I had been drinking, my pee basically looked like water. But it was still undesirable. Well, I end up trying to email my apartment complex and figure out what is going on (water is included in our rent). And I was freaking out because I was like, this guy is gonna have to pee and he might be grossed out, or wonder why the fuck I wouldn’t have water at 11pm on a Saturday. So I start texting my friends and accidentally paying little attention to him because I’m so embarrassed at this point. He ends up saying “well I’m gonna go since you’re preoccupied right now” I apologized and said I was trying to email my property manager and he says “is that really all you were doing ?” Like he didn’t believe me. And  then I don’t even know what compelled me to say what I said next but I end up saying “you don’t want to stay even to have sex with me?”. Mortified thinking about this now. He says “another time, I have to go take my dog out”.

I end up texting him about ten minutes after he left (he lives about 20 minutes away from me) and I apologized for being preoccupied and sent him a picture of the email between me and my property manager. Then I text after that “I really liked having you over” then “/:” and he’s said nothing. 

He seemed really into me and I guess I messed things up. I feel bad because I’m usually a person who doesn’t touch their phone when they are with other people and I would hope he would know that from all of our dates. 

So is he ghosting me? Why would this make him not even want to talk to me? I don’t get it. Obviously I’m embarrassed and obviously I feel like shit about it.

30,mk62hl,1617574061,What am I supposed to do?,"So I'm gettiing along with that guy (I'm a girl) in my class. We already talked much back when the schools were still open (5 months ago) and during online school we started to chat and talk more on discord (with friends of us), also talking about more serious things in our lifes.
But he just doesn't make the first move and asks me out.
Even though I'm sure I gave him some clear hints. He just doesn't shoot his final shot.
When we're calling with his friends they directly make comments about him liking me a lot, he texts me back really fast, starts the conversation more often than me, forced me to invite him to my birthday with my friends, compliments me sometimes and so on.

So is it wrong to shoot my shot now and ask him out? Or should I wait for him to ask me?
It really bothers me that he leaves the situation open like that, things aren't clear and I'm sure that he knows that if he would ask me I would definitely say yes.

I've been casually hanging out with this girl for a while and we meet every 2 months or so. Lately I've been getting the vibe that she might be interested. For instance, today we hung out one on one and grabbed brunch, she let me pay (in case that's a tell or something). I could tell that she put in effort into looking good too. We then proceed to hangout at my place and watch some Netflix while we eat our takeout brunch and talk for a 2 solid hours. I dropped her off to the car and hugged her goodbye but upon looking back Im thinking I should have made a move and tried to kiss her. I don't want to alienate her because I do enjoy hanging out with her and find it very easy to talk to her. Just wondering what you guys do when you're not entirely sure if you should be making a move?

36,mk6xct,1617576838,"Can you help me figure out if my coworker is into me, or if my hunch is WAY off?","My coteacher [F29] (we both teach the same preschool students in the same classroom) and I [M27] have been working directly together for roughly 7-8 months now. For the record, the past couple months are when I realized I have feelings for her.

Here's the backstory.

Before we became coteachers, we worked in other classrooms and didn't know eachother. Despite that, she would pop into my classroom and make sure I was ready for admin to observe me, and even came in to let me know she heard from a mutual friend/coworker that I like the same band as her. Seemed a bit odd, as we didn't know eachother or work together, but I didn't think much further about it at the time. We hadn't developed a workplace friendship yet and hadn't even become acquaintances yet, but even back then it felt like a seed was being planted. This occured a couple months before we ended up as coteachers.

When we became coteachers, she learned about how I had moved to the city/state from another state right before COVID hit, so I hadn't explored the city yet or met anyone. She offered to be my ""tour guide"" and over the past 8 months is still developing a LONG list of places she wants to take me and show me. We were waiting till we became vaccinated and covid wasn't as big of a threat any more to start hanging out.

Rather quickly we found out that we share almost ALL the same interests and similar aspirations and life goals. We don't have a lot of time to chat as teachers, and only get to chat during nap time (students are asleep), and even then we lose track of time talking. So, for the past 6 or so months we have texted (and snapchatted) eachother WALLS of text every evening, having two conversations with entirely different topics across both the texts and snapchat, alternating between the two as we have time to respond to each. We have a million inside jokes, tell stories about our lives and childhoods, joke around (which gets flirty but I'm bad at reading flirtiness as romantic or not because I have very high functioning autism), and make a lot of plans for things we can do together in the post-covid world. My coteacher even told me once that our mutual coworker friend (my coteacher's best friend) thinks we're ""twin flames"" and my coteacher has told me numerous times that she never thought she'd meet someone who is so much like her.

When we do get to talk at work during nap time, we stand very close to eachother (like 2-3 feet), and she will even be the one to get closer. It seems like she either doesn't notice or care when her hair brushes against me when she moves around slightly while talking. During this, I notice we both end up mimicking eachothers body language, and we both have even jokingly pointed it out.


Now recently.

Our birthdays are one day apart, so that same mutual coworker friend arranged an outing for the three of us celebrate my coteacher's and my birthdays on a weekend before our birthdays. It was our first time seeing my coteacher outside of work, and we both had a blast. We ended up all staying out for nearly 11 hours, and neither of us realized it as we talked and had fun together the whole time.

My actual birthday was a few days after our get-together, and my coteacher hadn't finished my gifts in time to give them when we went out before, so she invited me over to her house to exchange gifts and have dinner and celebrate on my birthday after work. Just her and I. COVID has prevented me from making friends outside of work in my new city, so of course I took her up on the offer, even if only to spend my birthday with someone I enjoyed the company of.

Well while at work (school) during the day of my birthday (yesterday actually), the day of our birthday plans together, she gives me a gift that she has worked A WHOLE MONTH on, and even got our students to help with the past week. Fast forward to that evening, and I'm at her place after work. We ordered take-out, drove together to pick it up, and then went back to her place and we lost track of time talking the night away while eating and listening to music. We exchanged gifts and she gave me a personalized scrapbook (with location pictures and personal written anecdotes) of all the places she wants to take me to in our city. It must have taken her hours, days, and weeks to make the book. So much effort was put into it. She told me I was worth it and knew I would appreciate the gift. She asked for a hug at the end of the night before I left, so we hugged, but there was no urgency from her for the hug to end. She told me thank you for everything, and thanked her in return while we hugged. When I let go and looked at her (because I didn't want the hug to be weirdly long), she was already looking at me and then had a sad, maybe disappointed, expression. like she was looking at me longingly in a sad way. My mind went ""oh fuck I was supposed to kiss her"", but since neither of us have definitively expressed interest in eachother, and neither of us have used the ""date"" word, I felt it was safer to not act on my assumptions and we finished up our goodbyes. It was past 2am and we had work in the morning.

A few days later, we made plans for me to come over to her house so we could finish some required online training (2 hrs worth) quicker together. We finished the training, went and got some food to bring back, and then afterwards we just talked about our lives for 8 hours.

We've already made plans to go to a nearby park together on an evening after work this week. Is this normal to do platonically? I feel like she's waiting for me to ask her out and just let the cat out of the bag....

I'm left with torn feelings of really wanting to ask her on a date, but am dreadfully paranoid that a rejection (if I'm misreading things) would ruin our coteacher dynamic. I cannot for THE LIFE OF ME figure out if she's just the nicest woman on Earth, or is she the nicest woman on Earth AND interested in me. She touches my arm, but only occasionally, she plays with her hair but idk if that's just her. She does act like I'm incredibly funny, but we could just get along really well. I would be able to move on and be friendly and professional if I'm rejected, but she's a variable that I can't predict if she rejects me. If she says yes, then great. We're both mature adults. I don't have any qualms with shitting where I eat or whatever. I've thought about asking our mutual coworker friend (her best friend) if I'm crazy or not, as we have become very close as well, but am not sure how that looks. I also recognize I'm not a teenager and asking my crush's best friend if she likes me back seems a bit immature.



I tried to leave out as much of my own interpretations when making this post, and presented as much hard facts or observations I've come across, in hopes that it will help outside perspectives come to better conclusions.

Based off of what I've typed, am I crazy, or is she into me? I'm not focusing on the fact we're coteachers, just whether or not other people think she's interested  (I know, only I can really know) based on the data I've provided. I know what I want to hear, but am will not be deaf towards honesty.

She has this other habit which satisfies her is that she needs acknowledgment and affirmation from people around her like supporting her without credibility which of course is another weak  pattern further demoralizes her personality in my view and prospective plus she is the kind who fabricates stories and incidents just so that she secure her image in front of her friends  and will make her seem bona fide.

I hope she knows that because of serving herself be it joy or necessity she would ignore and would put her most precious thing on the line to live her moment of joy which only includes her and yes she's a woman with an advantage of getting sympathy from her ladies backing her up and telling her she's doing the right thing as if she lacks the capability of making decisions for herself in her best interest but no she's controlled and she lost control on her desires by putting her loved one at stake without any regret.

Now the problem which I have here is that she's continuously breaking into my privacy while advocating privacy breach herself and I know she's helpless because she has no control over me and I've dealt very decently giving her the space she needs but I hope she knows that she broke too many barriers already when it comes to my private space involving people who consider themselves as tech geeks which Ill take care of them very amazingly the day they step in to the airport but for her I want to tell her that she wouldn't be able to resist my blow which will eventually be my first act in response to her breaching my space with those losers.

I think she should've answered my calls back then wouldn't have brought us here or called me back if she was concerned now its not just late but her absence made me dig into those lies and I came to enquire about information and fortunately got revelations more than i was looking for again its because of her own behavior.

41,mk75md,1617577596,Everyone has baggage - getting stuck in loops," M26.

TLDR: I would like to know how people deal with rebounds and relationships when everyone has emotional baggage from past relationships. Do you just let go of people when you know if they were in a relationship half a year ago or 5 months ago? Or you just take it ultra-slow? I personally have tried everything. Taking it slow, making it fast, having sex, not having sex, giving space, and been there as a support.

Long text:  
Girl 1- F28: 4 years ago I met a girl everything was great. But she was just out of a long relationship. I was native then so I mistook her actions for affection for me. I also pushed her a bit, went fast, and reacted like a kid (you learn things and do things) it ended.

Girl 2-F23: Next one was also like that, I didn’t push her gave space but this time she called me gay for not sleeping with her and taking it slow.

Girl 3- F25: Another girl, things clicked, we had the same humor. She said things like talk to me and I’ll talk to you back. Things that were missing from past experiences. After a month it felt like I was the only one doing the talking. It ended.

Girl 4- F23: Past month I meet another girl. In my short dating/flings, she is the best person I meet. We talked about dark stuff and the worst things that you can’t talk about to anyone to each other. A mature person for her age. Our problem-solving things matched. We discussed and solved things rather than ignoring them acting like nothing happened the next day, like in all past experiences. But it turns out she hadn’t dealt with her baggage with her ex. But while talking to her at first she mentioned that she had dealt with it. I agree you learn better as time progresses. Her ex and she are gonna meet and talk about things. IMO that guy is just pretending and acting changed since it’s like 5 months and that is less time to change from what he used to do. Things seem to turn to a dead-end for me or maybe they will talk it out and it will end for them. I am free and am not pushing her in any way.

But at this point it’s not my job to worry about them, I am thinking about myself and how I can get out of this loop. Is dating like this? Is been too kind and listening to other people a trait to attract broken people? If you had an experience with someone with emotional baggage (griefcase xD) how did you do it? I feel lost since I always try to learn from past mistakes but still end up in the same loop.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk75md/everyone_has_baggage_getting_stuck_in_loops/

51,mk7ril,1617579680,Dating: I've hit a fork in the road,"In your late teens and 20s dating is much easier because you're young, not as jaded and possibilities are endless. Your list of wants and needs from a partner are much smaller and you are more open to partners that you may give a hard no to later on. This is because we are still exploring and figuring out what we want in a partner, and so we give more people chances,  the benefit of the doubt, have more patience for them, and dismiss more red flags. Thus, the easy choice in your 20s is to keep on dating. Keep on putting yourself out there and letting the relationship completely fall apart, because there is a lesson to be learned from it all and help you have a better idea of what you will want down the line.

Now fast forward to your 30s. You now know what you want. You understand the difference between compatibility and chemistry and love and lust and the 5 important things you value in a relationship and want in a partner. But as I've touched on before, dating gets harder in your 30s (especially as a female) and online dating apps plus a year of Pandemic only makes this harder. So there is more to lose with each person you do decide to date. 

What results from this is the realization that you've hit a fork in the road. As someone in their 30s, do you continue to date and put yourself out there or completely cut off dating and give up on the idea of finding a long-term partner?

Sure,  the easy choice may be ""Just date! What do you have to lose?"", but oh, you have so much more to lose as someone dating in your 30s. The options are no longer endless and time is ticking. You are not getting any younger and many people within your age group have already settled down and have families of their own. You can no longer risk it all to date the wrong person, who is not on the same page as you or not compatible and just because date the sex is great. And if you spend a year dating that person who never wanted to commit, well you just lost a year of your life. It simply requires more mental toughness to continue dating in your 30s, because there will be a smaller pool of potential mates and more rejection than those younger. Having to keep getting your hopes up and being disappointed is mentally draining. And by the end of it, your energy may be completely depleted and you may feel even more jaded.

On the other side, if you completely cut off dating and finding a partner, you may feel more at ease, but empty as well. The headache of going through different potential matches may be gone, but it's instead replaced with this feeling of loneliness. The truth staring at you in the face that you will have no one to share your highs and lows with and that before you know it, you are 40 and then 50 and you can no longer get back the days of your 30s when dating was easier.

Do you continue to be hopeful but risk getting disappointed and exhausted from it all or do you give up hope of finding someone entirely but go through life feeling empty? Which one are you going to choose? Whatever you decide, make sure you choose wisely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk7ril/dating_ive_hit_a_fork_in_the_road/

53,mk7tth,1617579892,"I keep saying its the last chance, but I'm crying alone again","I (21F) am very in love with my partner (22M), but I'm starting to doubt if we are right for each other. I know we are young, and people keep telling me not to panic over the future or stress about our relationship, but its been 2 years and I'm not sure how happy I am anymore. 

I struggle to motivate myself to do certain things like working (uni) or cleaning the house, so I keep a fairly loose schedule of the day to keep myself on track. I don't expect him to follow it, but I do feel he needs to contribute. Not only does he rarely contribute with housework, he rarely does any of his own work. Spends his time on games or with his friends. He also has the mentality of a child. If he's hungry, he asks me for food. If he's hurt himself, he whines like a child about it, not that I can do anything. 

He will go out for hours with his friends, come home, see a million jobs that need doing and say ""ill do it later, my feet are sore from.being out"" and then spend the next 3 hours reminding me his feet are sore. 

He loves to interupt whatever I'm doing to ask me a random question, or ask me to do something, interrupt what I'm saying, talk over me, mansplain my own degree to me, frustrate me to the point where I feel like I'm going to explode, and then ask why I'm being moody and short with him. 

Don't get me wrong, I love him to pieces when he isn't doing this. We have a well established relationship and plans for the future, and it almost makes it harder. I know for a fact I would have left him if our lives weren't so tangled together, but at the moment a clean break would be impossible and sometimes I feel like I'm still here because its too much effort to separate. 

Whenever I voice these issues, he cries and tells me he'll do better and he loves me, without voicing any issues of his own. I know I'm not perfect and I'd rather he tell me, because it makes me feel horrible for saying anything. I very rarely talk to him about my problems for this reason. 

We have very few similar interests and he actively jokes and makes fun of things he knows I enjoy, so I tend to try and hide these things, to save the upset. He likes to make jokes about my hometown and family, even though he knows they upset me. 

Honestly I do love him, but I'm not sure I'm happy with him anymore. While I know it will hurt and it will be messy for a while, I don't think it would be better to drag it out for the sake of an easy life, and I dont want to give him another chance because nothing really changes. He isn't even really doing anything wrong, we are just different people with different goals in life.

I’m very desperate when it comes to dating. I have never even been on a date because every woman I’ve asked has said no. I don’t think a single girl I’ve known has been interested and in me more than platonically. I’ve been laughed at and called ugly multiple times by girls, and made a girl cry after asking her out so I’m pretty desperate at this point.

To avoid things like that from happening again I started using hinge bumble and tinder but those don’t work because I’m a fucking ugly idiot and I probably should’ve saw that coming. If I wasn’t ugly I wouldn’t have made women cry just by telling them I like them.

I don’t know where to build confidence with this. I don’t know how to unless I don’t get rejected and I doubt that’ll happen until I’m in my 30s and some single mom will finally settle for me after I get a good job.

I'm 23F and now that it's been a full year since I've graduated and held a stable job, I finally feel like I'm in a good place to meet people and go on dates. So basically, I'm inexperienced with the whole dating scene.

I've downloaded some dating apps like Hinge and OkCupid, and I get a few messages a day. Some are too sexually straightforward (which I promptly ignore), some are neutral, but some guys send some genuinely thoughtful and respectful messages. So my question is, how should I handle those? I know I'm not obligated to message back, but I understand how tough and confidence-breaking dating apps can be for men (I've lurked around this subreddit for a while). Would something like ""Thank you so much for the nice message. I really appreciate it, but I don't think we're a good fit for eachother. I wish you all the best in search of the right partner for you!"" be nice, or would guys just prefer to receive no response at all?

71,mka8rv,1617588242,How much should you cave to family demands when choosing a partner?,"I know this is totally subjective but looking for others who might have dealt with a similar situation.

I come from a pretty traditionalist immigrant family but now live on my own, across the country in likely the most secular city in the US. Because of our distance, it's very easy for me to put on a front when in town while actually living a more open-minded and modern life. When it comes to dating though, they've made it clear that there's an expectation to find someone that's Christian at the least but ideally our specific sect/ethnicity. This is something that I can't hide in any way considering how enmeshed our lives will become. I also love my family and would love to find a situation that resembles my upbringing around a large happy family, lots of ethnic food, and a shared sense of community and purpose.

Now that dating is starting to pick back up, I'm more seriously reflecting on my priorities and characteristics that I'm looking for in a partner. I've spent a lot of time dwelling on religion in particular, but am no longer making any progress. It would be amazing if I could find someone that's in the exact same shoes as me (I'm sure there are many) and are down to play the part around family; but I'm certainly limiting myself and the overlap between folks in that situation and the local philosophically minded, electronic music-loving, reader community is pretty slim... There's also a chance that willingness to put on this front is a sign of emotional and communicative immaturity, so I have progress to make myself, and finding a partner in the same place would not be the right long-term move.

We went for a two hour walk along the beach when we first met in person one Saturday afternoon and it went well. He was very easy to talk to and I could sense he was nervous. I wasn’t attracted to him right away as he dressed very casually so I felt like I could be myself. He was five months out of a seven year relationship. They were engaged and he postponed the wedding due to work commitments, which was a constant issue in their relationship apparently. They split up a few months later after a huge argument. Apparently, she is now dating a new guy. 

A couple hours after our first meeting, he asks me to dinner the next Saturday and makes a reservation at a pretty pricey restaurant, which was a mention in the Michelin guide in 2019 just to give you an idea. I forget that Friday is actually my birthday and I was supposed to spend it with my family but after some family drama, it is cancelled. I tell him what happens and he says he wants to take me out for my birthday on Friday instead. 

The restaurant he takes me to is a celebrity hotspot and we even sat next to two celebrities that evening. To top it all off, he got me a custom made cake with my favorite fruit in it. He really went out of his way to make me feel special and it was incredibly thoughtful. Plus, he got dressed up in a suit and at one point during the evening, I felt the urge to jump on top of him! I was very attracted to him during our dinner date. He made me feel so nervous and boy, was I awkward and shy.

He’s pretty well off but I can just tell he’s a decent guy and extremely respectful. The next morning, he texts me asking if I got home ok and that he had a great time with me. 

I really like this guy. I don’t have much experience in dating, I’ve only been in two long term relationships and I met them in college.

I’m 23 and met a 35 year old guy from Australia on a dating app. We met and had dinner and really hit it off. I’ve dated guys with significant age gaps before but that didn’t really matter to me. After the first date we started seeing each other consistently and texting all day every day. I could tell he was developing feelings for me, and I had my reservations but I was too. 

The day of our first date, he told me a pipe burst in his bathroom and flooded is apartment (that’s NYC for you). Now that was true, but he told me because of that he was going to stay at a friend’s place. He also mentioned he wanted kids in the future, and made it clear he wanted them with me. We joked about it, which I was fine with. No guy had ever been that forward with about expressing them seeing a future with me. 

Today in what I thought was innocent conversation we got on the topic of kids. I asked him when he would want kids... and that’s when he revealed to me he already HAS a son... who is 10 years old. Him being from Australia is important because that’s where is son lives. He came to the U.S. a while back but he’s told me he had no intentions on going back. 

I asked him to tell me the real reason why we couldn’t go to his apartment, and he said it’s because his ex girlfriend lives there and he recently moved out, right before we began dating. He still pays his half of the rent as to not stick her with the full amount... and they don’t get along and have been broken up for months. 

I don’t know what to do, I do like spending time with him but I expressed we couldn’t have a long term relationship because frankly... this sh*t is crazy lol.

81,mkarum,1617590080,This boy SUS... or am I overthinking??,"**Background info:** Okay, so this guy I knew from high school basically asked me for my availability so that we can grab something to eat. Prior to this, we didn't really talk - like he would sort of tease me when we were in the same classes together (e.g. if I was on my phone, he would be teasing me about me dating someone etc.). That was our only interaction. He confessed that he thought I was pretty for a while, and I didn't ask further at the time because he was dating someone. 

**Present day:** I recently posted on my story, and he replied to it and we had small talk. He asked for my availability so that we can schedule a day to find a place to eat.  I told him I was shocked he asked me to go eat, and then he said ""haha come on I called you pretty a while back"". 

I also told him to text my number to go over the details, but he said he didn't have it. FYI: We had multiple classes together, and I gave him my number when we were in group projects, and he had it saved back then. I asked him, and he said ""Nopee. Orr I didn't save it HAHA"". 

I don't even know what any of this is supposed to mean lol. Does he actually like me or is he just lonely? And what does it mean when a guy doesn't save your number, but he calls you pretty? I'm so confused. Red flags or am I overthinking. 

**Another question:** When I ask guys (who are interested in me) what they like about me, they always just say it's because I'm pretty or talk about my body. Like do they not like anything else? 

***TLDR:*** A guy I knew previously had my number saved, but now he says he doesn't have it/ didn't save it when I told him to text me to schedule a date to go eat.

82,mkat0m,1617590200,I sort of don't want the pandemic to end because at least it was a valid excuse to not dwell on dating and having to explain why I'm single,"I'll say it: There's a lot about the pandemic that has sucked, but at the same time, there are parts of it that have lessened the burden in life, and one of those areas is how it basically gave everyone a perfect excuse to take a year off from dating, and for anyone who was single even before the pandemic started and felt like they were missing out on something, you no longer were. Even if you still used dating apps during the pandemic just in case, getting ghosted on in a conversation wasn't as big of a deal because trying to meet anyone was probably going to be difficult anyway. 

Now that vaccinations are rolling out, though, and it's going to be safe for vaccinated people to date more safely, the excuse isn't going to be there anymore. When someone asks you why you haven't dated, you won't be able to say, ""Because there was a global pandemic and I felt like it was pointless trying to date during that time."" People are going to start dating again, which is going to stir up some FOMO, and when I start trying again, too, I'm probably going to find myself dealing with the same frustrations with dating b.s. that existed before everything was brought to a halt. 

Irony is how when this all started, I was so mad about how the pandemic ruined dating for the time being, and now here I am realizing it was a blessing in disguise.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mkat0m/i_sort_of_dont_want_the_pandemic_to_end_because/

90,mkbq5i,1617593585,How do you accept that dating in your 20s is simply not in the cards for you?,"22M going on 23 this year. I follow the advice of this sub as much as I can FOR MY OWN SAKE. Therapy, medication, exercise, running, sunlight, stretching, meditation, hobbies. 

I have no dating experience and would like to change that because intimacy and companionship with someone that shares a deep, mutual connection and attraction with me seem like something worth trying for. I am told that I have to have reasonable expectations in dating. These expectations include the fact that I'm one of the men who have to improve themselves in their 20s in ALL aspects to have a chance at dating in their 30s. 

I get WHY I have to accept this; I'm stunted in aspects of life in ways that women will find unattractive. Lack of physical strength, I still live with my mom, etc. It's a path that takes longer for men like me and shorter for successful men.

I do not know HOW to accept that dating in my 20s is an impossibility for me. I can't HELP but feel envious of the guys that have the privilege of being supported and loved by a significant other. Regardless of the other issues they possess, they have the advantage of having a best, BEST friend to assist them and be there for them, in cases where the relationship is sound. Guys tell me to come to terms with the notion that the decade I'm currently in will be void of this experience, but a decade is a really long time. I wish someone can tell me it's valid to feel down that I'm expected to remain single in a decade in which many other men feel love beyond what they can imagine. Being a perpetually single man is not what I aspire to be. 

The other concern is that by the time that I improve myself, it'll be too late. I say that I want to improve myself and better myself, but I can see how to women, my improvements will be perceived as ""The absolute bare minimum,"" and that my qualities outside what I've worked for will disqualify me from consideration. It'll feel amazing when I own a home, have a full-time career, and be a realized person as the rewards of working hard in my 20s, but I'm afraid that women will see that and be like, ""What else? Why should I pay you any mind when other guys outperformed you in most life milestones and have social proof of prior women being attracted to them?""

Also, being an inexperienced virgin at age 30 likely lowers my attractiveness quite a bit. A lot of women don't wish to be teachers at that age and that's their valid preference. I think I'm a good human being, just not one that is good at life enough to form a relationship compared to my peers. 

With that being said, I'd like to ask how I can accept that dating in my 20s is something I may only experience secondhand via movies or imagination? When I reach age 30, will my hard work and self-dedication be enough for women to overlook my inexperience?

There are pics of me on my profile if, for any reason, it helps you to form your response to me. Thanks in advance.

We hiked and then watched a movie and after I thought she was gonna get up and leave but she just laid down next to me and we ended up cuddling for like an hour. I asked if she wanted to spend the night, prefacing it by saying if you’re not comfortable yet, just let me know. And she said not that night because she wouldn’t be able to shower and didn’t have a change of clothes (since we hiked she was probably sweaty lol). But after that she did say she would want to spend the night. So we are gonna hang this week again, and I want to ask in advance this time if she’s down to spend the night, so that she can bring whatever she needs to bring, how do I phrase it? And is it even a good idea to ask about spending the night this time? When we were cuddling she said again that she didn’t want to leave..

98,mkciyl,1617596633,Practical guide to find a partner,"There are those who believe that love should not be sought, that it simply passes, finds you, flows ... This is the case in some cases and, above all, in some age groups. We could say that this way of ""crossing"" with love is more valid during adolescence than in other moments of adult life. Difficulties begin as our peers establish stable relationships as a couple and as we incorporate responsibilities into our lives.

Finding a partner, therefore, is not, in most cases, a matter of chance, but the result of a series of predispositions and changes that must be made and that we have tried to collect in this article.

If you want a partner, look for her!

The first step would be to acknowledge this obviousness. As in any change, we must make a decision and focus our energy towards what we want.

Open possibilities

You can find a partner anywhere and at any time. It is not about joining the gym and believing that this is where the couple will be found, or registering on an Internet page to find a partner and waiting for love to reach us exclusively through this means. So, now you know: socialize as much as possible and sign up for www citasaciegas net if you want us to help you...

Stop negative thinking

Forbid yourself phrases like: ""I am not made for love"", ""I will never find a partner"", ""All men are equal"", .. We are what we think!

Pamper yourself, take care of yourself, love yourself

When a person is good about himself, his power of attraction multiplies. Take care of your image, get ready, play sports, leave home ...

Control the language you apply to yourself

Your self-esteem goes higher or lower depending on how you talk to yourself. Don't throw dirt on yourself! It puts an end to phrases such as: ""I am very shy"", ""I don't know what to say"", ""I think my things are not interesting"", ...

Emphasize your strengths

We all have skills, knowledge or concerns that differentiate us from others and that, if we develop, make us feel better about ourselves. Let others know about them.

The past is past

You can't start a relationship if you have a past relationship too much in mind. Try not to fall into monologues about a previous partner when you are meeting someone.

Show yourself as you are

Show yourself as you are but according to your best version ..! You like what you like, you are as old as you are, you know what you can do ... But you may want to know new things, change habits, be flexible ...

Visualize the person you want by your side

It is not about creating a ""prince charming"" but about marking us a ""must have"". For example, if it is very important for you to go to the mountains to go hiking, find someone who also likes it. If you need a certain stability to feel calm, look for someone who can offer it ...

No to teenage ""tics""

Looking for a much younger partner, who has not been married or who does not have children after a certain age is not recommended. Apart from the fact that you have many options to meet wonderful people, you can project little maturity and / or a certain fear of commitment.

99,mkcn2x,1617597079,Don't blame women,"I (25 M) recently realised that in many posts where men are complaining about their dating lives, they mostly blame it on women, saying that all women love 6'3 big buff dudes, all women are attracted to affluents, women are so picky, they only look at hot and attractive boys. Well guess what, we all love to be with someone attractive, affluent, smart..., that's why you as a man prefer a sexy, smart, attractive woman.
I guess what i am trying to say is, don't blame your failures in dating and getting your self rejected on a whole human gender. Cause i am man and when i get rejected i blame it on my self. So better work on your self, and by the way getting a woman shouldn't be hub of your life and focus, women will follow eventually if you are on your own journey to improve your self.
