We've been friends a while, but have never, until now, been single at the same time. We hit it off immediately, and everything was just fireworks. About a month in, we were out on a date, and she got shitty drunk, and then got really shitty with me. It really stung, but all I could do was make sure she got home safe, and discuss things in the morning. She said she didn't remember much of the night and that she was ashamed, and I expressed that I'd be willing to forgive her if we talked about it and she helped me understand exactly what was going on with her.

I gave her a few days and reached out. She told me she thought she was ready for a relationship, but that she saw some old habits resurfacing that night, and that she couldn't both be in a relationship and do the work on herself that she needed. I offered to support her if I could, but she expressed she needed to do the work. She doesn't want anyone fixing her. I told her I understood, and I forgave her. I can't possibly be upset at someone for where they are in life. I was straight forward and asked if she'd be interested in me checking back in with her down the road, and she told me she was open to hearing from me in a month or so.

8,rw2mlh,1641324820,Close friend of 5 years kissed me while boyfriend is away in the army.,"I hung out with two of my best friends tonight. They are both 21M and I’m 19F.  We all have been friends for 5 years. However, one is an ex boyfriend (I’ll explain). We like to laugh about it and call it dating lite because we never kissed or really held hands. We dated for 2 months when I was 14 and he was 16. After that we just decided to be friends although we both at the time said we loved each other. Since then we both dated other people. I recently got out of a three year long relationship (as of a year ago) and he has not been in a relationship for three years. However, as of a month ago I’ve been talking with this guy I grew up with, I’ve known him since I was 6 years old. He was my neighbor and friend growing up and we both have always had a crush on each other. The only downside is he’s in the army and so where he is stationed, he’s a couple hours ahead. We both decided yesterday that we were exclusive and I was so excited. We decided to call it that so then we could take this week to see if we could do long distance since it is a huge commitment especially with him in the army and me at college. It’s only been day one and I feel like everything is messed up. 

So here is what happened. I’m hanging out with my friends and it’s about 10pm. We all decide we need to go home because we all sat in my car and caught out since we closed down the restaurant we were in. We all say our goodbyes and my ex says “I have something for you”. This is very out of character for him but I’m like okay. We go back to sit in my car since it is freezing and he gave me all of his Twilight books he has since I haven’t been able to find a copy and he had them for some reason and I’ve always teased him about it. We talk for a bit about our up coming semester. He then grabs my hand a bit hard and rushed in and kissed me (like a peck type). I lurched back immediately and said I need to leave. He then said “that never happened okay?”.

I don’t know what to do. I’m obviously going to have to tell the guy in the army but I have no clue how. I’ve never been in this situation. I’ve never cheated on someone and I felt like this was cheating even though I didn’t kiss back and the kiss was god awful. What do I do? How do I go about it? I really like the army guy.

To add: I have no feelings for my ex boyfriend at all. I feel really weird now because I feel like he’s broken some of my trust.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rw2mlh/close_friend_of_5_years_kissed_me_while_boyfriend/

I recently just started dating a girl who is 20 and still in uni. We’ve been on 4 dates so far. 

For our next date she asked if she could spend the night at my place and just hang out so that’s what we have planned. I’m gonna be picking her up as she lives in a shared apartment with her friends.

I currently have my car all cleaned up, all my rooms and bathrooms cleaned up, bed and couch all tidied up and everything overall clean. Also bought some candles that my mom used to buy from bed and baths and some room fresheners just in case to make sure the place smells nice.

Not sure how to dress like in casual or semi-casual clothes. We’re mainly just going to stay inside, she’s bring some food over to cook, and we’ll just watch some movies and play games together.

Backstory, we dated for some time until I had to leave for work in other state and that was that, decided it was best to split up for the time being. Now we talk everyday for hours. Anyway, to get to the point, she gets pissed when I ask dumb questions. Ofc she does not always react to it the same way, surely it depends on her mood, which is why I am wondering is she angry because of something else so she is taking it out on me. In her credit, I should know the answer to these questions because it is really logical, i.e today she went to work and to coffee with her sister, then came home and told me she forgot her charger. I asked where, she got pissed because I ""knew"" ( tbh I really should have known, its logical ) she left it at work. According to her, I do this all the time, ask such stupid questions that I know answer to. Makes me wonder, am I dumb, forgetfull, or just too busy so I literally just respond without thinking because I don't care, which I DO sometimes. I do care about her, seeing her pissed makes me sad, so am I being an asshole for asking dumb questions?

19,rw38pz,1641326435,Most dating advice is unhelpful because it’s gendered,"The below makes a good partner (based on studies of risk factors for divorce and what makes a partner less likely to be abusive)

Consistency, availability, reliability, responsiveness, predictability, flexibility, agreeability, naturally giving, and easygoing.

Whether you are gay, straight, asexual, male or female….being a good partner is actually pretty standard. 

Telling women to make men chase scares away the good guys and specifically attracts men who don’t respect boundaries.

Telling men to chase teaches them that women are a prize to be won which devalues both parties right off the bat. 

The best thing we can do is try to be a friend to our partner, if you can do that you’re a good partner. All I had to do was refuse to chase women and start meeting more women until I liked one who also liked me enough to put in effort back and 100% of my previously unbearably insecurities are gone. I no longer get jealous, feelings of inadequacy, feel neglected, feel pathetic, worry that my partner doesn’t care….it just doesn’t happen anymore. My fear of commitment is gone completely and it is 100% because I refuse to be the only person putting effort in even if it’s just the very beginning “getting to know you process”.

The results? I’m dating the first woman in my life that actually makes me feel good about being in a relationship and doesn’t make me want to break free and be single again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rw38pz/most_dating_advice_is_unhelpful_because_its/

21,rw3a0u,1641326528,Getting back into dating after having my heart broken for the first time...,"Ok so long story short... 2020 sucked, I think we can all agree. But to add to the mix, I (27 F) also had my first real heartbreak during that year. I met a guy that I fell head over heels for. It was great at first, but I guess I didn't notice how toxic and mentally abusive he was until it ended nine months later. He showed up on my doorstep with my stuff, sat me down, and told me that it wasn't going to work, and that he'd tried to fall in love with me but never would. I get it, sometimes love doesn't happen, but the way he treated me throughout that nine months left me feeling unwanted and deflated, if I'm being honest. It was a good learning moment for me in terms of relationships, and I took a year and a half off to better myself.

Here's where my problem really starts. I've been seeing this guy and it's progressed to the fourth date. Not super crazy, I know, it's only date number four, but I like him and I really think he likes me. When he dropped me off after date 3, he tried to initiate more but I let him know that I don't really swing that way so soon. He was respectful of it, and asked me on date 4... which he is now suggesting we have at my place, just something lowkey with takeout. I feel like an idiot, but I'm kinda freaking out. I don't know if I'm ready to let my guard down for another person. If I'm being honest, deep down I'm still really crushed by the way my ex treated me and the rejection of my first love. I've been on dating apps for months and have been numb to it all. This guy I've been seeing has managed to slip past that defense. I'm worried that he'll want more than I can give tomorrow, that I'll make a fool of myself, or make the same mistake I did in 2020 and get stuck with another broken heart. I know this may sound panicky or rambling, but this man just texted me about the date tomorrow and I had a minor internal ""oh shit"" moment at my desk at work.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read this.

28,rw48vw,1641329095,Unsolicited sexts to strangers are a form of sexual harassment and one of the worst byproduct of online dating culture.,"I don't use Tinder. But this is a fairly typical online dating story for me these days:

I match with guy on the dating app that I use. Guy messages me. He sounds nice. We start talking about our families, hobbies, interests, any people we know in common - normal topics. It turns out we have a lot in common. A quality conversation develops and continues. We are both excited.

A few days later, one evening he texts me that he is in bed and he would like to do x y z to me. I am in the middle of doing dishes or hanging out with my friends or whatever when it arrives, so I'm not in an already aroused state, unlike him. Also, even in an aroused state, doing x does nothing to me, doing y is something I find more ridiculous than sexy, and someone tried doing z to me in the past and it was unpleasant. And again, while he sounds like a nice guy, we still haven't met and I have no idea if he even looks like his pictures IRL - and he doesn't know this about me either. To me, this is just gross and sounds totally disingenuine, as well as inconsiderate of him.

I say something about not being into sexting. He is disappointed. I go on to reassure him that he looks attractive on his pictures and I'm sure he is an amazing lover, and it's not about him. At this point, he either 
a., gets mad, accuses me of not liking sex and I drop him like a hot potato; or 
b., if he reacts normally and says sorry then the following happens:

I try to get his awkward sexts out of my head and I hope we can go back to the normal progression of this new relationship. Maybe we go back to a normal convo briefly, but after like 5 minutes he is again saying that he wants to put his finger in my butt. 
At this point, I know that I landed in the ""sexting buddy zone"" and there is no way out. Meeting up in person at this point is pretty much off the table, because I guess it would be awkward for him to meet and face in real life the person to whom he wrote all those weird things, and go roller-skating and eating ice cream and whatnot. He never asks me out, doesn't even initiate a hookup or any kind of IRL sex, despite me hinting that I would much prefer one or both of those things to just texting. Communication between us shrinks to him sending me a new yet very repetitive unsolicited sext every few weeks or so, despite me never reacting. I finally get fed up and block him.

The big drawback of sexting is that you cannot see the other person's nonverbal cues so you cannot tailor your reactions appropriately. During IRL sex, this is something that happens naturally (unless if you are a rapist).

I am convinced that these guys are relatively decent people IRL and it's the online medium that brings out this behaviour in them and they simply forget that they are talking to a person.

I think before sending an unsolicited sext, a man should consider how he would feel if a woman he had never been even on one date with started texting him about the colour scheme she wants for her wedding to him, the names of all 6 of her future children from him and how they want to be a stay at home mum in the suburbs (while he works his ass off). Any normal, sane man would run for the hills from something like this. Receiving an unsolicited sext from a man doesn't feel that different from this.

35,rw5avk,1641331854,Is it just a harsh reality most people look for other people within their race?,"When I was younger, I always thought Gen Z is somewhat colorblind and progressive when it comes to dating. But as a 21 year old biracial male (black/white) living in a country that’s predominantly white (the Netherlands) I’m starting to attribute my lack of succes in dating to how I physically look.

I don’t think I’m ugly; I’d say I’m just an average looking dude. But my friends who happen to be white, are also average looking and when out or about, they get approached pretty often while I stand by pretty awkwardly like an NPC.

On dating apps, it’s the same story. I get good pictures taken, solid bio. But I end up with zero to 3 likes, barely any matches and after a week or so nothing at all anymore.

For my friends, well, likes and matches of course aren’t an issue in the slightest.

Being a POC isn’t so bad in the capital cities but I’m starting to feel out of place like a sore thumb in my village and small cities surrounding it. My lack of intimacy is having me down greatly, seeing others my age in happy fulfilling relationships leaves me feeling bitter. I’m invisible.

Should I consider migrating to another western country like the US? Work isn’t a problem, I study IT so getting a job when I’m finished studying should be no trouble.

Pre Covid we went on two dates, he was so sweet during them he paid and was a complete gentleman. He then moved to another state and invited me to see him multiple times. But due to Covid, I didn’t feel comfortable. Even when he came back home, he would ask to hangout, and I would still say no because of Covid. Now it’s been a year later, and he still reaches out to me. All the times I said no, he was super understanding about it. He’s invited me to thanksgiving, to meet his friend and family, and to his family members service. He told me he would treat me well.  Last year he admitted to saying he likes me. And I told him I liked him back. 

Today he invited me to see him again. This time I asked him what what he is looking for and what he thought about me. He didn’t say anything about me but said that until he finds the right one, he’ll be looking for a relationship. I told him I am looking for a relationship and enjoy talking with him.

We were into a lot of the same things, worked in the same field. Then she asked me if I could drive. I told her I had a moped but not a car and that I was planning on getting my licence this year. She then dived in and started asking loads of questions about why I don't have a licence and how I live my life like 'why didn't you learn when you were 17?' and 'how do you get to places?' I explained that it wasn't by choice, life had just worked out a little funny for me after school so I went to university, came home and got a job and saved up for driving lessons and then covid happened (apparently a worldwide pandemic isn't a good enough excuse). She also annoyed me by essentially laughing at me that I drive a moped. It gets me from A to B and is cheap so I'm perfectly happy with it. She told me she lives in the middle of nowhere so I need to be able to drive to come and pick her up for our date (which I hadn't even yet asked her on). It seemed me picking her up was the only way this date was going to happen. When I asked her if me being able to drive was a dealbreaker, she said yes. Eventually she relented and said that she would drive for this date but that I HAD to get to her (about 30 miles away from where I live), no possibility of her coming here or meeting somewhere in the middle. She made me feel like quite a loser and added that I needed to make learning to drive a priority because she didn't want to wait to meet me. Then she started asking when I was going to come down for this date telling me she'd like to go this weekend (which I still hadn't asked her on).

Is driving really that important? I get that it might be a bit unusual for a 24 year old not to drive and that quite often dates do pick each other up and take them home again and that men are meant to be chivalrous and plan the whole date and pay. But is it really not possible for a date to go ahead if the man cannot drive? I'm completely clueless with this. I've only been on one date in my life when I was 18. Was she right in saying that I HAD to go to her for the date?

I (f,24) have recently broken up with my ex (m,32) of 4 years. We were engaged but our relationship were very toxic in the end and we broke up. 

Coincidentally I have ran into the person who was his classmate in uni (they are acquaintances with my ex, but nothing near being friends . My ex actually doesn’t like the guy so much ) , we started a conversation and when he found out I was single, we went out on a date(I liked the guy as a person before but never romantically because I didn’t look at any guys this way). So far we had a lot in common, pretty good chemistry and ended up sleeping and then talking a lot after, hanging out. It’s definitely going towards a relationship vibe, especially from the guy, he’s really treating me nicely. I would even say he’s being very romantic,
More than me . I genuinely like him too but sometimes moments with him remind me of my ex and I feel extremely guilty and sad. I don’t know why.  

Technically they were never friends and I truly logically don’t see a problem but maybe it’s just me grieving my previous breakup? It’s just that with a new guy we are sharing some intimate moments (sex, spending time together almost as a couple) that it’s hard to imagine I’m actually doing it with a new man … and the fact that this new man is related to my ex, even slightly adds up.

I always feel like i’m a waste of time of the person i’m talking with. Especially when i talk to girls.

I keep on working on myself… I regularly go to the gym, train a lot and study. I don’t have lots of friends at all… so i don go out during evenings. I used to have a friend but he was popular and never had trouble with girls. Our friendship faded due to his new gf ( about 1 year ago… ). I’m ok with that, i know it can happen. 

This friend caused me lots of insecurities, and i eventually deleted instagram. I feel way better rn regarding that aspect, but ofc my chances to meet new people or new girls decreased. 

I tried to meet people through courses, but they were all in their mid 20s with their lives and so on. Girls too.

Tried therapy for 1 year, didn’t work. 
I’ll have another meeting with my psychiatrist. I really hope she’ll give me drugs. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in these weeks.

It’s just that i hate myself. I like myself only when i lift. Walking on the streets and seeing couples around makes me feel very bad about myself, cause i can’t imagine myself holding a girl’s hand, or simply being on a date.

Something that I find constantly amusing is how anxious/insecure many hetero women seem to be about making sure guys are taller than them, or tall in general. 

It’s pretty bizarre to me, both from the point of view of my sexuality and gender, and the fact that I’m just under 5’10”- bang in the middle, height wise, so I’ve dated people of all genders who have been both taller and shorter than me, and never really thought about it.

But I was wondering- what are straight guys putting on their dating profiles? Are they fetishising really short girls? Do straight women only seem so obsessed with male height because they feel guys are going to reject them if they’re too tall? What is the most desirable height difference between two straight people?!

It’s clearly a minefield- thankfully not one I have to worry about, but I need the hetero lowdown just out of morbid curiosity.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rw963j/on_dating_apps_do_straight_guys_love_short_girls/

Some background: I am a 22-year-old virgin man. I come from an abusive background where I have consistently been taken advantage of. Because of this, I suffer with some mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. I have had to visit the hospital before, but I go to therapy, and I take medication. I feel pretty stable at this point. I am currently a sophomore in college but have no real home to call my own because I cut ties with my parents. I usually live out of state with my great aunt over breaks (I have few alternatives) so that also makes getting a relationship difficult. I have several friends, but no one I feel comfortable fully confiding in (apart from one online friend).

I have precious little experience with women, but what experience I do have is not that great. I have tried dating apps, but that has almost always ended with me being ghosted (I barely get any matches to begin with). I have been introduced to a girl by a friend, but that didn't end well either and I was just strung along. I have even stepped outside of my comfort zone before: I've attempted a cold approach before (bad idea) and even acted on trying to start a relationship with a little crush I had (she stopped talking to me). I cuddled with a couple different girls, but the experience wasn't special to them in the slightest, and it crushed me.

I honestly have no idea where to turn. I think having a girlfriend would be awesome and maybe even help me out in some ways. It would be nice to be held and feel loved, you know? I want someone I can feel safe with. But I have had no luck, and I feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness day after day. I've lived a dark and pretty hopeless life. I want someone to share my life with now, instead of walking alone. I understand getting a girlfriend won't magically solve all my problems; hopefully I am not giving off that impression. And I understand that relationships are a two-way street, and I would also be there for her.

In short, I feel like I have exhausted all of my avenues to getting a good healthy relationship. I don't know what else to do. I am tired of waiting around and listening to the same old advice that, ""You'll find someone when you stop looking for them.""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rw9ebi/i_dont_know_where_to_turn_or_how_to_proceed/

The date is great, we both have fun, half the time he suggests we hang out again and then the communication drops off and I don't hear from them again. 

I can't figure out why this keeps happening and I feel like there is something wrong with me. In May, I will have been single for three years. 

My personal hygiene is good, I always dress nicely, I'm an event host so I can definitely hold my end of the conversation and I am great at making eye contact. I have a lot of friends and I don't think I'm socially awkward at all. I'm super easy going with date spots and I'm happy to plan them or go to a place my date has suggested. Is there something I could be doing differently or better? 

I went on a date with a guy in early December, it went well, he suggested a second date after he returned from his holiday travels. We were supposed to go to a venue tonight that is temporarily closed due to Covid. When he contacted me to let me know he just said ""I'll have to take you when they open again."" No mention of meeting anywhere else tonight and no actual plans so I am going to assume he's lost interest as well. 

I get my hopes up every time I have a date and get so disappointed once they lose interest, this has happened almost a dozen times now. I'm supposed to go on another first date Sunday but am now considering cancelling because I am 99% sure I know the outcome. I know I should stay positive but I can't keep meeting a guy then having him lose interest at the rate it's currently happening. It's starting to become difficult emotionally.

I (F27) met a guy (M30) on Tinder, we said we weren't really looking fro anything specifically, however if the right person came along we'd be open to the idea of a relationship.

We started chatting and soon moved to sexting. We sexted for about a week before we caught up at his place. We basically made out and dry humped. He said he likes to take sex slow.

We caught up again and did the same thing before he went away for a month.

We've been sexting whilst he's away. 

I can't tell if he's interested in me as a person or as FWB, and if it's FWB, why there isn't any sex.

He planned on making us dinner and even was making me a gift using the hobby that he does. I told him I would return the favor and would make him a gift as well. He’s been really sweet and texting me with hearts which he hasn’t done since we were dating. I’ve been doing it back. He even said he wants me to meet his family to do a certain activity with them(which I didn’t meet them before when we were dating). 

Today he sent me a selfie and I complimented him, and then went cold on me after that.

82,rwa4x2,1641345298,Friends with Benefits with ex.,"Hi

A few years ago my ex gf dumped me. It was a long distance relationship and we disagreed on wanting a family but otherwise it was mostly perfect. 
I very quickly started dating as I was completely devastated and looking for a replacement. Stupid of course in hindsight . I pleaded with my ex to change her mind but she was resolute. I mentioned we could be fwb whilst seeing others but at the time she wasn't sure and said if we do I'd need to stop once I start seeing someone. I told my ex I was back on dating sites

Fast forward a few weeks I went on a date it went well and I had a second planned . My ex out the blue wanted to meet as a friend to which I agreed. We went to the beach and fooled around. She pretty much acted as she had done whilst we were together. 
The following week she stayed a few nights and we had sex. She just happened to be on holiday near where I lived. I assumed it was a final goodbye. She told me she hoped I would find a nice girl .
The following week I had my second date and she stayed the night. We didn't have sex but she went to kiss me and I didn't stop her. A few days later my ex asked about the dates and I told her about the kiss. She went mad saying 'you don't know what you've just lost 'and said I part cheated. She then blocked me. I was really upset but I thought I hadn't done much wrong as I was single and I thought because my ex knew I was dating she might expect it. I didnt think of myself as seeing this person at this stage. Being with my ex ws torture and I felt like I needed to know there was someone else.
Anyway I saw the other girl again thinking things were definitely fully over with my ex including the fwb. Still no sex but she stayed over again. I managed to contact my ex via Facebook and she asked if I saw the girl again. I lied and said no because I told her previously how much i loved my ex which was true. I told her I'd told the girl about my ex and didn't want to see her again. I did this but not at the time of the phone call as I wasn't sure if my ex was coming back or not and selfishly didn't want to lose the other girl in case.

My ex came to visit me after that as a final goodbye. We had sex again. She asked if the girl slept in my bed and I lied and said no because I wasn't sure she'd believe we didn't have sex and I couldn't face upsetting her again. A day before she was due to leave she said she would see me again and we ended up back together before splitting again a year later because we couldn't close the distance

I have a slight tendency to talk about history more than average (history teacher) but I make a concious effort not to over indulge in that habit.

Basically I'm a quiet and introverted sort of guy, which really seems to be a death sentence when trying to make a connection. I get ""didn't feel a spark"" or ""seem like a kind person just not for me"" often. 

I do get frequent feedback from my students that I am one of their favorite teachers ever because I'm very non judgemental and supportive. That just doesn't seem to carry over very well when it comes to dating.

Anyway its been a month and ive found someone new who actually treats me right and it feels more real than anything i have felt at such an early stage. We were both cheated on in our past relationships and have trust issues but for some reason we completely trust eachother. He is 1000x a better man than my ex. So the problem here is...My ex is his boss. My ex hasnt stopped texting me. He always reaches out to hangout or just ask me if ive found someone new or literally any kind of information he can get out of me. Its gotten so bad that he is texting my sisters boyfriend just to ask what im doing and if im with someone, and my sisters boyfriend also works for him as well. My ex also had an issue with my new man before we brokeup. We got into an argument over him and he had a dream that we were going to date if we ever brokeup. Guess that one came true.  My ex wants to get coffee in 2 days and i know he is going to ask me literally every question he can to get information and i dont know if i should straight up tell him im dating one of his employees or just lie until more time has passed. im worried that once he knows, he is going to fire him for being with me and maybe even fire my sisters boyfriend for lying that he didnt know anything. I dont want to be responsible for people getting fired...but my ex acts out of anger and makes poor decsions when he is angry so it is highly likely that there will be some kind of backlash from him.  what should i do? any advice helps",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwaq9y/my_ex_is_my_new_boyfriends_boss_and_i_dont_know/

2 month ago I go out with this girl off tinder we vibe. Before our second date we had a few phone calls where we talked about relationships and a bunch of stuff and what she's looking for. 2nd date we go on we hangout in my car as I drop her off I ask her for a kiss, she saids no and saids she wants to be friends because I'm a good vibe. I then made sure I clarified because I can be really straight forward that she was neither looking for a relationship or a friends with benefits/hookup.

Skip to 2 days ago where I moved to my new place and were still talking, were vibing on my bed and watching Netflix. I wanna clarify i made 0 moves on her, and was so uninterested i was in my pajamas didn't even dress up nice lol. At some point I look at her and say whats up (she made a weird noise like she's nervous) then she saids she wants to kiss me this was like an hour and half into hanging out. I ask her what changed before kissing her because I'm curious why she denied me before she saids she was feeling it tonight. We start with a kiss then cuddles then making out right into sex. Which was okay I wasn't really feeling it, idk why even though it was my first time having sex (virgin). I busted a nut in like 30 seconds in and kinda just stopped at that point which I assume was not the best experience for her but pre nut she seemed like she was having a good time lol. We also messed around for 30 mins pre sex (making out, touching). Over all wasn't feeling it myself but went through with it anyways.

After that she saids this never happened which I was like yeah it did lol, at this point I'm pretty blunt and meme around since I don't really care that much. My attitude was like that the whole night since im not really trying to impress anyone, were just friends or so i thought. I'm confused wdf is going on in her head. I'm not exacly crazy about her not like when I first met her, but what should I be expecting now after she said this never happened lol

I should also point out were freakishly similar in some things, which she pointed out as well and I was okay with us just being friends when she denied me that night two months ago then she hooks up with me.

Any advice is appreciated and let me know if I can clarify on anything!

I do not see her moving out of her house in the near future. Would seeing this bother you if you want a serious life down the road with her? Im curious.

TL;DR: I told my girlfriend that it troubles me that she lacks independence because of her upbringing and now her family is mad at me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwbgtu/i_told_my_30_year_old_girlfriend_i_have_concerns/
