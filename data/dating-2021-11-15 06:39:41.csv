Recently I found out that at the time when we were getting closer she was in a casual affair with a married man, they stopped talking later and she was 100% loyal since we got together, but I still can't get over the fact that she 1 lied, 2 had an affair with a married guy, 3 didn't open up about it when we decided to get serious
I feel betrayed and even though we live together I can't be close to her anymore without thinking about the past
Am I making a big deal out of this? Should I just forget it and move on? And how?

9 times out of 10 I'd say that this is a lost cause, but I reached out to her again last week, just to see what type of response I'd get. She was very nice and replied with questions, but she took a day to respond to me.... I assumed that this meant that she has lost interest and even though, I responded.  


She replied again another day later, with about three paragraphs, with emojis and questions (so not as cold as I would expect from someone that takes a day to respond). I was sitting with my female cousin and her friends at the time and they were all unanimous in thinking that she's keen. But I know a lot of dudes will take personal offence and say if she's taking that long to reply, she's just not interested. It would be good to know some of reddits sisterhood's thoughts on this.

6,qugac1,1636982411,Cancelled our date a few hours ahead - what‚Äôs the proper course of action?,"Been dating this guy for the past two/three weeks - we went on three dates and they all went well.

Now we both went on holidays and when we came back we had a cinema scheduled, that got cancelled because he was too tired/ busy with work that he had to catch up on.

After that, I invited him over for food, then drinks &amp; cinema. He agreed on Sunday, and we organised it over a few days.

Saturday came, he went out and called me the next morning to iron out a few details. He apologised as we had to postpone until later evening, we cancelled the meal at mine and settled for cinema/drinks. I think he wanted to get a few things done (work related) before the date, which I understood bc he has a tedious job and had a presentation.

He also apologised for going out the night before knowing we had something planned, and I didn‚Äôt get why at first bc he can‚Äôt plan his whole week end around 1 event.

I thanked him for making the time bla-bla-bla. We agreed on a time, location and programme.

A couple hours later, he texts me saying that he‚Äôs getting worried about work &amp; that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy and relax knowing he‚Äôs got so much stuff to do, implying he‚Äôd want to reschedule.

I ignored for a couple hours, he texted a few times in between trying to get my attention. 

I was pretty upset/ disappointed - had I known I would have planned something else for my Sunday so I didn‚Äôt reply until I wasn‚Äôt.

When I replied, I said I understood in many words but that I was disappointed.

He then apologized saying any other afternoon/evening would have been great, thanking me for understanding even though I was annoyed and that he sensed the disappointment.

I answered again saying I understood, but that I was annoyed I couldn‚Äôt be annoyed blabla, and that I didn‚Äôt reply immediately bc I don‚Äôt like being rash in my replies bc I can sound so blunt by text.

All he said after was ‚ÄúYou are good I didn‚Äôt take it that way so don‚Äôt worry üòò‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt reply.

No date has been set for the new date, which I‚Äôm not happy about - the least you can do is offer an alternative and I did give him a few cues to do so.

He‚Äôs leaving in 10 days for a holiday, don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll be back before December bc he has landlord issues.

Don‚Äôt know what to do. Pause this until he‚Äôs back? Move on completely? Ignore his last message? We had a great momentum and now it‚Äôs dying down - to me at the very least.

7,qugd6g,1636982662,"At 23, I do not feel relatable enough to girls to date them","Everytime I meet a girl and think she's nice/cute, I quickly realise how unrelatable they are. I am a relatively boring person, but girls usually have lots of things going on. 

Many girls are party animals. I am not. Never been to a festival, or to a party in the past 7 years. I do not even know how to throw a party. At parties I am a bit awkward. I don't even know where to go if I were to go out because I know no venues like bars where I'd be comfortable. Many girls I know also do drugs which is really common here. Again, never done that. I have no problem with it but it makes me stand out.

Most girls I know have a relationship or have been in multiple relationships, which I haven't. Haven't ever come even remotely close to being intimate with a girl so I cannot relate to people who have. A girl who has had relationships, but also boys, are an enigma to me and I'd rather avoid them so they don't find out I have never come close to someone else in that way.

These are just a few examples of many. I don't feel human and it makes human connections really hard for me because nobody feels relatable to me in any way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qugd6g/at_23_i_do_not_feel_relatable_enough_to_girls_to/

. Asking me over and over again in an argument ‚Äúwhat do I want‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt know what to say which made him angry.
. Tells me has other girls after him
. He found out I slept with someone he knew before we even met he had a huge go at me about it and it upset him and he told me he was in a dilemma with me ‚Äòas he was so scared to hear anything else‚Äô 
. Asks if I‚Äôve met anyone else and if I only want him
. If I send him a photo on social media he replies with ‚Äú I love how your sending this to how many other guys aswell‚Äù then doesn‚Äôt believe me when I say I‚Äôm not
. Has told me I‚Äôve been a dickhead the whole time we‚Äôve been meeting and when I ask why he suddenly doesn‚Äôt remember why
. Every little thing I do now annoys him even though in the beginning we was so care free and always had an absolute laugh
. Before when we‚Äôve joked we‚Äôre going to replace each other he would laugh whereas now he goes mad at me and tells me I can‚Äôt believe you have said that
. Tells me I only message him when I‚Äôm drunk but it‚Äôs cool and no worries (even though this isn‚Äôt true)
. He went away for 2 months to a different country and said is ‚Äúthere any point in this/us anymore as he is away‚Äù when I accepted it and deleted him to move on he went mad and asked me why I wouldn‚Äôt let him finish what he had to say, but to me if it‚Äôs finished what more do I have to say.

16,quhotc,1636986578,Is she interested or not?,"31m met 30f OLD

First date wasn't the best or worst first date I've ever been on. But I liked her enough that I wanted to see her again.

So I asked her out again a couple days after the date. She agreed but said she had plans to fly home and spend Halloween weekend in her hometown.

So we set a weekend date the following weekend. We planned on going to the aquarium. I told her they do times entry tickets and they needed to be purchased in advanced. She okay'd this and I got the tickets for the agreed time and day.

Morning of the date she tells me she is sick, throwing up, and will need to postpone the date. I tell her it's okay, just feel better, the usual stuff.

I thought she might be lying, but I posted our text convo here and the consensus said give her the benefit of the doubt. So I did, and honestly her pattern of behavior, unusual lack of social media activity over the days she said she was sick, sent me selfies (she looked sick) makes me believe her. And at thos point, if her motive was to get out of seeing me, this whole thing was way more elaborate than it's worth to just say no to me. So theres that.

This past weekend I had to work three 12s and had no time for anything hit work/food/sleep. I asked her if she still wanted to reschedule, she immediately replied ""definitely!"" But we havent picked an actual day yet. 


Now, from what I know about this girl through our date, our conversations, and her social media, she seems to be shy/introverted. And not particularly experienced dating. I could be wrong but I kind of get the feeling she is interested, but doesnt want to, or know how to put in the effort to make it work. She was also very nervous on our date, and I dont think it was me. I look like my pictures and am above average looking. 

She still responds texts immediately, sends selfies, sends flirty texts..but we barely ever see eachother. 


So I guess I'm trying to figure out her pattern of behavior. It must be explained by either

- She's interested and we are both just off timing wise
- She's shy and inexperienced dating
- Im wrong about the above and she's just not interested

Thoughts? I dont want to keep investing time in something that isnt going anywhere. This weekend will be 1 month since our first date which is far too slow to continue for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quhotc/is_she_interested_or_not/

21,quicfj,1636988454,Has anyone else had the experience that guys they meet online are consistently more attractive in person?,"Maybe it‚Äôs just that people are more attractive in 3D and men don‚Äôt catfish but goddamn. Lol so I, 19F, broke up with my long term boyfriend about a month ago and since then I‚Äôve gone on 4 first dates with guys I met online. I‚Äôve regretfully bailed on like 5 other potential first dates (made the mistake of wanting to only focus on one person at a time- I regret that). But yesterday and the day before I went on two different first dates and in both occasions I was like- wow they‚Äôre hot. Yesterday especially so. Now, I already thought he was extremely attractive from his profile photos, but this man was like a younger Chris Evans but slightly more wholesome looking and w/green eyes. Maybe I‚Äôm just biased but wow. He‚Äôs so far out of my league in my opinion, but I did have a fun time talking to him so hopefully we can at least be friends (he goes to my university). 

And like, I think that‚Äôs pretty common for a lot of guys since they don‚Äôt tend to catfish and/or even have super posed and flattering photos of themselves. My friend has told me my photos are a very good representation of how I look irl (my skin is a bit bad at the moment but I can wear concealer etc and it‚Äôs healing now that I saw a dermatologist and started a routine). And it‚Äôs not perfect in my photos either. So I think she‚Äôs probably right. I don‚Äôt use any photoshop or filters. Sometimes I wear different makeup I guess, but still. I do think I look quite pretty irl other than having problems with my hair and skin at the moment (which I can mostly fix). 

Either way though, I‚Äôm meeting a lot of attractive guys at the moment! Maybe it was just the switch from bumble to hinge but like- idk man. I like it lol.

37,qujqx9,1636992342,Are my (F18) standards too high?,"Hi, preface: I've never had a boyfriend, I've never been close friends with a guy before, the only interactions I've had with men my whole life were sexual, including with older guys as a minor. So that's why I wonder if my current standards are higher than they should be.

I've been ghosted so I started thinking why, and I think that the reason was how open I was about my insecurities too soon and too strongly. And I think I can appear kind of not sane sometimes, so I'm working on that and in the future I won't do excessive validation seeking with guys. I've been getting more and more stable and recovered from my eating disorder btw so that's cool.

Now, I'd like a reality check. My idea of a relationship would be very slowburn, like getting to know each other as friends and having comfortable chemistry, growing together and learning to love each other for real, forming a lifelong stable connection. I don't want to call him my boyfriend after two months and then watch it fall apart.
My requirements are that he should be conventionally handsome, and that I should be his physical preference (body type, hair/eye color...) unless he has none. I am 100% sure I would not date a man who has a thing for chubby women, or redheads or anything I'm not. But I'm afraid because what if I get that beautiful connection only to find out that his ideal woman would look nothing like me? That's not something I'm willing to compromise about, since I don't really have a type, only things I'm into or not into and I obviously won't date a guy I'm not into.

Does it count as showing crippling insecurity if I ask a guy quite early on what's his physical type? I really need to know because if a man says something like ""my favourite colour is green"" I immediately assume he has a thing for green eyes unless he stated otherwise. I want to avoid that kind of stress.

And my other requirement is that he should be a feminist (or think like one), and want marriage and kids. Is that contradictory? I just want a man who is progressive but still wants a traditional life like me.

Also will it be considered a red flag by guys that I never had a boyfriend before? I'd sleep with pretty much any safe guy but when it comes to serious stuff, I'd like my first boyfriend to be my last, like, someone I extremely care about and I know for sure I'm in love with.

In short, we went to the market and shared an acai bowl, then went to the beach, then stopped at a store to drink some beer, did a short hike, went to the beach again where we played in the water and kissed. Then we hit up a brewery. We did all of this on a rainy day on our bikes. It was spontaneous and fun. 

I couldn't fall asleep yesterday thinking about how much fun i had and I'm anxious about whether or not she will want to continue seeing me. She finishes work late on the weekdays so I'm not sure we will get to see each other before next weekend. I texted her today ""yestersqy was fun with you. Let's hangout again soon.""

Only thing is he seems to be into partying still and I just am not and never really have been (which I told him). He said he has slowed down but he told a couple of stories of partying and getting high sort of recently.

48,quk6ap,1636993483,Was she really not interested or have I overreacted? Please review our conversation,"Some context first: matched on Bumble on Thursday, flirted a bit, then ended up asking her out for the same evening and she gladly accepted (as in she literally wrote ""I gladly say yes!!""). We meet up for dinner at around 9 pm, chat about a lot of things and we vibe pretty well, interest seems high (red flag: she kept having to pick up work calls in front of me for about 20 minutes in the middle of our dinner, shit happens, I get it, but IMO she wasn't apologetic enough about it but whatever), we moved to a place nearby, meanwhile walking hand in hand and started to get more physical.

Once there we order drinks, I make her laugh a lot, she is flirty, it's clear things are going well. Kept playing with each other's hands throughout. I ask her if she had ever tried \[activity\] to which she replies no so I invite her to go together on Sunday or Monday. Again she smiles and says ""Yeah! I would like that!"". At around 3 am (so 6 hours after first meeting) but after a while she says ""actually I have to help a friend who needs to remove her cast on Sunday, in that case we can go on Monday"". Alright.

I take her home, we stand in front of her building for a bit, we kiss multiple times. Once I'm home we have a final exchange on whatsapp (where the screenshots start, see below).

The following 2 days she takes *hours* to reply and...Well, you can read the rest here: [https://imgur.com/a/HdiXNRb](https://imgur.com/a/HdiXNRb)

\---

Keep in mind that I'm absolutely not butthurt by the fact that she said ""no"" (it's a numbers game) but only by the fact that I made it clear my time is valuable and to respect it (as I respect hers) and all she did was making up what I think were a bunch of excuses to either not see me again or just string me along in case the better prospect didn't work out (I'm 99% that was the case).

In the hours she was ""too busy"" to reply she would post stories on freaking Instagram...

Or maybe I totally overreacted and I should have taken what she said at face value. In that case: any suggestions on how to recover?

51,quklah,1636994600,I feel like everyone is disappointed with dating due to unrealistic standards,"This post applies to pretty much everyone but just for some examples, a hot guy can hook up with an average girl but will never consider her girlfriend material, but the hot guy will still use the average girl for sex, as a result, the girl thinks that she's a 10/10 girl and will waste her younger years holding out for a 10/10 guy to commit. But that's not going to happen, then she ends up in her 30s wondering where all the good men are, there are plenty of good men out there but she's so fixated on the 10s that she misses out on them. 

Likewise, there are countless posts of guys complaining about how girls don't want average guys, but quick observation clearly disproves this, I'm fat and autistic but I've still managed to find girls to date, In addition, I'm currently a midwife and I see all types of different guys being fathers. There was even a short bald Indian which incels claim is impossible, the problem here is the guys are picky too, they are pudgy nerds who think that the 10/10 hot blonde will like them for their personality so they ignore any girl that's not a 10/10 sorority girl.

I think that people should be more honest and objective about themselves and what they could realistically achieve I also think that just because someone is hot doesn't mean they are compatible with you. I wouldn't want to date an Instagram model for instance because we would have nothing in common to talk about, and as I said earlier I'm fat and autistic, and yet I still manage to find women willing to date me.

So, awhile back I posted here talking about how it is hard for me to find a traditional Catholic woman. I am now out of the U.S. and living in Poland and I see that there are many traditional Catholic women in the smaller towns and villages. But many of them that are single happen to be in their late 20s like me. As of now, I'm about to be 27 years old as of the end of November.

Personally, I find myself not wanting to get married and have children with a woman who's even a year older than me because she'd probably be 30 by the time we'd be married and have our first child and for some reason, I'm not comfortable having children with a woman in her 30s. It's very odd, but I can't help myself. Lately, I've finding myself more attracted to younger women *(19-22 years old)*. Yet, every time I bring this up, there will be some people who will give me flak for liking someone who's 7-8 years younger than me. Although other people will say there's nothing wrong with that age gap. 

At the same time, its rare to find a woman in her early-mid 20s to be a traditional Catholic Christian at all and embracing the traditional lifestyle. I'm sure there are some around and maybe I'm not looking hard enough. But until then, I'm in a pigeon-hole it seems. I want to be married and have a family of my own one day, but I do not know which age group I should stick with. Early 20s or Late 20s?

75,qundgm,1637002070,I regret dating a so called friend ‚òπÔ∏è,"Hi all,

So I am going into week 9 NC. Brief overview:

We had a disagreement over text. I was first to reach out after a few days - silence. I reached out again to apologise for my part in the disagreement, also said it was clear he was not speaking to me and I would respect that - I was again met with silence.

He began orbiting my social media which hurt my feelings. In order to protect myself I removed his access to my social media stories for 2 reasons - 1 to stop myself posting things to try and get his attention (we have all done it come on guys), and 2 to let him know that it's not ok to orbit me whilst ignoring me. I don't do toxic i'm sorry and I have stayed in NC without 1 slip for 8 weeks. It's been tough.

I have known him a very long time (Friends that go way back) and our relationship is just under a year, I am still shocked that it has ended over something so small - a disagreement! I have hoped and prayed every day since that he would reach out so that we can resolve this.

Week 9 and I am starting to resent him, resenting him for treating me like i'm nothing. I'm a good person and did not deserve the silent treatment - TWICE!!! I thought our long time friendship meant something - clearly not. I have been tempted to reach out a third time but for what? Another ghost no thanku!. My upset is turning to anger and I suppose acceptance. I would still be open to a conversation I think i'm owed that. However it's not on me to put this right anymore.

My thoughts - anyone who ghosts to end a relationship/friendship is in my view an asshole and a coward! I have not once begged or pleaded, never been constantly calling, messaging, not liked or bombarded social media. certainly not a story watcher either!

 I am a good person with a good heart and would love to hear why men/women end a relationship/friendship this way and whether they felt bad afterwards?  I would like to think that he would contact me one day but whether I will be forgiving is decreasing everyday that passes.

Any thoughts/advice appreciated and any ghosters with their stories I won't judge - curious as to why people do it more so in long term relationships/friendships??

I‚Äôd like to think he feels bad for leaving it like this, I did try to make sure it was left on somewhat good terms even if it was over.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qundgm/i_regret_dating_a_so_called_friend/

- she would constantly flirt with me throughout my shift (she would find any excuse to walk up to me and talk, like hand me random items). 

- She asked for my number (and used a lame excuse to get it by asking her to send her some random video). 

- She would drive me home from work all the time (she would offer, or more like insist). 

- She would text me all the time (sometimes sending heart emojis).

- She called me cute or complimented my features multiple times.

- She would always suggest we go out for drinks.

- She would drop hints like ""I have nobody to see this movie with"".

- She would talk about me all the time to other coworkers.

- She told me that I was the only reason she hadn't quit the job.

There are other reasons too, but the point is, I'm sure she liked me, and some of my coworkers thought she did too. So she eventually broke up with her boyfriend around the time our flirting really started to pick up. This is where I think I screwed it up. I kind of didn't react when she brought up her breakup. A few days later, I invited her out to go to a bar with me and my buddy. She said she would if she wasn't busy with her new job. She ends up never giving me an answer. I reach out about 2 weeks later, she apologizes, claiming she forgot, and brought up that she still wants to get drinks with me. I then text her about a week after that asking her to meet up for drinks, and she says she needs to check her schedule. She converses with me for a bit, and then again, doesn't let me know her schedule. I haven't texted her since.

I think I screwed up because of one of these reasons:

1) I didn't give her the response she was hoping for when she told me she broke up with her boyfriend (I think she was disappointed with my disinterest in the news).

2) I invited her out to a club with my friend, when she was probably hoping for a 1 on 1 outing with me.

3) I didn't text her at all the day I was going to the club, and she was probably waiting to hear from me, and wanted me to show more of an interest in her coming.

4) She might've thought I was just trying to hook up with her because I was only suggesting going for drinks, and she wasn't interested in just a hook up.

- She would text me all the time (sometimes sending heart emojis).

- She called me cute or complimented my features multiple times.

- She would always suggest we go out for drinks.

- She would drop hints like ""I have nobody to see this movie with"".

- She would talk about me all the time to other coworkers.

- She told me that I was the only reason she hadn't quit the job.

There are other reasons too, but the point is, I'm sure she liked me, and some of my coworkers thought she did too. So she eventually broke up with her boyfriend around the time our flirting really started to pick up. This is where I think I screwed it up. I kind of didn't react when she brought up her breakup. A few days later, I invited her out to go to a bar with me and my buddy. She said she would if she wasn't busy with her new job. She ends up never giving me an answer. I reach out about 2 weeks later, she apologizes, claiming she forgot, and brought up that she still wants to get drinks with me. I then text her about a week after that asking her to meet up for drinks, and she says she needs to check her schedule. She converses with me for a bit, and then again, doesn't let me know her schedule. I haven't texted her since.

I think I screwed up because of one of these reasons:

1) I didn't give her the response she was hoping for when she told me she broke up with her boyfriend (I think she was disappointed with my disinterest in the news).

2) I invited her out to a club with my friend, when she was probably hoping for a 1 on 1 outing with me.

3) I didn't text her at all the day I was going to the club, and she was probably waiting to hear from me, and wanted me to show more of an interest in her coming.

4) She might've thought I was just trying to hook up with her because I was only suggesting going for drinks, and she wasn't interested in just a hook up.

80,qunk3l,1637002563,I told my friend he is not the catch that he thinks he is and should lower his standards. It did not go well,"So my friend (M25) as had some trouble dating. So have I (M32).

I have determined that it is because he is being too picky / choosy. Here is the thing. He has an excellent education and career and is in fact in a very enviable position r√©sum√© wise, especially for his age. But in my view this has come at the cost of him neglecting his body. I'm going to be blunt but he is physically unfit having a huge beer belly (despite being a teetotaler).  I know that being physically unfit makes one physically unattractive, regardless of gender. Further, he has grey hair that makes him look 40+

On the other hand my friend has had Women show interest in him but he has turned them down, primary because he wants another educated professional. That, along with moral character and having a good connection / getting along are what matters to him. He doesn't seem to really care about looks. Which is great but it doesn't change the fact that physical attraction is necessary in a relationship and it is hard to be attractive when you are physically out of shape.

On the other hand, my friend is convinced that he is a top-tier catch because he has a good education and career and is also really good with kids + has certain domestic skills. According to him, he brings both the traditional male and female roles to the table and therefore ""deserves"" someone who is about as successful as him career wise. Essentially he wants a ""fair deal""

I was getting tired of him complaining about being unable to find someone who I laid out the bitter truth and told him that he can't find love because he is in truth not much of a catch because of his looks and it doesn't matter how much he *thinks* he brings to his table - if you are physically unattractive it doesn't matter and that he is not in a position to be picky. If a Woman is of good character and you get along and there is mutual attraction you should date here and not restrict yourself to successful professionals.

This triggered him and he got hurt and angry. He went on his usual spiel on how he brings a lot to the table, how he ""deserves a fair deal"", his view on how the male provider role is entrenched and how it's not fair that he's expected to ""marry down"" despite being good with kids. He also said that he does in fact exercise regularly, and has healthy behaviors, etc. (you can't tell that by looking at him). and that it is not like he is obese or anything and in fact is physically fit when you look at the running / walking / biking he does / is able to do. He acknowledges that he is overweight but doesn't see it as an issue because he is not looking for a ""supermodel"" and doesn't really care about looks anyway.

And sure that may all be true but if you appear physically unfit and 40 you are going to have a hard time finding someone in their early 20s and you need be willing to compromise on certain standards. I also think he is en route to becoming one of those cat ladies who can't find someone because they refuse to consider those less successful / educated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qunk3l/i_told_my_friend_he_is_not_the_catch_that_he/

84,quo988,1637004445,boy in talking phase with med school girl long-distance online assistance I never met in person," So I met this girl about 5 months ago online and we have been talking almost every day with a few breaks here and there when she has a huge exam or is generally busy with Med school. We started off as online friends in an online friend group before telling each other how we feel about each other about a month and a half later after our first interaction. I am from the state of NY and she is from Michigan which also doesn't help matters though we have been close to seeing each other so many times but the timing has been the issue. I have facetimed with her many times and we have each other's cell phone numbers so she is definitely a real person. I really like her and she likes me and I really want to meet her but unfortunately, she has to study for the USMLE Step 1 exam which means she is busy until the earliest the month of March and the latest May. I really feel she is special and I love talking to her but do I look dumb waiting for her? She says we are still in the talking phase and getting to know each other which is ok, but I'm worried that until we meet in person we will still be in this phase where we talk here and there due to her crazy study schedule. She is so special that every time I do even go on a date with other people nobody else ever comes close to her whether it be her persona or just her intelligence. She sometimes has missed a few of my messages but that's also when she is really busy with school and doesn't want to be distracted and she has told me that she wants to eventually date me but she has no time for a relationship and she feels bad having a great guy like myself wait when she isn't available.

Last Saturday we went with our group of friends to the cinema and after i take her to the train station just the two of us and before  she taken the train i told her how i feel, she got really surprised and wasnt saying anything , so i told her we can talk about it later ( the train would arrive in 5/6 minutes ).

 Next day, Sunday, she message me saying if we could talk on Monday and saying  would only be fair if we talk in person and thx for giving me time to think about it , So at lunch hour on monday she asked me to talk  and she said She is demisexual and she explained to me what that means and she couldnt enter in a relationship with me  because would be unfair to me since she doenst feel the same and she doesnt know if she will so we agree that we would still friends .


My problem here is i really get attached when i like someone this way , my last relationship was 4 years ago and since then i didnt felt this way with anyone and was really hard to forget about it , i didnt tell her this so should i just give up and try to forget her , should i tell her that will be really hard for me to forget her and say i can wait or i just wait and see what happens without touching this topic anymore?

Am I getting this right or am I just being possesive?
I understand we both busy but 1 date in 5 weeks is not something I think possible to build something especially if you got time to go out partying.However she kept saying she wants me to meet her friends and we communicat daily bases whit voice notes txt etc etc.
So I was thinking to start using dating apps again as I don't see we going somewhere whit that time frame.
I like her a lot and she gave me more attention than anyone ever in my life.
So if I use apps is that cheating?

The very reason I dont believe in soulmates, or love. Having multiple girlfriends, calling them the sweetest, and cutest in the world, one after the other is the definition of insanity, and I WILL NOT drop to this low.

Love at first sight is just pure luck, and not love at all. If I dropped my standards, i'd essentially be caving, and if I drop those very standards, OF COURSE those girls would be all over me. They can't get other guys, unless they themselves are fat, and hideous, too and they know they can't achieve a guy like me. Opposites do NOT attract in the human race. To them, i'm hot, so they push their luck. So, I keep myself on the ""hot"" end of the spectrum when I'm going girl shopping. There are some very nice average girls, though, and I sometimes drop a standard or even two if they're lucky.

I do, however believe in compatability. You can tolerate someone just enough to where you get to be with them for the rest of your life. You put yourself in this mindset that you're ""in love"". When you're merely just physically attracted to this person, and you hold them in high appreciation, and natural survival instincts tell you that they're beneficial to you. In conclusion, love is three things: 1. Your mind telling you that that person is perfect for reproduction, and continuation of your genes. 2. High appreciation for another's behavior towards you. (If you have something that benefits you, you don't get rid of it.). 3. Marketing/social media will have you believe that ""love makes the world go round."" It may make you believe that your ""partner"" in life is something more special than just another human. We are not special. There are very few people of note on this Earth.

Love is a sham. I just don't understand why I can't find my compatible ""partner"".",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quop2n/i_mean_im_right_but_is_my_thinking_normal_or_even/
