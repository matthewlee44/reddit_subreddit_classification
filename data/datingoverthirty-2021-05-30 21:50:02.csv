29,np9442,1622483388,Keep or Ditch?,"I went on a first date with someone the other day and it went pretty well. We seemed to have a lot in common and agreed on everything. We both wanted a second date and said we would text to determine our plans. When I reached out again, he responded immediately and we started talking about scheduling a second date. I had good vibes. 

When I asked if he had any ideas for our second date, he proposed to “grab a bottle from my freezer and go somewhere and drink.” 

In what world would that be a good second date for somebody that you enjoyed spending time with or are interested in building a family with? 

It also concerns me that this person is almost 40 and still lives with his family, and doesn’t know how to cook. He said those were all cultural things and also never expected their S.O. to take care of them but when you add up that they can’t even make the effort to schedule a decent second date, is this person worth pursuing? Also, did he just tell me what I wanted to hear during the first date? Is he an alcoholic? 

Ladies of Reddit, I would love your raw opinion. What would you do?
