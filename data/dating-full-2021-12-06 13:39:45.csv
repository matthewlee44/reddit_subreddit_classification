We aren't dating but we are very close, we have hooked up several times too. We had a heated fight 3 weeks ago on my birthday. 

The fight was about two things: 
1. I wanted to meet him on my bday and i specifically asked him a day before if he can and he said he will meet me but he didn't meet me on the main day. 

2. I expressed my disappointment to him about him not posting a story of me on my birthday. Few days ago, i asked him how would he feel if his 'close friend' didn't post a story of him on his birthday to which he replied that he would be very hurt. And now he did the same to me. I wouldn't have been furious about this thing if he wasn't active on social media but he is, very much. He wrote a few lines for me on my birthday that i really really appreciated. But when i confronted him about this thing, he said that he didn't know that a story would matter so much to me by putting the guilt on me. And said that a story matters to me more than what he wrote for me. It is not like that. He gave multiple justifications earlier about the same in the beginning of this conversation by saying that he slept early, he didn't check his phone. They are lies because i know him. He is a very frequent phone checker. 

About the meeting thing, he totally ignored this. Invalidated the whole thing. He just clinged onto the story thing. 

He gave irrational multiple justifications for his actions as to why he did what he did that were totally unconvincing that made him seem like he was actually giving excuses for his behavior. 
We have had arguments in the past about his lack communication and blame game. He acts like a victim everytime we fight. He says he'll work on things but never does in reality.

With this new guy, I’m in no rush, but what draws me in is how SAFE he feels. I’m attracted to him for so many reasons but I truly don’t think lust is one of them.

Basically we were just talking and stuff, and she says she's free on day X and if I wanted to roam around the city with her.

I say yes and that I could take a day off for that.

She mentions strictly ""friends only"" and that she's not interested in a relationship. I was taken aback, like, why are you on tinder on the first place lol.

Maybe it's a culture clash or something, but for me if the boundary is so explicit, it's a real thing and not open to negotiations.

Initially I said ok, but thinking about this a bit more, I really didn't feel like using up a vacation day for this would be a smart move. Also if I liked her this would have been even worse for me, I don't need a friendzoner thanks.

So eventually I told her that and I basically cancelled the date.

I've got a pretty face and I look after myself.

I'm female, 23, very well educated and my friends, family and peers are all surprised why I've been single for 4 years. I have a range of artistic hobbies, I enjoy the outdoors and love animals. I am also an athlete, competing in MMA/wrestling at a national/international level. So I'm very physically fit.

I've met people organically, on apps, through friends and have even dated a couple of my friends but it all ends the same way. 

I've very different people too, I don't have a particular ""type"" so I'm not noticing a pattern in their interests or appearances. They are however all really lovely people, but they just don't want to pursue anything with me seriously.

They all give a similar reasoning of ""I just don't want a relationship"", ""something doesn't quite feel right"" etc. Classic ""it's not you it's me"".

My fear is - why am I attracting emotionally unavailable people? I normally date a little older, and the issue is much the same, nobody is ready for a serious relationship.

However, there might be one thing that is potentially putting men off. Guys I've dated have commented about wanting to get into the gym and have even joined gyms whilst dating me as ""look how much bigger your muscles are than mine"" but they've also always been very complimentary about how beautiful/fit I am. I thought maybe they just wanted to gym with me? But perhaps it's a turn off all together? 

Very confused, a bit lonely and wondering what I can do to find somebody that isn't scared of commitment.

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn’t pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

My closest friend group knows too and so do my brother.

I think I’m tired of being so closed off when it comes dating. I remove myself from such conversations because it’s just something I cannot relate to.

So in terms of the future, I’m not very positive about that at all. This is important to dating, as I see it all the time. “I just need someone who has goals and is continuously working on themselves”, especially from women. I honestly don’t think that description fits me at all. I’m not not doing anything about it, but that description is far from who I am, sadly.

She had supermodel looks and yet would send me the nerdiest YouTube videos you can imagine and play along with all of my random conversational tangents. I fell madly in love until it turned on most of the aforementioned was just manufactured.

Over time as I began to realise I didn't really know who she was and felt no emotional depth to her. it was almost disputing, like she was an android. She would stare at me with cold eyes and give me increasingly backhanded compliments. I became concerned by it and started to pull away. She flipped and became cold and angry. We broke up, twice, the second time being for good. We haven't spoken since.

In the near 2 years since then I have been basically unable to feel anything for any girl I have met.

This weekend I was working an event away from home and at this meeting I met this girl. Hadn’t seen her at the previous events so didn’t think anything of her. Well we briefly introduced each other and shared some of our work. 

Since she didn’t know anything about the event I offered to walk her around and show her who’s who and what’s what. Conversation was flowing great and there was banter back and forth and she was really excited to be there and I was happy to introduce her to this world that I work in. 

Well that initial meeting turned into the entire day of laughs and hanging out working together and walking around. We were practically glued at the hip. We shared fries, and walked through the woods, and talked about everything under the sun, and she occasionally made physical contact. So the first day ends and we part ways and I offer to take her out for food is she’s free. Unfortunately she got stuck in traffic and got back late so nothing happened. 

The next day I decided to let her do her own and I’ll do my own thing. Well I see her again and go over to say a quick hello and it turns into another full day of hanging out and working. The conversation was just so easy and flowed well and everything was good. 

The end of the day came and I offered to hang out a bit longer until she left and then walked her to her car. We live in separates states and quiet far apart and she also ended her relationship just last week and I was perfectly fine not making a move cause I didn’t want to force anything for a short weekend trip. But we hugged and took a selfie together and agreed to hopefully see each other next year. 

I’m really happy by this experience as it’s a confidence booster in that I know how to confidently talk to women and I could do so for upwards of 10 hours. In some essence I’d like to call it a first date(s) but again I wasn’t going to force anything or there looking for a date that so I’m perfectly fine gaining a new friend.

Like many others on here I was ghosted seemingly out of nowhere when I thought things were going well. We had hung out twice (once at my place and once at hers) and had made out but not gone beyond that yet. I know you’re thinking “this sounds like a hookup situation” since we hadn’t really gone on proper “dates” but I wasn’t getting that vibe from her. We had plans to hang out again the following week (she even said “see you next week” as I left her place). We then made plans to get dinner one day during the week before this next planned date and this is where it goes downhill. She cancelled the day of the dinner date with a seemingly legitimate excuse so I wasn’t too concerned but the seed of doubt had been planted in my head. A couple days go by with no talking (strike two) and I reach out to her to discuss the date we had originally planned the last time we hung out, which at this point was now two days away. She responded a bit and more or less confirmed we were still on but when I brought up specifics she didn’t respond. And that’s the last time I heard from her. I texted her the day of asking if we were good but I already knew the answer at that point. 

So I’m left here wondering what the hell happened like so many of us are in this situation. I have to assume she found someone else (we met on tinder) because I don’t think we spoke enough between the dates for me to say something to put her off. Anyway I’m tempted to reach out this week and just ask what happened even though I know I shouldn’t. But in my mind worst case scenario is she continues to not respond and best case scenario she tells me how she is feeling so I understand why she decided to end it. I know she doesn’t owe me anything since we only talked for a few weeks but it would be nice to know her side so I can stop thinking about it.

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn’t pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

Nothing crazy, about 10 people. One girl there (my cousin's friend) I had met before once, but didn't really know that well. I was definitely the most outgoing and best conversationalist there, so naturally I talk to this girl over the course of the weekend. I ask her questions about herself, and we're getting along pretty well. I didn't even consider her to be a romantic interest, although I do think she is very attractive. Over the weekend our conversation is pretty flirty at times. She was doing things like pretending to hit me with objects, and would give the occasional touch on the arm. When we were drunk she asked if I would go hiking with her at some place where she lives. At one point she walked up to me and asked me what my zodiac sign is, and my cousin who was standing behind me gave me a big smile, like she was hinting that this girl was into me. When I told her she said that I had the same zodiac sign as all her boyfriends. When we were leaving, she gave me a hug goodbye.

The second time we hung out at his house was this past weekend. I went over on the Friday evening and we were together until Saturday afternoon. Oddly this time, we did not have sex.

I initially didn't particularly mind that we didn't have sex. I thought we were having a good time overall; we visited the spa in his apartment building, made food back at his place, watched movies, cuddled, I having fun. I was genuinely enjoying his company.

At the end of the last movie we watched on the Friday night, he said to me he was really tired. It was around 11pm. I asked him why he was so tired; ""what did you do today?"" I ask him, and he goes ""Not you."" We laughed and went to sleep.

So literally, I went home the next day, and we didn't have any sex, we cuddled a lot, but no sex. And my mind is making me question when he said "" Not you"" was he lowkey insinuating he had sex with someone else perhaps earlier?

We talked a little bit and were sorta friends, but it was nothing beyond that. We're around 24 now, and I reached out to her through instagram just out of curiosity.

To my surprise, we actually had an enjoyable conversation, and she even seemed invested in maintaining the conversation. For example, she would say her phone was low on battery and would text me as soon as she recharged it, and she followed through on that. If something caused her to take a long time, she would apologize for it. I, personally, don't even do those kind of things because I don't usually engage in these kind of lengthy text conversations.

More importantly, she even texted me first the next day. So, I thought I might be interested in her and if things continued to go well, I would ask her on a first date. In most cases, I jump out of the texting stage ASAP, but I felt it was appropriate in this case since we hadn't talked in ages, and she seemed invested anyway.

What ended up happening is that Freud must have possessed our conversation, and I somehow accidentally ended up asking her out. I made a certain joke, and she took it as me asking her out. Basically, I said I wasn't in that context, but if she was interested then why not? I thought it was more important to roll with it then to simply say no because that might close the deal on that forever.

Basically, she said ""**I don't know, we really don't know much about each other anymore**.""

Basically, I ended up retreating back in a playful way, and the conversation ended on (I think) a positive note. 

I haven't texted her today, and I don't plan to just to kind of roll back some of the steam. My question is: **Do you think that this is something that's dead in the water, or is she genuinely just unsure?**

Hi, this is mostly about a rant about me and my journey to polyamory. For context I’m 20f and I just got out of a polyamorous triad relationship. This was also my first ever real relationship. I’m extremely heartbroken and want to rant. Any advice or tips is appreciated. 



I had two partners “F” 27f and “D” 27m. Me and D and F met online and originally were friends with benefits. I had my first ever real sexual experience with them and our feelings grew, soon we were all really close and began dating. Previously F and D had been together for 4 years, lived together, had 2 cats and planned on getting married one day. I joined their relationship as a third, we were in a throuple for 1 year and lived together for 4 months, F and D had lived together for a majority of their relationship and I moved in with them while leaving behind an abusive living situation. They assured me that they would help me and that they wanted nothing more than me moving in with them. They promised me that we will always work out our problems, that it wouldn’t be easy but that they wanted nothing else but to be with me. I always thought our relationship was absolutely perfect and that we were extremely happy, I had never felt so safe and loved in my life, despite it being a difficult choice to move out while being 20 and not yet financially independent I decided to take the risk because of that. Since I moved in we have traveled, gone camping, have spent all of our free time together laughing and in love, have gone on many dates and worked on our individual relationships as well as our relationship as a whole. We always worked on our relationship and tried to make sure everyone was happy and was getting plenty of time with one another. I was hopeful and saw myself being with them for many years. 





The problems began when me and D became more close. Before I moved in, me and F had been really close and in love and had so much fun hanging out, going on dates and spending our free time together, we were also the most intimate we had ever been. Me and D where also very close but didn’t get to spend as much time together as me and F. When I moved in, F began to work more in person which meant she was gone from the morning until night, me and D both worked from home so we got to spend more time together. F couldn’t handle it, she was not only getting less alone time with D but now I was living with them and getting to spend all my time with D while not seeing F as much. This began to cause some problems between me and F’s relationship. On top of that, since F became more busy with work we stopped having as much time to be intimate, while me and D had the most time to be intimate.  Insecurities grew more and F became uncomfortable with having to share D with me during intimate time, she also began to feel more emotionally and physically distant from D.






F decided yesterday to pack all of her things and leave, saying that she couldn’t deal with our dynamic anymore. She said she really needed to work on her mental health, go to therapy, get new meds. She has been feeling extremely depressed since I moved in and she hasn’t been able to adjust to our dynamic change from not living together to being nesting partners. I know she still loves our partner D very much, and he also loves her since they have so much history (4 years together, plans of marriage). She still wants to be with him and not “share” him with me. I decided  that while she works on herself and her mental health, I can work on preparing to move out so that she can come back and be with D while I leave the relationship. For context, I have never lived on my own before.  I’m 20, a college student and had previously lived with my abusive parents before moving in with my partners. 








I’m extremely heartbroken. I’m sad me, F and D will never have our beautiful throuple dynamic ever again. I still believe our relationship was a peak in my life and I’m sad to let that go, I don’t think I’ll ever get to experience the beautiful harmony of being loved by a man and a woman at the same time again. I’m sad that I will have to leave D so that F can come back to be with him, I love him so much and he was my first true love. Im sad that D would be willing to sadly let me go so that he can be with F and continue with their plans to be together forever. I’m scared to be out on the world on my own for the first time. I’m scared that I’m not worthy of love, or one person loving me in a monogamous relationship. I hope that I can one day find someone and grow to love them the way F and D did, they saw each other as a “forever” I want to find my forever too.  I don’t think I ever want to be polyamorous again or participate emotionally in a pre-exciting relationship with two people who love each other more than they’ll ever love me. I have a lot of feelings and don’t know how to process it all. Taking it one day at a time. I hope things can get better but I feel very hopeless at the moment .

We have been occasionally texting for about a month, which I’ve enjoyed but in the back of my mind know that it’s not going anywhere.

He seemed hesitant but then said 'maybe for a lil while'. We kept making out inside, and he told me he doesn't wana sleep with me tonight cause he likes me. At one point he took off his shirt, which I found weird. But he has eight packs or whatever and I think he wanted to show me how fit he was. Then he asked we are not sleeping but if he can go down on me, I wasn't comfortable going through that without getting tested and such. So we kept on kissing and then he said you need to sleep and left. Honestly I wasn't expecting to hear from him anymore cause I was pretty certain he wanted to hook up. But he texted me few times after getting home last night and then again this morning. Here are my confusion, I have been told I am attractive, decent career but he is way more attractive and childless, so not sure if he is genuinely interested.

It didn't use to be something I would worry about too much, I just figured it would happen organically when the time was right, like a lot of people. But as I got into my mid-20s and the pandemic hit, I realized that I truly was unhappy being alone and that I probably wasn't going to meet anyone any time soon unless I put myself out there. So, about 7 months ago, I started using dating apps (Tinder, Bumble) pretty earnestly and regularly.

Overall, not an encouraging experience. I'm okay with the number of matches I get, but over 99% are no-replies, one-sided conversations that fizzle out, and random ghosting in the middle of conversations that seemed to be going great. I've started to dread even messaging someone I'm immediately attracted to, because I probably know how it'll end already. The remaining &lt; 1% was one date (my first) that apparently went so poorly, she decided to leave suddenly and ghosted afterwards. It was disorienting for me because I didn't think it was bad at all, just a bit awkward, and I felt like we'd connected over a lot.

I think that would have been something to take in stride and not get hung up over if I were able to go out with more people. But that's 7 months of trying my best to meet people and only getting one date. Since most first dates usually don't work out, it'll take years and years before I find my first relationship at this rate. Is that flawed thinking? It doesn't sound like it can be right, but I also can't tell what's wrong with it.

Maybe I'm just doing something wrong on these apps? I try to be confident, but I usually don't project excessive boldness that I can't back up in real life. I don't act like a ""nice guy"". I mostly just do my best to show (the positive sides of) my authentic self and converse as if I were talking to a potential friend who I happen to think is cute, but it never leads to anything. It's like there's always this huge asymmetry of interest: whatever level of interest I might have in this person, she's only a tiny fraction as interested in me. It doesn't matter our compared physical attractiveness or any superficial stuff like that, that's just the rule. That's what it feels like, at least.

I hate complaining about this stuff. It feels lame to do so. But as someone with no prior relationship experience, trying to date has really hurt my self-esteem. It's made me feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me and question whether I'm dateable at all or worthy to be in a relationship with someone.

I didn’t think I like her that much at first but now I really do. And she appears to be into me as well. We flirt every night over text. And she texts me about her day almost everyday. However, we’ve never done anything more than cuddling and we haven’t even kissed yet. 

Then, when we got back I walked her back to her place and we hugged goodbye but when I was gonna go for the kiss for some stupid reason I couldn’t do it and it just ended with another awkward hug. 

I texted her after about how we had a great weekend and she just loved my message and replied “agreed”. Then I texted her something again last night and got no response.

We were supposed to go out just for the drinks or dinner but it ended up being a longer type of the date. We went to the bar, then a walk, then we went to him and were talking like until 4 am and after we did have sex. I like him a lot as a guy, he’s been extremely respectful and gentleman in all ways. During our date and after sex he made sure I was comfortable with everything, that applies to experiences inside and outside of bed. I did feel like we had chemistry + alcohol + I was lacking some physical intercourse experience so I’d say that’s why it happened so fast. But I basically totally enjoyed both parts of the evening.

Then he invited me to meet during the weekend and we also firstly spent some time together hanging out (restaurants, walk, Xmas markets) and then we went to his place. Sexual experience was great again. But it’s definitely not just about sex, we talk a lot about everything and share many similar ideas, tell stories about our families and etc. He also does make some plans for us in a way that he’s suggesting that next time we should go there or there and etc. Last time he wanted to make plans but then told me let’s keep in touch and see how our schedule goes though. 

I don’t want to give it any label yet but I’m just wondering, where to go from there? He hasn’t messaged me since we last saw each other (Sunday morning) but yesterday (on Sunday evening) he somehow found my Facebook and added me.

I’m in a really good happy relationship right now, it’s going great. We have dated about a year now and made it more official a few months ago. In the begging I think we made it official to quickly and didn’t have time to realize each others baggage/ learn about eachother. He’s left me a couple times/ slow faded (ghosted) me before, even when we were together or when we agreed to just talk, due to his own baggage and I guess being scared (we’ve communicated about it more recently) I’ve learned in this time that he’s responsible for his baggage and I’m responsible for mine. 
  Saying that to say this, I’m more worried about my baggage right now. I was in a abusive relationship for 3 years, cheated on and manipulated (so basically a sad excuse of a relationship). I’m really worried I’m going to sabotage this relationship, not intentionally. But there’s certain things that trigger me, and I get defensive with him and always end up regretting it. I feel like I have a lot of learning to do, and I don’t want him to leave me (I guess I have a deep fear he’s going to because of our history so far). We have a lot in common and jive really well, I see myself spending my future with him. 
  I’m also a hopeless romantic and wear my heart on my sleeve, so I guess there’s a underlying fear of heartbreak.
