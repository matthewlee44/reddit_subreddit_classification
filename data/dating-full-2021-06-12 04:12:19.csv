I tried it, get a decent amount of matches, but as a twenty something man who isn't interested in hookups it's rough (I'm sure it is for the women out there too). 

I'll match with women, dates will go very well, then usually something will flail out when she says she's looking for something short term or a fling which doesn't interest me (nothing wrong with it, just not my cup of tea). 

A little bit about my background, I go to the gym 4 times per week, I'm in grad school at a decent public university, work and socialize when I can. I have problems like everyone else, so I'm definitely not immune to it. 

Are there people nowadays who actually want something meaningful? Do I have to wait until I'm older in order for that to happen? 

To preface this I am Asian, not into the hookup scene, I do get interest from women at the gym or at university but it's mostly just for short term... Maybe there's a vibe I'm giving off that I'm unaware of??

I'm not sure if there's necessarily a place you go to to find ""long term?"" or if it's just the age demographic I'm in. 

I want to figure out if the not wanting long term is just depending on the people I'm attracting (If the problem is me) or if it's just that bad out there.

I had 3 relationships and 5 other flings (all younger than me) through my lifetime, but I always ended up frustrated by their dominating manner. 

It annoys me that my men were trying to take charge in our relationship and dictate my life. As if they were challenging my freedom and independence, I detest this. I know what I want. I already have all plans and projections of my own future. Respect my decision. Even on small things like date night, I want them to understand that **I** decide where and what to do. When I ask for a date, just get ready and I will pick you up on time. Don't plan ahead. *I lead*. Just join me. 

It irritates me even more that some men thought I wanted an alpha man to challenge me. Why would I want that in a relationship? I want a submissive and receptive man I can protect, mommy around, keep him safe, help and guide him on the right track. 

I don't know how I can attract the right type of people and achieve this dynamic. I consider myself quiet decent, even charming.

So... Here's the deal.
I (24M) just got out of a very demanding relationship and I'm kinda looking for... Dates ? I guess. Nothing too serious in any case.

I'm an average looking dude, I have good manners, hygiene and clothing. When my friends talk about me they tend to say that I'm a charismatic and knowledgeable man.

However, despite being a ""datable"" guy, I can't seem to attract any women at parties. I'm kinda shy and ooening out to people is a real challenge to me.

I'm kinda lost when it comes to dating and I just feel like I  never learned what to do or what not to do. 
How do I even talk to a woman without making her incopfortable ?
How do I tell someone that I like them ?

Women notice me, they talk to me. That's a fact.
But I seriously can't do more than ""talking"" because I' deeply terrified of making them feel unease... So I shut myself out.

I‚Äôve previously had 2 long term relationships before I lived in London. I moved here when I was 21/22 and have had one situationship EACH year up until now. They usually last 2-5 months. Always start the same, the guy and I click, they make a lot of effort, arrange thoughtful dates, and then eventually they stop progressing and stay quite stagnant. 

They‚Äôll end by the guy breaking it off with me (first one was in love with an ex), the second was also not over his ex (didn‚Äôt find this out until quite late), the more recent one felt we didn‚Äôt have a spark, that was last year. Currently I think I may be in another one, but I‚Äôm not sure.

Recently I noticed he stopped arranging dates so often and I thought he was creating space. Instead of jumping to conclusions, I stated my needs and said I‚Äôd like us to keep making regular plans. He responded very well which I took as a good sign. He asked to meet up and talk about it, he said he‚Äôs sorry about the plans and that he wasn‚Äôt doing it on purpose. He said he wants to keep making plans, we made some on the spot, which happened on Thursday. Since then we‚Äôve not made more, so I guess I‚Äôll just wait and see. We‚Äôve been seeing eachother since April. 

He did tell me in that chat that he was a little guarded because he was broken up with suddenly last year by someone he‚Äôd been dating for 6 months. He also said he‚Äôs got a busy summer and is worried that I‚Äôll be hurt if he doesn‚Äôt make enough plans with me. He cried a little bit when he realised he‚Äôd hurt my feelings.

I could be wrong but I feel like I‚Äôm heading down the situationship route again. 

How do I stop this from happening? It‚Äôs a painful cycle.

I (still) have a hard time understanding why they needed to break up with me when our relationship has always helped us through many difficult times in life. 

I tried to be their friend but It was hard because I was still very in love with them. Every single second as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was torture since I was deeply hoping that we‚Äôd get back together. When they couldn‚Äôt give me an indicator if they were open to seeing me romantically in the future, I started being incredibly anxious and overwhelmed with feelings. I projected all my fears onto them and talked about how insecure this breakup had made me and after a few back and forth of villainising me despite my pure intentions, they decided to go on separate ways permanently.

It hurts me that they seemed ok from going from fianc√© to friend and then to a stranger within 6 days. I feel that for all we‚Äôve been through and all that I‚Äôve done (won‚Äôt go into private details), I‚Äôve been made to feel that I wasn‚Äôt enough and this breakup just affirms that anxiety. 

I‚Äôve always been a confident, secure and sure person. I feel like they‚Äôve broken me and I can‚Äôt go back to the me that was so happy and sure a month ago. 

99% of me still wants them back, but i don‚Äôt know what to do about that.

I'm 39 and yesterday, after a long dating hiatus, I went on a date with a woman I met on Tinder that's 40 and has 4 kids. I don't mind women with kids. Been in relationships with such ladies before and I usually get along with kids just fine.

The date went well. There were no awkward silences and after we had a drink or two, we went for a super long walk in the park, at night, in the dark but she didn't seem to mind (it was her idea)

I noted a few signs of interest:

\- She laughed at my stupid jokes. Or when I made facial expressions that are funny, she laughed too.

\- She didn't really flick her hair, but I did notice she fidgeted a log with her bracelet.

\- She didn't mind when I put my hand briefly on her arm. No pulling back, but I didn't leave it there for long either as to not make her uncomfortable.

\- She talked... and talked... and talked a LOT. I listened and she looked in my eyes for long times while we talked

\- She leaned in closer on the table on multiple occasions and didn't seem to want to stay distant.

\- She told me afterwards that she had a good time and enjoyed the evening

\- When I told I enjoyed it too and asked if she wanted to go on another date, she said yes (though it'll have to wait till July because she has the kids till then)

\- We actually kept talking way longer than planned. On multiple occasions we were like ""ok time to go home this time. This reminds me of that one time where...."" and she went on talking again. Which I didn't mind

\- Towards the end of the date, I said I felt like hugging her and she said that I could. So we hugged, she rubbed my back and we both agreed it felt good after such a long period in covid-confinement. I jokingly told her I hoped it didn't feel too awkward when I asked for a hug but she said that no, it was fine but that if I had asked to kiss, she wouldn't have agreed (which I can kinda understand on a first Tinder date)

All this sounds kinda positive right? Well a couple of things make me hesitate. 

During the date, she said she didn't feel like that instant ""click"" and instant chemistry or infatuation, but she did add that she believes in love that can grow more slowly over time. And after that she did also say ""if you date me, please do keep in mind I have a lot of baggage I carry"". She told me about it and she did go through a few things. She didn't ahve an easy live and she also added that she was wary of online dating because she was massively disappointed when a few first dates ended with the guy just wanting sex and admitting he's married... but she seems like a strong woman because she's living a normal, productive life.

The fact that she said this does indicate that she doesn't find the idea of dating me impossible.

After the date, since we were both with the bike and it was really late (past midnight, we really had a longer date than we thought) I asked her to let me know by text once she arrived safely at her house. She did let me know. I told her again I had a nice time and would like to have another date with her in the future. She said that the date felt like it went really smoothly, as opposed to other dates she went on, and wants to go on a second date too, but she also added that she's conflicted about those thoughts of instant chemistry/infactuation VS love that can grow.

I told her that I just had a good time and that I would love a second date and that we'd just see how it goes from there.

I know I can't do much more than just let it flow and see where it leads us, but did I fucked up somewhere or would you say this is pretty much a lost cause?

I dont do anything hostile, but there are some bad vibes that people I think unconsciously chatch. I feel judged and I feel rejection scares me so much that anticipating rejection makes me angry. So girls dont like angry vibes and every time I go home knowing that I could have ask a number, danced, kissed a girl if she was ready for a kiss.. and I feel bad because I push people away. Sometimes when a girl touches me I feel startled and jumpy. So the girl feel rejected and rejects me in return.

Just posting here to see if anyone else has ever gone through this or felt this.

I (25F) am with the man (25M) of my dreams, the man I wanna marry and am going to marry. I love him, and he loves me. He treats me how I always wanted boyfriends in the past to treat me: respects me, listens to me, shows me he loves me every day in many different ways, gives me space when i need it, does everything he can to make my happy, the list goes on and on. He‚Äôs perfect for me.

In the past, every single relationship I had was bad. Toxic, full of manipulation, deceit, cheating, and I was most affected by being abandoned over and over. I still slightly suffer from some of the effects of abandonment, but my current boyfriend never makes me feel like he‚Äôs gonna leave me and I do feel secure with him. 

This relationship i‚Äôm in, in my head, doesn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. Because to me, relationships were always full of negativity, anxiety, chasing the man and him chasing me, toxic games, etc. I know logically my current relationship is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and how it should be, but in my head it feels abnormal because I‚Äôve never had anything like this.

It‚Äôs not a problem necessarily, I don‚Äôt doubt my current relationship at all. Sometimes I just think about how different it feels, and I scare myself that something may be wrong with it, but I know it‚Äôs not.

I now fully understand why some people choose to be with toxic people, and run from relationships that are healthy. I‚Äôm not planning that, I‚Äôd never leave my boyfriend unless something horrible happened. But after a few unstable relationships it really is all you know, and that‚Äôs your normal.

Two months ago I (M20) met this girl (F21) online during lockdown, she doesn't live in the same country I live in but she'll come working here very soon so this wouldn't even be the main concern. Since I wasn't really looking for romantic relationships online, rather connections in general cause I felt lonely during lockdown at times, I didn't really prepare for this to happen. But I met her and we got along very well. Since neither of us really went into this looking for a relationship (we're both single though) it was never something we talked about. Still... we called a lot and I think I let myself go a little (hard to know whether she'd say the same about herself). And given that during lockdown I couldn't really see my friends that frequently (I usually mainly rely on them with my attachment needs) I felt lonely and that girl kind of washed that all away. Which is also why I noticed that I'm too dependent emotionally and in terms of my needs on her (even though it's ""just"" an online thing).

Okay so to get closer to my actual question... she's been acting distant lately and that could be because of the exam stress for her but those are over now and I don't feel like that changed. I noticed that I've been feeling very anxious about her being distant and checking how long she takes to reply and stuff. The usual ""anxious attachment"" kind of things. I'm guessing though that this is connected to how dependent I am on her in terms of my needs (for the past two months at least). We did have a conversation about that two days ago where I told her that I've been feeling anxious and also worried about her cause I felt like she's been distancing herself. She didn't deny that but she was genuinely surprised and told me she didn't really notice she was distancing herself and apologized for making me feel anxious (where I think it's not necessarily fair for her to apologize cause this is more about me but anyways).
Lockdown is slowly being lifted here and I'm allowed to meet my friends again, met them for the first time in ages yesterday, and while being with them all the anxiety was completely washed away and especially the dependent feeling too. Now that I'm back home I feel like I'm in lockdown mode again and the anxiety creeps into my brain again. But I'm optimistic that meeting my friends more often from now on will really help me.
To get to my question now... she's been acting distant maybe cause we've been getting closer to each other (which is nothing more than my narrative but I feel like it's true) and I'm usually more of the avoidant kind of person in terms of attachment so I only really developed this anxious style during lockdown. Meaning, especially when she said she didn't really notice how she was being more distant, I felt that and I could relate but I also know that during a time where one has this avoidant mindset, every attempt to get close is exactly what pushes them away because of their fear.

After giving it a lot of thought I think that I do genuinely like her beyond the dependancy I developed during lockdown. I have no idea whether she thinks the same about me or not .. maybe not at all but what I want is clarity and also if I shoot my shot, I want the best chances possible. Meaning if I was in an avoidant mindset personally and someone asks me out I'm out of there despite maybe wanting it (= low chances if I'd ask right now)
I'm not saying my chances are high, but I want opinions on how you'd maneuver my situation? If she distances herself even when she didn't really realize that... she's implicitly communicating that she needs distance meaning my plan would be to rely more on my friends again now that I get the chance and give her some time and distance. And then maybe after some time ""shoot my shot"" or at least tell her that I think I like her and ask for her thoughts on that and on me/us.
What do you think is the right thing to do? And how would you maneuver someone being in that avoidant mindset? (assuming that's what it is, maybe she is just distancing herself in general cause she is not interested)
And do you think there's already damage done due to me communicating that I feel anxious? (Something I was worried about)

I started seeing someone and we hit it off really well a couple months ago. Our dates were typically 5-7 hours, he had a lot of green flags, and I truly felt I could be myself and be appreciated for who I was around him. He told me some pretty personal things, valued open communication, wasn‚Äôt afraid to be vulnerable, and listened and supported me through a really tough meltdown. He seemed to really put in the effort. As someone whose love language is quality time, this was a pretty special connection for me. I had never felt that same amount before with anybody else! He told me directly that he liked me and I said the same later. 

Long story short, he suddenly withdrew and stopped talking as much, saying he can‚Äôt make any commitments *at all*. I chalked it up to him being sick and busy and also stepped back and kept myself busy with other things - but he still said he wanted to continue to talk/hang out. This felt better until it kept continuing and I realized I was increasingly becoming an afterthought. If I didn‚Äôt start the conversation or suggestion hanging out, I felt like he wouldn‚Äôt nor would he mind never seeing me again. It was very very low effort on his end. After thinking about it, I sent him some messages saying that while I really enjoyed our connection and it was special to me, I think I deserve to be treated better, especially since when I said I liked him back, I said it doesn‚Äôt have to be serious or get labels, I just want what we had to continue and he agreed. I felt pretty disappointed when he treated me SO well and didn‚Äôt communicate that he actually didn‚Äôt plan on continuing it (when he said he would communicate clearly about everything). Anyway, I said I‚Äôd rather rip the bandage off now if this is how it‚Äôll continue to be. And if so, good luck and I wish good things for him. He never replied. 

It‚Äôs been a little over a week and I know he‚Äôs seen my texts. We are still Snapchat friends and he‚Äôs been active on social media. I previously had deleted his number and blocked his Facebook, but last night I felt so sad and hurt over how I was treated. I wanted answers and felt really insecure. I texted ‚ÄúHey, can we talk?‚Äù around midnight and he hasn‚Äôt responded. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt but I really need advice/motivation on how to not do that again. 

So far, here are the various pieces of advice that I‚Äôve been given:
- I did that right thing because I deserve someone who puts as much effort as I do. If he really wanted to, he would do so like at the beginning when he was trying to get me on his hook
- He has issues of his own that I am not responsible for. He may have great green flags in the beginning, but the overall red flag of him being different later is concerning and wastes time
- its ok to grieve because it came out of the blue and I didn‚Äôt have time to prepare for it, whether he was official in my life or not. If he were to say for some reason yes it was fake and he lied the whole time, that won‚Äôt fix anything
- acknowledge the pain 
- take this time to focus on yourself 

Personally, the most effective ones are the arguments that I can use to talk myself out of not contacting him again, but then the hopeful part of me also tries really hard.

Should i do sm online flower delivery thingy?? Is it too soon to do this?

She likes different kinds of bands for her hairs to tie them up, Should i amazon her sm stuff for hairs?? Will it be more meaningful if i gave her these when we meet in person??

Reinstalled Tinder again, although I know it will most likely be of no use. I've met one of the two on Tinder, though, so who knows. Here's the catch:

Every single time I restart Tinder, I get a couple of likes/matches over the course of the first day(s), but as soon as those are over, it plummets. Getting matches becomes pretty impossible and if there isn't a suitable match, it's fruitless and usually delete the app for a while.

I'm not ugly by any means and in real life I'm pretty sociable and likeable.
