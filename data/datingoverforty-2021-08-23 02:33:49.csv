1. Stop posting memes as your pics (if I wanted to look at memes, then I'll go to a meme site)
2. Stop posting pics of your kids!!!
(I'm here to date you, not your kids. Also you are making your children more vulnerable to pedophiles and sex trafficking)
3. Blur out faces that aren't you ( did you get aunt Maggie's permission to post her pic?)
4. Stop taking selfies from below. If you can't take the time to take a decent selfie from somewhere other than the couch, it just shows laziness
5. Take pics of you doing what you enjoy: don't show me the fish you caught, show me you fishing
6. Post a cleaned up pic. Show me you take pride in your appearance.
7. Stop posting pics of your cars, trucks, bikes, boats. You are only attracting gold diggers...JS
8. Be honest about what you are looking for. Don't lie and say you want an LTR when in reality you just want a hook-up. Liars are a turn-off

We had plans to spend Saturday evening together and he had a charity car wash and asked if I'd stop by at 2, if not meet him at his house at 4pm.

Nothing after that. Not one word. Radio Silence. 

So, after 2 days of non-communication, and seeing him active on FB messenger the entire time, I just unfriended, blocked, and left.

10,pa0562,1629726358,Advice requested,"So I'm a 43m single father of 2 (sole custody) back into OLD after a 17 year disaster of a marriage and a cancelled engagement to someone that had a problem with telling the truth.  I've met someone I really like.  We've been out on 6 dates so far and seem super compatible with a lot in common.  My issue is that she put her status on her OLD profile as Separated and on our first date she told me her divorce was almost complete, she was just waiting to get the final paperwork to finalize things, and it was due ""any day now"".

While talking the other night, she mentioned a conversation with her STBx she'd had where he said that he was still hoping for reconciliation and I asked her some questions about what paperwork she'd received back from the court.  Unfortunately, in comparing notes I learned she hasn't received anything back from the court in several months and that the ex had told her that he'd handle the divorce filing for them, as he had gone through a divorce previously.  She said she'd paid him money for the filing fees and had filled out the initial paperwork to get the ball rolling, but it looks like he never filed it and has been stringing her along and lying to her for the last several months, and he has now gone silent when she asked him about it.  Note: they split up 6 months ago and haven't been cohabitating during this time.

Since finding this out I have told her that I am very uncomfortable dating someone that is still married and isn't even in the divorce ""process"" as of now.  We also reside in an at-fault divorce state and I do not want to have a relationship with her potentially used against us by an angry spouse.  I have told her that I want to put our relationship on pause until this issue is cleared up.  She was unsurprisingly upset about this and is talking about how angry she is at her ex.  Did I handle this correctly?  I have no intention of using this as an excuse to see anyone else, but I feel like it was the only sensible and responsible thing to do given the situation?  Any advice on how I could've or should've handled this?

"" Got a thing to go to, beautiful hotel suite, nice meal booked in a restaurant with the big boss and 2 colleagues with their plus 1s, all on expenses a  free weekend away, will be taking the 2+2 and the day after dropping into a car museum for lunch and a wander round on the way home, will need to share a bed, but we have all done that before at parties and tenting etc so it won't be over weird for us lot haha ... Anyone up for it?"" 
So a female friend was first to stick her hand up...

 "" sounds great, will dump the kids with their grandparents, how posh is the restaurant?"" 

So we had a great weekend, fed, entertained, museum and a good sing along in the car while driving, just a fun weekend with a friend. 

Then today I had a couple of site visits to do, as I was driving along the south of London I went past Greenwich Royal Observatory and Maritime Museum, last time I visited I was a school kid, thought to myself I would like to revisit there some time soon. Wonder if anyone else would like to go?

Which got me thinking would it work for dating as well as friends? I don't use OLD as it's just not for me the current popular format, too many bad dates and bad conversation put me off it, people just weren't who they said they were it seemed. Yes I do have a history of attracting hot crazy messes which has been a lifelong issue, OLD amplified that problem.

 But I think that any woman who fancies a walk around Greenwich maritime museum and observatory must be somewhere on my radar of agreeable personality. So perhaps we need site where we can do the above. So many threads about people not coming up with original date ideas, or not making moves to arrange a date. Chuck your idea out there, nail your colours to the mast pardon the pun, and see who likes the activity idea. This way the date and activity is right there in the open from the outset.

a bit drunk so bear with this long ass weird ass story and post.

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 months ago I, 40F,  started talking with a guy 42M (SCEM, a jovial loving tease to him being a stupid crayon eating marine which i respect him a shit ton for) I met him in one of my Facebook groups.¬† He was really nice, not creepy and super interesting. Has been all over the world as a marine, works in the same industry as me, laid back raver hippie kinda of guy, just a mega cool dude. very respectful and genuinely curious about my life and my thoughts, feelings, projects.  After a week or so of texting a few times a day he asked me for a date.¬† He lived over an hour and a half away and I had recently gotten out of an on again off again abuse situation and was not at all looking to date. I also could tell he was from a much higher economic status than me and was embarrassed.  at the time i lived on a 56 acre farm and was a total bumpkin. im cute and smart and awesome, pretty creatively talented, with a killer rack  but im so so stupid innocent naive and bumpkiny.  its the one flaw about me i hate the most and gets exploited to fuck and back.

&amp;#x200B;

I was honest and open about this and he still continued to keep in touch with me everyday or every couple of days, not pressuring me just being kind and genuinely interested.¬† My Mom was extremely sick with breast cancer at the time and my home life was a MESS. I was having a quite difficult time. SCEM kept in contact with me daily and we bonded over music, art, politics, our mutual profession and soooo much more.¬† About 2 months later he again asked for a date and I told him I would enjoy that very much but the logistics were bad.¬† Somehow he and I became a part of each others daily lives regardles still not yet meeting face to face.¬† It's worth mentioning he has messaged me every single day since January 2021 before 8am to tell me good morning and check in with each other on how we feel about life in general.

 4 months into us now talking everyday, I ended up moving to the to the city where SCEM works tob restart my life.¬† My BFF since middle school lives here, she is literally my heart and soul and biggest champion and that was my reason, not him for chosing this city.  It's still an hour commute from his home to the city.¬† When I finally met SCEM I was blown away.¬† He is so successful and strong and inspiring to me.¬† We started to see each other on the weekends and once or twice a week after work he would stop by.¬† I'm only 2 miles away from his work.¬†¬†

He would take me to expensive hotels on the weekends and we would drink beer or eat mushrooms and talk about amazing things. I felt so bonded and close to him.¬† He would send me packages and gifts addressed to ""Beautiful Horse\_Apple"" (using my real name).¬† Still texting me all day everyday usually as soon as he woke up which could be as early as 4:30 or 5am.

This man would seriously text me before he got 2 blocks away from dropping me off after a date to tell me how pretty I looked or how much I inspired his mind.¬† We made so many plans for the future and our goals aligned very well.¬† Several times he told me he loved me.¬† I even got to meet his teenage son a few times and his son asked me if I was his dad's girlfriend and SCEM confirmed this right in front of me.¬† We were intimate many times and it was always out of the park banging hot good times.

So about 4 weeks ago he started to flake on all of our plans.¬† He stopped texting me as much and it was nearly ghost level.¬†i totally get it that he is very busy with work, being a single dad, operating several side hustles (work we want to do together eventually i thought, in short ecommerce industry).  i also want him to take down time for fun.  but at some point he could have made some time for me and just has NOT.  but yet -  He just signed a year lease on a home near my neighborhood and we have plans to work on a budding business.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

 Then last week I caught him texting another girl on Facebook he had never even met about taking her for dinner and telling her he was single.¬† I called him out.¬† He told me he thought it was me setting him up (like for real dude, we're 40, people don't do that) so he played along.¬† I stopped answering his texts and eventually after a few days he apologized and said once he moves up here we can talk.¬† I responded finally and told him I truly felt like after 10 months we had a real emotional connection and the fun together in person was unreal and I absolutely accepted him without conditions as he is.  I told him if he could go forward with me being 100% honest then if he lived in a cardboard box with 100 other girl friends I would still be fascinated by everything he had to say and listen to all his hopes, dreams, thoughts and problems with an open heart.¬† He replied ""on fleek"" as a 42 year old man.¬† Fucking seriously, wtf does that even mean in that context like what a crayon eater.

I can not figure out why someone would put all of that effort, time, cash and emotion into another person just to drop them like that.¬† nearly 10 months of daily contact literally from sun up to sun down is a big emotional investment in my eyes.  We never had any arguments and were vocal about how we respected each other a lot.¬† I feel like this is a lot my issue being perhaps codependent on narcissistic people but I also feel like he probably met someone he was more into and I should let it go and be happy someone I care so much for found something that makes them feel fulfilled.¬† Its hard.  he moves in two weeks.  i almost want to wait it out and see what he says but I kinda think at this point if I respect myself I would suck it up and work on moving on.

After a breakup your ex is to you essentially heroin, cocaine , This person is a like highly addictive drug and you are a junkie and you‚Äôll do anything to get your fix even though you know it‚Äôs terrible for you to do so 

All you want to do is , kiss them , hug them and tell them your sorry and can we get back  together every thing is going to be alright 

Your ex can give you a your ‚Äúfix‚Äù through many means- calls, texts, face time, snapchats, tweets , phone calls and even meeting for coffee and even meeting then for some loving in the bedroom department 

Just like any junkie, you need to detox in order to recover. And the best way to detox is to quit¬†cold turkey. 

You will never move on with this person right there in front of you. 

Including in this is you may also ruin your chances of getting back together and making it last this time, but do you seriously want than when you analyse your relationship and potentially starting from scratch with another 

When a relationship ends, all the reasons it ended are still there that‚Äôs fact 

The issues didn‚Äôt magically repair themselves. If you get back together because you miss each other nothing will be different and you‚Äôll just go through the same cycle of breaking up and making up‚Ä¶ and this can go on for years!

I‚Äôve seen a few posts from others having the same issue I am so apologies if you‚Äôre tired of reading. üòÜ I‚Äôm at a bit of a loss and hoping this doesn‚Äôt turn into a ramble session, so here goes. 

I‚Äôm 44, never been married, no kids. I consider myself to be a very social, honest and just a good person to have around‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm certain the people in my life would say the same.  I‚Äôve been single for about 6 years now, lost my dad 5 years ago and I‚Äôve only been on a few dates since then for a few reasons. Part of that being the grief process and feeling as though I need to have myself together before I can really be in a relationship, but then a lot of it is not really knowing how to ‚Äúput myself out there,‚Äù which is what my friends have told me I should do. I started doing OLD initially in the late 90s and realized a few years back that that arena has changed *immensely* in the way of expectations and general dishonesty. However, I have tried to give it a chance. I‚Äôve met a few people, but things were less than ideal. From married people to catfish to one who stood me up (literally left me sitting in a restaurant after we‚Äôd been talking for about a week over text and the phone), my experience hasn‚Äôt been great.

So all that to say I‚Äôm pretty gun shy now and not sure which direction to take. I don‚Äôt really meet people the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù way for any other purpose than platonic (which the pandemic obviously made worse), part of that has to do with me being a military brat in Alabama and having different views than a lot of people think I should  have (which is another show in itselfüòÇ). I get the ‚ÄúWhy are you single? You‚Äôre such a catch!‚Äù all the time, but here I am talking to strangers on the internet about being single. 

TL;DR At this stage in my life, being a very social and open and outgoing person, I feel like a hamster on a wheel who may soon become a spinster. Anybody have any advice and/or in the same situation and want to talk about it?

I matched/have been talking with someone. We have kept the talking to pretty surface level, but a little back and forth each each. That‚Äôs what we both prefer until meeting. We were supposed to meet last week for a quick drink but had to cancel due to weather. We are back on for this week. He has been extremely polite and kind, certainly made an effort to initiate, though I also do too.

But the thing is, he‚Äôs incredibly fit and I‚Ä¶am not. I‚Äôm talking borderline bodybuilder/fitness/gym/running guy. Very good looking facially too and tall. Like I said, he is kind, polite and has good job.

Me - what most would say a very beautiful face, never had any complaints there. I am certainly curvy in a womanly way - large chest and thighs, shaped appropriately overall but just‚Ä¶also a bit fat to be completely honest. I also have a good job and he has shown some interest in that. I am also very active, healthy and I spend lots of my free time outdoors.

Soon after exchanging numbers, he said the two other times he met women from an app, they did not match their pictures and could I send some recent ones. All of mine were recent, but I understood his concern and honestly, why not be fully honest. So I walked right into my bathroom, took a full body shot (clothed!) and a face selfie. He replied ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù. That is the only thing he has said in reference to my looks. I‚Äôve sent a couple more ‚Äúfun‚Äù current pics that showed my entire body.

I can‚Äôt help but be worried he will be turned off in person, that I‚Äôm fatter than he‚Äôs expecting. I‚Äôve been fully honest but I can‚Äôt help but think he‚Äôs drawn in by my face and will be turned off by my body.

I know, I know.. I won‚Äôt know until I meet him and be confident. Normally, I am very confident. I am beautiful and plenty are into my body, but am I being unreasonable in my fear? Any woman who has been rejected because of her size can understand and I hope others reading this can try to sympathize/shed some honest light for me. Oh and one last detail, I saw a pic that showed part of his ex and and is literally the opposite body type from me (very thin, small chest -very beautiful).

Let me add that because of his ongoing inability to include me in his life I‚Äôve been less inclined to allow him in mine; just weeks ago telling him I didn‚Äôt trust him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I knew he wouldn‚Äôt steal or damage property but I didn‚Äôt trust he wasn‚Äôt going to hurt me. . I feel like just having his brother with him for the night, should have been something he brought up to me prior to it taking place. . If you knew your girlfriend didn‚Äôt trust you yet she allowed you the opportunity to have access to her house while she was away - wtf wouldn‚Äôt you communicate your comings and going‚Äôs rather than risk losing her???? !!!!  I still don‚Äôt understand why he didn‚Äôt just get up after the movie and go to the other room where a bed of his own was waiting???.. Even went so far as to tell him I felt sort of betrayed, if you will. I don‚Äôt even Understand what these feelings are that I‚Äôm having but i do know they aren‚Äôt good. To top it off his grand response was ‚Äúhe isn‚Äôt going to explain himself or argue over his brother‚Äù. Wow!  Okay. Meanwhile he slipped having said ‚ÄúI believe that was the first time he slept in your bed‚Äù.   When I asked for clarification not once but three times- he ignored me every time. He also tried using a story I told him about my son when he was an adolescent; having shared a bed with his best friend. Mind you his example was of my son and when he was like 11yo.  IMO not a comparison. Am I over reacting?

67,pbpq1o,1629942908,What advice will you give to friend of mine !,"Hi everyone, 

So I have been following dating groups here on Reddit and thought of sharing a situation my friend is in. He gathered a lot of courage to open up to me. So I will maintain the confidentiality. 

He is 30 years old, married with a 4 years old kid. He belongs to typical Indian family where marriage are arranged and people are still not open to acceptance about other things.  He is well educated and forward thinking person who like to connect intellectually with people and considers himself sapiosexual. Unfortunately his wife is typical homely Indian girl and doesn't have the intellect in the areas my friend craves. 

Anyways, he had to move to US for work and there was this gap for a year before his family could be with him. During that time he met with a woman who is 50 years old. They started taking and according to him, her independent, thoughtful nature and intellectual levels made him fall for her. Apparently, the lady is divorced and has 3 kids and she has fallen in love with him as well. The lady was made aware that he is married and has no intention of getting divorced. But she was already exploring the non monogomy when they met and since she met him, she again went exclusive with him. 

Now here is where things get interesting. My friend has no intention of getting divorced. ( The social norms and family tradition and respects along with his love for his kid being the reason ). But on the other hand he has never felt so strong about the lady whom he is seeing and had relationship with for past few months. However, he is sure that he can't open up about these things to his wife or anyone else in family as they are very orthodox. 

Given the situation whats the best advice one can give for my friend. His idea is to keep things going as they are but he feels guilty of cheating in a marriage. It's a messy situation and I really couldn't give any firm advice on this.

68,pbrqjt,1629950285,Some perspective on my living situation vis-a-vis dating,"I (M41) was wondering if I could get some of your perspectives on my living situation and what you think and it and my dating. About my situation:
Wife and I are living in separate rooms and have been for two years with no physical intimacy but we are good friends and okay with seeing other people now and we open with each other about it. 
We have two young boys (7 &amp; 4). Despite living together, we try to split parenting time for boundaries.
We plan on moving out into separate homes but slowly since we want to live near each so the kids can walk over. 
We will get a divorce once we feel we need to (taxes, loving apart, significant other wishes) but not rushing it- we don't want any fighting and have done remarkable well so far.
She has a long distance boyfriend whom I text with (primarily to reassure him about our situation)

About me: I just started OLD. How much and when should I bring this up when dating? Profile, texting or in person? Id prefer to date someone divorced with kids b/c it seems like a lot for someone that hasn't gone through this at some point.

74,pc19jj,1629990071,"I call coincidences like this ""the incredible shrinking globe""","I've been friends with a co-worker --Elise (late 40's)-- since transferring to a new country in fall 2019. Elise started dating an American guy --Eric (late 40's)-- in the next-town-over, about a 90m journey through public transport, in Feb. 2020. Lately, she has been traveling to him for the weekend about twice a month, and he to her for the weekend about once a month, so they are together nearly every weekend. 

Our company has a generous transfer program, and a huge office in the next-town-over. Our window for applying is September to November, with moves from June to August. Elise has been thinking about it. Eric has been encouraging it. I'm sure they talked about moving in, but I don't know how confirmed that was.

First work day for new transfers, Monday, Elise is in the front and I'm in the back of a RideShare with a new colleague --Dianne-- who has transferred from the next-town-over's office. Dianne is talking about how she went down for a last weekend hurrah to see folks there who were leaving the country. A few of them went to Starbucks¬Æ to hang out, where they ran into a local language teacher who had taught/ assisted all of them. They also encountered an American guy who worked at a company in our industry.  
Dianne says,   
""Oh! LocalLanguage Teacher (LLT) sent me a picture -- she's started dating that American!""  
Hands her phone around -- it's a pic of LocalLanguage Teacher, in a pool, with her arms around Eric.  
\----------  
I wanted to end my post there, with the ""dramatic reveal,"" but there is a little more.

Elise says, ""Oh, I know him.""  
Dianne, ""How well? The LLT (20's) seems to really like him. Is he a good guy?""  
Elise: ""Well, I thought so ...""  
Dianne: ""She says that he said he hadn't been dating for about 18 months. How did you meet him?""  
Elise (in the front of the car, looks back at me,) ""Well, I've been seeing him for the last 18 months.""

Dianne is speechless.

Elise gets LLT's contact info and once we get to work, texts her using the app we all use in this country. They exchange about 4 texts.  
Elise: ""We've been seeing each other for over a year.""  
LLT: ""But you live in a different city!""  
LLT says she has to go to the gym but she'll get back to Elise.   
Elsie's text: ""I don't have time for cheaters and liars. I'm done with him and with you.""  
\-----  
*Bonus ending:*   
RideShare home from work today (Thursday). Elise's phone chirps. Eric is messaging Elise's phone number:   
""Hi Sweetheart! Why did you block me on the texting app? I miss you. I miss your kisses. When can I see you again?""  
Elise is furious -- HOW did her get her phone number?   
Dianne and I say at the same time, ""BLOCK HIM!""  
And, she does.

*Since I should have a question for everyone-- what did Elise miss?*   
*As a good friend, how can I help her?*

I totally believe that LLT and Eric had been together for quite a while. They didn't randomly meet at a Starbucks¬Æ -- they randomly met people from our company and Eric warned LLT to ""play it cool.""

75,pc2scc,1629994618,Taking dating nice and slow‚Ä¶.but I really miss sex!,"Upfront request: please, NO creepy chats or messages!

I (47F) am taking my time navigating the dating thing after a looooong marriage. I do get consistent interest, but have figured out by now that this new dating world is extremely different from when I started dating my ex-spouse 25 years ago. What might seem quite promising at the beginning can quickly dissolve for the most random reasons or none at all, so I‚Äôm taking it nice and slow and just enjoying the experience of meeting guys for coffee and convo or whatnot. It‚Äôs been nice to just chill and get to know someone.  I don‚Äôt want to rush to the sex part until it feels right and natural according to the pace and dynamic as things evolve. 

On the other hand I really miss sex. Like, a lot. So there‚Äôs a tension there. 

How do you ladies approach this phase? Prematurely sleeping with someone I‚Äôm getting to know with the general intention of cultivating a LTR can ruin the relationship potential from my perspective. So do you have casual encounters while doing the dating thing? Or while you‚Äôre getting to know someone, when you realize it isn‚Äôt a LTR fit, do you shift the dynamic to a physical short-term NSA thing instead of moving on?

So after a few years not dating I'm finding myself getting the itch again to do so (i'm 49M).  Thing is I live in a small town where you recognize strangers/people you don't know.  Most people keep to themselves but there are neighborhood watchdogs who like to know everything about everyone.  I grew up in a large, metropolitan city and I have not gotten over this fact.

81,pc7z1x,1630010116,OLD date,"This happened a while ago but I don't know why I have remembered it today.

Met someone on. OLD, had a few text chats and arranged to meet at a pub. It was an Irish pub and there was some football on the screen.

I got there first and I ordered a drink. He was a few minutes late. I settled in and started watching football. He came in and said a quick hello before going to the bar to order his drink. He came back and hardly said a few words before pulling out his phone and started texting/reading/playing on his phone. 

There was an hour between my date and my next appointment. I prefer to have something else to do after dates. It makes it easier for me to make excuses but also incase things don't go well as was the case this time. I ended up watching football for an hour and made my excuses to get out.

He followed me to my car and asked for a lift to his apartment. I was uncomfortable but I didn't say no. I drove him to his place and he invited me in. I politely refused and reminded him that I had things to do. He asked me what I was doing after my thing and I replied that I was going home. He didn't seem pleased and TOLD me, I should come back to his apartment after my thing.

Now I don't know how he thought this date went well. I still struggle to understand what I said or did that gave him the impression that I was going to sleep with him. The few sentences we exchanged included me pointing out that his profile pictures were a few years out of date. He had put on quite a bit of weight and had a few wrinkles and he had lost a bit of hair. None of these physical traits would matter to me if he was he was honest about them in the first place.

I think this was one of the strange dates that I have had. I can't even remember if I sent him a message after the date or if I ghosted him. Well, it's one of those things",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pc7z1x/old_date/

87,pcci1k,1630025067,"[53M] Being the step-parent, one man's story","tl;dr at the bottom.

This is long.

I have a friend who‚Äôs a couples counselor, he told me, ‚Äúthe toughest job as a parent is the role of step-parent.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt lying.

Flash backwards 9 years. I met my now ex, her kids were 3 and 4 when we met. I don‚Äôt have kids of my own and I instantly bonded with them. I dated their mom for a little over 7 years. For a few of those years, we all lived together. It was a whole new ballgame. No sleeping late, ever. But, you know what, it was okay, because they were, and are, awesome kids.

When we broke up they were 11 and 12. I‚Äôd been in their lives way more than I hadn‚Äôt. Their mom and I broke up about six months before Covid hit. I moved out. The plan all along was for the breakup to be amicable and me to stay in their lives. Even during Covid, the kids and I would FaceTime, or play games online, or do the Disney thing where you watch a movie at the same time. It was pretty cool, especially since I couldn‚Äôt see them in person.

For a time during Covid we discussed getting back together. Well, that fell apart, and probably for the best. We were definitely arguing more towards the end of the relationship.

Fourteen months into Covid, she texts me and says we needed to talk. She called and told me she was seeing someone, and since it was a mutual friend of ours, she wanted me to hear it from her first. Fine. I honestly just want her and the kids to be happy. I told her when we broke up, ‚ÄúI love you enough to let you go.‚Äù I meant it. 

So, a little after that phone call, I texted her because her son‚Äôs birthday was coming up and I asked her what he wanted for his birthday.

She said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get him a present.‚Äù Basically with that, I was cut out of their lives.

We never married. I had no recourse, no legal ground, nothing I could do if I wanted to see the kiddos and she didn‚Äôt want me to. It took a while for that to sink in, when it did, it hurt. A lot.

For that reason, I don‚Äôt think I could ever date a person with young kids again. Because I don‚Äôt want to go through that loss again.

Her kids could call me in 10 years and I‚Äôd still do anything for them if they needed my help.

Anyway, I hope there‚Äôs some people out there who can identify with my story. I just needed to vent.

Good luck out there.

tl;dr If you date someone with kids long term and breakup, be prepared to have your heart broken in a way that is way worse than breaking up with just your significant other.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pcci1k/53m_being_the_stepparent_one_mans_story/

We chat, we laugh, we discover a lot of common interests, it was fun. He walks me to my car and we end up standing there (in the drizzling rain!) chatting for another solid half hour. We part with a nice hug - ok I think, maybe my leaning towards him and my my touching his upper arm and forearm were too subtle.

He texts me the following day telling me he had a great time. I reply that I too had a great time and would like to see him again. He immediately asks me if I'm free on Thursday of the following week, his first night with no kids (he's got partial custody). We make plans and we end up texting about every other day, sometimes more, he initiates more than I do.

So date two comes around and we have to work around the weather and move to an indoor venue and grab drinks/food. Not my first choice as there is now a table between us. Anyways, the evening goes much like the first. Lots of laughter, lots of things to talk about, we are in there for four hours or so. He walks me to my car and again we end up standing there another half hour or so talking. He asks me ""are you free tomorrow?"" and proceeds to invite me to his regular board game night with his friends (I love board games, he knows that, is one of the things we have in common). I am free, so I agree. I initiated a hug upon meeting earlier in the evening, I'm expecting he will initiate at least another hug now. Nope, he wishes me goodnight and walks away. Wtf.

I'm really confused. It's starting to feel like he has no romantic interest and just sees me as a (potential) friend. But why invite me to an evening with his friends? Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't introduce random guy I had a couple dates with to my friends.

I know no one here is a mind reader, but what do you think might be going on here? He's been divorced for two years, not sure how much dating he has done in that period. Maybe he's out of practice? I think I'm gonna kiss him on the cheek when I see him tonight. But I don't want to assault him if he's not into me üòÜ.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pcqodo/is_this_guy_interested_or_does_he_just_want_a/
