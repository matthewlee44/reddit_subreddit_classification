0,qmkmrl,1636032676,I'm dating a flake,"I (m21)saw her(f26) at a work event and she asked for my number. For a few weeks I tried to set up dates and finally we went on one. This was a great date and she even told me that she enjoyed it and couldn't wait to go on another one. My issue here is occasionally she will flake out on me. For example I made her favorite food last night and invited her over because she said she wanted to see me. I cleaned my apartment and everything was set for a nice evening. She ends up not responding for hours and suddenly says she's just going to get panda express. This pissed me off. I haven't even responded to her last text and I'm not sure if I should. I feel like ghosting her or giving an ultimatum. We've been dating for a month now and I feel like if she invited me over I'd be there no problem. But when I try to set up stuff with her it's like pulling teeth. It's like when she wants to see me she wants me to go sleep over and keep her company but when I need it , she's not available. What do I do?


TL/DR
 
I am dating a flakey woman who is hard to make plans with. Should I just ghost her for now, or ultimatum?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmkmrl/im_dating_a_flake/

I went in after him to brush my teeth and wash my face, when I noticed my toothbrush was all wet. I figured he accidentally splashed it but just wanted to double check. I asked if he used my toothbrush and he said yes!! He didn't ask if he could or even bother to tell me he'd used it. I wouldn't let my closest friend use my toothbrush, that is so disgusting to me. He tried to justify it by saying we'd kissed but... it's not the same babe. I don't want your plaque and old food in my mouth. This being disgusting isn't even what has me most concerned, its the way he was so comfortable violating my space and belongings without even asking me.

My new boyfriend[30M] seems to have ED. He can only stay hard for a bit like less than a minute during penetration sex certain words stimulation can help him but it doesn't last long either. I am not sure if it is caused by his mental problem (OCD) or this is something more serious. 

I feel I truly like him and satisfied with relationship in most aspects. I'm 28F and don't have a lot of experience in this area. I'm also looking to have serious relationship and get married someday. But this problem seems to bother me and make me feel he's less manly.

24,qmnmvc,1636041218,Should I seek dating therapy?,"So I am dating this girl locally (we met 3 times and last time we held hands) and i am \~40 and dating options are limited.

When I told my friend about it she said I am doing it all wrong. She said, we should be texting eachother everyday since thats what happens when both people like eachother. she said when she dated (shes married) she and her now husband texted eachother everyday. She said she went to therapy too for dating stuff and it was very helpful (before she met her now husband).

I think she is hanging up on:

1. Not texting everyday - if she likes me she would text me everyday and me too.
2. What I look for is out of whack. She says wanting to have a family or age requirement shouldn't be there because it could cause unhappy marriage.
3. Also mentioning how getting older means limited options, how women have requirements too like age etc. she says i have the wrong perspective on this. I mean salary, age, occupation requirements are hard things therapy can't solve right?
4. Culture difference. The local girl i am dating is from another country- came to US 10 years ago and is 32(i was born there too but i am more americanized since i came here at 9). I know some of the stuff that do happen or expectations are more culture based but my friend says therapy can help... I dont know if therapy can help when some ""oddities"" people perceive are from dating culture perspective though?

She then said : ""as i have stated previously, you have no hope of finding a lasting relationship until you get therapy, not to be mean.your perspective on all this is so completely wrong and you don't even see it ""

I know she means well and we get along super well at work. Maybe because she did therapy so she feels she got married and happily it is fine. Maybe shes right idk.

26,qmnuup,1636041765,I need help plz,"Okay this may be a Lil different than the posts found here. The story goes like this...

I've been studying for a professional exam and the syllabi is very very big. So I had to skip college and stay at home for literally nearly 5 or more months without human contact. (besides my family ofc.) Except maybe for once when I had to go to the college to submit some docs.

So this began from Jan to now November. Literally 9 or so months without meeting people and all. And above that, i don't have friends and a group cuz I am sorta like a weird nerd guy who doesn't like taking photos and shit. And I don't have this roll with the flow thing my friends have cuz I like planning things and getting them done as per the plan for efficiency and all that. And socially awkward too. I can't talk as much as I am chatting as i am doing right now.

 I can open up much more online but then I feel that it actually feels like the receiver of my text would actually think I'm taking stuff cuz it's the internet and shit. I know it cuz I think the same way. I don't take seriously anything i find online or recorded. 

Although it has given me a tacit psychological advantage over my friends who went ahead to become alcoholics and smokey people, and others who don't think ahead before doing shit and literally fuck up every time,(and it's not limited to me thinking I'm smarter than everyone)  this led to me being alone for a way longer time than the above stated 9 months or so. In fact i have been like this since 15 i guess. I'm 19 now. 

Straight to the point, yesterday was the third break from the loneliness of 9 months. (2 being college shit related) So we were taking photos and it was group photos initially. After that, my cousin sister  took a pic with my older brother and then told me to come and take one too. I kinda started freaking out and blanked out for a second  but some errand struck her and she left. The person taking the pics was another sister of mine and I think she noticed this. 

Later that day, i analysed the various reasons why I became so frightened and honestly i didn't have a idea as to why. Is it because I am a introverted person who doesnt like taking photos? Or is it because I am a stupid dumbass who can't do one shit right?

Either case, I feel terrible and wanna change but I think the sheer awkwardness I get when I'm near girls would take more strength than what i have. Can someone tell me why the fuck am I like this?

33,qmopk5,1636043980,"Ladies, here's a dating hack to understanding guys: The reason he may not seem keen on efforting an emotional connection off the bat is because he's burned out trying to do things right, so pursuing intimacy safely solves half his single life problems. You need to show up emotionally, too.","I don't make everything all about getting when I am dating. I pursue a relationship myself and work toward building a genuine connection, and still it does not seem based on actions that many women actually do want that this in the end, which then triggers an existential dating crisis that makes wonder what women actually want if I am pursuing them with the goal of a relationship, trying to build a relationship, taking the time to get to know them, and signaling every possible signal that says, ""Hello, yes I am interested in you. I will make myself emotionally available to growing a relationship with you, and am willing to go through the work to go out on dates,"" only to find out she just ended up hooking up with some other dude she was also talking to who ghosts her after that.

A lot of guys are out there doing what women want a guy to do out there in the dating world, but it's not working, so they get to a point where they are like, ""Why bother wasting my energy on the emotions and coming out discouraged for it when it falls apart, when I should just do what a lot of women I encounter do and take the quick sex wins if I can?

What might help on your end is actually showing up emotionally yourselves (ex: being patient with scheduling dates and not writing guys off if they don't ask you out within a week of matching, being engaging in learning about him rather than having him do all the conversational heavy lifting, texting him first for once, making him feel ""seen"" rather than just like another option floating through your match queue) and then maybe you won't have to worry so much about guys giving you the bare minimum and only wanting to get laid.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmopk5/ladies_heres_a_dating_hack_to_understanding_guys/
34,qmout7,1636044369,How to communicate sexual insecurities to a friend with benefits?,"So, late twenties here. Never had sex in my life (and technically still not). I had many occasions in the past, but did not care because of religious education plus anxiety.

Met this girl I really vibed with. On second date she wants to have sex, in a park. I agree and tell her it was my first time. No problems for her. I perform oral on her and she really enjoyed it. But when it came to penetrate her, my dick became flaccid after wearing a condom. We tried everything, nothing.

Few days ago, we are now in the comfort of the room. She tells me she really enjoyed the oral and fingering sex of a few dates ago. So, I go on her (although it seems I stimulated her peeing too lol) for like an hour or more. I was rock hard without even touching my penis. Actually, I was quite aggressive, as I did not masturbate for almost two weeks, and was quite focused.

I bought new XL condoms, as last time we had difficulty in unrolling them (we checked, it was the right orientation). Nothing, as soon as I start wearing a condom we had difficulty in unwrapping it.

I got anxious, and flop again. I was not able to penetrate her as my dick was again flaccid, and the condom was not inserted well. But we did not persist as the previous time in 'waking' it.

I was quite horny and anxious, so I asked her to perform some oral sex or dry hump. She tried a bit, but then gave up. She did not want too in the end... So, also as the first time, also the second time I did not came, and did not enjoy the experience.

It seems I get too anxious. I do not know what to do. I feel it has to do with a mix of religious belief and going against my family, as well as performance issue as I was hoping the XL condom was going to work.

I am still not comfortable with this girl for sex (I did not enjoy the first two times, too much anxiety, and too much in my head). And, as we agreed is a fwb relation, I am not sure what to tell her. I know she really likes me, and she is comfortable with me. I can ask her anything and she talks a lot. She is always up for hanging out, even if its just a walk and kissing. But if I do not satisfy her sexually, I guess there is no point hanging out.

Should I stop hanging out with her?

I wanted to talk to her about this, although not sure if it is a good idea talking about my issues and still not being comfortable as this is a fwb relation and she can just dump me and find another dude....

So should I communicate with her more?

Thanks!

p.s.

I am going to see a therapist tomorrow, although I will focus more on the anxiety part with them, and will not ask for advice on what to do with my relation with this girl.

But he isn't just a clown and is also smart, he can have deep conversations with you about art, philosophy, physics, history, movies, poetry, politics, maths. You can also have absolutely stupid completely non sense conversations with and the level of perversion in the conversation depends upon your comfort level. He is also pretty confident, like he can give speeches in front of thousands of people without any prep or go and win a debate competition without even studying or lead several legions and invade Gaul in Rome's name. He can also protect you in danger cause he is a black belt in both Karate and Jiu Jitsu. Also if you are a strong girl, he will spar with you.

But he also has some bad things like looks wise he is average ti below average like a 4 or 5 out of ten, also he is short. Around 5 feet 6.5 inches , can look around 5'8"" in shoes.

It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt get dates either. I can go through the motions and usually have a few prospects going on consistently. And on and on.  

My main issue is I can look at hundreds of profiles and not find a single person I‚Äôd be interested in getting to know on a romantic level. Is this weird? I‚Äôm not depressed that I am aware of. Pretty happy with myself. Maybe I only love myself? 

I was married 15 years (together 18), and in a LTR after that for 8. So I‚Äôve been with someone nearly half my life.  And I like having a partner.

40,qmozut,1636044760,How do I communicate my emotional unavailability to someone pursuing me that I like but I'm not willing to be vulnerable with yet?,"Me (27F) and this guy (30M) matched on Bumble years go. Immediately then I got into a relationship with someone else but we kept in touch through the years via social media. By fate we both recently moved back to the state we matched in and we are both single so he asked to finally take me out. 

At first I was really excited and find him really attractive but the more I think about things the more discouraged I feel. After my last breakup 2 years ago I fell into a depression because of how abruptly my ex ended things and I was depressed for a while. I dated people but was super emotionally unavailable and really struggled to bond with guys beyond sex. 

I am now taking heavy classes that are kicking my butt and my self esteem is down in the dumps in general. Because of how busy I've been with studying, I have also been having minimal socializing and have been super isolated and mentally struggling. 

This guy seems great, from a wholesome family, great social life, great career, super understanding when I tell him I'm busy with school etc. And I can just tell I'm going to disappoint him and he deserves someone more lively, upbeat and available. I care enough about him to actually want that for him, while accepting that I might not be good enough to offer that. 

To be honest at my core I'm just afraid of ever being vulnerable with anyone again and giving them a chance to gut me. After my last breakup I promised myself to just keep to myself and be careful to never invest in anyone again. I feel terrified that I like this guy. 
I want to communicate this to him without servering our connection. I'm aware that he's not obligated to wait for me and I won't ask him to, but I'd be open to reconnecting in the future romantically of I ever am ready. 

We have a date this coming weekend that we planned weeks ago and I'm already dressing it. How do I deal with this?

48,qmq2ta,1636047628,Finding Somebody To Love,"Looking back, I feel like I've always had this insecurity about how I seem to take so long to get into a relationship after a failed one.

I've had my fair share of romantic relationships, neither a number to brag about nor feel inadequate about. I've also never really had issues moving on emotionally from failed relationships.

However, between every relationship and the next, there is always what I'd call a ""drought"". During this drought I would find myself having no one to love. I'd put myself out there, in social gatherings and dating apps, but there would be no one who would show me affection. Not a single person would show me that they might be interested in something with me (casual, serious, fwb, etc.)

Granted, I would eventually find one person who shows me that they like me, which would make me so happy, and we'd begin a serious relationship like any other. But the drought always makes me wonder if I'm just terrible relationship material.

These droughts tend to go on for a year or two, and right now I'm in the middle of a drought spanning about 3 years and counting. As much as I absolutely enjoy my life, I've always admired people who can just find a new relationship whenever they're ready, and sometimes even if they're not ready.

Perhaps I really am terrible relationship material, so I'd just have to leave it up to fate to find someone who would want me, or perhaps I'm just really terrible at finding these people myself in general.

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks ago I started chatting with this girl on a dating app. Right away I knew I liked her personality and thought she was beautiful. We both established we were looking for something long term. We met up a week later and holy crap she was incredible and somehow even more beautiful in person. What I figured would be a simple 2 hourish walking date turned into a 10+ hour date! We walked a ton, ate some food, walked more, then sat down to settle at the end of the night to cuddle and talk. I thought it was one of (if not the best) first date I ever had. 

&amp;#x200B;

She gave me her number and we moved to messaging off the app. Had our 2nd date about half a week later during the week and it was another suuuuper long date. Then again about half a week later on the weekend we had our 3rd date and you guessed it, another very long date. All 3 dates we both commented on how time just flew right by as we were having a great time. And there seemed to be physical chemistry too as there was hand holding, cuddling, kissing/making out and she enjoyed it all! Didn't progress to anything too sexual though as I didn't want to rush that aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAYS....we were supposed to have another date about half a week later. Unfortunately she texted me with a bomb that she's been having a ton of fun on our dates but ultimately the romantic feelings just weren't there for her. Then we talked on the phone for a bit where I told her I was really caught off guard by this because I honestly thought she was really into me so I must've misread things. She revealed that she genuinely had an amazing time with me, genuinely was excited for all our dates, and also enjoyed the physical stuff, but the romantic feelings never really came up for her the way she was hoping for and didn't think it was fair for us to continue. And no she hasn't been seeing (or even talking) to any other guys.

This sucks. HARD. And I can't believe how devastated I am over this girl since it's only been 3 dates! I mean 3 weeks ago I didn't even know she existed! And now I'm like comatose which I think is just ridiculous. Thing is that after my very LTR ended last year, all the girls I've seen since then I have felt so little for compared to this most recent one. Like it's not even close. I thought we had a really great thing going that I already started envisioning our future together. I got ahead of myself, I know. I only have myself to blame for that.

64,qms05q,1636052887,Dating a male friend as a woman - should women avoid it? Is it risky?,"I suspect a male friend of mine is interested in me. He is snapchatting me fairly often, always asks if I'm going to certain events and who I'm going with etc. Has asked me out for lunch and is always nice, friendly and a bit flirty in person.

Now, I find this guy funny, nice and attractive. I would absolutely smash if I met him somewhere out in a bar but the problem is that we've known each other for 2 years and we are in the same college courses so things are complicated.


I'm also hesitant due to the friendship, but there could be a possibility he is only friendly toward me because he finds me physically attractive but doesn't really like me or care about me as a person. Should I give him a chance anyway? I just don't want to get too invested and attached, since we are already friends I'm one of those that develop feelings quickly if there's added intimacy to a friendship.

The date on Saturday was great except for when we went back to mine and due to how much alcohol was consumed we weren't able to have sex. We were  both very eager. The next morning he messaged me when he got home but the conversation has been off since then. Everyday I've initiated the conversation and he's responded but it's not flowing as much as before. I like him, I think he's good looking, great kisser and he's one of most interesting people I've ever gone out with and conversation in person is like we've known each other for years. Tbh, I know he doesn't want anything and I just need to let that sink in.

72,qmsfqp,1636054054,Out of my league,"
So In a college class this morning and I thought she was super cute! This happened to be the 2nd time we‚Äôve sat next to each other. Keep in mind we have NEVER spoken to each other

Anyways, I typed out on my phone in my notes, ‚Äúhey my name is ___ and I think ur super cute and I‚Äôd love for you to enter your name and number here:‚Äù 

I showed it to her and as she read she started to smile and took my phone and typed that info in. And later I see some photos on social media; and I realized‚Ä¶that I feel I made a huge mistake. She‚Äôs beautiful first thing, but she is so out of my league it‚Äôs not even funny. She has cute friends, and any guy friend who‚Äôs in the photos look‚Ä¶.well not like me. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a pile of garbage, but I‚Äôm certainly not a eye catcher either. I‚Äôm 23, 6ft 2, 250lb but I‚Äôm starting to exercise. Not necessarily fat but any that‚Äôs there has really consolidated in the stomach area; and just a TAD in face.  (Trust me, I hate myself in every single aspect, so that doesn‚Äôt help either) I can keep up with other friends in sports just fine. I‚Äôm definitely no stranger to active things and sports. I do have tons of friends and maintain a social life


But I just feel like I‚Äôve made a TERRIBLE mistake, and that I just set myself up to look like an absolute idiot. Now I don‚Äôt even want to message her. Anyone been in situations similar?

73,qmsg3w,1636054081,"Her and I talked for a week, now out of no where she's just ghosting me? well, I'm not sure if she is.","I (23m) matched with this girl on tinder about 10 days ago. We instantly had a good connection and texted every single day, and she was also pretty flirty with me. I'm really Introverted and usually find talking to new people challenging, but with her it felt different and I definitely felt something different with this girl.

We planned out a date for last weekend, but she had to unexpectedly cancel the day before because her family came to visit and she totally forgot. She wanted to reschedule, but because I didn't know my schedule at the time, I couldn't offer the exact day or time. Regardless, she was still interested in me and the date and we still spoke everyday.

Ever since Halloween, she hasn't spoken to me once. She wasn't out partying or anything, she was just with her family. Idk if that matters, but Its just something to point out. I tried talking to her and asking her how her Halloween was, but she didn't answer. I left at that for one day and then texted her that I'm free this weekend, for our date. She didn't reply to that (I sent that yesterday). 

She hasn't texted me in 3 days, which is kinda odd because we'd text everyday. I have no reason to think she would ghost me based on how interested she was in me, but the more I think about it, I don't see why she wouldn't be able to send a quick text.

She told me she works full-time, and is a full time student. But she had time then to text me, why can't she text me now? I'm not mad or angry at her, I'm just sad that I'm probably getting ghosted (unless I'm overthinking it, and she really is busy). I'm just so tired of getting ghosted.

I've checked her tinder, and it seems that she's not really active (hasn't changed pictures, bio, and location stays the same), I don't stalk her profile, but just check it out whenever I'm curious. 

I'm just so confused, she really seemed interested in me and it literally out of no where all of that is gone

76,qmsq3x,1636054819,Is failure unattractive for men?," Whenever  it comes to the topic of failure, perfection, and hardship there seems  to one narrative: its okay to be not perfect. You shouldn‚Äôt put up an  act and tell the truth to a woman. It will be worth it.

Unfortunately,  I (30M) failed at some things. School was always difficult for me. Despite  learning a lot, I only wrote bad marks. I barely passed high school.  Since my parents were poor too, I worked hard to save up enough money to  attend college with 24. However, like in School I didn‚Äôt wrote good  enough grades to get my degree. I even changed three times my major. It  didn‚Äôt help. With 29 I needed to left college due to financial struggles  ‚Äì without a degree. The only job I could find was as a cashier at a  supermarket. There was no other option then to take it. I took it. I  mean it‚Äôs not that I personally look at it as a failure. I tried my  best. I gave everything. But I unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work. Now I try  to make the best of it and work every day hard to pay off my debt.

Now,  I got the feeling that women are turned off whenever I tell them my  story. Its not that I complain about it or anything, but at a certain  point in a conversation, you will bring up, what‚Äôs you have done in the  past. Whenever I do that, it seems that they lose interest in me. Same  goes with online dating. I once changed my job. I immediately got a few  matches. Before I didn‚Äôt get any. It seems that my job seems to be off  putting. I have also read some articles in the past, which state that  women don‚Äôt admire muscles or good looks, but education and  intelligence.

Now, I would like to  ask you, if it is really that unattractive to have failed in this  field? And if yes, what‚Äôs a good way to not be already rejected before I  even get the chance that a woman can meet me for a date? And another  questions, which gives bothers me, is hearing that women want  intelligence. In a generic term, I don‚Äôt have that. So what do you mean  do women mean when they say they want someone intelligent? Is it having a  degree in STEM? Being a nerd? Able to play chess? What do women with  specifically with this preference?

I  hope this post doesn‚Äôt come off as a vent. It‚Äôs not. I genuinely try to  improve myself. I obviously crave female intimacy, which is one reason I  asked this question. But especially, I don‚Äôt want to be a man who is  considered as one not worth dating/meeting by every single woman. But  honestly, who would? I also want to bring happiness in a woman‚Äôs life. I  also want to be appreciated once by someone in this context. I think, I  could give a lot. I like to listen to people. I like chivalry. Things I  often hear, are problems in relationships, wouldn‚Äôt struggle to do. Not  to brag. People tell me I have a good heart. It makes me kind of sad,  that I never get the chance to show my personality, since I get already  rejected for dates.

If you have read until here, I thank you sincerely. I look forward to your opinion. And would really appreciate any advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmsq3x/is_failure_unattractive_for_men/

(Ouch.)

Either way, I asked her if she could help me with her friends and she told me both her friends were single. I flirted with one of her cute friend, we'll call her Sam. She showed clear interest, although she had drank a lot that night. She wouldn't stop touching me though, so I kept physically escalating.

We go back to Cat's place and all of my friends/me/Sam are there talking. Sam keeps touching and making it clear she was into me, I told Cat that I felt uncomfortable trying to take advantage of Sam since she was clearly super drunk. But Cat told me that Sam was talking to me about her, and that she wanted to know if I was a decent guy and Cat shot her my approval. I asked Sam if she wanted to go upstairs with me, and we start making out, I'm kissing her neck, and I tell her to come back to my place.

She tells me she doesn't want to, but sooner or later she's telling me I'm driving a hard bargain. Eventually, we go back to my place and we had crazy passionate sex. After we're finished, she's laying her head on my chest and we wake up the next morning showering together and if it wasn't for work in a hour, I would've gone for round 2. She gives me head and swallows, and I order her a uber. I tell her to text me when she gets home, she texts, ""just got home :)"" and I say, ""that's great to hear Sam!

She didn't reply to that, but I didn't think it required one anyways. I'm interested in keeping this going, I just don't want to come off as needy or too much. I'm thinking of texting her tomorrow, but what would be the best way of going about it?
