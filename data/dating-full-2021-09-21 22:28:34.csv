So I have been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson and Kevin Samuels to help me find a good woman. My friends directed me to watch their content.

It’s hard in this college age to find a woman who values and respects a real relationship. I went on a date with this girl and we took the bus home and we saw a family with a baby in a stroller. Now, Peterson says to pay attention to how women are around children because it says a lot about them. I waved to the child and she didn’t. 

This foretells of: daddy issues, disconnection to children (which goes against a females innate desire to reproduce offspring) and goes against her female nature. 

The fact that she didn’t wave at the baby is a major red flag. I asked her why she didn’t. She said it was because babies don’t seem to respond when we’re masked. Because they read our facial expressions through mask. So no point. 

I’m considering taking this into a reason to give her the benefit of the doubt. I was thinking of taking her to the park to see how she reacts to children outdoors who are unmasked. I’m asking myself “will she play with them? Will she acknowledge them? Will she say hi to them? Will she ask to hold a baby? Will she connect with other mothers?” 

I need to ensure a females desire for children is there and that her biological feminine characteristics are healthy and normal. Or else, this woman could be another toxic unhealthy partner. What should my game plan be? I was thinking of also only dating women who are working in traditionally female careers like nursing since it usually is a sign that she is healthy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1019505,public,self,Should I give her another chance?

We then went our separate ways and met up last year for the first time in 5 years. He was came to visit his friend from my state and wanted to meet up with me. I didn’t expect it to be a date but he kissed me and bought me dinner. It was a great date and he wasn’t expecting anything after the date if you know what I mean. He even joked saying he wanted to marry me. The conversation flowed and we were both flirtatious. We then went on another date and he picked me up and we went for a walk. We then were dancing and opening up to each other. He then goes back to his state and a week later or so tells me that he got a job opportunity in another state that was even further. I initially thought there is no way this is going to work but he was very very persistent on wanting me to go visit him. Even though I really wanted to, I was scared of Covid (this is when it first started) and I never flown on a plane alone before. He was understanding that I wanted to wait and said that he would make me feel comfortable once I was there. But after a while, I continued to say no because I was terrified. Not only because of Covid but because our two best friends (Mike and Alana) aren’t dating anymore. I brought up to my friend that Eric reached out to me and she freaked! Saying that I shouldn’t date her ex boyfriends best friend. She also does not like him because he hooked up with Alanas friend many years ago, who at the time, was dating Eric’s friend. Eric felt really bad for what he did and acknowledged what he did was wrong. So now, Alana, alanas friend, and that boyfriend, does not like him. This puts me in an uncomfortable situation. Eric and I are in our mid to late twenties and this situation happened when I was 18. Do I think what he did was wrong, of course. Even after it happened, Alana encouraged me to hook up Eric. 

Someone in his family passed away and he came back up to my state for the services. He invited me to go but again, covid. He invited me to see his friends and family.

Anyways, Eric and I went our separate ways again and he got a girlfriend. They broke up a couple months ago and he reached out to me a few weeks ago. Since then we have been talking.

There's this guy I was dating but not in a relationship with. Things were great, we had chemistry/ alot in common but feelings/emotions were super fast &amp; quick. It got deep on a emotional level quickly and then out of no where, the dynamic changed. 

He grew distant and I confronted him about it &amp; he told me how it on purpose because he didn't want things to get serious since he was leaving for a month. (wanting to put a pause on us). 
I agreed/was on the same page.

but then he continue would talk to me everyday in such a non-engaging way that I started giving him the same energy back/pulling away/giving him space. 

It felt terrible, because things didn't go back to how they were. It wasn't like it even was approached to go at a slower pace. It was just like I was the only one putting effort in / my emotional needs were ignored. We saw each other on his terms/hes schedule.  It affected me negatively because I was ignoring my own emotions. 

So asked him if we should still continue to talk. I told him

 “I like talking to you and hanging out with u but things feel too distant to often. I’ve been doing my best to not be bugged by it but it’s at a point where i feel like I am and I’m in denial about it. 

I know you’ve admitted that you purposely do that. So I just feel like if this isn’t really leading anywhere, I’m just hurting myself because I’m hopeful things will lead somewhere because of how things were the first time we were talking. 

Things change. You can’t control how you feel. So me saying this, isn’t me hating or angry or anything like that.”

He responded with how 
didn't want to hurt me/ lead me on and he talks to me however much he feels like (SUCH A A**Hole) but he didn't see anything special. 

Then proceeded to call me and said that he didn't mean for it to come off as harsh as it did. He just felt like we needed to hang out more because Hes unsure about how he feels about me. Proceeded to give a excuse about some shitty news/drama with his friends while fighting with his family too at that moment. 
He said how he felt better after talking to me (on the phone) and that he will make more of an effort to hang out even if it was just for a little bit.

Actions didn't match up since after that talk he didn't reach out for 2 days. Then when he did, the message was kinda rude saying “ he was so busy with shit he had to do so he wasn't sending snapchats” and the conversation just was so bitter after that I left him on read.

I didn't talk to him for 3 weeks. 
he didn't reach out, even though he was liking my photos/watching my every move. Maybe i am looking to deep into it but I ended up unfollowing/removing him because it continued to hurt seeing his name pop up.


Brief version:

Is it considered ghosting, if you expressed beforehand your issues with your relationship with them?

Even though they “agree” to make changes/put effort into changing things, their actions didn't change. So you ignore their last message/ left the lines of communication open with no outreach for 3 weeks.

This also affects my listening because I’m being honest here as I listen to someone else talk I do catch myself thinking about what I want to say next or how to continue on from this and then I realize that I am no longer even listening anymore. 

Talking about me speaking too literally, I am truly particular with the words I am trying to say, especially in an argument or a heated situation or anything like that. However, in a scenario where I did that, when what I said was brought it up, it was immediately taken as me gaslighting them. I immediately try and backtrack what I said and then it just makes the whole situation worse.

We decide to go on a date sometime (saying I’d let her know if I could do this weekend or next weekend) and we follow each other on IG. I should also that I’m a way above average guy in terms of looks and the amount of accomplished and experienced (I could die tomorrow and still have lived more than most people could in a lifetime or 2).   


Two days later, I say I can’t do the upcoming weekend but can do next weekend and said I just wanted to make sure she was free before I made any other plans, which she couldn’t have been more excited for. Next weekend comes around, we get drinks Friday Night for about 2 hours, but after the 2nd round (we got 3 rounds total) she tells me it’s her friend’s 21st birthday so she’ll have to go after drinks. Also at one point, we talked about how we both go to therapy which is when she asked me why I go if it wasn’t too personal to which I say it’s fine since I already feel comfortable with her (I give her a slight touch on the hand) so one detail I mentioned was that I get emotionally attached to people sometimes and get too much joy from people and not enough from myself (feel like this might be an important detail in the context of all of this). After the 3rd round when the check comes, she offers to pay for half of our drinks but I wave her off. We leave, I wait with her for her Uber to arrive, we give each other a hug and she says “let’s hang out tomorrow night” which I’m excited to hear.   


The next day, I send her a text after lunch saying I had a great time at drinks last night and tell her my roommate’s friend is having a party if she’s feeling up for it. She responds within 20 mins saying she had a great time too and that the party sounded like fun and that she would let me know. I didn’t respond to it (idk why because she said she’d let me know) but then about 6 hours later I start to get nervous and send a song rec (we talked about music on our first date) 2 hours go by after sending that and she finally responds saying she was napping and was wondering what time I was thinking for the party – I respond 30 mins later saying probs around 10:45 pm and that I didn’t know that address but I would send it to her as soon as I got it. She doesn’t respond to that and 30 mins go by and I send her the address to which I get no response (It’s probs 9:30 at this point). Not the end of the world given it was I’ll last minute but I like to clear things up usually (communication is very important to me).   


So the next day, I send her a text saying sorry if I made her uncomfortable and that I didn’t know the details until the last minute either and reassured her that I don’t play games and am actually quite genuine about who I decided to go out with. She responds an hour later reassuring me that I didn’t make her uncomfortable and that she was planning on coming with her roommate but they passed out early (that’s BS I know). I say no worries, just wanted to clear that up and that it happens to the best of us – maybe next weekend. To which she responds “yes definitely i'd love that :)”   


The next Friday, I send her a message asking her if she wants to grab some Coffee the next day. She responds 3 hours later saying she probably can’t since her friends are visiting this weekend but says “maybe this coming week?” I responded later saying “I could only do the Monday or Tuesday since I have friends visiting starting Wednesday and then I’m traveling the next two weekends so might have to do end of September” – She doesn’t answer for 3-4 days saying “I’m so sorry I never responded to this message, I could do tomorrow if that works for you? :)” We exchange a couple more texts within the next couple of hours and then I let her know I’ll send her the details for the time and meet up spot later to which she says “Perfect ”. 2-3 hours go by and I send her the location to meet up asking her if 5:45 pm works for her (I told her I get off work at 5 pm earlier) to which she never responds.   


It’s now a week later (she knows I’m traveling since I told her the week prior plus she saw my story the other day) and I have no idea whether this girl likes me and is testing me somehow or whether I should just give up since she’s not interested, so would love some advice from anyone really on the matter and how I should proceed.

My boyfriend (M21) and I (F20) have been dating for a year and a half and we’ve been living together for 3 months. We’ve had a very happy and trustworthy relationship, there’s been no reason for me to ever trust his fidelity. 

Lately he’s had a very strange work schedule. He’s a chef so I very much believe him. With that work schedule his sex drive had plummeted, which totally makes sense. I waited really patiently and did the best I could to support him 110%, waking up at 4am to make him breakfast on crazy work days, doing his laundry etc. The odd thing is we had a week of absolute relaxation and he felt very far away. He also didn’t initiate sex once in a five day period when we usually have sex daily on our days off. I spoke to him about it and our sex life resumed kinda but a lot slower. 

Now the weirdest thing, he has an awful scab on his penis. We’ve been together long term, we’ve both been STD tested within that time multiple times, we’ve both never had ANYTHING. He went to the dermatologist today and the dermatologist said it could be syphillis or some sort of friction burn (we haven’t had vigorous sex and masturbation is off the table because we spend all waking hours at home together).

I’m torn between “if he wanted to, he would” and “Just call him and try to communicate.”

For more context, he and I are both in our early twenties, and we work in the food industry. He and I have a lot in common, such as living in the same town, aspiring to have the same professions, etc. He's a pretty friendly guy, but also kind of nerdy.

There was a time when work was really slow, and he and I were the only employees at the time, and we were talking for about an hour straight. We were talking about the high schools that we went to, and he asked me what I like to do for fun. I gave him a couple of my hobbies, and he would say things like ""I like doing that too!"" or ""I need to do that more!"" That same day, he also told me about really personal information about him getting bullied when he was younger. I'm happy he feels comfortable around me to share that info with me.

Before, I would usually be the one coming up to him and asking him questions. They would be simple questions such as his weekend plans. However, I stopped because I didn't want to be the one always initiating the conversation, and I felt as if I were asking him too many questions. Since I haven't been initiating the conversation, he's been the one approaching me and asking me questions about my weekend plans. While he does talk to other female coworkers, I'm the one he speaks to the most.

Whenever I need help with something, he's always the first person to help, even if it doesn't benefit him. For example, one time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and forgot to give the customer change, and I was unable to open the register. I went to another employee that was slightly more experienced, but as I was asking the other employee, he came up to me and asked me what happened, and he wasn't able to help me with the register, but he tried regardless. And since he was doing something else at the time, it's not even as if it were convenient for him to help, yet, he did.

Another thing I forgot to mention is that there is a day where it is really slow, so there's only two or three workers for the entire day. I start early in the morning, and his shift always starts closer to noon. However, he comes in about 30 minutes to an hour after I come in and will be on his computer.

There's a guy I sort of like that goes to my University. I've known him since last year (although we were never super close), and I know he's a sweetheart. Lately I've been hanging out with him at a few parties, and he has seemed pretty flirty. He was touchy (touching my shoulders, inviting me to sit close to him, putting his arm around the back of my seat), but he was drunk while this was all happening. We have a lot of similar interests, and we spent a decent amount of time talking. He went out of his way to tell me I looked nice, he has walked me home, and he brought me a glowstick (there was a bucket full at this party) and tied it around my neck. He chose orange because he said it matched my outfit. I thought this was all sort of flirty behavior, but I haven't hung out with him while he's been sober in a while since we haven't met anywhere but at parties lately. 

He snapped me the day after, suggesting I meet his cat at some point and being friendly. I played along and said, ""You should meet my cat too. I'm thinking of hosting everyone over for Halloween so you could meet her then, or you could come sooner."" He responded ""Let's goooooooo,"" and I didn't really know what to make of that. 

We have a mutual friend who he is pretty close with. This friend decided to ask him how he felt about me and if he was flirting, and he said ""I love [name], but that's not what I was doing. I wouldn't mind trying, though,"" which I thought was a rather confusing response. He also told him that he gets more flirty and touchy when drunk.

Finally, today, he snapped me again and asked me if he should wear a white shirt or floral one for his headshots. I responded after he had already chosen (I was napping), but told him he looked good. The pictures were cancelled, and I told him he would look good in anything whenever they decided to reschedule. He left me on opened after that. He also snapped me shirtless (shoulders up only) during this exchange.

Tldr: There's a guy I'm interested in who I thought was interested in me.

Some background:

So, i used to be early bloomer with women, so being overly interested in them since 11-12yo, and so experimenting with them since then quite alot in the most bizarre and great ways.  
Anyway besides some few short lasting GF experience during 15-17yo i always found hard to stick and to get too affectionate with any of them. I must underline that i never tricked anyone with false premises or hopes, and always making myself very clear about this part of me. This for various reasons but mostly because i didn't want anything too serious due to my curios to explore new things character. This has led to both a lot of fun and both miserable outcomes, never really getting fulfilled by this kind of approach.  


This continued till 18-19yo having my fair share of ONS and other short lived adventures. During that time i started to be very interested in a girl, like never before if we exclude first crushes as a child, and that ended up with me broken in pieces due to the fact that she tricked me and gave false hopes, and after that ghosting me and completely ignoring me. That led me to a deep depression moment in my life, feeling worthless, and not being able anymore to expose myself with girls, leading me to a few years of not having a sexual life anymore at all and completely closing my self. After that i tried again putting me in the ""game"" trying at least to know someone and try to have at least a resemblance of a sexual life i felt i lost for so many years. Of course this has led to even more disappointment and ending up not even trying anymore but to only really try to let myself know girls when they were making the first move, flirting with me.   


All this mess has ended up with me having 28yo today and not having had any truly meaningful relationship during all my life, besides friendships. I've hoped for one for so long, but due to all my previous history I've been feeling lost and stranded, with little to none energy to pursue any relationship. I've tried tinder a few times, and even after what i would call great date, lasting 12/14h, on multiple days, i always end up being ghosted without any apparent reason. Sometimes it feels like the women feel everything is going too well.  


So in the last 5-6y my sexual and sentimental life have been confined to just maybe few intercourse and dates per year.  


The situation now:  


I've moved from the city i was living in august, and only after a few days a friend of mine introduced me to a girl he knew when we were at a pub. I was completely not interested at the beginning, even though she was indeed beautiful, and even if my friend was telling me to try to get a chance with her, i rapidly was declining saying: she's not my tipe, i'm not really interested, ecc.. The usual excuses I've made in the last few years. After a while we were talking she ended up being more curious about me and started to flirt, even though i was flattered and anything i didn't really played along, besides some comments.   
After this evening i thought to myself that maybe it would be wise to try to go out with her, breaking my loops and routines and see where it will go. So i asked her number to my friend and used an excuse to go out with her. Since then, almost 2 months now, we have been seeing each other very often. On some weeks even every day. It feels fantastic, like the thing that i was hoping for so long seemed to become true. She seems enjoying me and my company and i certainly feel the same.  
The big turn down here is that, once again, even though i never pushed her straight away in a serious relationship, she felt the need to tell me that she is not ready for one, but that this doesn't change anything between us, and after a moment of disbelief by me, i tried to get over it and told her that there's no rush and we can see how it will go, but i will not wait for her forever. After that she has never initiate this topic again, but we are seeing each other even more often and everything seems fine. I've never felt so well with another girl and i'm eager to take it to the next level, but at the same time i really don't want to push her, and this is becoming sometimes hard for me, because i always fear to be abandoned once again. This is putting a lot of stress on my mind, and i started questioning my feelings: are they real? Am i being used? Am i only not trying to be alone, and therefore maybe using her? I'm definitely still not loving her, because i think love need time, but i'm certainly affectionate to her.

This math class is set up in a way in which we are assigned to groups based on our major and we work with that group until the end of the semester. So basically, class has been going on for a little over a month and my group consists of two girls. One of them being the girl I am asking about. We are all in the major of Social Work. So, the thing is she is required to sit by me because of how the class arrangement is set up.

I come to class early and she does as well. Most days we talk for a little bit before class asking how things are going and she seems to be pretty responsive. She also, smiles at me and laughs at some of the jokes I tell even if they aren't that great. I have also, noticed that a lot of times she will brush her foot up against my leg during lectures ( before we break off into groups ). I don't say anything of course, but than again the seating arrangements are so close that I can't differentiate between lack of space and intentional touching. I also, stepped on her foot one day by accident and apologized and she didn't seem to mind. Also, the other girl who is in my group has never brushed legs with me even though she sits just as close as the girl I am wondering about.

Another thing is we have these assignment, to do for class are like give a written response to the question and I have noticed some of the times her responses mimic mine to a certain extent. Not exactly, but a lot of time they are overlapping even though you could respond the questions in a bunch of different ways ( I respond to the questions first because of how early I wake up ). I have been doing what I can to talk to her every day finding out new things about her. She wore a shirt, on Monday of a band I like, but I was too dumb to say anything. So, I was planning on saying something about it tomorrow ( Mon, Wed, Fri class) about how I missed that shirt and what a good band it was ( old band ). We are both kind of similar personalities ( friendly etc. ), so it is just hard for me to figure out where the line is of flirting/being friendly. The other girl comes to class last minute and I assume that if this girl didn't want to talk as much as we do she wouldn't come to class early like I usually am ( 10 min or so prior ).

I don't want to be overly eager or anything or say anything that is super direct like you look really cute today or something along those lines. Because I am worried that if chemistry is building I could shoot it down with one dumb comment. We exchanged numbers just for the class, I also got the third girls number as well. So I don't want to be too explicit like asking to hang out or grab a coffee or something. Because if that doesn't go over well we have to be in our groups for the remainder of the semester and it could be awkward. I am just wondering maybe what are some good ways to continue from here and maybe subtle hints that I find her attractive? Also, how to figure out if she really is just being nice or not? Because I don't want to come off too strong or misread her intentions.

Some, further context is she is a Freshman in college and I am a Junior ( who is older than most mid twenties ). She is such a sweet girl though, not just attractive but genuinely a really nice person. I also, have a birth defect where one of my eyes is lower than the other so I have a hard time finding myself attractive even though I may not be terrible looking. I was really reluctant to make a post honestly, but its nice to hear others opinions. Another thing is I haven't dated in a while ( like 1-2 years ) so I am definitely a little out of the loop.

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that croud (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

Her main thing is the yelling and screaming. She justifies it with basically, “don’t say things that aren’t true, or are out of context, or are not factual, and I won’t yell”…

The problem with that is that it leaves wiggle room for calling anything I say wrong, or untrue, or not in context, thus leading to more yelling.

The conversation usually shifts from “sweetheart, we need to work on our communication and I need us to not yell and scream” to “omggg so not you’re the victim??! If I scream it’s your fault because you make me scream by saying things that aren’t true!!!!!!”

Anyways I had a talk with her yesterday right after I told her that if she wanted to talk, she can come see me… I live an hour away, and I told her that if she wants to come, we will talk, but no yelling, that’s literally my only rule. I told her to come to me because I always go to her and it ends in me getting yelled at.. so I made her come to me for once, I thought it would change things and make her think before she started yelling, considering she just drove an hour to talk to me… anyways we spoke by  the fire outside my house. Instead of talking with me: she was talking at me… she claims that she did her part in trying to make this work by making the drive…. So, yeah fine, but my thing was that if you drive here to yell at me, nothing really changed… anyways she got so upset that I kept telling her to not yell or else she can leave. As soon as she heard the option to leave, she sprung off the chair, got in her car, started screaming and crying calling me toxic and that I made her come here just to tell her to go home…. I recanted and said I was sorry and that I didn’t mean that I wanted her to leave, I just wanted her to calm down and talk to me like an adult… anyways she left angry screaming and crying without actually telling me what was bothering her SO much!

She says things like “I shouldn’t have to tell you” or “I’ve told you this before, you can figure it out” or “I’ve said this already, I’m not repeating myself” 

Which if you ask me isn’t helpful… I think she does this because she doesn’t have any actual reason to be upset. And she’s just mad that I kept calling her out for her yelling…..

J said that he wants a relationship but needs to find someone just like him and it seems like he's given up hope on finding someone. But, he said that he sees himself in me. The three of us came back inside after running an errand one time and I said it's cold, he immediately got up to give me a blanket and got onto A for not being a gentleman and getting one for me. J told me a lot of things that could mean either he likes me or the complete opposite, such as saying that I'm smarter than anyone he's ever known and that A should take care of me. He's also said things like ""I never thought the most intriguing conversation I'd ever have would be with someone your age."" and compared me to his ex wives in the process, me being the better one. He always hounds A and tells him to keep me, be a gentleman, etc. and for me to not let him fuck up again. Even A's father, J's best friend, tells A to listen to me, keep me, and that he's lucky to have me.

She’s divorced with a six year old daughter. I’m a single dad with a seven year old daughter. My daughter’s mom is not involved in our lives at all. She took off when our daughter was one with her high school sweetheart. I found out she started cheating on me with him starting about the time our daughter was six months old. She took off with him after I broke up with her and she hasn’t seen either me or our daughter in a over five years. I know how Reddit comment sections work so I’ll say this right now. I did get a paternity test done after I found out about the cheating and my daughter is most definitely mine. 

Anyway like I said I’ve been dating B since early July of this year. We’ve really hit it off she’s fun, pretty and being a single parent she understands a lot of what I struggle with from time to time. We have been intimate since our second date too.

We finally both talked about our exes this weekend. I told her about my daughter’s mother, the cheating and how it ruined our relationship. When she told me about her ex husband she kind of flippantly said it ended because of cheating too. But she was the cheater. She actually kind of laughed and said “It was me doing the cheating though!” 

I was kind of taken aback at how lightly she took the whole thing. I didn’t really want to push for details as to why she did what she did but she told me anyway. All she said was she felt like her and her husband drifted apart and she got bored in her relationship. She just acted like it was no big deal at all.

I know I’m going to get killed on here for this but I cannot see myself continuing to date this woman. I know it sounds judgmental but if she already cheated on one person what’s to stop her from doing it to me? I think she can sense that I’m not really into this relationship anymore.

I’m not going to just ghost her like I’m a teenager or something. I’m going to have to tell her I don’t think we’re compatible.

I’m older than him by a year and I just graduated college and I’m now working in my career. I studied my ass off through school to make it where I’m at. I want to go back to school in the future for a masters. 

My boyfriend is still in college and he is studying to work in the same field as me. 

I notice he doesn’t perform that well in school and is at risk of failing. He is not much of a hard worker and does not take studying serious. He also has a history of cheating on tests to get by.

He has also purposely failed classes in the past due to not caring and if it wasn’t for that, he would actually have graduated at the same time as me.

It bothers me sometimes that there is a possibility he may not make it through school and I will end up the sole worker in the relationship until he gets back on his feet. I do not want to be un even in the relationship.

Nonetheless, I still care deeply for my bf and seeing him struggle during his studies makes me feel bad for him and I all I want to do sometimes is to be be there. 

Lately he’s been contemplating dropping the degree since he’s failing the semester and told me that he might apply for another program… or enlist in the military.

He then proceeded to tell me that if that happens, he would want us to end because I don’t deserve to be with a “failure” like him. He says I deserve better and that if his education does not improve, that I should move on.

He says he doesn’t want to bring me down or distract me from my career and goals.

Hearing this makes me sad. He is not someone I want to lose and it’s hard hearing what he said. But I like how considerate he is too

I’m also going to add in here that my bf suffers from depression and right now he’s in the season of it. This is also why I feel bad for him too.

Monday came around and when i talked to her i got the feeling of her wanting to avoid me, in my head i started to feel weird because i didnt know wtf is happening. The end of the day came i was waiting for my bus as was she, i needed to speak to someone, to get an opinion, i spoke to this girl she told me i should go and ask her why she acted like this. Ohhhh why did i listen. So i went and asked her why she had been avoiding me she said she hasn't, i was lost i didn't know what to say it was super uncomfortable. She asked me to be more direct and i said you acted differently on friday and differently today, no words were spoken, silence, i said i was bad at saying these things, i tried to make some humour in the akwardness, she said what do you mean, and i dont know why but i said isn't it obvious i like you, she said i thought you saw me as a friend, silence, and then she said im kinda not free im seeing this one guy. I didn't know what to say, but know when i think about it 10000000 things come to my head.

She is a cheerleader for our school. It's really important that I mention that I have never meant this girl let only talked to her before. The football game is the first time that I laid my eyes on her. But to continue on with the story I asked one of my best friends if she knew everyone on the cheerleading team and she said only some. I pointed out the girl that I found attractive and she said that she doesn't know her. I told my other friends and they did their research on the spot and found out that she is possibly a junior or a senior. They told me her name and they showed me her Instagram. For this story will call her Kate. Fast forward to today I see this one girl, let's call her Tina, during my free first period who is on the cheerleading team with Kate. I was contemplating whether I should or not ask Tina if she knows if Kate is single and if she is a junior or a senior. After a few moments, I said ""fuck it"" and asked her if she knew the girl I was talking about and asked the questions that I mentioned. Now, this is where shit hits the fan. I don't believe I said the correct name to Tina about the girl that I was referring to which is Kate but instead another that I thought was it by accident. And guess what?  I confused Kate's name with another name and there was someone who actually had that name on the team! I kid you not! So basically the entire day I thought I got the answers that I was looking for but didn't because I confused Kate's with another name. I realized my mistake until my friend who was also at the game told me that I got Kate's name wrong and talked about another girl with Tina. I absolutely shitted my pants when he said that. How do I clear up the confusion with Tina and say that I made a mistake and I got the name wrong about the girl that I was asking about and proceed to ask her the questions that I had in mind?

He kept saying that he couldn’t believe how well the date was going (implied that online dates never rly go well for him), told me how much he liked me and wished he could stay there and talk to me all night (he had to work at 6 the next morning) and when we found out we listened to the same niche podcast, said that it was scary how good the hinge algorithm is with matching people. He definitely wasn’t expecting sex because he knew I was staying with my friend. We hugged goodbye and he asked me specifically what date I would be moving back to the city, implying again that he wanted to see me then. He texted me as soon as he got home that night telling me he had a good time. 

I texted him two weeks later once I moved back that i wanted to hangout, didn’t text him before that because I feel like it’s important to get to know people in person (now realizing this was a mistake).

Before coming over, he told me he needed to leave by 10pm for work the next day. Well, it got past 10pm &amp; he changed his mind, saying he didn’t really need to go into the office tomorrow and could just work from home. 

I offered that he could spend the night if he wanted to. After a min, he agreed &amp; said he’d spend the night. We cuddled literally all night long &amp; had morning sex + cuddles.

I left it up to him to decide what activity we’ll be doing this weekend.

Couple months back my brother asked me if I wanted to come on a trip with him and his girlfriend and her younger sister which I’ve never met before but I didn’t think much of it and agreed to go because I’ve never been to the state we were going on a trip too so I was down. The day we went we all met at the airport and I saw her and she saw me but I didn’t say much but a simple hey and that was that didn’t really say anything at all too each other and when we were going out my brother and his girlfriend would be in front leading the way arms around each other so usually how couples are while me and her sister would be behind them following but in awkward silence in our phones not saying a single word to each other. This all changed however halfway near the end of our week long trip we were in the hotel watching a movie at night after it ended my brother and his girlfriend went to bed it was like 1am and I was still up and so was the sister so I decided to finally just break the awkward silence and I softly threw the control at her and told her to put something on YouTube because I usually sleep late anyways and so did she. She looked at me and threw the controller back at me and laughed said she doesn’t know what to put that I should pick something instead. That night we spent a good couple hours watching funny videos on YouTube and watching vice documentaries laughing and talking like we’ve known each other our whole life we just sort of clicked i guess. This whole time we were silent and awkward to each other she just scooted up next to me on the couch and we both lay right by each other not touching or cuddling but damn near and that’s when k was like she’s actually pretty funny and cool I noticed her checking her phone a lot and got a quick peek of a text from her sister telling her to go to sleep because we were all going out early the next morning but she kept reading it and ignoring them as we kept watching videos. It wasn’t finally until my brother texted me to go to bed so that she would go to bed as well ( it was 3 rooms btw one room for me one room for the sister and one room for my brother and his Gf) so after reading that text I remembered and realized that she is 17 and I’m 21 so in my head I felt like what I was doing was wrong so I just got up all of a sudden and told her we better go to sleep since we have to get up early and she agreed and we both kind of awkwardly just looked at each other and said goodnight and went to our own rooms. The next day it’s as if everything was back to normal again but every now and then we would talk more and more but little by little and the “flirting” began for example we were out in the city and she would be like I have to lookout for her and I have to protect her because at this point it would be my brother and his girlfriend in front of us while me and her would be in the back but this time much closer and side to side. We eventually went to a haunted place that we wanted to visit before the trip ended and we went at night too so it was pretty dark and creepy she eventually caught me by surprise and wrapped both her arms around one of my arm as we started walking through this haunted building and I had forgot all about how this place was scary and haunted all I was thinking about how close she was leaning on me and holding me because keep in mind I’ve only known her for about 4 days after that she became more touchy and started leaning her head on my shoulder and random times she would punch my arm or knock my hat off my head . She would sometimes lean on me for a few seconds when we walked but I didn’t say anything about it I just let her. We went to the airport that night but were weren’t schedule to depart until a couple hours so we literally sat at the airport talking and talking for hours again laughing and joking. Once we got on the plane home everyone said goodbyes and that was that until recently I’ve seen her again last week when we went on a trip again same like last time and this time we hadn’t seen each other in months but again we clicked and talked like we’ve known each other for years and her again mostly talking with me and leaning her head on me again and once this trip ended she asked me when’s the next we’ll see each other and I was like what do you mean and she said she doesn’t know when she’s going to see me again and I just laughed and told her hopefully soon and she smiled and said yeah and said in a playful manner that she’s already annoyed of me and I’ve barely seen her but I told her she’s should be happy she’s met me so far or else she would be third wheeling and she laughed and said true and when My brother finally got the car ready to go home i gave her a lil pinch on the side of her stomach and told her I’ll see you next time and she just looked at me and smiled.,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1019963,public,self,I don’t know if she likes me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pszgi5/i_dont_know_if_she_likes_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Maybe there's nothing to deeper to find here.

Charm is charming. Seeing *authentic* charm in this generation of manufactured mannerisms feels like actual magic.

I just thought shes not that interested, since she replies like this and doesn't ask me questions and doesn't further the conversation, so I didn't really consider asking her out, but she asked when will we meet, and we agreed on the weekend.
Is she just shy and or introverted and is interested, but just terrible at conversations?
And I don't really know how a date as such would go. Not really into silence, but if she talks like this in real life, like some girls I've seen do, it's gona go terrible, as I will run out of things I can say...
