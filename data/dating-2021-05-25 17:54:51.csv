8,nl383h,1621986164,How do I(20) stop feeling like shit after rejection?,"I’m pretty bad at dealing with rejection. Not bad in a way that I lash out at girls who reject me, I just feel bad. Like when I get rejected in person it kinda ruins me because I usually end up asking a girl out if she’s already a friend, and then I feel so stupid for thinking I had a chance with her, then I feel even stupider because I changed the nature of our friendship, then I feel like somethings wrong with me because I got rejected and then I kinda just spiral. 

When I’ve asked out girls I don’t really know, it ends in rejection and sometimes it’s a very brutal rejection. I’ve been laughed at, told I was ugly, and on one occasion, lectured that she was out of my league. I’m now just terrified of face to face rejection in person. So I have just switched to primarily tinder and hinge and bumble.

Even when I’m on dating apps, it feels like constant rejection. I don’t even know why. I feel bad because I’m swiping right on such beautiful girls and I know there’s a 99.99% chance they’ll swipe left. It especially feels bad when I get get to the point where I’ve run out of girls and I’m still without a match.

I know that rejection is going to happen, so I need to let it stop hurting me so much but I don’t know how. How do can I not take rejection so personally?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nl383h/how_do_i20_stop_feeling_like_shit_after_rejection/

24,nl4v8f,1621991533,[M26] I really don't know where to go with dating anymore,"As the title says, m26, I am absolutely frustated with the dating scene right now. It's been three years since my last serious relationship and I have had date after date of misconnection. I can barely make it past the second date now without being ghosted or rejected. I don't know what happened. I used to be able to do pretty well, and now I am always falling short. 

I had an amazing first date with this girl on Friday, like knocked it out of the park. Great conversation, had this girl making out with me on my lap in my car for a half hour at the end of the date . Then she pulls back over the weekend. Today she texted me saying she found another guy and couldn't date two. I am glad she was honest at least, but I just can't see how I could have been chosen over someone else. 

It was one date so I'll live, but I got really angry at myself and started reflecting over the culmination of all the dates that never landed. I try not to get nihilistic over this and tell myself that I just need to keep working out, I need to keep working on my hobbies, I need to be happy with myself. But it's hard not to be all self-defeating and tell yourself that this is your life and it's ticking away each second and you will never feel a shred of human connection ever in your life, and everytime you fail you feel like someone is taking a chisel to your heart and what will end up being left is a hollow human being that is good at showing up at his job and paying his fucking taxes. 

I don't want that, but lately I have been stuck in a rut. I have made strides in other areas of my life and honestly am greatful for where I am at. But nobody wants to be there with me and I want to share my life with someone, it's not perfect but I think it's pretty great.

26,nl4vk5,1621991562,Guys I got love bombed and I fell for it even though I know full well that narcissists use it to control people!," 

So this guy love bombed me within a couple of weeks and declared that we were now exclusive.  Didn't even ask, just told me I was his girlfriend.  We had kind of known each other in the past so he wasn't some complete stranger, and it was during a long pandemic lockdown so I was quite inactive romantically and this shook up my world. He went from saying he loved me and I was his person to telling me he wanted to marry me, have kids with me, and be with me forever.   I imagine the escalation would correlate to the amount of action he was getting from other women because as it turns out, he was having sex with other women the whole time and swearing blind that he had no interest in anyone except me.  He was leaving digital breadcrumbs all over the place so I could see he was meeting new people and trying really hard to hook up with girls.  Combined with behavioural cues and stories that didn't add up, I went on Tinder to find him because I knew I would, and I found him within 50 swipes. I sent him the screenshots and he had nothing to say, he just deleted me.

He very likely has narcissistic personality disorder combined with esteem issues. It was especially weird if I'd mention earning money, he'd instantly change the subject to him doing something that he thought would make him sound like a rich person, but to me he sounded like a child.  If I said I like the colour of your shirt, instead of saying thanks he'd say ""IT'S VERSACE"".  He treats women like commodities, and just wants to categorise, collect and control us.  The guy is really a massive douchebag and I was obviously targeted because I'm sweet.

The breadth and depth of his lies is a huge mindfuck, now knowing that he'd say extremely sappy romantic things, and an hour later be fucking someone else.  I feel stupid for entertaining his monstrous pathology, and I feel used since I know he only saw me as a source of narcissistic attention.  His attention would have dried up when other sources gave him a platform to be adored, so I got out just as it was turning to the devaluation stage.  I'm so well versed on this stuff, it's really troubling that I fell for it.  I guess we're all vulnerable while dating because some of us just want to fall in love.

Met up with a guy spontaneously; he asked to meet at a local cafe if I was free in a couple hours. I was free, the cafe was near, his pictures were cute so I was down. An hour before meeting up, he said his parents had left and his place is free and asked if I was down to come over. I was down but then as I was about to leave he said his parents actually came back but he’s still down to go to the cafe. We got there, chatted for a bit, but the cafe didn’t really have a lot of seating so I asked where he wanted to go afterwards.  We ended up going somewhere to watch the sunset and afterwards hooked up in his car. 

He kissed me first and after doing some stuff for a while, I initiated the sex and asked if he had a condom. And he actually didn’t. He was not the type of douchey guy to want to put it in raw and he never asked to when we were hooking up. I guess the very few guys I did hook up with and all of my guy friends always had condoms on them or in their car. And when I was gonna come over his place, pretty sure implied hooking up. So I guess I’m just kinda confused and wondering did he not find me attractive enough to have sex with me? Is he probably not interested?

We still had fun regardless. Lesson learned; I should start bringing my own condoms.

31,nl5vn4,1621994933,Fell In Love With A Girl From Ukraine,"Okay I will try to make this short, so hopefully I can. I met this girl from Odessa Ukraine online. She's 25 and I'm 35. We exchanged numbers last November and we immediately hit it off. We'd talked 95% of the time on video. Due to Covid-19 traveling was difficult so I had postponed flying there. 

She is funny, kind, joyful, sincere, smart and gorgeous! She told me that she loves me and I told her that I love her. We never said that we're boyfriend and girlfriend, but it was basically a given by the way we talked to each other. I'm not seeing anyone here in my local city (I'm from the US by the way), and she isn't seeing anyone in Odessa. 

She's the girl I've been searching for and I cannot stop thinking about her. I have tickets to fly to Odessa in August. But things took a different turn a few days ago. We had a talk and she is having a hard time with us living so far from one another. She said when I come to visit her and have to fly back home she will be devastated. She doesn't know if she can deal with a long distance relationship.

She wants me to live closer to her, but if that cannot happen she's not sure she can be with me. So what advice will you all give me? I really want her and our chemistry and connection is so strong. We love each other already without spending one physical day together. People search for years to find what we found in each other. 

I do not want to lose her, but relocating to be closer to her is an extremely huge decision to make. 

Any advice from both guys and girls is appreciated.

33,nl6c55,1621996451,(21F) Found out my now-ex (24M) was going after this one girl during our relationship,"Considering survivinginfidelity's rules, I opted to post about this here.

This is the same (ex) Bf from my profile whom I lent $500 to help pay his rent, and subsequently kept giving excuses why he couldn't pay me back on time. He ended up ghosting me on this issue, and so I messaged people on his Following list on Instagram about my predicament because I didn't know his friends, and hoped that one person by chance knew my ex.

Instead, I got a response from a girl who in a call, told me how she knew about my ex. We'll call this girl ""Jen"" and my ex ""Bryan."" They were not friends, but Jen told me that she worked at a Wingstop near his apartment complex, and Bryan often went there to see her. Jen told me my ex had flirted with her, asked for her number, asked to hang out, or just went in to talk with her. Jen felt weirded out by his behavior, and never followed through with anything, but she did feel shocked and remorseful upon hearing from me that he was taken. I believed her when she told me she had no idea Bryan was seeing me. Jen had apparently seen me with Bryan as we went into that same Wingstop before, and had asked Bryan later on when he came by himself who that girl was. Bryan apparently denied he was seeing me romantically.

I know it's cliche to think, ""After all I've done for you, this is how you thank me"" but that's the best way to sum up my devastation. I helped him with his rent twice, and I was there to support him through many other issues he was going through, and he goes behind my back to actively hit on and pursue this one girl. He had always assured me I was the only girl he was talking to, but because of Jen's story, I now know that was a lie. What else could he be lying to me about?

I'm angry at my ex, and I'm grateful to Jen for reaching out to me, but I can't shake off the thoughts wondering why all the support I've done for Bryan meant nothing to him, and what about Jen was so alluring that he would undermine our relationship to pursue her.

Tl;dr - Was reached out to by the girl my ex was flirting with and trying to ask out. I had no idea. Even though there are things that I can point to that show he's not a good person, I'm extremely hurt by this news because he's always told me he's not talking to anyone else/not interested in anyone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nl6c55/21f_found_out_my_nowex_24m_was_going_after_this/

40,nl7cti,1621999907,Reasonable or Red Flags?,"I (48f) have recently moved to a new city and waded into the OLD scene. I have had many successful dates and a few very disappointing experiences... 

One thing important to mention is that I moved just before covid lockdown and did not have the opportunity to make friends or build a social circle. I am living by myself and as a result very bored and lonely. This is important as I feel it puts me in a disadvantaged position and may skew my behavior/ perception. 

Currently I am chatting with a (37m) considerably attractive, established, career oriented man (albeit younger than myself) and I am very confused by his behavior.

By virtue of the playful nature of our texts, we have seen each other several times in the past weeks, but always in a  spontaneous and quirky way ( to get a cookie from a batch I had baked not related to him; to try out the new shower head I had purchased). We have not had sex, or even kissed but the encounters do have an underlying sexual connotation.

While all this has been light and fun, it seems to be nothing beyond that; I mentioned that I was being to wonder if he was actually interested in me, and he assures me that he is but he is really busy and moves very slow.

Please let me know if the following sounds reasonable or like red flags:

- texting is generally reasonable, but takes a while to respond; will respond at very odd hours sometimes.

- is responsive but doesn't share much; will answer questions but rarely asks questions of me.

- Has been having issues sending / receiving texts. Seems he is not getting notifications of my texts and sometimes states 'why aren't my texts going through?'. I was starting to think he is just playing me, but the timing seems random and he continues to engage me after these incidences.

- while he is responsive during the week, he generally does not text on the weekends and seems to have a very busy social life.

- while trying to keep it light, my attempts to make plans and arrangements aren't going anywhere; he seems uninteresting in making time for me.

- when chatting casually / playfully (what should I bake next to lure you over, etc.), he will drop a 'just finishing up and I am out of here for a week'; then he goes radio silence.

- he is not very expressive and very hard to read; I did bring this up with him and he said that yes he is not expressive at all and he is aware of this.


I have been to his place twice and know he is truthful about his occupation and absolutely believe that he is busy.
And also believe that he has a full and previously established social life.

He is very attractive, successful, and increasingly interesting  as I learn more. Which frankly I was surprised by as I was being to think he was too pretty to be interesting.

Overall I am very attracted and intrigued, but wholly confused by his behavior. I can't help but think that he is just fucking with me.
But, I have never experienced a guy that wanted to take things slow and not try to get in my pants on the first date.....

So, does he sound legitimate or is he just entertaining himself at my expense?

TL;DR  I am looking for advice on if I am wasting my time with this person or if he may have genuine interest in me. His particular behaviour is foreign to me and therefore I am unsure if my typical interpretation is sound.
And, given living / being alone during the isolation of covid, I am having a hard time trusting my instincts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nl7cti/reasonable_or_red_flags/

42,nl7n7j,1622000944,Am I overly enthusiastic in my relationship,"So I’ve (F22) been seeing this guy(M25) for three months and since my mother language is French, he’s been trying to learn it. Today he sent me this Duolingo screenshot, complaining about a specific grammar point in French. Since I had my evening free and used to study in the field of Teaching French as a Second Language, I used my evening to pull up a non-exhaustive but decent doc explaining said grammar point in the most easy way possible and created two pages of exercise with it. Let’s say it took me around 2-3 hours but I’m not working tomorrow and it’s not even midnight where I live so it’s not like I sacrificed any amount of sleep. 

From my point of view, I enjoy understanding the French language, making nerdy PDFs and helping him learn French. I can even re-use my doc for helping out other friends in the future. Yet when I sent it to him, I sensed he felt slightly uncomfortable. He asked me if I did it all by myself and that it must have taken so much time. He appreciated the thought but it seemed that he didn’t feel comfortable at the thought of me spending my evening on such doc. I told him that beside work, I don’t have much to do and I’m a nerd for the FR language so I don’t mind but now I wonder if I come across as too enthusiastic or even creepy in this relationship.

Recently, I also told him I loved him to which he replied to me that he’s not ready to tell me so yet but he enjoys being with me. I feel like I’m putting pressure on him because I feel like I could be seen as intense. It’s not like he’d die if no one explained to him the grammar point by tonight. It’s just I felt motivated to do it. I feel I tend to try to be honest with how I’m feeling and do whatever I feel like doing but maybe I should’ve taken more into consideration how he would’ve felt when sending him this doc some six hours after he told me he didn’t understand said grammar point. It really came from a genuine will to help out and I really like him but I’m really wondering if maybe I’m a little bit too much into him.

There is a lot I can talk about, but the basic gist of all is that I really do like her personality and style of fashion. Not only that, but when I was in my lowest point at the beginning of this year, she reached out to me after she found out that both my parents were at the hospital. I was alone and she even offered to bring me lunch or anything I needed. I found that extremely cute and overall very kind.

She went to a school sponsored prom with a guy friend but that's about it. This new prom I mentioned is one that is not affiliated with my school. 

Should I ask her if she is going to said prom? Should I ask her out and ger to know her more? We are engaging in small talk but I need some advice as to how I can go about this dilemma.

I assumed he was into me because he would always text me first (now that I am more interested and want to see where things go, it is 50/50 text initiation).

But he has never made concrete plans. A month or so ago, he was like ""we should go to this museum"" and I said ""I'd love to!"" but he never actually made plans for it and after a week, I got tired of waiting and asked him when he was free and planned the time and date. We went and had an awesome time.

Now, he has suggested that 1. we go for a walk on the beach and 2. that we go to a wildlife park in our city (in different texts on different days) but he hasn't followed up or asked me when I am free or anything like that. I always reply to his suggestions with a ""Yes! I'd love to!"" so it can't be that he isn't making the plans because I seem disinterested or anything like that. 

It is really confusing because I would assume if he wanted to see me, he would ask me when I was free asap to make plans asap. 

I have no problem asking him when he is free and making the plans again but I want to know why he is doing this, why is he throwing out ideas but not following through with them.

57,nlb2ql,1622014387,Why is he acting like this?,"Me (F21) and my boyfriend (M27) have been together almost 2 years. I moved to his country and we have been living ever since. The past half year has been a very bumpy ride with him. I found out he has been using Tinder behind my back, “deleting” nudes of his exes but then saving them elsewhere, and other stuff similar of that matter. His excuse was his addictive behaviour, seeking out quick dopamine rush, that it didn’t mean anything to him and he only did it to feel good about himself. He had been depressed during that time and me, trying to be that understanding and supportive girlfriend - I forgave him. 
Ever since those discoveries I have been really struggling with my self-esteem and worth. I double question almost everything he does, try to catch glimpes of his phone screen, feel insecure and bad for acting this way at the same time. 
I am trying. I really am. And yet, I feel even more insecure although months have already passed. He says he wants to help me, he wants to make me feel beautiful, but everytime he calls me that - I think to myself “but what about all those other women that you considered beautiful”. 

He has many women friends from his hometown and is quite social. Many of those women he has fucked before, dated, kissed, etc but they are still friends up to this day. There is one girl that I literally have nightmares about. She was his last flame before he met me. They dated on and off but decided to stay friends. I always had a gut feeling about him being protective of her in some ways and that bothered me, A LOT. It wasn’t a brothely protection, but more of a romantic, that’s what I felt. I had to talk to him a few times before he deleted her picture off of his instagram profile. They still talk and I bet she still has feelings for him, because I’ve read her messages before. He would look at her pictures when he’s drunk/horny.

A few days back, I snooped on his phone (wrong of me, but this is how I found out he emotionally cheated on me) and read the messages between him and this girl. “I’m coming to town in June, let’s meet for a coffee on this day” “Congratulations my babe” - all of this is his initiative. 
I knew he wouldn’t have told me he is planning to meet her. He knows how much I don’t trust her. And this is what breaks my heart. 

I beg him to be honest with me. No matter what, even if some news would hurt me. I just want to have a peaceful mind, knowing my partner is not betraying me emotionally. He swears he would never cheat on me physically but his neurological patterns cause him to do stupid stuff like this. 

I am tired of feeling insecure, feeling like a psycho for snooping on his phone, questioning every thing he does.

So I’m stepping away from the dating game while I start medication and therapy. 

But I’m super lonely! It’s coming into winter here and all I want is just someone to cuddle with and hang out on a Saturday night. And I miss the passion and butterflies you get when you like someone. AND I miss someone texting me telling me to “have a good day”. I miss relationships but I know I would be an awful girlfriend right now because I’m not the best version of myself.

Any advice to get through this lonely period in my life?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlcsns/advice_to_distract_myself_from_dating/
65,nlcu0v,1622021623,"Should You Pay for Dating Coaching, Tinder, Sex???","I have a personal group where all my subscribers and followers are present. We have around 190+ WhatsApp group members and 180+ Telegram Members. On Instagram, I've 600 followers and on YouTube, I've 500+ followers.

Why am I telling you this?

**Let's imagine for a moment that as I approach you as a Dating Coach and tell you that I can help you with Women, with your dating life, with your social life. I can help you feel more self-confident, be more charismatic, more attractive, and a better man overall.**

Would you buy my services?

Even if I show you hours of content of me approaching random girls and taking them on a date and getting their number without the help of any external factor other than my verbal skills, personality, and understanding of attraction.

Will you invest money in me?

Will you do business with me?

You might think that it's an amazing business to be in. Because obviously there are millions of men in India who will be actively looking for dating advice and help in this area. You might even think that 'that person will become rich soon.'

Well, the reality can be a little disappointing. But I am not here to complain.

A couple of hours ago, someone posted in my group that buying tinder and bumble premium services is not worth it. You shouldn't put money to get matches. I was not shocked at this response but I wanted to show them a mirror or reality.

I am going to write the entire text as it is below. But before I do that, let's first understand what is the purpose of Tinder, Bumble, or any dating app.

**Tinder says - Bro, I will find women in your area that are now single, who are looking forward to meeting some cool guys, who will be of your age, who will be open to have a hookup or maybe a casual relationship with you. I will even tell you their age, their preferences, their distance from your house, their name, their passions. I will even show you their photos. I'll do all the hard work of finding and collecting thousands of such women who can be a good dating prospect for you, I'll even let you make a free dating profile. I will even give you a free boost when you join it.**

But, after some time, you gotta pay for it. Nothing crazy. Just like 300-500 bucks per month.

But most men reply with - Haha fuck you Tinder. You are a scam.

**Please take a moment to understand this - If tinder was a scam they won't be so successful as a business.**

I've dated and slept with (didn't wanna say this but just to prove the point) 10-12 girls in 2020 just through Tinder. In the peak time of the Covid Pandemic. If the world was normal, I am pretty sure, the numbers would have been doubled or tripled.

A friend of mine uses ONLY BUMBLE to meet girls. He meets at least 2 girls per month, every month with regularity.

My friend and flatmate (and btw) another fellow dating coach is in a relationship with a great girl for the last 4 years. They met on Tinder.

A friend of mine got married, through Tinder and is not traveling the world with her Tinder match/wife/mother of future kids.

**So, the point is - Tinder Works and produces results. Very good results. but you got to understand how to build a profile and a bio and how to use the app.**

So, I've created a Product called ""Get Her to Swipe Right"" that will help you maximize your chances, your results, and your profile's attractiveness. If you're interested, then DM me.

I've created another product ""Bullet Proof Texting"" to help you understand the dynamics of Texting and how to convert a match into a real-life date and a real-life interaction.

**That being said, here's the full Text that I sent to my group-**

Member: Because I believe spending money on dating apps is a huge waste

Me: Bro that's the thing. We don't wanna put money, we don't wanna look good, we don't wanna put hard work... All we want is a bag full of tricks and techniques so that we don't have to change ourselves. Bro I also bought Tinder Gold when I was using Tinder... Wake up, bro. Shortcuts are running out

Member: Do you mean one cannot excel in the Tinder game without buying gold or premium? You are saying like one cannot go to Kanyakumari to Kashmir by walk ... it's possible but it takes time ...

Me: You also have to understand the reward of going to Kanyakumari from Kashmir on foot. Is it worth walking for weeks just to go to Kanyakumari just so save a couple of bucks?

Is it worth doing all the effort on Dating Apps, just to get minimal results? 

Hundreds of new guys download tinder or bumble every day. There are thousands of fake profiles on Tinder.

If you understand the business model of tinder or if you understand the algorithm of tinder, then it will become pretty evident what I am saying. 

1. Tinder gives a free boost to whoever joins newly. So if you just install and join tinder, you will get some matches. But after that first free boost, tinder or bumble won't show your profile to anyone.

2. After you join and get some matches, tinder needs to give priority to new customers who are joining the application so that they are also engaged.

3. So most people get a couple of matches in the start but then nothing happens. Also, tinder is not a charity application. It has to sustain its business, so it wants people to pay. This is the reason tinder will give you a taste of the results then it will be like- Okay you have tasted the results, now pay for the same results again. 

4. Once you pay tinder, buy gold, or any premium services, tinder keeps your profile on a priority list. 

5. It will show your profile on priority to girls who are using tinder in your area or girls who are newly joined in your area.

6. You will be seen first and you'll get the priority listing. 

I understand money can be a problem. But look at it this way, if you don't have 300 rupees per month to make your profile be seen to more people, get more matches, and better matches, then how are you going to go on dates? 

One day of cold approach (daygame + nightgame) costs more than 500 bucks. Every month a beginner will spend anywhere between 5,000 rupees to 10,000 rupees just to go out and game, without getting any results. Is it worth Gaming and spending so much time and effort for months as a beginner just to get no results?

Even if you start getting results as an intermediate or an advanced guy, you'll have to travel, pay for food and drinks, pay for dates, buy clothes, pay for boot camps, pay for online courses, etc.

You just cannot escape payments or expenditure.

I am not saying whether you should pay for Tinder or Bumble, I am saying Tinder and Bumble are a really cheap and effective way to meet girls. Even if you take the costliest services of Tinder or Bumble, it's going to be far cheaper than Cold Approach. be it daygame or nightgame.

Also, people who are working are short on time. They have family, friends, work, and personal hobbies to attend to. Most people who are a professional, want to get the most of their time and free tinder profile is the least effective way to do it. Not taking coaching and boot camps is the slowest and least effective way to do it. 

Yes, you should learn by yourself. You should never put the responsibility of your entire life on your coach, but the coach will cut your learning time by 10 or maybe 100 times. You can learn something quickly and then also focus on other major areas of your life. Like a career, health, traveling, chasing better things than just sex.

So the question is simple - Do you want amazing results after going out for 5 years or do you want amazing results in 3 months? Do you want amazing matches in a week, or do you want to experiment, put time and energy for 6 months with little to no certainty of predictable results?

Even if you get a decent match after experimenting for months, is it worth all the time spent that you are not going to get back, ever? The question is if you haven't been getting results, how can you say that you will get results in the future?

Just being real with you, because I know a lot of people won't. Let's confront the brutal facts, shall we?

Another important thing to understand is Women's Dating Behaviour on Dating Apps.

We pick up artists, make our profile the best we can, and then wait for the most number of matches so that we can fuck the most number of girls possible. We aren't looking for a partner or a girlfriend. 

But girls, aren't like that. If they just wanted sex, they can get sex in one single Text by one profile photo with no bio.

They can get an overabundance of sex even if they just sit in their home and never go out, never work on themselves, never make a dating profile and just post some hot photos on Instagram with a caption that says- Text me to meet.

But usually, \~90% of women are trying to find someone they connect with and then stop using Tinder or Bumble for a while. 

Personal Example - I met a girl through Tinder, she had 900 something matches. Every guy is texting her on a daily basis. Imagine getting 900 messages per day, just from tinder. If she's on bumble too then add 500 more matches. If she has a decent Instagram profile then add 100 or something more messages. If she has an active social life, then add another 100 messages, calls, etc.

So a girl who's like 7/10 or 8/10 or above, will be getting, at a bare minimum 500 messages on a daily basis. 

Do you think she's going to see or read all the messages?

No, she'll just wait for the right guy once, once she feels that she has a connection, then she'll go out with him and completely ignore all other guys or maybe even delete the dating apps for as long as she's with that guy.

The girl I met, uninstalled tinder after meeting me. She declined all calls, all dates, she ignored all messages or calls from other guys. After we stopped seeing each other, she reinstalled Tinder and started to text back the guys who have texted her.

So, with girls, it's first come first serve. She'll usually date the first cool guy. The second guy, no matter how amazing, will have zero chance. Once she starts liking the FIRST COOL GUY, then she's totally invested in him. At least for some time. Usually for months and possibly for years.

Dating is a first come first serve the business. We have to be the FIRST COOL GUY SHE'S ATTRACTED TO.

A lot of women in India aren't the type who'll jump from one guy to another just to increase their lay count and prove that they are a master pua. They are more focused on the experience of one good guy. They are more focused on the emotional value of a relationship rather than the quantity of dicks they have taken.

Sorry, guys. I might be breaking your entire mind map and reality of game and dating. But I don't want to keep the truth from you.

It's getting to the  point now where it's upsetting me because of how stagnant it is, but I  don't want to embarrass myself by putting myself out there and getting  rejected.

Also, after chatting  over text recently, even after he was replying straight away and making  effort to keep the conversation going, he ended up leaving me on read  which didn't make me feel too good. Yet, he still shows signs of  flirting and shows interest in if I am dating etc...

75,nlegfe,1622027764,apparently my GF has EXTREME trust issues and anxiety,"This is an update to my previous post which people dont read anymore, as it seems. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njdckx/girlfriend\_has\_trust\_issues\_which\_affect\_our/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njdckx/girlfriend_has_trust_issues_which_affect_our/)

I just started to realize my girlfriend's trust issues are extreme and they are gonna ruin her life and affect the people around her alot. She said she doesn't even trust her family, her best friends or even herself! She also said something bad happened in the past that she doesn't want to talk about. We have been together for 6 months and she has only shown her face once to me, she was already anxious about that. Since then, she never wants to videochat me, the reason as she says is ""because she doesnt know me in real life so she can't trust me""

Because her anxiety is so extreme and it looks like these issues won't disappear by themself over time, I tried to explain her she needs help. She says she doesn't want help and that she wants to stop talking about the topic. She refuses to tell me what happened in the past and she also refuses to accept any help regarding her current trust issues. I tried everything, but her issues seem impossible to solve. She said she ""doesnt mind the trust issues"" and that her life is already hard anyway. She has the mindset to not do anything about it. She also doesn't want to talk with a therapist.

She really doesn't want my help or to talk about it. But it seems her ""trust issues"" will never get any better as she had them for such a long time and actually they got worse over time while I have been together with her. What do I do? Just leave it? Because of her trust issues she basically treats me like someone she met yesterday, she doesn't trust me at all and she says thats her trust issues fault and not my fault. We have been together for 5 months and she refuses to trust me more than she would trust a stranger.

I tried my best to comfort her, offer her help, convince her that im a good guy with no bad intentions but this shit seems completely impossible. I think she will keep acting like this for a very long time and I'm not gonna survive that. If she doesn't trust me at all after 6 months, and it's not my fault, meaning I can't do anything about it, how can I revive this relationship? It's going really bad because of her anxiety.

However, this past weekend I checked his recently added friends on Snapchat and they were all females. One of them being his ex that he saw right before me for a few weeks. He claims he had no feelings for her and it just fizzled out and he really just didn’t care about her. Before her, he went almost a year without sex so she was more of a get his nut in, not feelings. The other girls he added he didn’t follow on Instagram, except for one which was his friends younger sister. But what’s weird about the whole thing is that when you add new friends, it shows up on your Snapchat chat page, most of the girls weren’t there, which means that he probably deleted them so I wouldn’t see the new friendships. 

He’s not active on social media but loves watching other people’s stories (IG and Snapchat), which is why he claims he adds people. Idk this is just weird to me and part of me thinks it’s my paranoia because he hasn’t chatted with them, just added them. And he’s given me zero indication that he’s cheating / cheated.

I quit dating bullshit some time ago. It's all bullshit. I will live my own way alone instead, struggle as much as I can to die in the end. At least I will die proud. I know I didn't bow down to anyone or anything.

Someone will come and say ""you didn't meet all the women don't generalise"" None will ever meet all the women we don't have that much lifespan. We only have like 30 years at most to find a woman.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlhg13/its_such_a_shame_that_guys_dont_even_have_a/
90,nlhl4a,1622037209,Deep regret - ignored a girl in yoga class. Still have a chance?,"This beautiful girl was showing me interest in my first and second yoga class by smiling and making eye contact enthusiastically, I felt a connection and I responded by smiling and making eye contact, but we never spoke or had a conversation. Then went to a third class on a different day, didn't expect her to show up and was caught off guard. I was having severe anxiety that day due to personal problems and having a beautiful girl try and initiate eye contact with me made it worse. So I ended just ignoring completely not even making eye contact. This happened last year, I've not seen her since. But since lockdown is stopped and things have reopened maybe she might be at classes again. Since then I have improved my life a lot to try and reduce anxiety, if I was in that situation again I know I would do a lot better.

Do I still have a chance to speak to her if I see her again? Or have I blown it, only had one chance?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlhl4a/deep_regret_ignored_a_girl_in_yoga_class_still/

\-She doesn't like hugging, let alone kissing in public (as if she is ashamed of me, but I am not sure)

\-She has several times commented about not liking my haircut.

\-She often tells me to be quiet when I am telling her something in public.

\-When we walk with a group of friends she very rarely walks by my side, instead choosing to mingle among them leaving me behind.

\-She is very quick to get angry at me for what seems to me like a non-issue.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlhouj/would_you_consider_these_things_to_mean_that_my/
