0,qvmwfm,1637110319,Should I just cut him off completely?,"Been seeing a guy for 4 weeks. Originally rejected him becuz he drank too much on the first date but we did have a good convo so I gave him a second chance.

We’ve had about 6 dates now. I’ve met his friends and siblings. However this past weekend we went out with his siblings and friends to a bar and he got super high on weed and drunk. He tried fighting a guy in a bar that I had to stop (and he got mad at me for stopping him fight the dude). He then left me in the bar by myself with his family to go smoke weed and when I told him I didn’t like that, he got mad at me. That night when we got back to his place he told me (while again high and drunk) he didn’t care what I thought about him and didn’t think this would work out. I still slept over becuz I knew he was high and drunk and then the next morning he apologized and said he didn’t know why he gets mean like that when drunk.

However he reiterated that morning that he thinks we might be incompatible becuz I won’t have sex with him. He also said we’ve had six dates and he still isn’t sure what he wants with me and feels like he should know by now. Somehow I ended up staying longer at his place and we ended up going to breakfast and watching YouTube videos at his place and laughing. 

He was still a bit distant and cold the morning and afternoon though. I finally left and before I left asked him if this is what he still wanted and he said yes and said he would tell me if this wasn’t what he wanted anymore. We gave each other a kiss and hug and then I left. He hasn’t called or texted me today at all and didn’t say as I was leaving that he would text or call me like he usually does.

I called him and ended it last night. And he said he agreed it wasn’t working. I said we could still be friends and he’s still going to help me go apartment hunting on Thursday. Is this a bad idea? Should I just end things and cut him off completely? He’s just the most fun and funniest person I’ve met and if he can’t be in my life romantically, I at least want to be his friend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvmwfm/should_i_just_cut_him_off_completely/

2,qvmx04,1637110372,Should people just be honest?,"I feel like I’ve ended a lot of relationships because someone said one thing TO me and something else ABOUT me. 

I used to have a real problem with venting myself until I realized that talking smack about someone, to a person or group of people that doesn’t know them, can cause a lot of problems. Especially later when they’re like “saw your update, why are you still with that jerk?” And you’re like “you don’t understand! SO really is a great person!” 

It’s too easy to write off as “immature” because it can be hard to express your true feelings with a relationship at stake. It can be easier to vent to a third party. 

But is it healthy? Should the third party be someone who knows you both, or someone completely objective and confidential like a therapist? 

TL;DR people talking behind my back instead of talking to or asking me directly has definitely ended my relationships. What is the best approach when you’re having an issue but don’t want to break up?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvmx04/should_people_just_be_honest/

7,qvnftw,1637112025,My gf (19f) of 4 years spat in my (20m) drink and lied about it.,"I doesn’t sound like a big deal and there’s context to why I’m contemplating breaking up with her. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve caught her in a lie. Earlier this year, I had written some goals and detailed notes about how I would achieve them and left it on my desk - I find that the paper is missing and ask her if she’s seen it or done anything with it. She denies touching it and then I open the bin and it’s in there, scrunched up buried in rubbish. She said it’s because I was too focused and prioritising my goals instead of focused on her. I decided to move on as I understood where she was coming from - she said she wouldn’t lie like that again. 

2 months ago: 

I thought our relationship was great and it was going well - then I randomly receive screenshots from a lady who was married to my gfs tutor (30m) , which was a conversation bashing me and how I wasn’t paying enough attention to her (I’m with her everyday single day and I was studying for exams) - I broke up with her because the messages also mentioned that they should swap partners and they would be happier together… we broke up for 3 weeks. I decided to give it another shot because she was really apologetic and showed up repeatedly 8 times after I slammed the door in her face. 

She has been amazing since then and been trying to make up for that incident - she takes me out for all meals and always travels to my place everyday (1hour bus one-way since 1+ year ago) to study and work at my place together. 

Today:

We ordered bubble tea and we were working and drinking. She took a sip of my drink to try and I tasted her drink in mine (the level of the drink also increased and I could see her drink contents in my cup). I drank my drink and she said nothing. I asked her if she did anything to my drink and she repeatedly denied it ~10 times of me asking her and edging her to tell me the truth. She finally does and she admitted it. I know it doesn’t seem like a big deal but im sick of the lying… which she always says she’ll work on it and it’s a bad habit but I can’t keep falling for it. 

We’re just about to move together overseas for University and I don’t know if that’s a good idea. She also doesn’t let me go to the gym or workout without her and I feel very restricted (another issue I wanted to post about).

We went on one date and it went really well. He drove an hour to see me since I can't drive and he said he usually doesn't do that for anyone, and that he didn't think he'd consider dating someone so soon after his last relationship ended 4 months ago, but that there was something about me. We held hands and made out on the date, and we've been texting each other for about a week since then. He's told me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, and that he could see himself spending his life with me. 

But he says that he wants to have unprotected sex with me on our second date and if the sex is good we'll become boyfriends. I'm a virgin and usually don't want to have sex with someone until we're in a relationship or at least after I know them for more than a few weeks, but I really do like this guy. I'm a little afraid that he might just want me for sex, but he has said that he's not just after sex and that he likes me when I asked him. I told him that I wasn't sure if I'd be ready to have sex with him so soon. He said we could have sex when I'm ready to but that it would delay the relationship because he wants to see how good the sex is between us before we start dating.

This really hot girl was eyeing me the whole time. She kept getting closer and closer throughout the workout.

Eventually she sits next to me to do crunches, she even asked if I was using the equipment - she spoke to me first.

We ended up talking during the workout.

When she left she introduced herself and I introduced myself and we made banter one last time.

I've gone 3-5 times a week since and haven't seen her once.

I dm'd her over IG - ""Hey it's xyz from abc gym - how are you?""

She never replies and in fact blocks me.

One thing I'm struggling with is that on top of weight gained during covid, I've had an injury for the past 2 years that has really limited my exercise. I've lost SO much tone/muscle and when I see myself now I just don't feel like *me.* I was hella fit a few years ago and the change is pretty drastic. AND, I also got hit with telogen effuvium (hair loss) and I haaaaaaate how sad my hair looks now. I just hate looking in the mirror, even when I portray confidence I just think I look terrible. I know everyone will say things like ""confidence and happiness are beautiful"" but I'm dead ass serious, I just look like shit. 

I got curious with Hinge and started talking with a guy.

I hope it was the right decision. I explained everything to him and he didn't seem to be mad/annoyed luckily.

Throughout all our text and real-life conversations, she never mentioned him once, and I feel like that's irresponsible on her part. I mean, if you're a girl hanging out one-on-one with a straight dude, it seems like common sense to just say ""I have a boyfriend, so we're only hanging out as friends"".

The vibe between us is still really good, and I think we'll make for good friends anyway, so I don't really wanna jeopardize that by bringing this up and making things awkward.

You’re upset that I have a birth defect that makes sex impossible and maybe that’s why you don’t want anything to do with me.

33,qvoyo1,1637116846,"Bad eHarmony Experience and Not So Good Tinder, Bumble, etc Experience","27 M here. I apologize for the lengthy post, but I feel that it helps to tell the whole story. So, a little background on my recent online dating experience. Joined eHarmony in February 2020. After 2 months I completely hated it. I had someone who has photography experience take pictures of me after getting my hair done by a professional hair stylist. Also dressed in a nice polo, and struck a few poses. Also included some pictures of me with my dog, and some of me in different places on vacations I went on. I am in average shape, I do have a belly, but wouldn't say that it is that noticeable. I also had a few different people proof read my description to make sure that it was detailed and eye-catching. I'll also mention I am a software developer working for a company that is known for high job security, and I am making over $80K a year. During the first month I talked to a few people, but didn't really get to meet up because they said they were busy, and often a lot of the people who replied lived very far away, so it made meeting up for dates challenging. Then in March of 2020, you guessed it, the pandemic happened and everything was terrible. Still chatted with some women on the app, but a lot of them became very busy with helping family members, trying to find new jobs due to either being laid off, or work conditions being really bad, etc. Just lots of people who cut contact in the process of all those situations. After my year subscription ended in Feb 2021 I was very disappointed with my experience and wrote a nice email to customer service asking for a full or partial refund. They responded and gave me NO REFUND, they did offer me a special discount, but I decided that I did not want to use eHarmony anymore because it was so difficult to meet up with people since everyone was scared of getting sick, getting family members sick, etc. Now don't get me wrong joining again is something I could definitely afford to do, I just choose not to because it is a big risk at this point in time in my opinion. Fast forward to the present, and I'm on every free app you can think of. Bumble, Tinder, OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, you name it, I'm on it. And after 9 months of actively using these, I haven't gotten anywhere, all conversations have ended.

So I met a guy from tinder and we went on a drive, everything went okay until we came back to my flat and he said he hates that I keep being on my phone and stuff and then he said he could tell I’m stressed as I have a lot going on. We then kissed and he offered to give me a massage which felt great. He then said he wanted to give me a massage on my legs etc so I took my jeans off but rapped a blanket round me. As he was massaging my legs he was getting closer and closer to my bum and private area and he then ended up sliding a finger in but I told him to stop and he did straight away.

I have been in a dry spell for 2+ years and I really want to date or at least fuck, but I have no idea where to meet women. I realised my problem isn't that I get rejected, it's that I literally can't remeber even trying to sexually interact with a woman for more than two years. 

Dating apps are not for me since I am not good looking and also balding/short and most of all I suck at flitratious texting, always did. So I would prefer a type of  meeting girls where I can fully present my personality (my strongest asset :P) Also I'm a 24 year old man if that helps any.

She admitted we have a ton in common and are both so sweet to each other but also said she didn't feel chemistry after 8 dates and months of texting/calling, and that it probably isn't going anywhere. She also says she likes to go really really slow, which I'm OK with as long as she wants it to go forward. She also said she does not really like physical touching much from any guy (she said whenever guys do this, it turns her off), which I have kept to a minimum. We have been so kind to each other and enjoyed every moment together. I know she has because she has always has a big smile on her face (and smiles with her eyes too), has been completely open with me (except not telling me she didn't feel chemistry until now), tells me how much fun she has, and never flakes and responds promptly via text/phone, and initiates often. So I'm just really confused. If she doesn't like touch, and our pure kindness to each other constantly and having literally everything under the sun in common isn't ""chemistry"", then what is? Should I point this out to her?? Or is this just doomed? Any ideas to salvage this? Or things I should have done differently? I'm almost certain it's over (and I'm absolutely devastated), but let's just pretend it's not (though I'm sure it is because I can't control her lack of ""chemistry"").

I am currently in a situationship with a girl where we are technically talking but we act like we are dating when we are together. From the start I tried to take things pretty slow and she rushed things along and me being weak, I gave in. It has been about three months now and the first 2 and a half months were great. We would talk on the phone almost every night, text throughout the day, and I would spend the night at her place a few times a week even. She would always invite me over to study and have dinner then convince me to stay. LIke I mentioned though, that was the first 2 and a half months, the last few weeks she has been distancing herself more and more. She even went days where she hardly even responded to me at all and when she did it was excuses as to why she couldn't reply even though she was still very much active on social media. I feel like its also worth mentioning that she is always talking to random guys she meets around school or work and what not, and when we are together I see her responding to them immediately even though she always has excuses for why she takes forever to respond to me. Also when I flirt with her like I used to she either does not acknowledge it or replies in a very dry manner. I tried asking her if everything was okay about a week ago and she said that she had been having a rough few days and that she would start to be better but it has only gotten worse. I have gotten to the point where I know its not even worth trying to ask again since she will just ignore me or give me a bs made up answer. **I'd like to hear what you guys think might be going on and what I should do in this case.** A part of me knows I should most likely cut my losses and take it as a sign to start moving on, but its hard and I just keep giving her the benefit of the doubt even though she really hasn't given me reason to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvqeow/girl_im_talking_to_taking_longer_and_longer_to/

58,qvqwnl,1637123122,Would you date someone with a hidden disability? (Ostomy Bag),"Howdy everyone! I (22F) recently had surgery to get rid of my colon due to a chronic illness (Ulcerative Colitis)

I now have an ileostomy which means I have a piece of small intestine that sticks out of my stomach and empties into a drainable bag. This is how I go #2 now. It doesn’t smell (unless I’m changing the bag itself or emptying it in the bathroom) and you can’t even tell I have an ostomy unless I make it obvious (I can even wear a bikini and you wouldn’t be able to see my bag).

What I’m curious to know is:

Would you date someone with an ostomy bag?

When would you want to learn that your date has an ostomy? (On the dating profile, 1st Date, Couple Dates In, Only Before Hooking Up?)

Right now I’m planning on telling people after a few dates/before hooking up. (I’d also talk more about my health journey over the past few years at this time since it’s pretty personal to me and something I wouldn’t want to share with everyone because it’s a little traumatic to talk about because of medical PTSD)

My reasoning for not disclosing I have an ostomy right away is that I want people to form their opinions of me based on who I am - not based on my disability (plus it’s not normal for abled-bodied people to talk about their bathroom habits on the first few dates so why should I?)

I worry though that some people might feel misled because I’m not open right away about my disability since it does impact how I look under my clothes.

Dating just feels so superficial. I feel like I can’t find a person willing to look past my appearance.

Girls that are on the same level as me seem like they find me more unattractive than girls or of my league.

I don’t see many people like me. The rare occasion I do, they’re alone. Usually into they 40s without a wedding ring and an outfit that screams loneliness. Either that or they kill themselves out of said loneliness.

He ended up not responding with me for a day and the next day he told me that he feels very misunderstood and one thing he asked from me was to be understood. And how he had to pull his sh*t together and will be back later.

So maybe she did really need space, but more than likely it was the “with you” and let me play the field. 

Haven’t spoke to her in over a month and basically said goodbye forever to her when I walked away. Based on how I said goodbye I don’t think she would reach out if she wanted to. It wasn’t a harsh goodbye but, “I hope you find what you’re looking for and I hope you heal. Goodbye and take care.” 

Maybe I’m looking too far into this, but I feel like that doesn’t leave room for her to come back if she wanted too. She said she just needed time and now looking back on it maybe I messed up.

77,qvs5cm,1637127490,Attracted to a co-worker who knows I like her. What do i do next??,"Pre-Story  
So for a little input, I'm a complete scaredy-cat who had never talked to a girl I genuinely like before. I've casually flirted with girls before, but girls I don't really see on a daily basis or girls that ill probably never have a future with (sorry if that makes me sound like a douche bag). So recently I moved out of my parents house to a new city where i could start a new life (Toxic family, TMI) I got an incredible job with amazing coworkers that pays well. From what i understand, there is no serious consequences for work relationships so I'm good on that end.  


The Actual Story:  
Id say on my 3rd day of working there i noticed this really beautiful Nepali girl. She had looked at me and i looked at her and we both turn our heads away really fast (this happened multiple times.)  I was curious about her, so i had asked my friend who had been working there for some time now about her. He told me that our other coworker in our little group is good friends with her because they are both from the same country. I eventually mustered up the strength the week after that (today) to ask that coworker about the one I'm interested in and she told me a bunch of stuff about her. Like how's she single and a bunch of other stuff. She also mentioned that because she hasn't been in a relationship for a really long time, she is also very shy, as well as that she is very traditional when it comes to stuff like this so she would prefer the man to take the initiative in a sense. on that same day, my coworker had mentioned to me that she told the girl I like that I like her. She mentioned that after she told her, she had said she kind of knew from the beginning that i might have liked her (I'm not exactly the best at hiding how I feel when it comes to romance if you know what i mean). So now she is entirely aware that i like her, like, like like her. and im stuck in a situation where i know i have to take the initiative, but I seriously don't know how to.  


Finale:  
So, please reddit dating gurus, what do i do? I dont know what it is about this girl but just thinking about her gives me butterflies in my stomach and completely distracts me from what im doing. I feel like if i mess this up or i take too long to do anything ill miss out on THE ONE for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvs5cm/attracted_to_a_coworker_who_knows_i_like_her_what/

She was stationed in Florida and I was in California. We hit it off and had plans to meet up. We talked, mostly text a lot. Then she got orders to spain. After the communication got scarce. I got her some flowers for valentines day and a bear because I told her I liked her and wanted her to feel special. Took her two weeks reluctantly to say thank you. I was like that's messed up. I called her when she went to spain and her answer was, ""what do you want with my life""? That was in march of 2021 and she told me I don't like talking on the phone. I'm like how was I supposed to know if you don't say anything to me? One thing I told her was look, I like you but your communication sucks and on messenger, you leave me on read, or don't even respond. If you're busy or not intetested, just let me know. I wanna get to know you more.  Idk what I did to her to have her answer like that. Ever her friend said I should let that go. I clearly didn't listen. I wanted to travel spain even before I knew she was going so I went for a month. I messaged her multiple times during her deployment and just said, ""hey, thinking about you, hope all is well, imma be in spain during this time, hope you have some time for me"". Then she got back in august of this year and said, ""who did you come here to see""? I was like do you even have to ask? She then accused me of telling people I came to see her which I said it would be cool if I could but not the reason why I came. She said I have my daughter and you never asked what I had planned. But like I said I've been messeging you for months but no answer.  I'm always the one reaching out, checking on her, which she did for about a month, then stopped. I even sent packages to her as a surprise because she mentions she doesnt like it over there. While I was there, she said she was staying behind when the ship leaves and we can do something for a couple days. I'm excited and happy. I finally get to meet her. I'm messaging her for 5 days, just leaves me on read, then finally she messages back and saying she has plans with her daughter the same days she planned with me. I'm was like why even bother tryna meet up then? No answer obviously. After that I told her how I felt with all these games, etc and BS. NOTHING AGAIN. Fast forward to my last day in spain, we talk and I'm like let's meet up for a drink or food since I'm leaving tomorrow and still haven't met her. She's like, ""you leave tomorrow""? I'm like yeah I told you this before. I'm hitting her up, she says can you stop blowing up my phone. I'm like wow, I just wanted to see you. October she hit me up becsuse I helped her study for an exam, asked her multiple times did she pass, but no answer. I found out she didn't make the list even tho she passed the exam in march🙄. Then she accused me of catfishing her and posing as someone else to get us together and I told her why when I have your number and social media. I've been tryna get with you but I say I'm interested, you blow me off or say nothing. I said I like you and after 10 months, you say I gotta think about it. I want you, but you say no one wants you lol. I showed her proof i didnt do it but she still dont believe me. I asked her, ""so whats up""?

I (26M) have been dating (25F) for 4-5 months now. Things have been really great, and she seems like a cool person. We usually see each other every week at my place, the last time we met I dropped her off at her place and everything was fine
 

 I knew I would be busy with school and work for the next few weeks, so I asked her out for a weekend out of town 4 weeks out from now. She agreed. I think I miscommunicated because she may have been expecting dates in between? I didn't exactly tell her that I was busy juggling a lot of things. 

Either way, it's been 3 weeks since our last meeting. We have been communicating, albeit slightly lower than normal. I told her I was busy with exams, she wished me good luck etc. 
Then I get a message that she's calling the relationship off because things have been ""weird"". I asked her if she doesn't want to hang out anymore and she said ""I don't know, text me or meet me if you're still interested.""

I left it at that. The next day, she texted me - hey sorry, I went a little crazy. I didn't reply. Then she texts me again in the morning ""don't you wanna talk to me anymore?""
Then, when I didn't respond she messages me on instagram, I finally reply telling her I didn't like how she called things off without any conversation. She said sorry, that she got anxious and overthought and didn't mean it. What the HECK?  Then she texted me again asking if we could talk, and we did. She told me we used to talk so much and now I don't text her anymore, and that we haven't met in weeks. Fair enough. I apologize, tell her I'm sorry, that I was busy, and if she still wants to hang out that weekend. She said yeah and apologized again. 


I still felt weird about it. Like she got too clingy. I was still processing what happened, and with work etc it's so overwhelming. I don't know if this is indicative of bigger issues in her like anger management or abuse? 

Anyway, all this made me realize I really just want to be with my ex, whom I truly loved (not that I wasn't being since with this girl), so I told her politely as possible. She called me a turd and wished me a _very_ sarcastic good luck.

I don't have the energy to go out dating a lot.  

-

I'm always a gentleman, I pay even when she insists to pay, I open the door for her, tip waiter or whatever.

-

This girl and I had chatted for 2 months prior to the actual date, so we covered things like our likes, hobbies, interest, religion, etc... and we have 100% in common and was mind blown!

When our first date came, I hugged her from the start and gave her a compliment when we walked in.  We mainly just touched up on topics we talked about and I even made one sexual innuendo without even noticing until now that I've been reading things up.  It only lasted an hour because of work.  She was all smiles throughout the date and I even picked her up for a photo.

I attempt to kiss her at the end of the date (I lunged at her saying ""come here"") and she gave me the cheek.  However, after a few hours had gone by, she wanted to see me again on that weekend with a smiley face with hearts.  (I learned that it's best to mess with her hair and slowly get close to her, tease and then quick kiss)  So I learned something.

-

At this point, I got too comfortable...

-

The second date came and she had her hair down, I hugged her and (DID NOT compliment her at all) we went to play some games at the arcade and just talked about last time being at the arcades and just playing games beating each other scores... that's it, nothing sexual, interesting, just hanging out like friends.  After an hour went by, she pulled her hair up, we played bowling and had alcoholic drinks which we shared.  As last time, we played bowling with nothing sexual... just cheering each other on... high fives and that's it... when we left she gave a sexual innuendo, which I just smile and nod because I wasn't sure what she meant or how to respond... I asked if she wanted to go in her car and she said it's messy, which we decided to play pool... half way the game she seemed annoyed and said she was tired.  I walked her to her car and hugged her and she left.

-

The next date was almost 2 weeks later due to a cancellation.

-

Again, too comfortable.  However, I texted her a sexual reference of golfing which she liked and sent me kiss emoji face and a devil smiling face and said we'll grab drinks after.

-

On this date, we hugged (DID NOT compliment her again) made a very short talk about an event which we then went to play our mini-golf and I tried to make a short simple story of something that had happened the last time I played golf with the family and which I asked if she had any siblings... she was hesitant, but answered... we played normally, I asked her stuff like what's music she's into and she said ""anything"" and we continued playing normally... when the game ended, we walked to play some arcade games and when I asked to grab some drinks she said she was tired...  as we left I asked if we can go to her place and she said ""what, noo""... and we hugged and that's that.


-


I didn't hear back from her after two weeks and a half, which after the first week.  I first wrote the day after the date, which then I waited a week for another date, which then a few days later I told her what I wanted to do during the date which then I waited another few days and said if everything is ok, which then I started to text her I didn't mean going to her place sexual, just wanted to hang out and watch a movie since we had talked about that prior to ever meeting. 

She eventually said she wasn't in the right headspace for a romantic relationship and that I deserve someone better who can communicate daily since she's busy with work.  But she had fun with me and enjoyed the time spent.

I then bombarded her with 10 paragraph texts, even telling her I like her and asking for another chance....which she still hasn't replied to.  

It's been a month and I think it's game over...

-


So, please for the love of God.  What killed her attraction and what should I've done to fix it because clearly she was interested and she eventually gave up.  People have told me it's because I didn't sexually attract her and some say I didn't make good conversation with her.

She is great, and we have excellent chemistry, great conversation and sex. She seems smart and mature about many things but there are few things that have been making me worried and I'm not sure how to process that. Overall I like her.

We seem to have completely different environment. I was always a nerd, barely partied or got laid, but have been quite fit and make really good money ($550k) since I've been out of university and made great career moves. She meanwhile, seemed to have exactly opposite experience -- of being in parties almost every weekend, having several casual partners, not sure what to do, and currently makes 7 times less than what I do.

I've not dated much as I was working hard (but always took care of myself), and among the limited experience I've, I've great chemistry with her and I do like her. But certain things do bother me (either due to my limited experience or a bit traditional thinking).  

- She mentioned she did coke, psychedelics (limited number of times). I did mention it is a dealbreaker for me if that is something she wants to keep doing and I couldn't get a read about whether she is still ok doing that. She said she is ok, but I couldn't tell if she meant it. 
- She has had many more partners (17 vs 4, which I guess I can live with), but it makes me worried about trust. She still seems a bit impulsive about jumping to sex.
- Financially, we decided to do 70/30 split. 
- She also seemed a bit closed off, and less vulnerable (which she said it takes time for her to). Sometimes her answers are rather vague or don't make sense to me, like reason for last serious relationship breakup etc.

I think I'm also being insecure here with my inexperience with dating, and maybe the concern I've is very common thing (e.g. trying psychedelics once in a while). Based on the people she has dated who seem like very different from me, I'm anxious that, I'm probably the safe/stable choice that one can settle for. I'm not sure how to process that, build trust or make a decision on whether to continue this?
