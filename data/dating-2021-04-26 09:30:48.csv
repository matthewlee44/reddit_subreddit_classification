First of all you are a total sweetheart and I adore you. You are absolutely doing everything sweet and wonderful and patient.

Right now I am just feeling a bit overwhelmed with life in general and perhaps feeling not ready to be dating.

I want to keep you in my life 100% because when it does feel right, you are exactly the kind of guy I should be dating.

But I feel terrible being flaky as I manage my daughter and my crazy schedule. Can we keep in touch and perhaps pick things up when the school year ends and my life is less crazy?

This past weekend was incredibly busy for her, and since we're both introverts, I understood her when she said she was socially exhausted before she even went out. Today, I asked her if she'd be interested in grabbing a bite as part of our upcoming date. She said she had a long weekend, and that she's going to pass on dinner as a result.

The date itself is still on. She didn't cancel the date altogether which is good, yeah? Still, I'm worried she's maybe losing interest‚Äîor maybe she isn't and I'm just overthinking.

I had met a few people and they were okay with my FwB idea, but for any reason I don‚Äôt know it just cut off so quick and it made me feel like they agreed with me just to get the sex!

Recently I‚Äôm kinda fooling around with a coworker and he told me he‚Äôs not in the right place for any thing serious now, which is perfect for me, and more than that he‚Äôs cute and likes me back. So we exchanged numbers and been sexting for a while as well as flirting and touching while nobody‚Äôs around/ break time... I found it pretty fun and exciting at work. We also talked about coming over and fuck but things came up and it‚Äôd never happened so far while I wanted it so much.  Like while we were sexting he usually asked me to come over... whenever he felt like he wanted it, which could be too late for me or I‚Äôd be busy with my stuffs. And when I tried to set time for it (twice) either he fell asleep or busy... so yeah nothing happened yet but we still kept teasing each other, dirty texting (which I enjoyed), checking out each other (but we never kissed/ hugged lol)... besides that when we were just talking he also shared some of his stories with me and I really like listening to them. I had to admit that I have a crush on him, but just that, it doesn‚Äôt have to be anything further. Last week after work he asked me out for a coffee and then lunch. I was quite surprised but still went with it and the whole time was just lunch and touching. We also thought about doing it in the toilet but turned out it was not a nice one. I rubbed his hair and made him feel comfortable, and I liked it too. It was sooo hot and sexy and I just wanted to rip off his shirt lol. Then we had to got back to work. He messaged me some dirty things during work that day and suddenly stopped. The next day I saw him at work but there was no touching at all. I got home and sent him a few flirty messages and the last one was just delivered and never seen until now. We‚Äôre on a holiday so I‚Äôm not gonna see him in the next two weeks. Maybe he just wants to cut it off as this coworker-mingling is pretty risky. That would be fine for me but at least I hope he‚Äôd say something. I just hate being ghosted like this, cause everything seemed to be so fun. It somehow made me feel more excited to go to work. And I just want something fun like this. I feel like it‚Äôs so hard for me to get a FwB blah

By the way he‚Äôd been kinda hot and cold when we were texting. This time could be just the ‚Äúcold‚Äù.

We‚Äôre both in college and he is a very attractive guy who can easily find other girls to sleep with. I made him wait a long time before we could ever have sex. We had sleepovers, watched movies, talked, and about a year in we eventually had sex. Throughout the 2 years we‚Äôve only really had sex 4 times because the relationship is extremely toxic. The main issue is that I never got commitment. I even told him before we ever had sex that I want to be with him and he told me the same. But still never got a label, doesn‚Äôt take me on dates, doesn‚Äôt treat me like I‚Äôm his girl. I‚Äôve cut it off endless times but each time he comes back literally pleading for me to take him back. I‚Äôve blocked him and he‚Äôs made fake accounts and called me from different numbers to get in contact. Each time I would take him back because I do have feelings for him and I hope he will change, but every time the same thing happens. I have gotten to the point where I think there might be something wrong with him mentally. He completely avoids accountability, blames everything on me, and makes me feel like I am the problem and sometimes I will even believe it. 
Trust me I know half of this is my fault because I am allowing it I‚Äôve heard it a million times. I just want to ask this question: why do guys do this? If a man knows he is completely damaging a kind person who only has pure intentions for him and wants a relationship and leaves for their own mental health, why do they refuse to let that person go??

Please forgive my ignorance on this topic, also. I have been married for a long time, going through a divorce, and have not dated in 17 years. Things have changed a lot, so I honestly have no idea how this is handled now. 

For context, I live in the United States. 

How do you track and disclose your STD status to potential partners? Is there an app for that now? When I was dating before, I got tested regularly at my doctor, and was just verbally told the results, had lab reports copied if I needed them, and just told my partners the results. I‚Äôve never had a partner show me their results before, we kinda went on the honors system back then, and yeah‚Äîthat didn‚Äôt work well. 

I have a regular checkup in the next few days, and even though I am not even remotely considering dating right now, it‚Äôs possible I will in the next 12 months. Maybe. I don‚Äôt know, but if I do, I want to be prepared and have my ducks in a row. 

What do you look for? How do you disclose or communicate results or‚Ä¶? Maybe I should have put this in ‚Äúexplain it like I‚Äôm 5‚Äù lol!

It was really intense. We were both incredibly attracted to each other and we both said that it was the most intense dating experience either of us had ever had (we said this at the time and as things ended). He ended things after I tried to define the relationship. He seemed to just freak out. He suddenly said it was all too much and too intense. He said he didn't stop liking me but things between us overwhelmed him. We met to discuss, and he said finally that he just wasn't ready for a relationship. I asked if there was any future potential. He said no. I asked if he still liked me. He said yes. I asked if he still felt the same as he did initially. He said yes. I said we will now never see each other again. He said he knew that, though didn't seem to care. He said he was ok thinking about me being with another man. He seemed to suggest I liked him more than he liked me. This is despite the fact he was exceptionally full on with me and told all of our mutuals and his family we were dating and told me several times just how much he liked me. We discussed the future a fair amount. I was completely blindsided by things ending. He just did a complete 180, was completely cold and distant. I've never known anything like it. I know this is written from my perspective but I honestly did nothing wrong and feel like I handled the whole thing quite gracefully. I didn't cry or beg or anything like that, I was just really hurt and confused.

I went no contact immediately after our final conversation. I blocked him. We haven't spoken in nearly 2 months. I felt ok initially but as time goes on I just miss him more and more. I don't know how to stop thinking of him. I am working on myself and otherwise happy in my life. I have great friends and family and I am happy in all other aspects of my life. We just had something that felt so lovely and innocent and special. I'm just having a hard time moving on, and I find myself thinking of him more, not less, as time goes on.

I‚Äôm 26 F and an extreme extrovert who loves partying, travelling and meeting new people. My tryst with hooking up with men started when I was 20 and eventually became this  unhealthy coping mechanism against depression and anxiety. 
I have had the one fairly serious relationship when I was 21 and broke up at 23. Since then the spree of hookups began again and never ended. It has become a part of my lifestyle now. Somewhat like a bad habit I can‚Äôt knock off. I call it bad because I‚Äôm now starting to reflect on how I‚Äôve let mediocre men treat me be it in bed or just generally. I now crave companionship something meaningful. However much it freaks me out.

I don‚Äôt know how to meet someone off a dating app and not have sex on the first date. It‚Äôs probably because I think I‚Äôm worth nothing more except a good f**k. Albeit, I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm very good in bed 

I suffer from body image issues, although they‚Äôve lessened now that I‚Äôm in my late 20s. I‚Äôm actively working on this and realising my blind spots. 

Despite spending so much time with myself and growing to enjoy my company, I‚Äôm unable to settle the parts of me which are actually meant for loving someone else.

Now, YoUr JuSt A fRiEnD tO mE","So here's some back story  I (26m) met this girl several years (23f) ago, and there has always been some romantic &amp; sexual tension between us. Winter of 2020, we had a slight falling out &amp; didnt talk until NYE of this year, where she messaged me saying she misses hanging out &amp; talking with me. Recently she tells me she was drunk that night she sent that. This will be important later.

She moved away for university &amp; recently moved back to my area. She had an exam to study up for. Around February of this year, I had some friends over &amp; invited her over as well. My friends said that they could see that she really wanted me &amp; left. she had a few drinks, but Nothing happened. we cleared the air &amp; talked about how we agreed to put the past behind us &amp; move on. I leaned in for a kiss &amp; she said she wasn't ready yet... keyword yet. This will also be important later.

Several weeks after I invited just her, but when she came by she was a lot more distant.. now she was uncomfortable when I tried to get close to her. At the end of the night she said she wanted to be friends before anything else developed to which I agreed fully based on my own past experiences. 

She writes her test, passes, she comes over to celebrate. She has a bit to drink, leans in for a kiss, we danced &amp; stuff and were both having a great time, thinking we both shared the same mutual feelings for each other. She stays the night, and in the morning clarifies that we aren't putting a label on whatever it is thats going on with us, but we're just going to enjoy each other's company. 

She comes over this friday. Her birthday is the next day, and mine is tomorrow so we shared some birthday gifts, and I got all close &amp; I could sense the tension in her body language. She then a few minutes later keeps harping on about how im her friend to an excess for the rest of the afternoon.

I ask for some clarification to the night she stayed over &amp; admits that she doesn't behave like herself when she drinks, and despite that stuff happening where we kissed, danced, slept in the same bed, she still only sees me as a friend, and the real person I know wasn't the one doing those things. There were other stories &amp; details said but they aren't relevant here. Eventually, she left in tears feeling bad for stringing me along &amp; giving false hope. I was left heartbroken again thinking I had something which turned out to be a lie.

So, I've been doing some hard thinking. The only reason she messaged me the first time NYE, she was drunk. First visit? A few drinks, &amp; got flirty with me. 2nd to last visit? Drinking, yet not enough to change her judgment, by her own admission. I'm always the only one who starts conversation via text, she's never introduced me to her friends, her parents or anybody else, yet I have done that.

Whats going on? Have I been played yet again? Or am I reading into something I shouldn't be.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mz1twv/happy_birthday_now_your_just_a_friend_to_me/

We all know what it‚Äôs like. You‚Äôre chilling, relaxing, kicking back with your homies, and you see her. Perhaps, to your surprise, she sees you. First eye contact has been made, it‚Äôs probably not too long, just a second or two. 

But not a couple minutes later, you glance back (because she‚Äôs cute), only to find your eyes meet again. Maybe this time, it‚Äôs 2-3 seconds. At this point, you could wink at her and she‚Äôd know. But you keep your cool. 

I‚Äôm telling you bros, if she looks at your ass again, get up and calmly approach her. The odds of you walking away with a phone number and perhaps some date plans are very high. 

I wanted to make this because, listen, take it from me: when I was in high school, I got no action. I saw lots of girls I was into, and perhaps there was some reciprocation. But what I eventually learned after school was that you‚Äôve got to take shots you think you can land. For example...a woman ‚Äòlooking‚Äô at you (checking you out) is a clear indication that she wants to talk to you. But they aren‚Äôt always going to make that happen - you‚Äôre the confident guy, so go walk up to her. 

I‚Äôve since learned from my mistakes from my school days, and now I‚Äôm much more comfortable chatting up girls whom seem interested. Forget tinder, forget wishful thinking - if she‚Äôs checking you out, go for it. 

Tl;dr - you can‚Äôt mistake when a woman is into you. Very rarely will they approach you, so take the lead as a guy and when you keep finding those beautiful eyes connecting with yours, make it happen - that‚Äôs what she wants.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mz3lnq/if_shes_looking_at_you_go_for_it/

This is especially true for me as I live in a small to moderate sized town, and anywhere that's actually close enough to my work, not in a dodgy part of town, and is just not a shit hole is way out of my price range (around ¬£600-¬£700 per month).

My situation is probably not helped by the fact that I sold my car and used up almost all of my money travelling in Australia a couple of years ago and am now only just starting to build up a decent amount of savings. I also would not have access to a car if I moved out as I'm sharing the family ones to get around.

So yeah, due to all of the reasons stated above I feel like maybe it's not a great time to really try and get into the dating game as not many women are going to want to date a 26 year old dude who is still living with his parents.

Body language always speaks first in any conversation. When you are confident your body relaxes, becomes more open, you lean in, you smile, and you become more animated. When you are tense or not at ease with yourself, you will be sitting back, crossing your legs, maybe your arms, your mouth will barely break a smile, and your eyes will be searching elsewhere in the room. Knowing this will allow you to convey confidence with your body language. 

Your verbal dating conversation skills will largely be judged on how able you are to create a conversation that your partner enjoys. Ultimately, that leads to you getting more dates. If you‚Äôre thinking this is obvious, yes it is! The question is HOW to create an interesting conversation. 

Your dating conversation will be made up of you both asking and answering questions. If you ask the right questions, your partner is going to have fun. If you ask the wrong questions, they are going to ditch you. If you are evasive or less than honest when answering her questions, she is going to ditch you quicker.

Questions are powerful. Funny thing is that when a person is asked a direct question they somehow feel obligated to answer it. Here are some conversation starter question ideas for your first date:

‚ÄúWhat do you love to do in your spare time?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you particularly enjoy about that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you could go on a fantasy holiday, anywhere in the world, where would it be and what would you do?‚Äù

57,mz5sbu,1619465307,"How should I let my ex-gf who's blocked me on everywhere know I was very very F'd in the head when we were together, that I love her","Let me elaborate a little.

We met on tinder (M(e)19F18) in Jan and it was magical. Cryptic stuff. If someone had told me how I'd feel in a few hours' time as I was making my way to the ice skating field I would've told them sh*t like that only in happens in movies. We seemed perfect for each other and I was amazed by how well I fit in with her friends, too. Here I'd like to note that I've for my entire life struggled to find likeminded company. Nothing new under the sun I guess and I know a drunken 15-minute conversation doesn't give everything away but they reallt were amazing people.

After a few weeks she broke up with me, having started to cry a few times after we'd spent multiple days together. I couldn't believe the sh*t I was hearing, falling straight out of the honeymoon bliss to the dumps. I tried to explain how I realized I'd fucked up, it being my first relationship and all and how much she means to me. We talked a lot and things were actually getting a lot warmer between us until I screwed up, going to her place and almost fucking crying telling her how I love her in a very melancholic tone. After a week or so of very intensive crazying, topped with a very psychotic 30-minute video of me trying to explain how I felt she blocked me everywhere.

The thing is, that's not me. I know it may sound scummy but I've been secretly very depressed, anxious and generally F'd in the head for a long time. It was only after I drove my first love away that I realized I don't deserve this shit. 
That maybe after a year of crying fits, talking to myself imagining I have someone to complain to, daydreaming and manically starting projects I never finish, crushing loneliness and counting seconds to my death there might be something wrong with me.

That the answer to my problems isn't to sing, drink, joke and daydream more, buy my friends more gifts, to dress sharper and smile wider.

But I only realized this afterwards. When I imagined what the last people on the Kursk felt like and really wanted my ex, a compassionate, soft and sweet girl who I'd do anything for to give me a hug and tell me everything is going to be alright,  I said "" sorry for being so melancholic "". I'm (something to do with anxiety) fixated on knowing exactly what the causes and effects of everything are, how things are ""supposed to be"" and feeling and consequently seeming smart that I never admitted to myself or said a word to her about how fucking broken and confused I really feel. 

I wanted to just forget my problems and definitely not depress anyone else, especially her. When I told her with a big smile on my face that I had studied and sought a job I really had woken up at noon, written down one equation and stared at my CV for a few minutes before eating candy, jerking off and fantasizing about what we'll do together for the rest of the day. I barely said a word about how I really feel yet she was the only thing keeping me feeling like even half a person.

After deciding not to kill myself after she blocked me I cleaned my backpack and room instead. I fixed my bike and got a helmet, went straight-edge for a month after a few years' heavy drinking, quit smoking altogether, went to a doctor and heard I probably am bipolar. I quit popping my pimples and eating my nails. After actually sitting down to study for my uni entry exams I had no other choice than to admit I can indeed learn new things. Running 11km feels like nothing if I just put my shoes on and run. If I don't, it doesn't mean I'm a lazy piece of shit. It's really bittersweet how my life is so much better now than it ever was with her but I can't shake the thought - where was this guy when we were together? I love that woman. The fact I found a match like that in that mindstate is fucked up beyond all belief. How we seemed like the same person split in half and I drove her away because I was so messed up.


She's been depressed and anxious and how we instantly clicked was magical so how should I tell her this? I know ""Look, I have almost-a-diagnosis"" doesn't change the past but I really want to tell her I love her, that I do really believe we are a great pair if I just get my head in order and I believe she can see where I'm coming from.

I went on many dates in the last couple of years hoping to find the right man, but wasn't treated well by some guys (including sexual assault). I resorted to hookups a few times because I didn't want to give my heart to someone resulting in it being broken again (it only left me feeling unsatisfied and lonely, so I stopped doing it). I fell for someone recently -which is super rare for me- who told me he really likes me. He's ignoring me now, and I can't think of anything that might've caused it, things were good. I thought I'd finally met a nice guy, and for the first time in my life I actually felt like I might have met ""the one"". I thought I'd never ever feel that, and it made me hopeful and happy. Now I just feel stupid I fell for his act, he probably just wanted the ""chase"" and I guess I'm not interesting anymore because he got what he wanted (sex + I fell for him).

My heart feels more broken than ever. I feel lonely and unwanted. I know there are decent men out there, but I can't imagine that I'll ever find one or will be able to trust someone again. I've been disappointed so many times. I already was damaged goods, but I feel like I'm beyond repair now.

61,mz5xun,1619465706,Seeking Advice on long distance dating,"Hello all, 

I am a male (in 30s) and would like to seek advice for long distance relationship who I have with a female (2 years older than me). I left the country she was in due to family issues and have to look after my mother and father, so we have been long distance relationship since last June 2020. Due to time differences, we only text message each other in weekends only when she have time (because she an outdoor person - go out to eat etc.). 

When we talk over, it is usually over the phone or webcam to see how each is going. She messaged me often before when its morning at my time, but I believe due to stability of our relationship and her managing work &amp; her rent out homes to tenants, she message me less unless its ""a problem she needs help with (i.e. translating language, find A/C suppliers in her region)"". But one good thing is during my birthday, she ordered a customized cup which has her selfies imprinted on it, she mention if I miss her, I can look at the cup. But I will not be able to get it until I go back and visit her sometime in future

She used to sometime send her selfies to me, so that to me feel I have something which everyone else does not, but it seems nowadays she doesn't do that anymore and instead post it on facebook. I have this feeling of being ""left out"".

In long term, she does express she want to immigrate to the place where I live but first I have to marry her to sponsor her over. She has been in a working holiday at the country where I live before and likes to live there in the future. 

So I want to ask,

1. Should I continue the my proactive approach in messaging her on weekdays and phone on weekends (if time allows) even if I am the one doing the initiative?
2. Should I be worry too much if she posted bikini photos of herself on facebook? I told her I was un-comfortable with it and she told me it is for her self-confidence and I shouldn't worry it. Perhaps I shouldn't worry about such a thing?
3. Should I tell her how I feel about sharing photos between ourselves, something which we both know which links us instead of her always posting on facebook?
4. Should I buy her gifts sometimes (i.e. surprise gifts)? I don't want the relationship to degrade into it ""its all about money"" type of thing.

I have an certification exam on June 2021and these things disrupts me, making me hard to study...I am not sure what to do and would like to seek advice what to do, keep it as it is and not worry about it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mz5xun/seeking_advice_on_long_distance_dating/

Before we ever hung out, he told me that he wanted to be honest and said that he thinks he is only going to be looking for friends and that if I was comfortable with that then we could still meet up. I said yes because I thought I might not like him after meeting. 

I did end up liking him and we‚Äôve hung out a couple of times just as friends. A couple weeks ago I told him that I felt that I was starting to gain interest in him and he said :

‚ÄúI think you're pretty cool and would definitely hang out again, but I want to be honest. I don't think I'm looking for a relationship right now‚Äù

Which I took as code for ‚Äúyour fun, let‚Äôs be friends and keep me entertained until I find someone I really like‚Äù 

I distanced my feelings after this. 

So I hung out with this person again and they mentioned their ex briefly. From what I gathered it seems like it was a long relationship that just ended. 

So now I‚Äôm not sure if I should continue to crush. I haven‚Äôt had a crush since my HS years (7years ago) so it feels weird to just like someone w/any promises. My therapist said to enjoy my time with that person and just enjoy the moment. I agree. I have a lot of fun with them and I haven‚Äôt felt that type of joy in a while.

But the thing is I don't want to be dating a person for a year to make the relationship and I plan on giving out on ever being in one after this year so I wouldn't have to the time to vet someone out for a year in order to be in a relationship with them. Really I don't even have 3 months which seems to be the bare minimum depending on which article and/or study you read. Ideally it would be with in either 3 days or two weeks. 

I know I cannot control the most unpredictable variable, a human being. I've taken in the strat of being as up-front with the person as soon as a I can, which is not what most people are used to, and will talk about it with my coach the next time we meet. I'll be meeting with a coach that specializes in conversations to help with and see which class he has will better serve me. 

 Is it more of a ""sooner rather than later"" thing, or just let the other person bring it up and if they are taking too long for my likes then just drop them out of the pool (I will be dating as many people as I possibly afford the time for.) and maybe if they come back around do I take them back in with the condition that it's an actual relationship and not in the dating phase. I don't believe in ""letting it play out naturally"" and I find it to be a waste of time and leave things open to me being led on.

We met on tinder and chatted for 4 days, with both of us looking for something long term. Went out to dinner followed by a few drinks at a bar. We were both so flirty (staring at each other, inuendos, kissing, and being appropriately touchy) that I was pinching myself. It's been a while since I've felt such emotions. We then had a long make-out session followed by going all the way in the back of my car. It was fantastic!  

The best part? We've seen each other twice since and agreed not to do it again for a few dates, and we are so much more into each other now than after the first date. It made me realize that: 1. Dating as an adult is way different than being younger with no kids; 2.  feelings can go dormant; and 3. a lot of work goes into keeping such emotional connections going for the long term.

Nothing sexual though. So after we left we obviously didn't continue anything (distance+other circumstances). We kept in touch for a little after he left but eventually he stopped reaching out so i blocked him on everything because i really liked him but needed to move on.

Recently (4 months ago) i added him again on fb and he messaged me. I would also like to say now im moving to spain (in europe) for 4 years to get a bachelors degree. After i told him he said ""i wish we gonna meet again at some point"" Then like last month i added him on instagram since he had asked me about it and he messaged me saying "" (my name) i really wanna see u again"" then i said he could always visist me in madrid. and he says ""i wish im gonna visit soon then haha"" then we just started talking and he said that he was out with a friend having drinks and i joked around about how i was offended i was a drunk text. then he was like ""wym?? im texting u bc i really liked u and i feel i didnt get enough time with u, it feels good to talk to you because i looked for your social media all this time and i couldn't find it and i thought i would never be able to contact you again. it sucked."" then i told him why i blocked him and he understood and he texted me when he was sober and said he meant what he said and it wasn't just a drunken text convo.\\

like a day after that, i texted him and asked what was the purpose in telling me those things and what did he want (i wanted to know if he wanted to be with me, but i didn't exactly ask that) and he said he told me because he was missing me and that he would really love to see me again at some point in life if i want that too. i told him when he said those things it brought my feelings back even tho its hard to be together and gave me hope that we could like actually plan to meet up again and when he said that it made me like he was just being nice when he said it and didnt mean it and i told him i wish he didnt say those things cuz i caught feelings again and it gave me false hope (like him saying he wanted to see me again and not actually making plans to do that) . then he said ""im sorry i didnt mean to make u feel all that, i still like you too, but im aware of the context and know its hard to meet again. i didnt say i was gonna come i just said i hope it happens, me saying that doesnt mean that we would meet again"" then i understood and thanked him for being understanding, he offered to leave me alone if i felt it was bad for me and i said we can stay friends.

then like a week later, he sends me a tik tok meme that says ""hey i just want you to know (weird dance) you're pretty darn beautiful"" then right after went to sleep. he texted me back after waking up apologizing for falling asleep. then i asked him how he was and he told me like everything about his day and how he was feeling. then i had to go offline so i told him ""bye miss u (his name)"" and he said ""sure no prob, haha miss u too, \*kiss emoji\* i asked why he laughed and he said ""im not laughing at you i just didnt expect that"" then later on i slid up his story, we talked a bit and he left me on read (wasn't something to reply to) we havent talked since this.

other things are i posted a song on my instagram story (not a popular song) and a week later he posted it on his facebook. i also saw he liked a meme where it said ""me tryna catch MY fish after someone says theres plenty of fish in the sea. (not stalking we mutually follow some meme pages). and hes been liking my recently posted pics and hes in the top 3 of my instagram viewers (people say those are the people who interact with u the most) . it was also my birthday a couple days ago and he liked my insta post about it but didnt say happy bday. i say these things because i dont know if hes trying to get my attention or not and may just be nervous to reach out first?

75,mz6w0j,1619468189,Storage room date,"Storage room date

Decided to try out tinder for the first time and downloaded the app last week and finally met someone off their yesterday. The conversation and text messages were pretty cool and chill. Cracked jokes and laughed a lot. That same day we messaged we decided to meet cause why not? Who wasn‚Äôt to go back and fourth messaging.

All my pics on my profile are current all from 2021 and had Full body pics as well. So it‚Äôs not like he was going to be surprised by anything especially with be being a bbw on the smaller side. I drove to his place which took an hour with traffic and he met me outside when I arrived. Before I even could turn my car off I rolled the front passenger side window down and he walked up saying I‚Äôm sorry sweetheart but I really have to go to my storage unit before they close at 8 (this is just after 640pm that got there) at first I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúwtf, you couldn‚Äôt have don‚Äôt that before I got here‚Äù any who I was whatever let‚Äôs go. So I got into his car and we went down the street to his storage unit. 

It was one of those Storage place where you can always store vehicles/RVs etc. he parked next to his storage and he said I could come inside his RV while he looked for his Paper work that I needed but I was telling myself hell no I ain‚Äôt. It was maybe 15-20 mins then he was done. After we left and was driving back to his place he drove by this park that had a river where you can  had benches but we didn‚Äôt stop there, he just drove by so that I could see and then right after that he took another detour to a local swimming pool. He lives in a subdivision so he was showing all the local landmarks in his subdivision and then when he got to the pool he said he needed to read the sign that was on the gate to check some information. Now I‚Äôm sitting there in his car watching him read a sign but holding his phone up to his ear, he comes back is like sorry sweetheart but my mom called with an emergency and I have to go and see what‚Äôs going on. So he drops me back off at the front of his house and he drives off. I get back into my car but I didn‚Äôt immediately drive off. I plugged my phone in and opened up my google maps to figure out the best way home. I finally get that done and I make a 3 point turn to go back the direction I came and I see him coming back to his house and I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúI thought you had to go leave for an emergency‚Äù? I knew he was lying and have no idea why he did all that cause I didn‚Äôt even make it inside his home let alone the drive way. When he dropped me back day my car he said he felt back and that he would come to me today since I drove to him but I didn‚Äôt believe him. 

Surely I wasn‚Äôt because I wad a catfish. was it because I was a bbw and he didn‚Äôt really like that even tho it was clear from my username or full body pics? Couldn‚Äôt have been my hygiene cause I was freshly showered? I don‚Äôt get it. What was the issue ?

Why am I not surprised, what a crap company, can't even take reasonable criticism. The post didn't violate any of their posted rules lol.

I have used Tinder for awhile, and I used to really like the app.

I'm actually shocked at how greedy this company is now. They have literally passed the likes of Facebook and Apple in terms of greed, which is really saying something.

It is literally in their best interest to never or rarely show your profile to people you have liked. You are probably already paying them $20-30/month, which is absolutely outrageous btw, and they still are literally like: ""Nah, screw you, we aren't going to show your profile to anyone and intentionally severely limit your matches, try paying us $40 a month instead idiot"".

It's actually absolutely ridiculous and I've never seen a company treat their paying customers, who are already paying them a ton, **with such absolute disrespect**.

I'd be happy paying $15 or maybe even $20 a month if they didn't try to pull this kind of stuff.

Too bad Bumble is just as bad now and there are literally no alternatives.

I am like one of the guys from big bang theory. A flamboyant geek if you will. And I live in the south where it's more cool to be into the outdoors and things like reality tv than it is to be into comic books and unrealistic characters and story lines. I get told I'm ""too childish"" for some girls. And I ask why. They tell me that ""that anime, star wars, superhero, and cartoon stuff you like is for kids."" So I proceed to tell them that I am who I am and I won't change. Now I've had some geeky girlfriends. But they didn't work out obviously. They left and simply said I can't see myself with you. Or I left them because they were too clingy. I've been told by numerous people I'm not bad looking for a big guy. And it's not all fat. I can flex any muscle in my body and you'll feel something solid under the fat. I did martial arts for a while and before highschool was over i was fit enough to join the military and run 3 miles a day and do 300 pushups, sit ups, and squats in 6 sets of 50 as well as a 5 minute plank before bed every night. I was turned down by the marines because of many of my mental disorders so i ate my feelings. Now I've gained 80 pounds. Not all of it is fat. I'd wager if i just lost 60 pounds I'd look very fit. But if i lose 80 pounds my muscles would have more definition because there'd be less of a percentage of fat. My body fat is probably at 30%. Cause every single bit of it all went to my inner thighs and stomach. Which sucks. I tried online dating but all of my matches are not attractive to me and I want someone that I like to look at at least a little bit. So maybe I should get in shape before I try dating again. My number one rule for myself is if I want a good looking girl then i have to be good looking. I have to be fit. Cause I can't expect to be with someone and set that rule for them if I'm not following the same rule. Maybe when I'm fit enough to cosplay I'll head to a comic con thing and try to meet somebody.

78,mz74un,1619468832,Asking if someone's still interested,"So I've been on a couple dates with this guy I met from bumble. We're both 24. The dates have gone really well, and before our third date, everything was going great - he seemed interested in me, and it seemed like he was into possibly pursuing a relationship. But, we haven't necessarily talked about that, and both of our profiles do say 'Don't know yet' instead of wanting a relationship or something casual. 

Then, we had our third 'date', where I stayed the night at his place. I felt the night went well, and he *said* he had a good time. When I got home, I sent the usual 'I had a great time thanks for inviting me over' text, and asked if he'd be interested in hanging out again, to which he responded saying 'definitely'. Since then, though, it's seemed like he's backed off a bit - we've normally talked throughout the day each day, and now he's starting less conversations and not responding to more messages. While I wasn't totally invested in this guy beforehand, I now feel a lot more interested, so this is messing with me a bit.

I've been strung along before, and I'm just generally someone who prefers to be direct, since I don't like wasting my time. So, am I just overthinking this all, now that I'm interested?

85,mz7ul4,1619470720,"How do you tell the difference between a woman looking at you because she is attracted to you, and if she is just looking at you because you look weird or she's creeped out by you?","I was at the gym the other day and I honestly dont know if I'm physically attractive or not, like I'm tall (6'2) and really athletic so I have a lean muscular build. But I've caught occasionally a woman glancing at me whether im working out or walking around. I cant tell if they make eye contact with me because I'm attractive or if I'm unattractive or make them feel wierd.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read that if a woman looks at you a couple of times its because she's interested. But I've also read that she needs to smile at you to signal interest. At the gym I go to when you're in the middle of a workout you can pull your mask down briefly until you finish your set and put it back on between breaks so between breaks I can see their mouths. However they do glance at me more than a few times but they never smile at me so it makes me a little insecure as to what they are thinking about me whether if they think im attractive, creepy, or weird looking. My mask is up at all times when I work out so i cant really smile back at them. And even if I did every time I attempt to smile I feel so insecure like, ""No dont do that, what if they think I'm a creep and get uncomfortable when I look at them?""

88,mz84wu,1619471464,I developed a mental health related app based on CBT which saved my relationship!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn‚Äôt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to get into argument with my partner for no reason. So I just started noting what activities I did with him in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with him doing certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. This also saved our relationship.

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

89,mz8at3,1619471893,Not sure where to go from here... SOS!,"Not sure where to go from here! SOS!

I met this guy at the end of February. He was super nice and good at texting throughout the days before we met but a couple weeks into it he asked why my last relationship ended. I didn‚Äôt give him the full story but told him it just didn‚Äôt work out and we were together for 10 years (I‚Äôm 29 and this guy is 30). I‚Äôm not sure if that scared him off but we‚Äôve hung out like nine times since and had sex after five dates.

I really like him and I am starting to feel myself getting attached. He told me a couple weeks ago he is too busy with work to give 110% and be in a relationship. Which hurt. I initiated us getting together last Friday and texted him to ask if wanted to get a drink and we went out and had a lot of fun and I ended up sleeping at his place, it was the first time in three weeks that I had seen him. He was complimenting me, opening the door for me and holding my hand in the streets! I don‚Äôt know where to go from here especially with the mixed signals. This is so hard for me! Even though my last relationship ended only eight months ago, I have found myself so happy just spending time with this guy. Should I distance myself and see if he comes around? Should I just enjoy spending time with him and getting to know him or just cut it off before I get even more attached?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mz8at3/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here_sos/

93,mz8pkk,1619472998,How to stop being so torn up about a man ghosting me?,"I (22f) had been dating this guy (28 m) for the past couple of months. After our first date, I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to see him again. He is a very rich and successful business man, but was pretty arrogant the very first time I saw him, being a bit rude to the waiter and spending extravagant amounts of money which turned me off at first. But after that date, he continued to ask me out until I finally said yes. 

Once I got to know him better, I saw the person he is underneath the front he puts up to everybody else. He is sensitive and emotional, he even cried in front of me one night revealing a lot about his past and losses he has been through he tells no one about. He revealed that his past trauma has led to his struggles with alcohol and cocaine use, and smoking cigarettes. While at first something like this would have pushed me away, I wanted to continue to support him and be there for him and pursue a relationship because I like the person he was inside. 

He can be quite rude and arrogant sometimes, expecting money to fix the smallest inconveniences. While it irritated me, I also was jealous he had such power and control over every aspect of his life. I feel as if he did have a bit of a power complex, not feeling like he should be expected to do things that other guys would do in a relationship, like pick a woman up for a date or walk her to her car at the end of the night. Whenever I asked him to do something like this, he would laugh or complain. But I was still drawn to him. 

I liked our deep conversations and that he revealed a side of himself to me that I don‚Äôt think anybody else typically sees. He is surrounded by people just like himself most of the time (rich and successful partiers). We continued to go on dates for the next two months after that but just this past week he ghosted me out of nowhere. I had spent the night at his house and left the next morning and he kissed me goodbye and said he would see me soon. I texted him once I got home and he replied, but then once I replied to him he never responded again. 

It‚Äôs been five days now. I‚Äôm very confused and hurt. I saw a future with him and it was very nice to be with somebody who had such an exciting life involving fun events and activities and took me out to these amazing places that I would‚Äôve never dreamed of going before. 

I‚Äôm really depressed. I just wanna know what I did wrong. The only thing I can think of is him opening up to me made him feel vulnerable and he didn‚Äôt want to be around me anymore because I knew that side of him. I don‚Äôt know if that even makes sense..

TL;DR: A man I was dating ghosted me. If we were probably incompatible in the long term, why am I so torn up about this and how can I feel better?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mz8pkk/how_to_stop_being_so_torn_up_about_a_man_ghosting/

96,mz988m,1619474410,Telling someone you don‚Äôt want to text anymore,"I‚Äôve never posted here, sorry if I do it wrong! 

I (31F) been talking to a guy (48M) who i met on Tinder for a couple of weeks now. Hes about an hour away, but cute, seemingly normal and nice. We have been texting sparingly, but consistently (at least once a day) since we exchanged numbers. We‚Äôre both pretty busy with work and kids, and do not have eminent plans to meet, but have both said that we would like to do so at some point. 

Something made me google him last night, and i unfortunately found out that he was arrested about 3 years ago for a domestic violence incident with his ex-wife and her boyfriend. Neither party pressed charges, but this was reported on because he has a public job. 

I understand that it is somewhat unfair to judge someone solely based on a one-sided account of what was possibly one of the worst incidents of their life, but i no longer wish to speak to him anymore, because 1) I‚Äôm fairly newly sober, this incident involved alcohol, and i fear this could be a triggering behavior, and 2) i have been in a relationship where domestic violence occurred, and i would like to do anything within my power not to open myself (or more importantly, my children) up to that possibility ever again. 

My question is, should i ghost, or explain why i don‚Äôt want to talk anymore or meet in person?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mz988m/telling_someone_you_dont_want_to_text_anymore/
