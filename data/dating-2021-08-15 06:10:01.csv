You are mostly disinterested in them, their feelings, their life, their experience. You’re just indifferent. You don’t care. If they’re nice to you, you’ll be nice to them sure, but you won’t go out of your way to associate with them.

7,p4syya,1629032385,I have fallen for a guy I never thought possible.,"We are both the same age, 26.

We are working on similar fields. 

He has been an invisible presence in my life in the sense that he is a family friend, so much that our extended families know us just be face. He is my father's best friends son. 

But I have essentially met him only 5 years ago due to us living in different states. Like 2000 miles apart. And I have met him over the years, say for at most an hour and half of which was surrounded by family. 

Everytime we met, I have always felt like his attention was just on me. Be it the total ""alone"" time in very public places is maybe 20 minutes over the 5 years. 

But we talk every day by text or call for the 5 years. We talk through the night..till 4-5 am many times. But he never says goodnight or morning. 

Constantly. I'm the one who leaves sometimes but he has always pulled me back to him. Never once gets angry. Only once when I said he doesn't care about me in a fight. And that too was just stern and never raised his voice. He is always, always so very patient. Understanding. Seemingly so very perfect with his professional goals. Life aspirations. He talks so passionately. Honestly. Bluntly sometimes. 

I find that he is very much like me. Not sharing things that bothers him. Always being there for me. Listening to me. 

Even very gently provides solutions on my career and ways to improve myself. Always says he believes in me.

He is soo smart and yet tells me that I'm the smarter one.

 If I say something bothers me, he'll never touch that topic again or apologize of he does. Or asks me for a reason and let's it go when I don't provide the reason.

He always acts strong. And everytime I think of him, I'm filled with this feeling of love and happiness. It's crazy how he can affect me so much. 

We talked about relationships, I have been in one very but not for the past 5 years. He says he has never been in one because he is working on his career. And he sincerely means that. I sometimes feel that earning money is more important for him. He does care about his family and everything. Ignores no one. But he says that relationships are something he can't think of right now. 

And I was of the same opinion. But recently, I can't get my head out of him. I keep thinking about him. Weird dreams where we are kissing (lol). I just want to be with him, seee him (haven't since the pandemic)

I'm scared that he won't feel the same way if I tell him. And I know I should tell him and I'll know for sure and all. But I have never felt anything like this before. He seems too good. I tried to fight this off (ghosted him for 4 months) and it didn't work. 

I tried to concentrate on work and it works for sometime but something funny or important comes up and I think of something he said. And here we go again. I have enrolled in 5 classes. Plus full time work (yes, coffee is my bff). 

I'm so torn. I don't want to tell him if his answer will be a no. But I don't know what I can do with the distance and the goals (mine too as I have a lot to do myself).

Hey guys. I had some questions that I wanted to ask.

TLDR I'm 20M she's 19F, we met on tinder, she lives in a city 200 miles away from me. Now we are both introverts and she is pretty shy, so am I.

We started texting and after 3 months we went on our first date, couldn't arrange that faster since I had exams and so did she. Our date went great, it was awkward obviously but we managed to stick it out for 9 hours. We also had a second date, where it went even better, again an 8 hour date.

In our last text she said she will go to my city for college and should come to that city in a week to get prepared and what not. Now that text she sent, she replied after 6 days. I replied back and now I haven't heard from her for 7 days.

The way we text is we don't say stuff like ""hi how's your day"", instead we continue the topic from our last text.

Now I do understand introverts don't respond fast to texts, I am an introvert myself soo.. thus we do usually respond in 1-2 days time instead of right away, but 6 and 7 days has me worrying.

I did text her ""Where did you disappear off to "" with a semi poker face smile. Was this text fine? What do yall think is going on? again I understand 1-3 days, but a whole week two times in a row seems strange. Also is it possible she doesn't want to text cause she'd rather we talk in person ? cause I do sort of feel that way with her since we get along so well or is that just me overthinking it lol.

So long story short, is it reasonable for her to do such long pauses after a text?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4tju5/dating_an_introvert_whilst_being_one_yourself/

16,p4trxz,1629035525,"(m,31) My crush (f,34) went on a date with one of my friends and I'm heartbroken!","(m,31) I have a crush on my female coworker (f,34). We work on projects together and are a pretty good team, and right from the beginning when I started in 2019 I had that feeling of falling in love with her. She's a very kind and lovely person and we also have the same taste in art and music. I play guitar and do vocals in a Punk band and she's very interested in the music we make (her favorite genre). I think she fancies my at least a bit because she often brought me my favorite sweets or left me cute surprise notes on my desk (for example if she didn't work the following day, she would leave me sweets and a note). Well, March 2020 happened and we didn't see each other in the office, except for one or two exceptions. Now in 2021 I'm back fulltime in the office, but she's only 1 day per week. The past two weeks I was on my leave and the day before my leave started, she was at the office and that evening she invited me for drinks after work, only her and me, which was awesome. She also mentioned that she briefly knows my band's new bassplayer, I told her a few weeks earlier that we had a new band member. The next day was my birthday, she knew it as I mentioned it the evening before, but she didn't sent me a text or mail. Alright I can live with that. 

During my leave, my band was recording our first song at the studio of our bass player. Yesterday (Saturday) we had another session. Some hours into the session, the bassist (m,28) said to me: recently I went on a date with a coworker of you, ""T"". This hit me like lightning and my heart literally broke in two pieces. He continues: ""it was just a one time thing though, we had pizza and she paid for the dinner. Now I feel bad about it!"" He just mentioned it in passing while going to a different room and while he was outside I turned to the drummer and told him that T is my work crush and my heart just broke. And of course he laughed. When the bassist returned I didn't even know what to answer him so I just tried to stay calm and not act jealous or anything but inside I was dying. 

Is there a reason to be jealous or angry ? I'm still thinking about it and I don't how to react when I see her again at work in a few days. I really don't know what to do now. I'm beating myself up with regrets of being too passive and thoughts of losing her. I'm really hurt. The day before my leave she was so sweet to me and caring, but this just sucks.

The only positive I can take from this, is that I can put all those emotions into the next recording session, which will be vocals...

**TL;DR:** My coworker crush (f,34), who likes me too (I assume from her behaviour towards me) went on a date with my band's bassist who is even younger than me (m,31). During a recording session of my band he told me about it (he doesn't know that I'm crushing on her) and now I'm hurt, sad and heartbroken.

If a number of people on here who claim that they're ugly, were actually ugly, the entire world would be 90% hideous people. At this point it's no different than 100 lb woman calling herself fat. You are average at worst. Most people will assuming you are bullshitting with you providing images or a description of your looks to back up your claim. 

If you don't want the advice to be more confident, then don't ask broad generic questions, or make broad generic statements. Also if you feel the need to come on to Reddit and complain about how unattractive you are, I assure you, you are not confident and people can tell.

Also, what exactly makes you want attractive. What physically about you and what you look like do you think makes you look ugly or unattractive. This is the internet, we don't know what you look like, so of course I'm not going to trust you when you make these broad statements. We have no proof to back up the claim. 

Are you genuinely physically unattractive (some deformity, being heavily overweight, etc..) or do you just not take care of yourself (do your hair, have any understanding of what style is)? People like people that try

Are you genuinely physically unattractive or does every interaction you have the opposite sex feel filled with self-hatred? Even if you feel like you are confident in yourself, people can tell that you are bullshitting.

Are you genuinely physically unattractive or do you just expect everyone you have interest to say yes to you? Curb your expectations, just because someone is attractive doesn't mean most people say yes to them. Regardless of your attractive level, most advances will be met with it a no. You have to learn how to handle rejection and understand that most people don't want you and that's okay and normal.

Are you genuinely physically unattractive or do you only go after people that you know won't find you attractive? Of course you're not going to find someone if you only try to pursue people that like Superman, and your Batman.

Are you genuinely physically unattractive or does your obvious desperation to be in a relationship turn people off?

She said yes enthusiastically with exclamation points and smiley emojis but we were both very busy that week so we didn't set a day. About 3-4 days later we ran into eachother at the gym(I had no idea she went to the new gym I started going to) and she introduced herself and we chatted a bit. I messaged her later and told her it was nice to meet her and she replied saying ""It was so nice to meet you! We definitely need to get together and do something soon"". I picked a day, time and place that week and she agreed. The day comes around and her day goes to shit(damaged couch delivery and other hassles with the BMV) I understood and wasn't upset about her cancelling. While we were talking on a separate occasion we were talking about chicken parm, and it turns out I make a mean chicken parm so I told her I'll have to make it for her sometime and she said that she would love that. Tried to lock down another date and she agreed enthusiastically again but she was unavailable the days I suggested and she never gave me an alternative.

38,p4vrto,1629042009,"Probably ghosted, what should I do now?","Hi r/dating!

First of all, I'm sorry for any possible grammar error. English is not my native language.

I (M24) recently started using Facebook Dating in order to know other women. I never had a girlfriend but only rejections from other girls that I have met or known, so I'm (unfortunately) used to it.

One week ago, I matched with a girl on the app. We started texting and knowing more from each other. Our messages weren't short, we both had a lot to say. She even added some heart emojis to my messages and things seemed to go well. Last monday I wrote her again, replying to her last messages and asking for her social media accounts, in order to move the chat from Facebook Dating to other messages clients and (possibly) set up a date in the near future.

Zero. Nada. Nisba. No answer since then.

I know she has a work and other stuff, and I also know everyone is plugged on their smartphone nowadays.

I'm sad because she seemed a very smart, polite and respectful girl to me. I know dating apps are like a game for many, and I'm probably not the only man who contacted her. I just want some sense of closure.

Before writing this thread I read many threads here on Reddit about the subject. Usually we should ""move on"" or ""ignore"" the ghosters, but I don't like this way of thinking. I'd rather read a simple ""sorry, I don't think it could work"" instead of trying to find a sense of closure myself. 

Maybe I'm trying to see the good inside of everyone. Should I at least write one last message to her next week?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4vrto/probably_ghosted_what_should_i_do_now/

43,p4w2i7,1629042993,Is he depressed or has he lost interest?,"
Hi, I (F18) have been dating a guy(M19) for the past few months, we went to school together but only became close recently. Once we started to get to know each other we connected instantly and had never felt this way before about anyone however the issues that had been on our minds was our obvious culture difference and the fact he is moving overseas to a new city in mid September. Despite this, we decided that we would pursue the relationship with the knowledge that it was going to end before he left although the past couple weeks have been challenging for us as we were unable to see each other due to me contracting covid and he had surgery. The surgery seemed to take quite a toll on him and we had started to struggle to call regularly and communicate to the same extent as before. This past week or two he had grown more distant and seemed more withdrawn but other times is still enthusiastic so it seemed like a bit of hot and cold behaviour. At the start of the week he had introduced me to some of his friends via a call and it seemed to well so I thought this was a step in the right direction. I was wrong, the past few days have been problematic as he told me we barely speak anymore but it could be for the best so he doesn’t get over attached before he moves away, he has also started back to work and had a full time schedule which makes it challenging for us to meet up. He brought up how we needed to meet up a few days ago and we arranged to meet tomorrow however there has been a death in his family yesterday and he has been straggling to deal with this. This morning I woke up to a message and he said that he thinks it is best we drop our label and we can still meet up when he can but due to the circumstances he thinks this is best. He enjoys gaming in his spare time and spent quite a lot of spare time socialising as he has quite an extroverted personality but although he still replies to me it just feels as if I’m annoying him and that he has become more withdrawn from the activities he usually enjoys. What should I do now? Do you think he’s trying to back away as he knows he’s leaving soon?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4w2i7/is_he_depressed_or_has_he_lost_interest/
44,p4w62h,1629043306,Am I overthinking this?,"Am I overthinking this or is it normal?

I am 19 years old and currently in my junior year of college ( Finance major/ philosophy). I have always told myself that I would eventually wait to lose my virginity (my choice) to someone I have deep feelings for and i finally found that someone. We met on my way to class I bumped into her ( I dropped her books she was holding and it was raining) I had not seen her before ever but when I did she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen not to sound cheesy but she is beautiful. Anyways that was that and she went her way and I went my way but 3 days later I saw her again in the student lounge all by herself so I introduced myself and we got to talking and we hit on from there. Took me about a week  to ask her out and I eventually did she said yes we were talking like everyday and I even met her friends and she met mine and on the 4th date I kiss her and we have been together ever since ( she is 21 and is also a junior). I eventually tell her I am a virgin and I have never had sex although I have done “other things” and I was freaking a bit because what if she found my virginity to be weird at 19 years old but she said it was fine and that we all had a starting point. We have been together for 6 months and she told me that she was willing to wait until I was ready. You know the part where you don’t ask about your significant others relationship well I did just that we were just laying in bed and my curiosity got the best of me so I ask how many guys had she been with at first she kind of look shock she did not give me a number she just said that it’s not something she is comfortable telling me and she is mine and that is what matters I took it as a sign of maybe she was uncomfortable with the subject so I changed it and we went along with our day. This is the part where I feel like an asshole like I said I was curious so I asked her again to give me a number and she did after making me promised I would not be bothered by it since that is not who she is anymore. 18 guys she slept with some where bfs and the others  were one night stands ok I told myself she had life before me and she did what she wanted and in her words she was having “fun” fair enough I think 2 days goes by and I told her I was ready so we could have sex for the first time she even went out of her way to make it special ( I did not ask her to) she said she wanted me to feel like me to feel like her one and only. Her parents were not there so we started making out and we went to her room and when she was kissing me my mind was just telling me your just another number you just number 19 I told I was not feeling well and she said it’s fine we can try again and I left I felt like an asshole I even told my older sister (not every detail) and she told me I was being a dick but over the past 3 days I can’t stop myself from thinking her and those other guys.

49,p4wpzi,1629045133,Feeling neglected...,"I'm a 29 year old female, dating a 32 year old single dad (who has diagnosed aspergers)- we went on a date during my Christmas vacation and it was an amazing date and we seemed to be on the same page about everything- one of those things being sex and intimacy. I have a pretty high sex drive- and in my past relationships, that's one area that was always a problem because my partner's libido didn't match my own. I'm also affectionate- I give and like to receive little touches throughout the day and words of affirmation.

This man said he was all those things and showed me he was all those things. After that date (and this may seem nuts) I had to return back to work (which was VERY far away) and we decided this was something we wanted to hold on to so for the next year and a half we did long distance. We had a plan for him to come see me but then COVID hit, so the entire duration of this long-distance, we never got to see each other in person.

I decided not to renew my contract so I could be closer to family and him- and just before I landed we agreed that it just made sense to live with each other. So I moved right in...We had three really great days- and then things got a little stressful (just life stuff- mostly for him) and he started being less and less affectionate/intimate. He assured me he was just stressed...But, it's been a month- we rarely have sex, and if we do its because I initiate it. There's no physical affection during the day and no words of affirmation (except for the ""i love you"" before he turns over to go to sleep). I brought this up and he said it's part of his aspergers, that it's a typical struggle for him to be affectionate or express his feelings...So- I've been very patient, and I've been an A+ girlfriend and great with his son and supporting him with his new job. I've been putting all my needs aside- and I just feel like my patience is just running out because there have been days that we've just been clicking really great and I think ""we're definitely having sex"" and when it comes time to it, he makes an excuse...On top of that, since he's so busy, we don't really spend any time together except when comes home and we do our bedtime routine...I asked him about going on dates but he said it's not really his thing and that also is tight for money.

Last night I started crying (I hate to make him feel guilty) and I told him I feel there's something else because he told me he had a high sex drive, and he again assured me it's just life but also brought up the fact he can't give me an orgasm and this is hard for him (but this is something I told him day one, that I'm one of those women who have a hard time having an orgasm naturally with my partner, so I have to incorporate toys. I also confided in him that it's a sensitive topic for me because my last partner lost interest in sex because he took my lack of orgasm personal..). So this really upset me- because while I'm trying to cater to him in every way (and happy to do it), and not only him but his son, at the end of the day I feel like I got very little in return.

Am I being unreasonable? Should I just continue to be patient (cause I'm sure pressuring him and crying isn't going to make everything better but, geez, I can't help it- I feel so undesired and I'm trying to keep it together)...Anyway, any insight would be great...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4wpzi/feeling_neglected/

Hiking is where it's at.,"Asked a women out through OLD to go hiking for a first date (gave her a few options, others were more ""normal"").  But, she also thought the hiking was the way to go! Before I even got home, she already asked me to a second date :) 

It was one of the most chill, anxiety-free dates I have ever had and wanted to share. We went up a small mountain in a popular spot (other hikers needed to be around, for safety reasons of course).  I think keeping your body moving really eats up any nervousness or anxiety, it's a great outlet. You don't have to stare at each the whole time as with some sit-down dates, and can share glances when you want. 

No makeup, no fancy clothes worrying what to wear to impress (although dressing for desert heat will always impress IMO).  No worrying if you smell just right. What if you sweat through your shirt?  That's guaranteed, who cares :)  In the end we were both completely drenched in sweat, and from my POV it was super sexy.

I know hiking dates are more popular in certain areas than others, but many I know would be outraged at the idea of hiking, or doing something sweaty and active on a first date.

This has happened to me a few times and I'm somewhat new to dating (with frequence at least, I haven't had more than 5 'good' dates in life so I'm just now starting to notice some patterns). The date would go amazingly, we would laugh and share deep personal stories and lock eyes with each other and make out but the next day the girl hits me up with a text that she's been ""reflecting about last night deeply"" and that we have something to talk about.

There were more dramatic responses like ""I don't think we should see each other anymore because looking back I see some slight traits or signs or glimpses of this and that"", from that to more mild things like ""you're very cool but I don't think we're compatible in A or B"" or even ""I really like you but I don't think I'm very well for some \[really specific behavioral patterns\]""

What does this say about the psychology of women? Or is it something that people have in general and I don't? I usually forgive some minor ""Mistakes"" or incompatibilities and just tell the person we can work on that and get used or even learn to love one another's outlier points.

We met in college where meeting new people was pretty easy (even for a goofy looking guy like me lol), and in the real world meeting new people has been a struggle.

After a year of trying to met someone irl, I decided to sign up on match, and immediately I met this super cool girl. She's so laid back, we have all of the same interests, and conversation is just easy. 

First off, I noticed that she isn't very flirty. I didn't hound her with compliments, but I did let her know that I thought she was cute and really cool. She never really filtered back, she just said thanks and changed the conversation. I figured she was just shy or whatever so I didn't think much of it.

After about a month of talking, we went on our first date yesterday. Dinner was fine we just talked like normal, but bowling was weird. I asked if it was too much of a cliché to say the winner gets a kiss, and she said ""No there won't be any of that tonight"". 

In the moment I just chuckled and said okay, but my brain went through a loop. I dont expect anything from a woman after a date, but i guess i was just excited to kiss the girl I got along with so well, and was just surprised when she didn't feel the same.

So i don't know. We kind of made plans for a next time but we really haven't talked since we parted ways last night so I think it was a wash. I think she didnt like me in person and just doesn't want to say it, which is fine lol. Life goes on.

I have really connected with this guy who I’ve been talking to via phone for almost a month. We met in person for the first time and he was bigger then what I imagined he would look like. 

He is 6’4 so already a big guy in stature but I didn’t expect him to be as wide. 

I am not the fittest looking girl and I actually used to be 40 pounds heavier but I’ve changed into healthier ways. 

He says he’s really active which I love but sexually I can’t get passed this weight block. He wanted to cuddle and be close which I did a little but I don’t have any sexual desires and I feel a little awkward cuddling. 
When he was with me he felt me being distant and brought it up. My brother is big and it kinda reminds me of him which makes me think he wouldn’t lose weight or he would be a “bad” role model for me health wise. I did tell him how I’m not used to dating bigger guys and how I’m trying to understand why I feel this way.

I really want to push pass it and I feel so shallow about it.

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4xqui/i_got_weird_because_she_wasnt_clear_about_her/

61,p4xvvu,1629048850,Younger women attracted to older men??,"
I’ve (M37) been using an app off and on over the last year or so and recently expanded my lower age limit to 23. I did this mostly just to see what’s out there and because I have already seen most of the 28-38 yr olds in my area. Anyways, I’ve been getting quite a few matches that are in their early 20s but am hesitant to meet or pursue anything with them because I’m not sure what their angle is. I’m ready to settle down in a long term relationship but I know I wasn’t when I was in my 20s. I know its different for everyone, but I’m curious what younger women are thinking when they match with older guys? If you’re attracted to guys 10+ years older than you, do you consider those guys potentially long-term material (e.g., marriage, kids, etc.) or is it more of just wanting to be with someone for the time being who is more stable than say a college aged guy or someone just getting started figuring themselves out? I guess I worry that these younger women will eventually want to be with someone their own age by the time they’re in their 30s and I’ll end up being single again when I’m in my mid 40s.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4xvvu/younger_women_attracted_to_older_men/

At the beginning, two weeks after seeing each other from friday to sunday, we talked about the fact that it was okay to see other people until one of us said we were not comfortable with that because of feelings, but with the condition of always being honest (if seeing someone else meant something/ we wanted to pursue something with that other person). Since that moment something changed, and we started spending more time together (weekdays, weekends, I spend the night almost every weekend at his house, I know his cousins and friends, they refer to me as his girlfriend…) and everything was fine. More than fine. Until Saturday, when I woke up with a bunch of texts from a friend who saw him and a girl partying and making out. He did tell me he was going to go out that night (which was weird, because we literally spend every day of the weekend together, but was fine because I completely trusted him and didn’t think much of it).
He’s in a trip (attending to someones wedding) and on friday morning, we made plans for when he comes back, and while a part of me wants to call him and tell him I know everything, another part of me wants to wait until he’s back and see how he acts. Will he tell me? Is he going to be honest as we agreed, or is he going to act as if nothing had happened? 
After thinking about it, I am at a point in which I need to know where we stand as a couple. Which is the conversation I’m planning to have with him. I’m open to listening to what he has to say, understand what happened and based on that, decide wether I can move past this or not.

Maybe someone has this experience already up their sleeve. Everything has been wonderful so far. This came out of the blue. We spent last Saturday together and with his daughter. (We both have daughters, mine was with her dad at the time.) Sex is great, everytime we hang out is great, no complaints. He's been acting dodgy the last few days, and I felt this coming. He's a good guy with a good heart and did it in person. But absolutely zero of it makes sense.

His daughter was with her mom for the summer, so she wasn't around when we first got together. I've built a relationship with her since she's been back. The only thing I can think of, is she said to his sister 4days ago that dad can have a friend but no gf. Idk if that sparked this or not? But that's completely normal for a child to go through. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Today, he said he felt pressured (I've never pressured and said I need time too) and that he has too much going on. He doesn't feel like I deserve the lack of communication. That he doesn't feel he can open up to anyone right now, since his daughter has been back he has a lot on his plate, and just doesn't have time for a relationship due to all the mental stuff he's going through. Fyi he is a recovered addict and I know that's a daily battle- but I've been nothing but supportive. I don't want him losing himself. It's not worth it. Everything has been at his pace. He says he thought he was ready but he doesn't think he is anymore and doesn't want to lead me on because he can't promise me that he'll want to keep trying. He feels like he should feel something by now and he doesn't feel/know it's something he wants to put in time towards. But yet he tells me I'm perfect, nothing is wrong with me, and he hopes to still be friends. That he doesn't want to stop talking to me. So wtf.

I'm using my brain in this situation and I want to say there is more to it or something he isn't telling me that he doesn't like about me. Or maybe it is his mind and he's that effed up. I don't know the addict side of things and how that alters perspectives or how you feel. If it's some dumb reason where I need to cut ties, I'd rather cut ties and move on. But I want to be understanding. I'm totally confused and absolutely crushed. He's been sober for awhile and has full custody of his daughter. He said he was ready in the beginning. Now here I am.

One time I was telling her a story how two guys were saying girl B is cooler then girl A I was the only one who was saying the opposite and she was like I don’t believe that I know you don’t that’s don’t  that that and I replied back saying is true and I don’t say stuff I don’t believe and she just went so silent and looked at the ground. 

A few weeks later girl b is asking for my number and she gets pissed and starts telling me that yesterday she was hanging out with girl A and she asked for my number because she wanted to see how I was doing because my best friend left town for a bit. Girl A tells her there’s no point of her giving her my number because I don’t have a SIM card which is so far from the truth  true I just told girl A that I’m on pay as I go. The thing is girl B has a iPhone as well meaning I can face time etc but even if she didn’t there’s still what’s app. 

Why would girl A do this? Is this a good sign of interest? Or is she just jealous that girl B usually gets more male attention?

90,p50wou,1629058680,When you're seeing someone new...,"What is something that's happened on a date with someone new that made you feel good? 

For me, it was the other night. I've been seeing a man for a couple months, not exclusive. We were all curled up on his couch watching a movie. He was sitting, I was slouched and put my head on his chest. After a few seconds, he put his head on mine and all I could think was ""awwww!""

There are lots of little things, spoken or unspoken, that just make you feel a tiny bit good.

91,p50x7t,1629058732,Dating on Reddit/online/any where,"I'm trying r4r,ForeverAloneDating... and so on. But I'm wondering is it whort it, like has anybody had any success. I know dating apps only helped a little to me, so I wanted to try Reddit. Beryl met anyone and most of the accounts I checked were just mad like a week ago and that is shady as fuck.

So I'm asking where is the best place to meet anyone on an online platform or anywhere else that doesn't have to be online. All I'm asking is how what were and I'm asking because I don't want to be alone anymore. All I want is to do is go out on a date with a girl so I can get real experience.

Sorry if I sound weird or mad M dating life has been terrible.

Ps. I just moved to Germany to start a new and If so maybe I can get some advice from locals on dating in Germany.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p50x7t/dating_on_redditonlineany_where/

93,p51129,1629059090,Is posting nudes online (but not in a way that you're identifiable and not for sex work) while single (before a relationship) a reason that you'd break up with a girl?,"Basically I (19F) just got out of a 5 month relationship because my ex (19M) couldn’t get past the fact that I posted 3-4 pictures of my nude body (anonymously, no face was shown) on Reddit before him and I started dating. And I told him the reason why I did it was because my first ex made me insecure about my body, so I wanted validation after that breakup. 

He seriously had a tough time dealing with my past and would constantly have intrusive thoughts about “other guys jacking to my body” and a bunch of other things, and said he didn’t feel like I was truly his and he said he felt degraded and he said he hated my past. 

So for any guy: Is it a dealbreaker that I did that in my past? Like would you not date a girl solely because she did that in her past? I guess I just feel really bad about my past now and I’m scared this will be a dealbreaker for a lot of guys/any future partner I pursue.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p51129/is_posting_nudes_online_but_not_in_a_way_that/

I understand looks do matter and people won't date someone they find physically unattractive, but it leaves me conflicted when people clown their friends for dating someone less attractive.

95,p5164w,1629059567,Ladies/Nurses,"Ladies, Specifically ER Nurses, what’s the best way for a guy to approach you for your number while you’re working?

Here’s the background: I’m a Firefighter/Paramedic and I transport patients from time to time to a local hospital. There’s a nurse there who I’ve noticed is incredibly nice and I’ve always seen her be very hard working and very attractive. I would absolutely love to get her number and treat her to coffee, drinks or dinner and see where it goes. 

For the record I’ve already checked the left hand and haven’t seen a wedding/engagement ring. 

So my ultimate question is: How can I approach her for her number in a way that doesn’t make her uncomfortable, doesn’t land me in trouble, doesn’t sour the working relationship, and ultimately has the highest chance of her saying yes?

Thank you anyone for the input! Trying to get back out there again after a 6 year relationship ended and 3years basically being out of the game/off the market by choice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5164w/ladiesnurses/
