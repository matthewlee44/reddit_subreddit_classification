And even since I was in high school I’ve noticed that brown men were the main ones into me. I have tried to date some in the past but honestly it never went anywhere or nor were they serious. I was also told that some use women from other races to get their fix because they couldn’t do so with someone from their own race. And also there is the whole arranged marriage thing that they have to lean back on if things go south. Now I’m in my late 20s trying to give dating a go and it’s the same thing. 95% of them men that like me are brown so I figured I’d come on here and ask what exactly do you like about us? Is it our curves? Is it genuine?

I’d say I’m small to midsized but kinda curvy so there are some soft and squishy bits. However, I’ve gone on a couple dates with this guy who is super sweet, he used to be bigger but now he’s pretty skinny and fit. 

It’s been a long time since I’ve been so insecure about my body (since high school really) and I hate feeling like this again. I’m just so worried that the more he sees of me, he’s going to have the same thought that I do about the squishy bits. He calls me small and short when we’re teasing each other (not in a sarcastic way, but I’m 5’7 and he’s an actual tree) and he’s said I remind him of a Disney princess.

We shared a lot in common and I thought their thought process was amazing and I was looking forward to a relationship with them. I felt a lot of confidence with them and they gave me confidence to trust in them, so I went all in with my emotions and I was ready to receive their emotions too in all fairness, I felt like we could get along super well and have alot of fun together. I was going to give them anything they wanted as long as they gave me comfort. But they ghosted me for a few days and I asked them ""where are you?"" and they said ""I don't feel compatible with you, I feel exhausted around you and I feel like there's no room for me to feel feminine and like I'm the one taking care of you."" I wish she should have told me this before but I wasn't seeing it that way, I only saw a mature girl who we had a lot in common and I was ready to make any effort to fix any misunderstandings.

This has likely happened before. I'm starting to recognize that girls want to feel in a position of being feminine and the man being masculine has to take care of the females.  I've also recognized I'm not getting along well with other introverts. There's always some miscommunication since we're in our heads.

The way I'd approach relationships is... ""omg thanks for existing, I feel emotionally stable rn. Where do you want me to take you?"" and I'd be honest about it because I don't lie when I feel a strong emotion. 

I'd have to redefine who I want as a girlfriend...  I want someone who can listen to my emotions and give back their emotions and we can both take care of each other. 

I need to also help myself more. Maybe that'll make me more attractive. Like I may come across as a weakling or a wimp sometimes.  hmm... This change of identity worries me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/melaxh/wow_guys_i_dont_know_what_to_do_really_i_need/

14,melh5d,1616875491,A long distance friend and I are going on vacation... Is this a date? What do I do?,"Tldr; I (24M) am friends with an old coworker (25F) who moved away. I have feelings for her but not sure if it is mutual. We are going on vacation with each other alone. Is this a date??

I am in a bit of an emotional rollercoaster... I'm probably freaking out because I am overthinking it. 

Let me start from the beginning- I was hired on at a new job and met a girl at work and we instantly clicked. Our conversations were always easy flowing and made work pass quick. We had a few overlapping interests but also very different personalities that complemented each other. She is the very outgoing, blunt, and in your face type. I am much quieter but really value close connections and only open up to those closest to me. She is an open book and somewhat of a flirt.

The first few months were me onboarding and she helped a lot with that. However, we only spoke at work. Soon enough we exchanged numbers and began speaking from time to time outside of work. It was such a natural progression and I personally just enjoyed the great conversation. The messaging every few weeks started to increase to weekly and some phone calls here and there. I forgot to mention she was also dating someone new at the time. This relationship soon ended but she never told me. I honestly only knew she was dating someone thru other coworkers. I never saw her as anything more than a friend at that time but I did feel a connection beyond the professional setting.

Fast forward a few more months and she hit me with BIG news... She landed a job many states away and is planning to quit and move soon. I was one of the first people she shared the news with at work. It all happened so quick. Covid hit and she moved. The goodbye was very weak. Got her a gift in the form of cake and poof... Didn't even get to hug due to the circumstances. 

Sorry for the ramble but I hope to provide context.

After she moved, there was a time period we didn't talk much. It was just typical checking up on each other. But out of nowhere we just started messaging more and the conversations would just keep rolling. You know when you message someone until you fall asleep and the convo picks up in the morning and so forth. So we had these bursts of convo every few weeks and it was almost daily. We began chatting on the phone weekly. And idk what clicked but I just started developing feelings. 

Ive been on both sides of being the one driving the convo because of my own feelings or just waiting for it to end because I don't share the same level of attraction. This was different, neither of us was forcing anything... It just felt right. We wanted to see each other at this point. I also want to clarify that we never talked about our (or if there are any) feelings for each other.

Fast forward again... So she visits the city I'm in to see old friends and family. She also set a day to meet her old coworkers including me. We all have a wonderful time eating dinner but we soon part ways. Literally in my car about to head home I message her a message telling her that I had a great time. She quickly responds and asks if Im down to get some dessert and drinks. So we both meetup again and spend the night having some of the best laughs and share stories. I opened up to her even more and she told me she felt safe with me. In my head I wanted to make a move but never did ... (Yes I feel stupid) 

We hugged and parted ways once it got too late. 

The rest of that week I was going through so many mixed emotions- why didn't I make a move? Why didn't I tell her how I feel?! How does she feel??

I got it off my chest by calling her later and telling her that I felt a really strong connection that night. And that because of distance and how much I value her friendship I think we should keep things how they are. (Stupid yet again!) She then tells me she also felt a connection but she isn't good with her feelings and finds it hard to express them. It kinda ended there... I never fully stated anything about where my heart is and same for her. 

Our messaging slowed down a bit and I went on a few dates. Really tried to make it work with this girl but it ended in 2 months. 

Annnd again we started messaging almost daily and calling most weekends. We shared all of our deepest secrets except how we feel about each other. We are open about what our past relationships are but never even entertain the idea of the two of us (or rather bring it up)

Recently we have been telling each other that one of us needs to visit the other. So I made plans. I was going to take a week off and go spend some time there. Unfortunately personal family matters came up and I couldn't make my trip. She was extremely supportive and was the shoulder I needed to lean on despite not being there physically.

Almost caught up!!

She has always bugged me about her desire to travel and how it has been so long. She suggested that we should go on a vacation and I took her seriously. During the planning we both said we asked our friends to see if they are willing to go, but none did on her end (did she ask tho?). I asked one but they weren't interested and kept it at that.

Soooo we just booked a vacation (somewhat of a romantic spot) for just the two of us for a full week. 

What do I do? 

I am not sure why I feel anxious? I feel like I don't have a proper read on her. 

Is this a date? A couples vacation? I have to make a move and be honest with her. I want to tell her how I feel... But should that happen before we go or when we are there and feel the situation out? I can't tell if she feels similar feelings.

The next thing that scares me is what happens after... Distance is still there! 

The vacation is in 2 months so I have time to overthink even more. Heh 

I really value her friendship and hope for the best.

But then sometimes if he leaves me on open I’ll message him a few hours later and then he replies and we talk for the next few hours. It’s confusing so I don’t know what to think about the situation anymore. It sounded like he really liked me until this started happening a month or a ago. And what sucks is that when he doesn’t reply back I keep getting falling in and messaging him instead of waiting to see if he ever messages me back first. And I don’t know what I should do. I’m trying so hard to not message him today and see if he messages first but it’s just so tempting because I like talking to him and I am slowly falling for him and the 4x we hung out so far he does seem like a really nice guy. I just don’t know anymore. And I know there’s probably tons of other guys out there but the one thing is that he is the only guy I’ve ever talk to the longest (I’ve never made it to a relationships with anyone yet) and I’m afraid if I lose him and he finds someone else I’m just gonna break because it’s just so hard for me to find anyone let alone someone to talk to me even for this long before leaving and it sucks!,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/melk9h/so_tempted_to_message_him_but_i_dont_know_if_i/

I almost always initiate our conversations though she responds very quickly and we usually can text or talk for a while. I also think we share a lot of common interests and can communicate well.

I once asked her about if she would be interested in a relationship, and she hesitated because she thinks that I am unwilling to settle down due to her past experiences. So I told her to take her time and think about it. More recently, I noticed that she is back on dating apps, including installing a new one, where she says she is looking for a relationship and want to settle down in the profile, even though I am there for her. 

When I think in that direction, I noticed that in all our dates, I always pay for food, I take her grocery shopping and drive her around. She has never initiated any of our dates. But I really like this girl and don't want to end it.

27,memt2j,1616879512,Is online dating dead?,"Like most people (from reading other's posts) I have had an ""on again, off again"" relationship with online dating. But recently it seems that we have hit a ""saturation point"" of scammers, fakes, flakes and bots. It is now completely impossible to access a ""real human being"" through any of these ""services"", let alone one who shows any kind of interest in dating. 

If you go on to the Google Play Store and actually read the reviews (after you sift through the obvious ""shill"" reviews), you will quickly come to the understanding that the ONLY purpose these apps serve it to make the ""developers"" lots of money while requiring the absolute least effort from them. That raises another valid point, a few years ago you had to look pretty hard to find a dating app that used bots to ""encourage"" users to pay for services (ie. You sign up for a ""free account"", and even BEFORE you finish setting up your profile, you have 20 ""likes"" from ""people"" who have never seen your picture, don't know your age, or where you live, because you haven't put that information into your profile yet. But the MOMENT you pony up with your credit card numbers, POOF! All those 20 ""people"" cease to exist.).

But now (after a recent poll of dating apps on Google Play Store), it seems the ALL the apps are using bots to encourage payment. How is this NOT just plain crooked?

Like you may of guessed, I am no ""spring chicken"" I have been around for a few years, and frankly the whole online dating thing disgusts me. I have a favorite quote (origin unknown to me) that I think applies here ""online dating is like wandering around your local landfill (garbage dump), desperately searching for the least damaged items to take home with you"". Congratulations, we are all now ""dumpster divers"", but with money and they want it (our money). Today, I read in a review of a ""dating app"" another good quote , ""this app embodies the absolute WORST points of human nature"", I think that may be my new favorite quote for dating apps. 

With all that said, I am seriously considering the old ""tried and true"" methods of going to the local bar on Friday nights or joining some kind of ""activity group"" as my main dating modality, it was never the best way, but at least you get to see REAL PEOPLE without all the paywalls and other scams. 

I sincerely wish each and every one of you success in your attempts at dating in this scary world.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/memt2j/is_online_dating_dead/
28,men0z3,1616880189,Considering Giving Up,"I figured I may as well do this now before my hang up of venting out what’s bothering me to others rears it’s ugly head and I back out.

Alright so a little about me. I’m 37, live with my mother (to help her with bills while she helps me with my daughter), I don’t have a glamorous job (quite the opposite it’s quite thankless and highly stressful but I’ve been there 4 years and leaving now would mean a massive pay cut), I personally don’t think I’m attractive but I’d say at least average looks, and as stated earlier I have a child. So finding someone is rather insanely difficult. I recently had a three year relationship end when all the COVID stuff started (completely ghosted wouldn’t answer calls or texts). So I took a little time before I looked again. Well a few months ago I met a woman who was so great. She accepted everything that others had scoffed at or even insulted so we started talking and really hit it off.

Well after months of text, phone, and video chats, we finally set up a day to meet in person (today as I write this). We spent the last week setting up a good time, a place, and we both agreed that because of COVID we’d keep expectations low. There was a slight distance gap but that’s why we took so long making sure everything would work out great. We even spent the night before I went to bed for work making sure all the plans were set.

5am comes and I get up and head to work. My morning shift goes pretty quick despite some technical issues at the job. I was extra excited finally meeting this woman. I hadn’t heard from her all morning which wasn’t odd because she takes sleep meds and sometimes wakes up late. “No big deal,” I’m thinking “there’s still time before we meet up.” Well as you can guess the time came and went. I even sat around for an extra half hour in case she got held up...nothing. No phone call, no message, no anything to let me know what was going on or to tell me she was having second thoughts. I attempted to text and then call. No reply to the text and phone rang twice then went to voicemail (as my sister would say “she hit the asshole button”). 

Usually I wouldn’t let a setback like this get to me but as I’m getting older and have had so many friendships and relationships end suddenly I’m feeling like just cutting my losses and remaining alone would be best. The pain never gets easier to bear. 

Thank you all for listening. Any advice is always welcome and kind words are always appreciated.

41,meopaa,1616885441,Accident,"
I accidentally broke up with my boyfriend the other day. We were in an argument before i was supposed to leave for vacation, and when I said I didnt want to leave until we were in a better place, he said we had two choices: work on it, or break up. I didnt know what to say because I couldn’t believe this was being brought up, so i said “I dont know, break up I guess”, not really meaning it, but I didnt know what answer he wanted and i felt pressures and overwhelmed. Immediately, i started crying, and apparently he asked me two more times if thats what I wanted, and i said “you already asked me, the answer was yes”, although i don’t remember this at all for some reason.
We calmed down a bit and were laughing, and i realized that that wasnt what either of us wanted, but he said “whats done is done. Once i hear that you dont want to be with me, my mind is made up”. I immediately spiraled into an ugly panic attack, because I realized I made a permanent decision under pressure, and wasnt even thinking clearly. He asked me to leave, but I didnt feel safe driving and I couldnt explain that to him. It was like my brain stopped working and couldnt form thoughts. I eventually left, after I told him that i didnt want to leave if we werent together and he said we’d talk about it in the morning, which calmed me down enough. 

Anyway, I woke up the next morning and he had deleted our pictures on social media. He told me that what happened (my panic attack) scared him, and he didnt feel safe or secure in the relationship anymore. I dont know what to think or what to do because this was our first fight, and I feel like 1) big decisions shouldnt be made in times of high stress, and 2) i feel like first fights are scary, but can be a learning experience for the couple. I dont know what to do because just prior, we were talking about moving in together and meeting each other’s families. He told me he still loves me and is sad, but that he no longer sees a future with me since my anxiety manifested that way (even though its rare- i was under a ton of additional stress). Is this it or is there any hope of reconciliation? Im heartbroken, I really saw a future with him and im beating myself up for not having this under control.

42,meoqwd,1616885588,Dating Texting Preferences,"Had a 1st date with a girl I really clicked with last week. 2nd date scheduled for Tuesday (wish me luck.)

I really enjoy chatting with her and we have a lot in common, which makes me want to message more. I also realize that not everyone has the same texting preferences when dating or in a relationship. I work from home at a computer all day and texting is super easy and accessible, but I know it's harder for others.

Last thing any of us want's to do is give someone the chore of having to respond to you more often than they'd like.

I can't be the only one that struggles to decide what the correct texting frequency should be at different  stages of dating. Thought I'd ask you all what your preferences are for early dating.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Never. Call me if you/when you want to talk.
2. Texting just enough to make plans and nothing more.
3. Once or twice a day.
4. Whenever you think you have something really worth sending/sharing/asking.
5. All the time, all the memes, all the things!
6. Other?

Of course, the best option is probably have to a brief discussion about this at some point. Or just to try and figure it out based on their texting patterns... But, that can be awkward maybe.

For some context, I (F24) was seeing someone (M23) a month ago for about 2 weeks. We had three dates, and I believed he was interested in something more as he held my hand in public and was very consistent during that time. On the third date, we slept together and he immediately pulled away afterward, practically started ghosting me. It was hard for me to come to terms with what happened, but I stopped talking to him as soon as I felt the switch in his behavior and accepted that he didn't feel the same way at that point. It usually does not take me long to get over someone, but lately he's on my mind a lot more than he should be. I feel like I'm not getting enough sleep and every time I run into him on campus or something reminds me of him, such as a song, I get upset.

When I go to campus I avoid going places he may be now. I have seen other guys but it's not the same. I don't try to repress or avoid my feelings, but I'm tired of how much they affect me. Mainly for a guy who I was only seeing for two weeks.

I asked him when he was free and he didn’t even give me a time. This is for “hanging” by the way. Why not an actual date? 

Also, i hâte asking guys out.

57,meqb5e,1616890585,Is a woman offering to split the bill a bad sign?,"I just got back from a date, by all accounts I thought it went well and that a second on might be on the horizon.

We had been talking for a few weeks and she had recently accepted an offer for her dream job. Instead of the usual coffee date, I suggest a somewhat fancy place for dinner to celebrate her accomplishment. (I wore a suit sans tie and she a dress) 

The conversation was easy, flowed very well and there were no awkward silences or anything of that nature. When the bill came she asked if I wanted to split it. I was genuinely taken aback as this is the first time a woman had ever offered. 

I politely declined and said *insert name of restaurant* was my idea, we’re here to celebrate your new job I’ll take care of the bill. She thanked me and we talked a few more minutes before we left.

I normally don’t do dinner as a first date but we seemed to have a good amount of chemistry and it was an occasion worthy of recognition. Plus with the pandemic it was nice to dress up properly for an evening out.

When I got home she thanked me again for dinner and said she didn’t want to see me again because “there was no spark”

I matched with a guy on a dating app before the first lockdown. we had loads in common was easy to chat and then he asked me on a date. Had to cancel date cause of lockdown but we talked a lot over text, 

We finally met in person. Had a great first date for 5 hours! The banter and connection was great and he said I was easy to talk to. He did mention his ex a lot like ‘I don’t think my ex liked me’ and talked about how he had mental health probs and unemployed. I didn’t mind I’m open minded, I cared more about someone I could get along well with

Went on several dates, the banter was amazing. He said he felt we connected well and would love to take me to art gallery we talked about 


Then bam, ghosted. He ignored my texts for 6 weeks. Came back and told me not feeling good to talk regularly .

I moved on but told him he can call anytime. Haven’t heard from him again for 6 months and saw he’s active on the dating app with new photos.

73,merml4,1616895059,How can OLD be fixed? (long post),"Hello reddit. 1 week and 4 days. That's how long it would take for me to shake the hands of one million people. That is, if I were shaking one hand every second without eating or sleeping. Seems like if you tried maybe you could do that without killing yourself considering that's roughly the longest anyone's gone without sleeping (assuming some sort of feeding tube arrangement). But if you scale that up to 7.9 billion, it would take 250 years. In three lifetimes, even given super human hand shaking abilities and stamina, I couldn't dream of meeting everyone on the planet in even the most superficial way possible... and you know, they'd all be dead and replaced multiple times over at that point.

&amp;nbsp;

Lets say, in looking for love, I happen to be a bloke who's interested in a lass that speaks English between ages 18-28. I've just carved down that 250 years to a healthy 1.2 years. If we make the situation a tad more realistic, including eating, sleeping, working, etc... lets say I could generously spend 4 hours a day speed dating at 5 minutes per date. That, my friends, would take over 2,000 years (assuming no one is taken and I'm a completionist).

&amp;nbsp;

Tinder has the most active users of any dating app, nearly 8 million. It's impossible to know exactly how many are fake but loose estimates seem to be in the 50-75% range. Considering 38% are female profiles, we can assume that roughly 1.5 million or fewer real females are on tinder, with about 15% in my age range. Now, we have no way of knowing what the overlap looks like between dating apps, but lets assume that no one uses more than one dating app (to increase the coverage as much as possible). Given that assumption, my estimate is that all dating apps combined cover roughly 1.2% of the women, worldwide, that fit those picky age and English standards.

&amp;nbsp;

This estimate[1], of course, is quite meaningless, because droves of people download and delete these decrepit apps every day (apparently the only service with more than 50% of users returning the following week is eharmony). Hopefully you need no further convincing that both dating pool coverage and filtration are big concerns. Concerns that OLD doesn't address.

&amp;nbsp;

I come to you today to discuss what makes OLD largely unsuccessful and to make a plea for any fellow software developers out their to join up and do better. First, I should give some background.

&amp;nbsp;

## Background and Motivation
I am not someone that uses social media. I was raised largely without internet, and only started using it freely a few months before college. Throughout highschool and college I didn't care about dating. This wasn't for lack of girl's interest in me, or my lack of attraction to them, I just had a very deep seated superiority complex and felt like every girl I met was beneath me. I've also always been very utilitarian, and thought dating/dances were a waste of time and money. I've been in only one short relationship at the start of college nearly 4 years ago, but really it was more of an experiment than a relationship (doesn't that sound fun).

&amp;nbsp;

I tried OLD once or twice for not more than a day or two during college out of curiosity, and was quickly disinterested for reasons everyone is well aware of (and maybe some lesser known) which I'll detail below. But, in the last month I've been giving OLD a more serious look, both because I'm now ready to invest in a relationship and as an informal research project.[2][3]

&amp;nbsp;

When I look at the dating pool as the set of all women (in my case) fulfilling age and language criteria, I realize that the set pretty much only gets smaller as time goes on.  People die, and are taken. The only way for it to grow is through divorce/break ups. Now, I'm not a believer in the traditional stereotype of a ""soul mate,"" but even if I were, ""the one"" for each of us is someone who (presumably) already exists somewhere on this planet. Online Dating should theoretically be capable of helping us all find that person at least as fast as, if not significantly faster than, traditional dating.

&amp;nbsp;

Why do I care? Well, first of all, obviously, I'd like a better option to use myself. I can only imagine most women similar to me are not on OLD. Second of all, there's a collection of macroscopic problems that I think humanity doesn't realize is holding us back, and I believe our inelegant dating ""system"" is one of them. If you're familiar with the concept of keystone habits, a habit that tends to affect many if not all other habits in your life (like exercise), recognize that a relationship is possibly the greatest keystone out there as it has potential to create and destroy other keystone habits. I think a drastic improvement to the way we find relationships has the potential to percolate into every aspect of human development.

&amp;nbsp;

## Why OLD doesn't work
Some of these are obvious and well worn, some I may have missed, and hopefully some are new to you

1. OLD by it's nature attracts mostly people that are tired, desperate, lonely, lazy, self absorbed, and/or horny (though some may hide these well)
2. Frequent misrepresentation, both intentional and unintentional [4]
3. Even those in it for the long haul aren't in it for the long haul (they'll probably dump the app within a week)
4. Instant gratification is a plague. OLD apps profit off of addiction same as most highly profitable mobile apps. By virtue of addiction it's increasingly impossible to settle on someone the longer you use the service as a craving forms for seeing more profiles and more fantasizing. Actually investing in someone threatens to take away that addiction to fantasizing and breeds fear that maybe you could have lived a better fantasy.
5. No accountability. No community.
6. Inherently ""pump and dump."" Users join the service with the intent to get rid of it as soon as possible, and the platform wants to extract as much money in that time as possible.
7. Company gains nothing from you getting what you want out of the service
8. Has very little coverage of the dating pool, and coverage is intermittent (the ""one"" could have joined and left last week and you'd never know it)
9. Impressions are wildly inaccurate, even just seeing a video with audio rather than a still image of the person drives up the chances of you liking them significantly (who'd have thought animation and emotion was important?). There's often a mismatch between writing voice and speaking voice as well (as is certainly the case for me)
10. Virtually no feedback whatsoever (you're lack of success could literally be due to one poorly worded line in your bio)
11. No relativity. We like to see progress. People are so bad at writing bios they can't really give you a good picture of whether their life is on an upward trend of improvement, which is usually more important than where they're at in the moment. Someone may be ""in the negative"" in terms of how successful they are overall, but if they're on an upward trend a healthy relationship can help accelerate that progress. Instead, OLD keeps people chained to hoping that someone will come along and reverse their descent.
12. Does little to nothing to prevent or expose ""Black Swans"" (things you don't know that you don't know which hit you out of the blue, commonly including debt levels, children, polyamory, medical conditions, etc.). Sometimes people tell you about these, sometimes they don't... and there's no way for you to warn others if they didn't.
13. Someone you've unmatched with can make profile updates, and on top of that will hopefully be a different person in 6 months. You'll never know unless you reset your matches or make a new profile
14. Oriented more towards restrictions than setting baseline expectations. The way information is presented tends to make people seem immovable on things that might merely be preferences or learned behaviors that are subject to change.
15. Many seem to have adopted a ""hell yes/no"" mentality and OLD's binary decisions fuel this (IMO it has it's merits in person, but not when operating on the skewed/incomplete view that OLD presents)
16. OLD does such an inadequate job of superficial filtration on such an inadequate subset of the dating pool that we ourselves are forced to become algorithmic filters and invariably spend most of our time filtering rather than giving each person serious consideration
17. Most OLD only allows photo's of/containing you with no coverings like helmets. Good in some sense, but if you're, say, into Motocross, or want to show off photos of pottery you made, they'll remove the photos. Generally the way around this would be to link an Instagram... assuming the service allows that and you have one (I don't, and won't)
18. Merely signing up opens you (and bots) to all profiles in the service.
19. Very transactional and inorganic
20. Profits off of hope (as many successful ventures do)
21. Doesn't do a good job of teasing out how self aware people are. (In my observations, relationships can thrive despite not sharing all the same interests, but don't thrive when there's mismatched levels of self awareness)
22. Some apps save profiles that could potentially be a good match in their exclusive club behind a pay wall (assuming those are real profiles)[5]

&amp;nbsp;

##### Why dating in general doesn't work

The following are opinions of a young, non-dating-coach, engineer... who... 'experimented' on his only girlfriend thus far. So take them for what they're worth.

&amp;nbsp;

I believe most people have dating a little backwards. If you wan't to get fit, you don't go to an amusement park. Most long term investments in life are hard before they're fun. So it perplexes me why people insist on ""having lots of fun"" (or some emotional equivalent) being their criteria for pursuing a relationship. Feeling a ""spark"" is overrated; though, fire is a good symbol for a lot of relationships. It's intense, consumes a lot of energy, and burns till there's nothing left or until something suffocates it.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd rather build a relationship on cold hard bedrock than a spark. I feel like people need to start off being more intentional about working out problems and being blunt and honest about values and philosophies. Start off with the negatives, the baggage, and the challenges Instead of using your SO as a way to satisfy an emotional craving or trying to gauge whether they're successful enough, fun enough, and attractive enough. We should be trying to gauge whether or not we can be an effective team together, not whether we're good enough for each other (and yes, health and attraction play a part in being a healthy team). Having a ""Whole greater than the sum of it's parts"" mentality over a ""Missing piece"" mentality. Seems to me, from my limited life and internet experience, that most people get to the point where they're jaded dating veterans in their 30's and 40's or higher before they start off with the baggage to avoid wasting each other's time. (I'd rather start while I'm young, thank you)

&amp;nbsp;

From my observations, virtually anyone can open up to be a fun, relaxed, spontaneous, etc. kind of person if you both have a good foundation. So the ""are we having enough fun"" metric is foolish.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of my thinking lately is influenced in part by the books ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" and ""Atomic Habits."" 7HOHEP talks about how, as virtuous as some of the following centers may seem, it's detrimental to live a life centered on family, spouse, children, career, self, enemies, friends, role models, etc. rather than being centered on principle. Doing so is often like using another boat as an anchor in a storm. Atomic Habits addresses the fact that one reason so many people fail to change habits is because they are focused on outcomes rather than identity. The difference between ""I'm going to exercise today"" because ""I want to lose 50lbs"" vs ""I'm an athlete and that's what I do.""

&amp;nbsp;

One thing they jointly made me realize is that most people I know live almost exclusively outcome centered lives regardless of how centered they are on family, spouse, etc. Being outcome centered is the true opposite of being Principle centered. What was the outcome of that date? Was it fun enough? Did they contribute enough? Do I feel cheated? Was I bored? Did I get enough material to show off on social media? Did I get enough approval from friends and family?

&amp;nbsp;

You're only going to be an effective team, or at the very least a happy individual, if you know what your Principles are (past a vague ""don't be mean"" mentality), and if your principles mostly match up. Then in the dating scenario, the quality of the date is measured by how honest, attentive, etc. you were, regardless of how ""well"" it went. Good outcomes tend to flow naturally from good principles, but even when they don't you're not distressed because you followed your principles and that's the stick you measure with.

&amp;nbsp;

## What might make OLD work?
What I am suggesting here today is not just a dating service, but a community building service that is oriented towards dating. First and foremost, we need increased: safety, community, ubiquity, and distillation. 

&amp;nbsp;

Following that, a successful service should:

1. Be non-habit-forming
2. Bolster actual real life interactions 
3. Find ways to match based on principle and not solely outcomes
4. Obviate the needs real people feel for making falsified accounts 
5. Mitigate bots with more than just 2fa 
6. Give users complete control over their information
7. Support experimentation 
8. Have different forms of feedback 
9. Have variable barriers to entry 
10. Not be useful and engaging only so long as you need a date 
11. Do a better job of setting expectations 
12. Find ways to add bounds and reduce anxiety-inducing open loops

&amp;nbsp;

## How do we get there?

For the sake of all humanity, we need an open source application that is completely free. Not ""freemium."" Not ""sign up so we can sell your data."" **Free**! It needs to be viewed more like a public park or utility that everyone has access to in order to become ubiquitous.

&amp;nbsp;

Frankly, OLD feels scummy. The ways they make money is the second largest motivator in my mind for dumping them, and a large part of why many people never invest in them in the first place. A lot of people aren't committed to OLD and are stuck in a state of ""testing the waters."" In order for a good alternative to be ubiquitous it's going to have to be free and not make users feel insecure about what information they put into the service or like they're being taken advantage of for money.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Anti-On-Demand
As stated, it also shouldn't be habit forming or time consuming. Trimming down matches is one way to do that. But there's a better solution. One that initially may or may not seem appealing, but not only will it work, it will also make it possible for something with such an enormous user base to be open source and free.

&amp;nbsp;

Servers, storage, and bandwidth aren't cheap when you have a huge user base. By using a primarily serverless architecture, minimizing how much user data is stored, and following a weekly schedule for updating matches en masse, we should be able to minimize costs (from preliminary investigation on what tool chain to use, Blazor WASM with Azure Functions looks very promising if you're curious).

&amp;nbsp;

Updates only happening at set intervals has several other effects too. First, it makes the act of logging on and seeing matches more of an occasion than a pastime. Second, in the context of habit prevention, it aids in distancing the cue and craving from the reward. Third, it's not only more respectful of people's time, but also drastically increases the chances of users being available simultaneously since it coalesces people into a tighter time frame. Last, it shifts the general feel from an always-on mentality to a project mentality. This does thwart feedback somewhat considering you'd have to wait a week to see what effects your profile changes had, but I'd argue it prevents manic profile tweaking without giving changes enough time to stew and would make users more intentional and committed to profile completion.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Variable Barriers to Entry
In order to mitigate bot/uncommitted contacts, no one would get access to all the profiles on the site simply by signing up. There would be various communities[6] with stipulations attached to them. E.g. I join the writers community and college football community, which means in order for anyone to see my messaging info or like me they'd have to, say, write me a memoir and tell me their favorite team (each community would have a selection of criteria to choose from).

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to the community aspect, another barrier which could be one of the main draws of the service would be a ""give and get"" functionality. If you make your photos blurred, everyone else's photos will be blurred. If you make your age private everyone else's will be private. If you don't have a photo you don't get to see photos. If you want to see someone's bio you'll have to fill out yours first.

&amp;nbsp;

Another potential barrier to entry is requiring a 30 day waiting period after making a profile before you can participate. This could be reduced or eliminated with friend endorsements.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Semi-automatic
In an effort to further abate us becoming algorithmic filtering machines, a good service should have some date scheduling functionality and a basic visual calendar. It should be commitment based. You'd tell it what times you absolutely cannot have a date, and give it one block of guaranteed availability and it will try to work with that (among other preferences and optional tweaks). There would be a combination of request-based and automatic scheduling, and the scheduler would, for example, take into account favorite dating locations and try to schedule multiple consecutive dates with minimized travel (this is drastically oversimplified for brevity, this will be quite a complex feature). Most likely, the scheduler would not show you anything about the person you're going on a date with (or at the least have a very reduced view), and have no option to reschedule[7]. Flaking out or getting antsy is a common problem, and I think having a bit of mystery will make people more inclined not to do that (FOMO).

&amp;nbsp;

Ideally, busy professionals and people that just generally don't care to waste time on the service should be able to spend a week or two setting up their profile and start having dates show up on their calendar; allowing use of the service almost without intervention.

&amp;nbsp;

Going with the theme of accountability, and the fact that the intent of OLD is indeed to go on dates, users would be able to see before liking someone how many dates someone has canceled or not shown up to. And after going on a date would be prompted to record that info.[8][9]

&amp;nbsp;

##### More comprehensive profile information and control
A wider variety of data, such as: your reading list, bands and podcasts you listen to, youtube subscriptions, discord servers, places you've lived, favorite dating locations/events/activities, what room temperature you prefer, what kind of driver you are, and much more should optionally be part of your profile just as much as the standard hobbies/interests, schooling, and demographic information. And not only available, but recorded over time (so you could, for example, see if the person you fancy is currently listening to a band you used to listen to and vice versa). Data items could be both built-in (like demographic info) as well as be user generated submissions to communities. Everyone in the community would vote for which data items they think are most relevant and the top ones would then be available to attach to your profile if you are part of that community.

&amp;nbsp;

An integral part of the vision involves every data item having user managed settings for whether it's: publicly visible, private to different levels, manually requested/revealed, stored only locally, and backed up remotely. For example, maybe I'd like my Twitter revealed to anyone that likes me, my Instagram revealed to anyone I match with, and my phone number only revealed upon request if I confirm it. I may also have my phone number stored only locally, meaning it gets sent to the server temporarily when it's time to update a match with it, but deleted immediately afterwards.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Personality aggregation
One functionality that could really augment this is having a dedicated synopsis section for their social media and content consumption/production rather than only having data items linking to their external profiles. i.e. There'd be a section linking you to their twitter, reddit, facebook, etc. as usual, but opening that section would reveal people they follow, subreddits they frequent, subscriptions and videos they've liked, their top posts, blogs, etc. (this avoids having to do any googling or clicking on links and probably gives you a better idea of who they are than a dating profile ever could on it's own).

&amp;nbsp;

##### Something for Everyone
As much as I'd like to think that I have the perfect perspective on dating, and as much as I'd like everyone to adhere to it, clearly what works for me won't work for everyone. My desires, experiences, and ideas presented here come from the perspective of a busy professional with grandiose aspirations that doesn't have time for all the 'nonsense.' For the service to become truly ubiquitous I believe it will have to cater to everyone in some way.

&amp;nbsp;

Whether that's supporting functionality for polyamory, friends with benefits, hookup culture, sugar daddies/mommas/babies, whatever... regardless of whether or not I care for that sort of thing, I feel that supporting as many diverse relationship types as possible and giving people exactly what they want will either convince them that it won't actually make them happy or make it easier to separate them from people that don't want those things.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, having something for everyone extends past types of relationships to experimenting with different dating methodologies as well. Which is covered further down.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Love knows some bounds...
Ghosting and 'pseudo-Ghosting' (my term for ghosting that's not really ghosting but people still feel ghosted) are an open loop, and that's why it sucks so much. That's why when you go on a date you usually have a pre-established non-rejection exit strategy, like picking someone up afterwards. It puts bounds on the date, and closes the loop. A good service should focus on discretizing interactions and closing open loops.

&amp;nbsp;

As an example, traditional OLD goes: see, match, message... profit?

&amp;nbsp;

Unless the person is mature enough to close down the conversation themselves, it either ends with ghosting or less likely a relationship. Both feel very uncertain and cause varying levels of anxiety depending on how responsive the person is. The only way I've come up with so far to alleviate this is to put constraints on how long you can interact with each other, an example of which is given in the next section.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Venues for experimentation and exploration
A good service would be able to support (hopefully with minimal involvement from developers) user created dating methodologies that users can participate in to see how they work in the context of OLD. A few examples:

&amp;nbsp;

- Blind dates. You don't know anything about your match (except that you got matched). I'm tempted to say that this should be the default, considering that fact that in real life you meet everyone without knowing anything about them, and don't go around filtering people out that don't quite make enough money, are an inch or two below your ideal, don't take good pictures, etc. So, more or less, you'd be using and trusting the algorithm to reduce the odds of completely wasting your time.

&amp;nbsp;

- Group blind dates. You have to figure out who it was you were matched to through conversation. (potentially the service never tells you who the original match was, could make things interesting)

&amp;nbsp;

- Doing away with Like/Dislike. You can only friend people. You go through and friend, say 25 people (notice the discrete number) and have either group hang outs, a speed dating session, or a set amount of  days to message each other (all three are discrete time chunks, closed loops). Then you signify which people you'd like to go on a date with. For each person that signifies the same by the deadline, the automated scheduling will schedule dates for two or more weeks in the future to give it some space. Which people you end up meeting again would be a surprise.

&amp;nbsp;

- Dating someone who's almost perfect but has one of your deal breakers

&amp;nbsp;

- ""Meet me half way,"" where you both meet at an equidistant point from your homes with no pre-planning and decide where to go from there

&amp;nbsp;

- Micro-dates, little sections of maybe 15-30 minutes between commitments where you happen to be in the same area and do something simple

&amp;nbsp;

- Feel free to submit more ideas

&amp;nbsp;

Allowing more experimentation with the meeting process past 'you liked each other, now take turns messaging' should hopefully make OLD less transactional and more organic/interesting (as a bonus you wouldn't have to say you met on OLD, but at a group blind date or whatever). It will be worthwhile to add functionality that allows self exploration and reflection as well, which I have ideas for but won't get into here.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Beyond dating
An important part of tearing down the ""what's in it for me"" mentality encouraged by OLD is establishing some more permanence to profiles outside of just dating. Naturally, if profiles exist outside of the dating context the service would need relationship statuses (like Facebook). As for whether these should be publicly visible, I suppose it's best to leave that up to the user as with all other data items, but it would be necessary for scheduling. In some ways this changes the service to be more like a standard social network, but my vision for it has key distinctions. Most notably, social networks are predisposed towards mob/elitist mentality and tribalism, and we want to avoid that.

&amp;nbsp;

Rather than a service where you mindlessly scroll through endless content, reading and reacting for everyone to see, the social network aspect of the site will be more oriented towards individuals. Users would have a limited number of posts in their feed, and these would primarily be posts about different relationship scenarios[10] (mostly originating from profiles they've closely matched, or highly popular scenarios). Fore example, ""your SO just turned the AC on right after you turned it off, what do you do?"" Given that the site objective isn't building a social network, I'm not sure whether you'd have friends or not and be able to see and compare their reactions (over-comparison is another thing we'd like to avoid), but you'd certainly not be able to see the general public's reactions (remember, data conservation, bounds, non-habit-forming, anti-mob). You would, however, be able to see matches' and likes'  reactions after you'd answered yourself, which is in line with the site's objectives and ""give and get"" policy.

&amp;nbsp;

This feature may seem passably interesting, but it's actually quite important both in and outside of dating. Even after you're long off the market, you can still log on and find important questions you may not have considered that can prepare you mentally for the real thing. For example, maybe you are having a child soon and never considered how you're going to manage getting enough sleep. After seeing the question and considering, you realize you need to plan for baby-watching shifts so you and you're SO can alternate sleeping. Seeing other's answers may give you even further considerations.

&amp;nbsp;

 Note that the relevance of posts to an individual would largely be assessed by relationship status, so we would need more granularity than Facebook has. Such as recently single, just married, expecting, etc., and that in combination with whether or not they're currently looking to be in a relationship or off the market (recently single and not looking would naturally get different content than recently single and looking, for example).

&amp;nbsp;

Mentorship, in my mind, is another important thing that current OLD lacks. Some may currently use reddit and other social media for advice, but these have the same lack of exposure problem as OLD. Surrounding typical OLD you hear a lot from those that are unsuccessful, but when someone actually is successful most tend to just disappear and move on with their (now much busier) lives. A better service might feature their story, and  graduate those with long term relationships to a mentorship role. The service, in effect, would have its own 'influencers' or pseudo-dating-coaches. Users could browse and follow successful relationships and read their stories, and even potentially sign up for group sessions with those mentors (whether in-person or online) or message them personally for advice or questions. The mentors themselves would of course decide whether they want to be a part of this and there would be no money in it for them.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Kairos
OLD doesn't do enough to take your life's timeline into account. Sure, you may live in New York, and that distance from L.A. might be a deal breaker for ""the one."" As much as we'd like to think we'd do anything for the right person, the fact is that you probably wouldn't make long distance work unless you at least already had a well established relationship. But it's possible that the person is considering, or in the process of, moving. Or will soon be on vacation or business near you. Or might be open to moving depending on the place.

&amp;nbsp;

There are two features I have in mind to address this that go hand in hand. One, a heat map of your matches, with the temperature based on match percentage. Two, the ability to drop pins on the map to signify either places you're considering moving to, places you frequently travel to, places you have relatives, or more. This, for one, addresses the problem of people always changing their location on OLD. Mostly they do this to explore, and pin dropping on the heat map where they have a higher concentration of matches should satisfy that itch. For two, the heat map could actually influence moving decisions. Since this is a community building service, after all, you could potentially extend the heat map to include communities and not just matches, and find a place you'd like to move to.

&amp;nbsp;

Another aspect of Kairos we've already covered is more granular relationship status. Further than just considering what has recently happened and what you're ready for, a good service should take into account your timeline expectations. I.e  I may be someone looking for long term, but I may still expect to get married pretty quickly; conversely, I may want a short term relationship of several months before getting serious, followed by a long term before marriage. Those recently single may be immediately ready to get back out there, or they may want to wait a few months. So, there should be expected durations attached to statuses along with Q&amp;A oriented towards timeline. We could potentially also take into account how long people expect to stay at their job, how long they expect it will be before they want children, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Last, I had considered whether or not there might be an elegant way to track the 5 health aspects in a way that isn't tedious and requiring constant updates, so people could get a better idea of what kind of life progress their potential matches are making and whether they're on similar enough pathways. But that actually already exists in the form of communities and tracking data items over time (e.g, someone may be in weight-loss, therapy, investment, etc. communities).

&amp;nbsp;

#####  Is that all?
Definitely not, that's the 'condensed' version. I haven't addressed all the goals, nor covered all ideas I have for addressing each. I also haven't covered what I plan to call the service, or what branding and aesthetic it will have because I'd rather keep that secret for now (but I'm pretty excited about it). 

&amp;nbsp;

As I said at the start, I'm here mainly to recruit other software developers to help get this project started. But on top of that to open up thoughts I've had on the matter for constructive criticism. Given that I'm not much of a social media person, I'm not very aware of reddit culture, but I presume that posting something like this on multiple subreddits is common when you want to reach similar audiences [11]. If you have any suggestions for other subreddits to post this to for it to gain more traction, kindly suggest them or even share this on other social media.

[1]: It should go without saying, these statistics are quite loose. We're not looking for precision obviously. Nothing should be off by an order of magnitude

[2]: The applications I've used are: Bumble, Hinge, Tinder, OkCupid, Match, Coffee meets bagel, Plenty of Fish, Eharmony, Happn, and Elite Singles, in order to try and get a feel for the differences in paradigms. I tried each for about a week, then discontinued all but OkCupid because it has a more robust question/answer system to experiment with, and because that's a lot to manage.

[3]: If you're curious, I separated out a list of my experiences on OLD since this one was getting ginormous (post pending, I'll link when it's up)

[4]: For example, many women (possibly as a result of lacking feedback) incorrectly classify their body type, this can be both intentionally and unintentionally considering it's somewhat subjective

[5]: Aren't these technically 'influencers?' Shouldn't these people be paid for bringing in revenue to the services? I'm not saying there's a legal obligation, just an interesting thought

[6]: I envision communities being like plugins. In a very literal sense. Some may be simple, only asking about information like a favorite football team, but ideally a full on api would allow, say, someone to join a pacman community that requires you to beat a certain score before you can match with them. Communities, of course, are a form of user generated content, which invariably requires some form of moderation. I won't get into details, but the architecture of the site will lend itself towards self moderation. 

[7]: This understandably raises concerns about being able to google the person to figure out if they're a sex offender or criminal or whatever, I won't get too much into it, but I have a few ideas to counteract that possibility

[8]: Things like this pose the possibility of conflicts of course. One person is sour about the date and out of spite tries to hurt the other person's credibility. There are various methods for dealing with this, short of having an appeals process (which is a last resort). One such method is simply allowing a buffer, so that you're record is unaffected till it becomes a recurring problem (multiple people reporting missed dates). This same solution can be applied to bot reporting

[9]: Some users may not like certain accountability features, like people being able to see how many dates you've skipped out on. We would have the option to hide this, but also have the option not to match with people that have hidden it. The idea is to separate people who want accountability from people that don't, not force them to be accountable.

[10]: Other potential items of interest other than scenarios include: ideas people have for surprising your SO, date ideas, things that have improved your relationship, polls, and more.

[11]: looks like it is, and it's called cross-posting",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/merml4/how_can_old_be_fixed_long_post/
74,mersqp,1616895672,First Date Postponed...Twice,"I apologize for the lengthiness...

I (25M) recently messaged someone (25F) on IG in hopes of meeting her. We're from the same home town and went to high school together (one class separated) but I actually have never talked or had class with her. However, we follow each other on social media and are clearly aware of the each other.  I always have thought she's very pretty and someone who I think I'd get along well with, and possibly date, so I decided to shoot my shot. After messaging her and starting a conversation, I asked if she'd want to get coffee and take a walk, and she said yes. I was thrilled! 

The day it was suppose to happen, it poured. But she suggested postponing to today, and were set to meet at a brewery. However, one of her best friends just coincidentally went through a break up with a significant other (who that person lives with) and she told him she'd get him out of the house tonight, thus effectively canceling tonight's plans with me. 

I'm  annoyed, only because I think I'm really going to like this woman so I've been bummed out being postponed on the day of twice now. She also didn't suggest another day/date like she did last time, so part of me thinks she just may not be interested and doesn't have the heart to be straight up with me.  I don't think that's the case, however. I do think she will go out and meet me, but the last two weekends have been a gut punch to my confidence.  

So, I'm not sure what to do now. I see that I have  two options:  
1) Do nothing. Ball is in her court. See if she reaches out but if not, move on.

2) Give it a day or two. Reach out again early next week suggesting something, and being upfront about telling her it's okay to say no if she's not into it.

I do know that she was recently talking with someone, but no longer is. I want to be persistent because if I wait too long, she may meet and find chemistry with someone else. However, a part of me thinks I should just move on due to how disappointing the last two postponements have been and wanting to avoid that disappointment again. 

And to think this is all about someone I haven't even met! 

TL;DR: Been postponed on twice now for a date with a woman I went to school with, but don't personally know. Not sure if postponements are legit or just convenient excuses.

82,mesesh,1616897883,I'm scared of asking somone for a number in public and I'm confused on what I'm doing wrong,"All my friends have met their SO at work or something. My buddy who we'll call roman met his first girlfriend at his job. He works at a restaurant and managed to somehow ask for her snap? His second girlfriend he also met at work in a similar manner but this time as a walmart cashier.

How do you get to the point of asking for someones snap at work? I'd be terrified. What if she asked for my manager and I got fired? What if she takes it as weird or perverted. This idea isn't helped by the fact that I was falsely accused of rape in high school ( it was fucking terrifying and I cried for days untill she finally confessed) I'm genuinely scared to make a move in a public setting. It's even worse considering I dislike online dating. OLD doesn't work for me. 

OLD has always been 1-3 matches a month. Only one out of my 12 total have actually gone somewhere and it ended up being a one night stand kinda thing. I wouldn't say I've given up on OLD but it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm fully aware I'm not the best looking guy and I'm ok with that. I'm confident for sure and I think I look decent, definitely not 10/10 but who is. I just think OLD isn't always worth it. 

The one thing I can say that bothers me is what I do and my traits in comparison to others.

Now to preface let me say that I don't think I'm better than everyone else and I strive to see my flaws so I can work on them. With that said...

At 18 years old I'm working 70 hours a week. This isn't a huge detriment to my social life as far as I'm concerned. I'm on my own insurance policy and with the money I saved I just bought a brand new car. I'm finishing up senior year at home and I'm going into college next year for construction management. I genuinely believe I have a decent head on my shoulders and I strive to do better day by day. So what else could be wrong? This isn't me asking for support or comfort. This is me genuinely asking what I need to improve. I'm satisfied with myself and how far I've come. 

I know some of my weakness's. Definitely my weight. For my height im for sure a bit underweight. Not much I can do about my weight so I embrace it. My hairs never been the best. Never been super happy with it because I can't figure out what looks good on me. My family life is shaky but I never being it up.

The last thing I'll mention is that I'm not old enough to go to bars (clearly) and I'm not in college right now. So I'm not sure how to actually meet people.

I know this post covered alot of different areas and I'm sorry for that. I guess I just needed to get this all out after seeing young couples at work tonight. Made me a bit sad/jealous. I'd love some advice or constructive criticism. Thanks for taking the time to read this

89,mesyca,1616899857,Play the game or stick to being me?,"Hey guys,
So I(19f) have been dating this guy(21m) for a month now and I like him a lot, but I'm conflicted on a couple things and could use some unbiased advice.
So we've seen eachother every other day or so since we started talking, but he has yet to put a label on it(he knows I want one). 
In our relationship, I'm definitely more clingy than he is. I value communication over text when we can't see eachother a lot more, he'll not respond for hour long stretches consistently and ignore me longer when he's with friends, and he's said my expectations for communication that way are higher than he really wants them to be. 
But, like I said, I do like him a lot and he makes sweet gestures in person like teaching me to dance, bringing me coffee when he knows I'm stressed with school stuff, and being physically affectionate except he doesn't like to hold hands in public(he prefers for me to hold his arm, which I'm probably reading too much into due to my own insecurity as a way of distancing himself from me a little, since that requires only me holding him. He does sometimes rest his head on my shoulder in public though), among other things. 
Today I was talking to my brother though and he was making me feel like I'm making myself way too available to this guy, and I should be a little harder to get and make him chase me
I've never really liked playing games like that, if I feel affection I like to show it, and so on. But this made me think: I'm considering giving my virginity to this guy (TMI, sorry) when he doesn't even want to give me the label of girlfriend (although aside from hinting, we haven't had a direct conversation about it in 2 weeks) and I feel like I'm a burden to him sometimes with over texting. It make me worry that maybe I'm undervaluing myself and making him feel that I'll always be there on standby for him, and why secure something that'll always be available, Yaknow.
So should I try to distance and play a little harder to get? Or should I just continue to be genuine and give him time? Last time we talked about a relationship his response was he needs time, I don't know if that's still true or if he even intends to ever give me a label, since we're both moving in a few months and what we have will be short lived.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mesyca/play_the_game_or_stick_to_being_me/

93,metklv,1616902128,Dating apps except Facebook dating are rigged...,"I have Bumble, Tinder and Hinge and I no longer receive matches after about 2 months or so. In each, I’ve averaged about 10 matches with women. When I first signed up to those apps, I got matches quickly. I still regularly use the apps and swipe so I know it’s not because of inactivity. Also, I don’t recklessly swipe right. All of my dating apps use the same exact pictures and BIO. 

Meanwhile I’ve been using Facebook dating and getting dates for the last 3 months and have 63 matches and continue to get them daily. I only get matches really when the women that I’ve liked already, like me back, but at least I get matches. 

I am convinced, that because apps like Bumble, Tinder and Hinge need to make money from the users, they purposefully suppress your profile’s visibility (primarily if you’re a male who’s not a model) until you pay for their boost features or super swipes. Meanwhile, Facebook makes their money from ads and user data so they couldn’t care less to incentivize the dating portion of their services. 

Guys, just use Facebook dating...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/metklv/dating_apps_except_facebook_dating_are_rigged/
94,metlf9,1616902216,"Spent 8 hours with a date, she said she would definitely be down to meet again, now she hasn't replied. What should I do?","I (26M) went on a date with this girl (25F) 2 days ago. We went bouldering (we both like climbing), and we followed up with dinner. She and I met 2 years ago very briefly, and recently linked up on hinge and had been speaking for about a week.

I thought she wouldn't be too interested because we weren't really talking much during bouldering. Although, I figured she was in her own world solving the climbs. 

But when we got to dinner was when we really clicked. We had similar taste in music, in humour, in things we liked to do. We spoke for hours and hours. Even when I went to drop her home, we talked so much. Overall we spent about 8 hours together. 

She told me that she really enjoyed her time and would definitely be down for a second date, she said ""you have my number"", I suppose it was for me to organise the next date. We decided on going to the gallery in a week's time or so in person. 

She told me she thought I was cute, had a great butt, and a gentleman. She wanted to make me a playlist of songs too. She also said that she has never let her weird side out this comfortably before. The whole interaction was the best I've had in such a long time. 

She told me to text her when I got home, which I did. We had a short back and forth reminisce about a game we played. The next day (yesterday) I said I had a great time with her and would love to meet again, if she consented (we were jokingly using ""do you consent"" through the night).

I don't know how long I should wait. Should I even message her again? Do I let this die off here? I really would like to see her again, she was fun.

Probably an important note. She did only reply once or twice a day on Hinge.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/metlf9/spent_8_hours_with_a_date_she_said_she_would/

96,metrpe,1616902923,Is it bad to be straight up?,"So I was chit-chatting with this girl I met for a while. We talk, we exchange photos, definitely see the momentum (Always how the game is played). We start talking, and it gets to the point of of BOOM, a date is made. So I had made a second date with this girl about 4 days ago (She gave me a reasonable excuse for the first one). Today we planned to meet up at 4PM. We message in the morning. 03:55PM she tells me if we can reschedule for later and I tell her ""Its fine, what time do you got on your mind?"" By 6PM, I had made plans with my friends thinking this situation between me and her was a ""flake"". She doesn't text me until 07:30PM telling me if im going to be busy later...  I told her I had made plans because I felt she was going to flake and told her that I just didn't feel her communicating or respecting my time that I had and I knew I wasn't going to wait all day for her, but that I would be home by 10PM. She goes nuts, things start to go squirly, we get in an argument, she deletes me from all social media and I guess thats that, end of story. Was I in the wrong for being straight up to her and letting her know how I felt? Sometimes I feel when im straight up girls just feel offensive, but I try to say how I feel, and she did flake me the first time. Yea I wanted to see her, but I also couldn't just stay home and wait all day for her to give me the green light or for her not to respect my time. Im not sure, sometimes I feel when I speak my mind girls feel like im disrespecting their ego, or sometimes I just feel that I am more mature than most girls I date since I know id be like 15 minutes early for the date... Huh maybe its cause I keep dating girls younger than me, anyhoo I def get tired since idk if its just games girls play.
