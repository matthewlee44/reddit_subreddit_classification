I’m average looking but what I have going for me is that I’m 6ft tall and well endowed . I’m anywhere between 6.5 to 7 inches in length depending on arousal level. 5.5 in girth. I have pics on my Reddit profile for proof since I know a lot of guys lie about size. I am also a selfless lover, enjoy giving oral and pleasing my partner, and will always try my best to make the girl orgasm or I consider it a failure. 

I am going to try tinder but have no idea what I’m doing lol. What should I put on there for my best chances to succeed? Should I mention my size or does that come off as douchey? What types of pictures should I have? Despite this post I’m not some F boy nor am I going to deceive anyone of my intentions. I just want to have a new experience as I said.

We went out and immediately hit it off. We dated for three months, never with a title (red flag, I know, there were many I ignored).He treated me wonderfully. We went out multiple nights a week and spent every other night at my house. He told me he wanted kids with me, that I was everything he wanted in a woman, and many other sweet nothings. It was the best sex of my life, the most fun of my life, and the most I’ve felt loved in my life. I truly believe he was my twin flame, when it turns out I was probably just manipulated. 

This broke off between us when I moved back home for a bit to get situated for grad school. I always thought when I got back that we’d have our chance again.

Since I had been home I had tested positive for chlamydia, let him know, and he said he had tested negative. I had been with other people and assumed it was someone else (also notified everyone I had been with). A few months later, I came back to where he lived for a weekend to check out campus and we hooked up. Shortly after (a few days after) he posted pictures of an older woman and the flowers he had gotten her. 

A few days after THAT an 18 year old reached out to me and said they had hooked up during the times that we had been together, and that she had gotten from chlamydia from him, as she was a virgin when they met. 

I called him and he made light of the situation. I told him he needed to get tested and tell his partners if he was positive and he laughed. I had suspicions before,but it turned out that he slept with many other women when we were together. He was adamant to me when we were together that I was the only person he was with. 

I went nuclear, and reached out to about 10 women that he had been with/talked to in the same timeframe, including another woman that he dated, and later claimed to me was his “soulmate”.  (Note: this wasn’t even the older woman he was dating when this all went down who HAD KIDS. She was 40 he was 27, and she had teenagers). All of the women I contacted had been with him and many tested positive. He and I have since gone non contact and I have him blocked on all platforms. I’m sad, angry, and heartbroken over it all but I hope I was able to protect some other women in the process. 

All this to say, I’m now moving back to the same town where we both used to live. I want to be able to go about town and not be nervous to run into him. I don’t want to wear this chip on my shoulder. I want to be able to go to all the same old bars and not be anxious to have all these feelings come back.

It was very difficult to get into the group as the organizer wouldn't accept most new members unless he personally knew them or if they were friends of another member in the group.

I attended the first meetup of that group a few days ago. Then today I got a DM from a girl who attended that meetup and she said it was nice to meet me and that we should hang out some time. Took me by surprise since we didn't speak to each other at all at that meetup and I only vaguely remember what she looked like. I'm also pretty shy and introverted when I attend meetups with people I don't know, so I'm surprised she noticed me since we didn't speak to each other. Based on what I remember about her, she also seemed like she was shy and quiet, which I prefer in girls

I don't really know how to reply to her message. If I ask her on a date, I'm concerned that things could go badly if we date and she could complain about me to the organizer and get me kicked out. This is the only meetup in the area that is exclusive for my age group, that is very active, and has events that I'm interested in. OTOH, I've had pretty much no luck with dating apps.

I have desire when theres a chase, when the relationship is new and exciting but once things settle in, my desire fades away pretty quickly. We’ve both been in a few long term relationships and haven’t had a lot of time being single before meeting each other so that may play a role as well. 

He knows all of this about me and understands completely. But it’s difficult feeling like our relationship is missing an important piece.

Just started dating a guy about a month ago. Super compatible and good chemistry. At the end of one of our dates, I spoke to him about slowing down the pace so we can truly get to know each other. I told him that ultimately I want a relationship but I do not want to rush things. He said the same but said he isn’t ready for a relationship rn. He also mentioned that he deleted the dating app after our first date but does not mean that we are exclusive and is still open to seeing other people. I expressed to him that I really don’t have interest in others after meeting him. (Maybe this turned him off) 

However I noticed since that conversation, he hasn’t been reaching out to me as much via text. 

To be fair, he’s settling into a new job, big shift in his life so I am trying to be mindful of this. But I’m finding myself to be over analytical overthinking every little thing. Clingy and needy. Insecure. I feel pathetic. 

I guess I was used to all the attention in the beginning. Him initiating everything, texting etc and now he’s not doing that… 

I initiated hanging out last week and we saw each other and I haven’t heard from him since.

Should I reach out and ask why he’s not texting as much? Is this a convo I should have in person or is this too much? Is it too much to tell him that I expect that? 

or should I mirror his actions and just back off? 

Would dating other people stop me from getting so attached? 

What can I do to stop this cycle and continue getting attached? I was doing a lot of reading and it seems as if I have an anxious attachment style. If this is how dating is going to be, I don’t think I should do it. I’m just feeling discouraged and pathetic. 

How often should people text that are dating each other? How often should they see each other? I’m such a noob and welcome any advice.

I've done really well in my career in the past year in terms of progression and (more importantly) learning things. I'm moving to New York in the summer for a really prestigious opportunity. In the meantime, I absolutely love my social life and friendships. 

Even my romantic life - which up until exactly one year ago today was literally nonexistent - is improving a little bit. I have dated three women in the past year. Although none of these became relationships (and one of them was insanely painful in terms of getting messed around and treated badly), I am happy that I at least have found the capacity within me to date even though I spent all 23 years I'd been alive before last year crippled by anxiety around relationships and sex.

That said: I feel pretty sad at the moment that I am not dating anyone. The last girl I dated was in January and she ended things because I was moving to New York in the summer. I think this has thrown me a little bit in terms of looking for anything new. As a virgin, casual dating doesn't really appeal to me much. I feel like most of the time the expectation with casual dating is sex and as quite a mentally vulnerable person who can find physical touch difficult I think just jumping into bed with someone could be really damaging. 

So I'd always hoped to find someone with whom I built up a genuine and powerful emotional trust prior to sex. So I think casual dating is probably off the table. 

And it just feels like the move to New York is so close now that I can't really think about getting into a proper relationship, or that a satisfying one could form in such a short space of time. 

This makes me feel like these next 4 months before I move are gonna be pretty lonely, and it's tough to just resign myself to my own company in that time. It makes me sad that after spending so many years wishing I could find the confidence to date, that I now have to put that on hold for another few months just as I found it.

I also worry a little about my dating prospects moving to New York. I've spent quite a bit of time in the US before now, and I often find that it's harder to connect with people there. The sense of humour, the values, the perception of what's attractive and what isn't, seems cosmically different to where I'm from. I guess I can sometimes find it hard to feel hope for my dating prospects in the future because there have been so few in the past.

Anyway, none of this is really all that crushing or existential, but I needed to get it off my chest. My friends view relationships so *so* differently to how I do, so Reddit felt like an okay place to share.

I (M/19) haven’t been in any sort of romantic relationship… ever. I’m openly bisexual but right now, I’ve been looking to start a relationship with a guy to see how I feel. A little over a month ago, I decided I’d try and spice things up by signing up for a couple dating apps to try and meet guys in my area since I can’t really go out for myself and meet people from school or elsewhere (I’ve been remotely attending college for almost 2 years). 

Recently, I found this guy who I think is **super** attractive; he personally ticked all the boxes based off of appearance alone, so I tried hitting him up. Didn’t get any sort of response, but curiosity got the best of me since he didn’t attach any of his socials, and I ended up finding his Instagram since he used one of those promo photos sports teams use on his dating profile since he’s a part of his university’s **\[REDACTED\]** team. I know it’s already slightly creepy enough I went out of my way to try and find this guy’s Instagram, but I *really really* think this guy is cute. Ended up falling more head over heels for the guy just looking at his feed and seeing the memes he reposted on his story, so I tried DM’ing with something along the lines of “hey I saw your profile on **\[REDACTED\]** and thought you were cute,” and hit him with a follow as well. Say it with me, *no response*.

At this point, I think I’m getting kinda worried that I’m getting too fixated on this guy because I’ve tried convincing myself that maybe he just hasn’t seen the DM request or some other reach of an excuse because I seriously want to have a chance to at least talk with this dude. I don't how to explain it, but it just feels like I've never wanted to get to know someone more so badly in my entire life. It’s kind of gotten to the point where when I’ve gone back to these dating apps to try and find other guys… I’ve not really found a majority of them all that attractive since I encountered **that** guy.

What do I do in this situation? I know dating is about having an open mind to anyone, but I’m going crazy over the fact I can’t get this one guy’s attention. I also know I shouldn't be putting guys I see against each other but... *again, this guy is so so so so cute in my opinion.*",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164860,public,self,I'm too into this guy I saw on a dating app despite never having interacted with him?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tqn6ow/im_too_into_this_guy_i_saw_on_a_dating_app/,no_ads,0.0,,,

It would honestly make me feel worse and lonelier to be texting someone I never really plan to meet. 

I’ve definitely asked guys out before instead of waiting to be asked out, but after dating a few guys that seemed a little passive/uninterested in real life too, I figured I would try to wait for guys to ask me out instead since it’s more of an indication that they’re actually interested. But after 2-3 weeks of consistent texting, time and time again, no matter how much we exchanged through text conversations, no guy seems to want to ask me out. I have had about ~70 matches who have all fizzled out, all of whom I was genuinely interested in and tried to give 100% each time.

I feel like I’m a reasonably attractive girl (though obviously I wouldn’t want to be presumptuous I’m trying to base this off of what people have told me), and sometimes I even drop hints like “oh we’ve been talking a while on here”. Ideally it would be nice to date someone who took the initiative to ask me out, like I have before with other dates/in other relationships.

Is there something I’m missing here?? I feel like having this many matches fall through is genuinely odd, though I’ve been told by friends that that’s ‘just the way online dating goes’.

Initially, it was just supposed to just be a hookup, but we hit it off pretty well and made future plans pre and post-sex. He didn't wake me up though to say bye after sex and just left the morning after. Texted him the next morning asking him why he didn't say bye (I'm used to people leaving with a bye even if it's just a hookup). He responded saying he didn't want to wake me, which is reasonable/polite. 

So we keep on texting and he asks me when he can see me again. I tell him I'm free some time during the week. (When we were texting, he would make all these future plans like inviting me over to his new place or doing X and Y together.) The day we're supposed to see each other rolls around and we meet up at mines to walk to a bar together. We spend the next few hours barhopping before I suggest we should go back to mines. We get back and start making out but before doing the deed, I tell him I'm on my period. He says he's had a traumatic experience with period sex so he's good with not doing it. 

I ask him if I should've mentioned I was on my period before he came over and he told me ""no"" and ""I like spending time with you without sex."" I say: ""sweet, me too."" 

So we cuddle and nap in my bed. He tells me to set an alarm (it's a weekday btw so we both work the next day) for like 20 minutes. 20 minutes pass, still cuddling/napping, and he tells to set another alarm for 20 minutes lol. Then he finally gets the motivation to leave, so this time he tells me he's outta here. I say 'OK' and then lay back down. On his exit he tells me he'll text me the next morning. 

And...no text??

I'm like: ""Okay whatever"" and just chose to forget about him.

A week has gone by with radio silence.  I changed my profile on Hinge last night. I replace some photos but kept my main photo the same. Today I checked Hinge to make sure I deleted one of my photos, then I saw that the dude unmatched me?

So I went on the date. The nerves before we met were insane, I haven’t been that nervous for anything in a long time, but once I was with her it felt pretty natural and while I was still nervous, it wasn’t a crazy amount.

I don’t know how to describe it, it wasn’t awkward but it felt like there was a little bit of weird tension. A couple of tiny little pauses in the conversation, us lingering a little too long when I took her home, that sort of thing. We did joke around with each other a lot still but it also felt like we were trying to get to know each other a little deeper than usual and like she was confiding in me things she wouldn’t have before. But then a couple of other things make me think she might not have enjoyed herself as much as I thought; her being the one to ask if we should leave after we ate, her saying not to worry about walking her home at first and that she didn’t want me to have to go out my way (even if she did seem grateful for it in the end), etc., it felt like maybe she just kind of wanted it to end.

Maybe I’m wrong, but I just kind of keep replaying everything in my mind and wondering if I should have done things differently. She was pretty adamantly against me paying for it all and we split the bill and she said I could just buy her a drink some time instead, but should I have paid? I walked her home which she seemed grateful for, but is it weird to do that after a first date? Was it awkward for her? Should I have tried to flirt with her more explicitly or should I have suggested we do something else after we had dinner?

However I recently asked out a girl and even though I fumbled it a bit she said yes. Cool, so we planned out a time and place, (coffee shop) and I combed the internet as well as asked all the trustworthy people I knew who had dated previously for tips on what/what not to do. So come date day, I’m feeling a bit nervous but pretty good overall despite having never been on a date before. We both arrived at more or less the same time and after a rock paper scissor shoot out (we both insisted on paying for the other) I ended up winning and paying for everything and we sat down.

Now I don’t exactly know how a date is supposed to go but if you ask me I say it went pretty well. We spent 3 hours talking and laughing with one another and probably would’ve spent more time if my parking meter hadn’t ran out. We both agreed to call it a day at that point and I walked her to her bus station, made sure she got on safely and then left. (I offered to give her a ride home but she declined since it would’ve been way out of my way so I didn’t push it any further) I got home waited a couple of hours to calm down before saying anything and then told her that I had a great time with her and suggested that we should go out again. 

And that’s it really, she never responded to that text. When I saw her today at class she was her usual self when we spoke but neither of mentioned the date or the text I sent her afterwards.

His wife left him in the Summer. This Fall we went on a few dates, but the communication was sketchy. It was always the wife pulled this or that on him and he didn’t want to drag me into his problems, or “seem clingy.” Then in December he told me he wanted to make things official “before someone else scooped me up.” and seemed eager to tell the whole world. The communication improved and we saw each other more frequently. He brought me to his family’s holiday functions and he came to mine. He even told my family I was the best thing to happen to him and that I pulled him out of the dirt after his wife left. 
But the communication was not at the level I wanted it to be. There was always some excuse for why he couldn’t take 30 seconds to text me during the week. We had a civil discussion where I nicely told him what I expected. It was a reasonable request. I don’t need to know where he is and what he’s doing 24/7, but I think daily communication was fair. The last time I saw him was on March 10. We texted that weekend where he invited me to come along to his family’s St Patrick’s Day party the following week. Then he dropped off for 4 days. I contacted him to try to get details for the party and had to ask him if he was alive to get a response. He said he “meant to text me” but that he had been sick with flu like symptoms since that Sunday. He sent me a photo of a negative CoVid test (which he probably found on Google). I told him to keep me posted about the party in case I needed to make other plans. At the last minute on St Pats Day he tells me he still wasn’t well and was just gonna stay in and rest. Later that night he told me he took a much needed nap and was feeling better, and that he “missed me.” He was supposed to come with me on a hockey tournament last Friday (March 18) and said he would really try to make it. Of course on Friday before I left he told me he still wasn’t well and didn’t want to risk getting anybody sick. That was the last I heard from him. He never checked in to see how the trip was or what happened in my games.  
He doesn’t use social media much but last  Wed I had a hunch to look at FB. Sure enough there he is tagged in photos on St Pats Day partying with his family when he told me he had stayed in and took a nap. I commented “interesting I thought you were sick. You seem to be doing well here.” Some of his family chimed in with popcorn gifs and to say to handle this in private. The friend he’s staying with told me he was under the weather last week but that it only lasted about a day. 
I’m sure by now he has to know that I know. I changed my status to single, blocked him on both FB and IG, and deleted his contact from my phone. 
I’m honestly more pissed than anything. If he didn’t want to spend time with me then he shouldn’t have invited me to the party in the first place. If he doesn’t wanna be with me, fine, then say so. But instead he has to jerk me around, waste my time, and play games like he’s in middle school. I’d think he’d be decent enough at least as a friend, but I guess I’m not worth his time or an explanation. 
At this point in my life, I almost expect to be screwed over sooner or later, and when it inevitably happens I’m not surprised. Before him I was single for 5 years and pretty much gave up on ever finding anyone. Now I remember why I stopped dating. I’m so sick of the bullshit.

She doesn't respond much due to her having 2 jobs, due to not having much money.

Understandable- a co-worker/my employee that I manage has also been chatting with her and I overheard a conversation that they plan on meeting over the weekend and hanging out. She mentioned to me she wants to grab dinner but when I set up a time and day she says she will text me and let me know. She never texted me. She did mention to me that she is wanting to take it slow since she has been married and divorced twice now.

So far this week I've been keeping it very short, only speaking to her if we cross paths at work and keeping it very minimal just to test the waters. She has been looking at me and smiling but hasn't really came up to me to talk. Not even that she forgot to let me know about meeting.

Just has been giving me the eye like wtf, why haven't you said anything to me. I mentioned to her kinda jokingly she never let me know about meeting and she said she knows and that she had to work all day and she will let me know when we can meet for dinner. The co worker she talks to alot, I think the conversation I have with her she tells the co worker. So it's like a 3 way conversation for some reason. How would you deal with this. There is a language barrier since she is from south America so my Spanish isn't the best. I told her I want to talk to her about something, she told me to call her. I want to tell her how I feel but never called her yet.

Sunday she texted me out of the blue saying sorry she hasn't been able to talk since she's been so busy and God willing will we get to talk on Monday.

But, after listening to countless horrifying anecdotes from friends and other women, my enthusiasm for returning to the dating scene has waned some… I’ve gone on dates and, while one connection showed promise - though extenuating circumstances cut it short, the other left a bad taste in my mouth that’s given me pause about what I’m exactly exposing myself to.

To be direct, I guess what I’d like to know is if there are actual people out there looking for a serious partnership or if the majority are simply looking to ~pass the time~ with whomever they find who’s willing? From those with more dating experience in the current dating climate, what’s the general consensus?

Any tips for how a hopeless romantic in search of a partner to share her life with should navigate these waters?

It took me until Friday to get over my emotion, and I’m 100% fine now. I still think she’s right for me, but it doesn’t feel like I NEED her, if you know what I mean. She was very nice about the breakup, almost apologetic, and she said it was bc she was too busy. 

However, I think it was really bc she thinks I’m too young for her (I’m a sophomore, she’s a senior). The reason I think this is bc she oddly and awkwardly asked when my birthday was, and soon afterward dumped me. 

Anyway, since then, I’ve felt better than ever, and it seems like she’s been doing worse. Take that with a grain of salt, I’m not even sure myself, plus I’m heavily biased XD. Plus she could just feel bad about doing it but still feel like it was the right decision. 

I saw her on Sunday at a sports event for our coworkers that we were both attending for fun, and tbh I had the time of my life. I made two diving catches in softball, caught two touchdowns on tipped passes in football, and destroyed everyone in volleyball (I’m 6’3” 😄). Plus I roasted a bunch of people on the other teams, all in good fun (as one of the only high school students there, I was roasting this guy for looking like an engineer, and it turned out he was one!). She seemed kind of subdued at the event, not as chipper as usual, which was odd since everyone was having so much fun. Although again, it could be my mind playing tricks on me.

I came to work in today and had about eight people tell me how athletic I was. Tbh, it was awesome. She came in to work as well, again not as cheerful as normal (although she did have to work outside and talk to the creepy girl, so maybe I don’t blame her). I didn’t want her to feel awkward or bad about breaking up, so I was chitchatting with her. To lighten the mood, I asked her if she was doing ok. She said yes. I said, “ok just wanted to make sure bc I’d imagine it’d be hard moving past someone like me.” 

I laughed to make sure she took it the right way, and she laughed, but not in a way like she thought it was funny. Like either a sad way or just maybe a polite way to make it not awkward. 

Lol she dumped me, not the other way around! If I dumped a girl and she said that, I would be cracking up! (If you can’t tell, I was pretty proud of myself for that one)

Anyway, if you can’t tell, I will be totally fine if she moves on but if she doesn’t, I would like to get back together. 

Also, I noticed her listening in multiple times while I was talking to someone else and chuckling. She even said “nice” one time when I wasn’t even talking to her. 

Anyway, what do you all think? Does she want to get back together? If you need more info, pls dm me. I would love to talk.   Also, is there some test I can do to find out? I’m seeing her tomorrow. And I can’t exactly ask her out again or ask if she wants to get back together if I’m not 99% sure, bc we work together, and if she said no, it would be untenably awkward.

And please don’t say, “just move on.” I already have emotionally. Just say, “no I don’t think she likes you.”

I mean, I haven't felt like this with a woman in years. Probably since I was a teenager. 

And I'm not doing anything creepy or clingy. We're matching energy at this point, but she's already living in my head rent free. Yeah. I'm embarrassed to say it. Hell I'm using my burner for this post. 

No love bombing yet, though I did tell her I enjoy being around her. And no thirsty shit, like I said I already ""scored"" but hell I'd chill with her any time without the sex. 

Now I know what you're thinking, ""so what's wrong?"". Well, this one I'm honestly afraid to mess up. Been with plenty of women over the years, haven't had a fear of failure like this in a long time. And this quickly too. To the point I don't even remember how to express my feelings for someone. Obviously I want a few more dates in before doing that.

It was us and my friend, and his gf all got together to hang out (the two girls are best friends so sort of a double date). I drove about 4ish hours to bring my friend up there with me so he could spend some time with his gf, and I could spend time with her. We've been texting for about 2 months now, and all is good. Even though I had my fair share of nerves, we ended the date off on a kiss, had a blast seeing eachother, and it was great overall. Honestly the happiest I've been a good while.

My concern now, is she's scared to get into another relationship, even though she had a good time. Actually, concern is a pretty strong word, because I completely understand where she's coming from given her past relationships. So the past few days I've been putting some serious thought into how to approach her on it, and I'm not sure how I should word it.

I know it's a pretty heavy topic too, especially this early on, and I've even been thinking to myself the amount of effort it is going to take long term, but I've decided I'm ready for it regardless of the amount of time, and it's worth it to me.

Overall, I just want to make her aware that I'll have patience with her, I'm not trying to play games, and I'm not trying to use her. I'm in it for the long-haul, even if it means taking the drive every weekend. 

I want to wait to see her again to talk about it, because I feel it'd be more appropriate to talk to her about it in person then over the phone, but I know distance can hinder that a bit and I don't want her second guessing my intentions with the time stretch in between.

So instead of just telling her how I feel now without holding anything back, instead I ask her questions and start conversations. It makes her enjoy the interaction and feel like I’m a much better and trustworthy guy than somebody who is a bit less carefree.

People of reddit! I have a story to share. I don't want to include too much background for anonymity reasons. This is going to be long AF, and very disorganized, sorry in advance.

I met someone at work a few months back, and I thought she was the package deal. Take this term however you see fit; great career, great physique, tall etc. It took me about 2 weeks for me to strike up a conversation with her, after which I would make small talk in passing. After 2 weeks of small talk, she mentions that she's quitting, so I saw this as the ""she wants to connect"" sign. We exchange contact info.

Another week goes by, and we have our first date. Everything went smoothly, we connected on opinions, and life outlook etc. we have our first kiss, sparks fly. Great!

We text, and chat almost everyday/every other day.

I moved way to fast on this one though, after about 3 weeks I asked her of she wanted to be exclusive, she agreed. I should've known better...

We established some social ground rules along the lines of communicating our issues, not letting problems fester etc. Her rule was we need to devote some time to talk on the phone everyday. Everything was great so far.

The days that I had work/could not communicate, I would send a ""good morning, hope you have a great day!"" text. Until one day she decided that I was ignoring her, and asked me if I still liked her. I reassured her that all is well, I'm happy, and still in love.

A day or two later, she calls and vents about her work drama, she told me she was very stressed, and I tried to console her. Out of nowhere, she started making weird comments about my messy life style, which was odd because every time she came over, she would comment on how much more organized/cleanly I am compared to her. Hmmm...ok... then the conversation turned into, her: ""I don't think we'll be together forever, so lets just enjoy the moment."" Me: ""surrreeeee"" I tried to dig up some info as to why she felt this way, no luck, other than, we live about 45 minutes away from each other.

A few days later we're in the car and she says, ""I prefer men that don't curse"" and, ""I dont like that you (as in me) vape."" I already explained from the gate that I had quit smoking cigarettes 8 months prior, so vaping was my go to, and yes I curse, but no more than the average person, probably no more than she would curse. Which she did swear every so often. I thought these were strange requests, but I respected that, with a HUGE knot in my throat, and finished with ""I prefer women that I can get a mani/pedi with."" She was opposed to ever getting her feet done, and would apologize for how haggard her toes where, but never trimmed them, or apologize for her fuzzy cat, but never shaved it, ""she ONLY waxed, and never shaved because shaving causes razor bumps, and waxing is such a hassle in terms of devoting time to make and keep an appointment.""

I also noticed, that if I vaped in front of her, she would cough, so out of respect, I stopped that. What was odd was... if I was vaping in another room unknown to her, she would walk into the room, and not cough.

Then there was the, ""I think that other girl at work likes you."" You should ask her out. huh? What??

She brought up the same ""we won't be together forever"" thing a night or 2 later, to which I replied, ""ok, lets just end it here."" Her response, ""but won't you feel hurt, I know I'll feel hurt. I really really like you, we have an amazing connection."" My reply, ""Maybe I'd feel hurt."" Another week or two goes by, we spent the weekends together at my place.

One night I picked her up to bring her over, she had another stressful day at work, and ended up belittling me again... I let it slide that night, but brought it up the next day, that it was the second time she said nasty things about me. She apologized, and told me I misunderstood. Ok... This weekend was the first time when I couldn't wait for her to GTFO. She commented about my bathroom being dirty, but I had cleaned it the day before she'd arrived, mind you her bathroom is in an old tenement apartment she shares with roommates, ceiling covered in black mold... looked like the bathroom you chop up a body in. I did not judge her for that. But, my bathroom was the dealbreaker that made her tell me, ""clean bathrooms are very important to me, take me home in the morning."" The morning comes and she changes her mind, and wants to spend the rest of the day with me.

Fast forward to the following week, now I have a long day at work, and I broke night finishing a big project, I get home from work, and just want to eat, shower, and pass out. She was texting me on my way home from work, I let her know that I got home safely, but I cannot talk on the phone tonight, I'm very dead-tired, and just need some time to myself. I also mentioned that I ""just arrived home, and I'm starting to make a small meal."" She decides to call me anyway, I told her ""I just want to chill TF out, I don't want to talk, sorry."" She accepted that and hung up, then calls back 5 minutes later, explaining that she did not like my reply, ""I said, 'ok', have a great night"" and hung up. 5 missed calls later I tell her, ""I cannot do this anymore, I'm tired of being treated like X,Y and Z."" Then the novel length of text messages ensues from her. She used whatever I told her about my ex, and kind of compared herself to my ex, and how she was such a better person, on top of a bunch of other random stuff. My only text back, ""I'm making this decision because you're being very mean, and disrespectful of my space, I would've thought that a woman like you would understand the importance of time, and being able to decompress after a long day yada yada."" Her replies were something along the lines of, her being God's gift to men, and I'm lucky that she would consider spending time talking to me, and how I'm not her ideal choice but she decided to hang out with me anyway, and if I don't want to date, she still wants to be FWB. I ignored that text, 30 minutes later she asks again for a FWB deal... I told her to really think about it, we will speak in person at work. GOOODNIGHT.

I went completely silent after this point for 4 days, until I saw her at work a few days later, she wanted whatever belongings she left at my house, and still wanted FWB and she cannot see us being together, and that it was my fault that I drove her crazy, because we went too fast and she didn't trust me enough (mind you, she already told me 3 weeks prior about how toxic her last LTR was) and this was after constant reassurance that I wouldn't cheat etc. I told her I'm not a huge fan of FWB, been there and done that, but the devil on my shoulder is telling me otherwise, so I agree.

Her stipulation was that even though we're FWB, she still wants to feel chased, and go out to places etc.

""I'm sorry I have 0 interest in chasing, and impressing you at this point."" So she takes back the FWB proposal.

A few days later, I shoot her a text and asked if she wanted to hang out, she said she misses me, I told her I wanted to just netflix and chill, and she was cool with that. The day to hang out comes, and she's not in the mood to be physical, but wants to go out for lunch, and for a walk in the park, or whatever. ""Deary me I forgot a had a doc appointment that day, and I cancelled.""

Now I have a work stalker, that comes to my office to strike up convos, and tell me how amazing I am, and these other guys she's dating just don't compare, and she still cares about me, and wants me in her life. FML though?

I know I'm no angel here, I just want to find the line of keeping peace at work...

I barely get matches majorly due to bad use of the app i.e. I keep deleting and re-creating my profile. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some observations regarding the disparity in dating apps for guys vs girls:

1. Most of the girls don't even have to make an effort to get a match. 
2. As a result, I see a lot of them being complacent or very single dimensional meaning they lack an all round personality.
3. On the other hand,  I am seeing a lot of guys making so much effort to better themselves essentially so that they can date better via apps. 
4. To all those guys, don't match with users who actually don't live up to your standards.

If you are someone who works out for a better health **AND** contributes to the society **AND** has good communication skills **AND** participates in family functions **AND** has a stable job which makes you happy **AND** you have a nourishing company around you **AND** you know how to take care of your emotions during difficult times **AND** all the rest of good jazz, 

**Don't match with that girl who puts zero information about herself on the app other than 2 hot photos which clearly is a sign of overcompensating for a lack of personality.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I went on date with a girl who is very hot and during the date we showed each other our Bumble profiles. She had more than 10k likes and I had only one like. Yet, at the end of the date she was like I wished I matched with more people like you.  But again, my bad, she was so single-dimensional  and all she cared about was her looks and Instagram.  I didn't call her and neither did she, but I had so much takeaway from that experience that now I can safely assure myself is that dating app metrics are not a true reflection of myself in any way.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164883,public,self,Don't be desperate to date,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tqsduh/dont_be_desperate_to_date/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I got there and things were going well. We were dancing and kissing and it looked like it was going to be a great night ahead.. Then it just got really weird. 

I went to the bathroom and came back and i saw this guy next to her trying to kiss her. She told me that's her gay friend don't worry about him he's just messing around. And then eventually they did kiss and people were asking me if that was my girl i said no were not exclusive and it was making me look bad. The two started making out more and more raunchily and it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable. A lot of people were asking me about the situation i just said we are not exclusive and that's her gay friend. 

""he doesn't look gay to me...."" 

There was this group of girls next to me pleading me to leave. Literally begging me ""you need to block her and run i know you're better than this. That guy is straight tonight. You need to leave"" 

I had enough and i told the girl ""hey that was kinda weird i gotta go"" 

""ohhh I'm sorry, I'm just really open, i like everyone"" 

""yeah... Uhmm.. We can talk later just DM me in IG""

I left that gay club a bit traumatized and i proceeded to block the girl. She made me so uncomfortable. 

I called one of my older friends that had a partying phase and he said what really happened was he was trying to bait you and see what you're down to do.. Cuz you are a straight guy in a gay bar. He said what i should've done was as soon as i saw her kiss another guy i should've left. But i was tryna rationalize it in my head by saying oh that's her gay friend and we are not exclusive. 

""look don't be so hard on yourself, there's no reason for you to ever be there. You didn't know any better. Everything was going well until it all fell apart"" 

She was making out with other guys in front of me. I feel ashamed for letting people disrespect me and embarrassed that i didn't enforce that boundary.....just wondering what you guys thoughts are.

I'm also very sociable and charismatic IRL. I feel like I can't or am not able to showcase this with OLD.

i have never used filters/ anything like that on any of my pictures and i don’t try to purposely hide anything about my weight or anything like that! i do however always think i’m ugly so i try to get better lighting and a slightly better angle. i have sent funnier pics from like a bad angle but again it was with decent lighting so i think it makes me look a lot better than i actually do, almost pretty sometimes. 

i am very afraid that i am accidentally catfishing. like maybe i don’t actually look like myself even when i’m not trying to get a good pic with good lighting? when i see the other pics people take of me (like let’s say a family get together) i can see similarities but my nose looks a lot uglier from different angles and obviously it’s me but i just am so afraid of meeting up with this chick and she is expecting someone who looks like my face with perfect lighting all the time. i know i did this to myself, but it’s hard to send a pic to someone if you don’t like it yourself, and im just now becoming aware that i might have been catfishing? 

i guess i am just looking for opinions on if this is catfishing/ what i can do about it because i’m so anxious and it wasn’t my intention to ever mislead someone.

His reasons for breaking up were that he's gonna move and figure himself out, that he doesn't feel ready for a serious/longterm relationship and that he's feeling overwhelmed academically and that he needs his freedom. He literally cried when I told him I can't be friends with him, just because he didn't want to lose me
and I've made that VERY clear. Since then, I started not to contact him. Basically, I was working on getting over him. Long story short, I saw him today to give me my stuff
back. He was in a hurry, since he just drove 10+ hours back from his trip. When he saw me, he came up to me quickly, smiling over both ears, saying I'm looking good
and gave me a hug. I apologized to him about how things went down and wishing him the best. He cuts me off and hugs me, saying it's all good multiple times in a reassuring tone. He asked me about my life, how things
are going which actually surprised me, since we are literally broken up. He hugged me again, and before he could reach the door of the lobby, he said ""see ya later"" and I said ""see you later?"" to which he acted kind of
surprised. He was still smiling, but visibly nervous (the entire time, only saw him that nervous once when we got together). He was stuttering and saying that's just a saying, before saying goodbye and leaving. I have no idea what happened. I am glad I didn't get emotional during this conversation, but I swear his cheeks and eyes were turning red (I could've imagined things tbh). Of course, I
still wish we would get back together, what do you think? I am still working on getting over him and focusing on myself which is going surprisingly well, but I wanted to

As a 43 year old male, living in one the most expensive places on Earth, Santa Cruz, California, I sadly do not currently have my own place. In fact I've never had my own place. I've either lived with a partner or with roommates.

I make pretty good money, about 90K. That works out to 4k a month after taxes/retirement.  Rent here in Santa Cruz for a studio or 1 bedroom apartment is about $2000 a month, and it's tough to find something for less than that.

I feel self conscious and shameful asking women out knowing that they'll soon find out I still have housemates, well into my 40's.
