We have been seeing each other at least once sometimes twice a week and text each other everyday usually. We have gone on a couple of weekend trips together and often times talk about each others lives and whatever happens during the days we don't meet up. We even have virtual dates where we play games or watch movies together. Her friends and family know about me, although I haven't had the opportunity to meet them she talks about me meeting them and I want her to meet my friends. so overall it sounds like things are going pretty good right?

Well maybe it's just me but about two weeks ago we had gone on a date and things were going well, and when i was driving her home i had told her that i was falling in love with her. I didn't even realize i had said it till after it came out and she responded with she knew i wanted to say it for a while. So when we pulled up to her house, we sat in the car and talked for a bit more. She basically asked me what i wanted from seeing her and i told her that i honestly enjoy being with her and talking to her and want to keep seeing her. And she honestly told me that she enjoys being with me but doesn't feel like she is in love with me. i told her that even though i said it i wasn't trying to pressure her into saying it or anything like that, but it had felt right to say it in that moment. And in that moment she brought up some concerns that she had.

I had been honest with her when we first started going out that i had come out of an emotionally abusive relationship about 6 months before meeting her. I had been going to therapy for it and had already been on several dates with other people before meeting her. She brought up the fact that she doesn't want to be just a rebound for me. I told her that it was never my intention, and that i really do want to get to really know her. She then brought up some other stuff that she says i do that makes her feel uncomfortable (which I'm not going to go into since it is pretty personal stuff). I apologized for the things i did that made her uncomfortable and let her know that it was never my intentions. She told me that with other guys she has dated they always start out nice and sweet but eventually things go down hill with them. I told her my concerns that I'm afraid one day I'll wake up and text her and see that I've been blocked or ghosted as it's just an issue that I've had before. She told me that she would never block me with out telling me first if she was going to.

Well after having our talk i got out of the car and walked her to her door. She gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek and i kissed her on the cheek as well. This was almost two weeks ago and we are still talking to each other but i feel like maybe something has changed. Before she used to text me in the morning sometimes when she would wake up before me but now I've had to initiate the conversation almost every time. I've tried asking her out and she tells me that she has been super busy with work and has to wait to get her schedule the week before. To be fair she does text me back after she gets off work even if i have to wait a couple hours since she can take forever to reply.

I want to take her out and tell her that i heard all the concerns she has about me, since I've been thinking seriously about what she told me. I want to talk with her about what we are in-person and show that I'm genuinely interested in her, but I don't know if maybe she is avoiding me or if she is just really busy. She hasn't ghosted me; she replies to my texts and still follows me on instagram. Is she losing interest in me? or is my anxiety and insecurity making me over thinking these things? I know I have an anxious attachment style, but I have been working hard to make sure that is doesn't affect this relationship with this girl. Any advice would be appreciated and I'll try to answer any questions as best as I can.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,840571,public,self,Is this girl losing interest in me or is my anxiety getting the better of me,0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0owft/is_this_girl_losing_interest_in_me_or_is_my/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,

Two of which are good female friends of mine and they were complaining that all of their conversations on OLD go nowhere. I looked at how they started convos and just “lol’d” and handed them back their phone. I’m sure this applies to a lot guys as well but since I don’t have any direct experiences messaging guys on OLD(I’m straight so when I was on OLD obviously I only talked to women) I’m going to direct this to the ladies. 

“Hi” and “Hey” as starters is going to get you nowhere. As I guy when I got these messages on OLD I would just unmatch. It shows you put no effort into either looking at my profile or nothing in my profile was interesting enough to comment on for you(which is fine but then obviously it’s not going to work out lol). I got this the most on Bumble when women obviously had to make the first move. Much less common on others. 

And then let’s say you get a response to “Hey” and a conversation does start. One word simple responses to questions without follow ups also shows no interest and will quickly kill the conversation.

I used think when I encountered this sort of thing that these women just weren’t interested. But hearing my friends complain about their OLD success and then seeing them do this exact thing it kind of makes me wonder. I feel like for guys there is so much emphasis to be charming and charismatic. Tons of dating advice on how to talk to women and keep a conversation going but you don’t really hear about that for women. For women it’s just… look pretty. Which is really sad for many reasons but as we date in our later 20’s/30’s that is way less important. And if you haven’t developed social and communicative skills it can really hurt your ability to create a connection with someone.

I had been in a relationship for quite some time and now it's more than a year that I'm single so I thought to give Tinder a shot to find not a hookup but a good date!


Basically I've been chatting with this really cute and fine french girl for almost a week. To my surprise we clicked right away, she told me that she really liked my sense of humor and was so interesed in my job that (surprisingly again) she was the one to ask me out on a date. Because of my work we couldn't meet right away but It all was going very smoothly, we exchanged numbers, photos, had some funny conversations and the lot. I work really long hours and I cannot use my phone very often so I didn't always promptly replied to her texts but every time I had the time to send her one she was immediately online to answer me, I took this as a positive sign of interest from her towards me. I had an overall good feeling about it, ""back into the dating business"" I thought to myself. 


For a couple of minutes we had a chat the morning of the day we were supposed to meet where we planned most of the details of the date but after that I didn't receive any reply from her for hours. I thought it was noting  but since the date's time was approaching and I didn't hear anything from her I tried to reach her to know if the date was still up and she said yes. Nothing to worry about, I thought! So I shaved, ironed my good shirt, took out the best watch I have and proudly went to the arranged place.
In the end I waited for more than an hour and then had a drink by myself. 


Later in the evening I texted her, no reply. Out of curiosity I did the same thing the day later too and still to today no answer. 


I whish she would've told me she didn't want to meet anymore or make an excuse... At least the waiter was nice enough to let me have the drink on the house.


I have to admit that I didn't expect to be stood up like that so I don't know if texting her again should be the right move... 
I keep thinking that if she wanted to ditch me the most reasonable thing to do was to tell me that.


What can I do?

TL;DR - I really clicked with a girl who said that really wanted to meet me until the day of our date when she stood me up without any reason. Tried to reach her, did not receive an answer.

It has been going absolutely AMAZING. We never run out of things to talk about, laugh 24/7, and the chemistry is definitely there for both of us.

Ideally, he would attend the school 2 hours away, but I don't want to push him because I want his decision to be his own &amp; what is best for him. If thats the case - I think we would be fine. However, if he chooses the schools farther away, he has expressed that he doesn't think he wants to do a LDR because of 1) time &amp; stresses of law school, 2) not being able to emotionally handle the distance, 3) not being able to ""give me what I deserve"".

Any help would honestly be very appreciated.

PS: She does have a crush and she kept talking about him all day yesterday and we got into an argument and that’s where she said most of that stuff.

I finished this professor's class several weeks ago and final grades have all been turned in.

I am very interested in getting to know him more. Aside from being attractive and very much my type, he has a great personality that clicks well with mine and we feel similarly about many topics. It's unusual for me to meet someone I really click with and when I do, I want to pursue it.

I am definitely not obsessed with him or in love or anything -- I just see him as an attractive and interesting person and want to see where it goes if the feeling is mutual. I don't feel uncomfortable with the situation at all -- I'm 24, have dated men in their late 30s and age isn't an issue, and am a graduating senior (more on that below). I'm not connected to the university post-graduation and am working in a different field. If we date, I would be fine with keeping our relationship discreet for professionalism.

My first question is, how should I approach this situation? The issue is I don't know what his personal stance is on dating ex-students. If he were strongly against it and had an issue with any suggestion of flirtation, that could be harmful to me or give me a reputation for flirting with professors.

So instead, I could just email that it was great to meet him and I'd like to say hello sometime when he's around campus. However, that would likely lead to a state of prolonged semi-professional conversations on campus where even if he *were* interested in me, he would not want to disturb a perceived mentorship relationship and would likely assume my interest was purely professional.

So, what is the best way to communicate my interest subtly, that gives him a chance to reciprocate if desired, but won't embarrass me if not?

Additionally: a propriety question. I graduated last week, but still have 2 summer classes left and technically finish in August. Neither class is taught by him, one is just research and one is in a totally different department. Technically the university bans relations between faculty and undergraduates. That said, morally speaking there would be no power differential as he is guaranteed to not teach me in the last 1.5 months or ever again. Personally speaking, I would much rather initiate this now, not in 2 months, while we are still fresh in each other's minds and before, well, someone else snaps one of us up. Additionally, if we start out just talking or ""dating"" in the sense of going places and eating food, that shouldn't violate the policy and it's not like we would be jumping in bed together right away anyway. Would it be okay to try to talk to him now, with the understanding if it *did* lead anywhere he might want to wait until August?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,840750,public,self,I'm (24F) interested in my (40M) former professor.... how can I subtly demonstrate interest without embarrassing myself?,0,[],0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0s8qr/im_24f_interested_in_my_40m_former_professor_how/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,

Senior in college. I had a long relationship from 2018-2020 that was pretty toxic. After this I’ve casually dated a few people, nothing serious.

Basically I have low expectations for what men can/should do for me. I don’t like being paid for or overly catered to. It could be that I’m afraid to commit or that I’ve had douche bags in the past. But how do I overcome this?

I don’t like gifts. I always prefer to go Dutch on dates and drinks. I just don’t like feeling vulnerable or like I owe the guy sex afterwards.

But I’m realizing that most women are more open to letting men do shit for them and put in the effort/time/money for them. Lots of guys have tried to give me so much effort but I’m realizing that I never really welcome it. How do I be more open to letting men impress me without being any less classy or independent?

secrets here.  If you want to get a date, tell people you are on the market for a serious relationship.

I ask guys all the time if they have ever told their friends, family, and especially co-workers know they are looking for a serious relationship.  Most guys hem and haw and finally say something like, ""Well, they know I am single.""

That is a huge mistake, because if you are a good guy and you let people you see every day you are on the market - so to speak - for a serious relationship people will come out of the wood with suggestions you meet sisters, cousins, aunts, mothers, and daughters.  This is how nearly everyone used to get married in the old days.

At least in the West arranged marriages largely died out by about 1600, but pre-vetted suitors certainly did not.  A brother had a friend at school or an uncle knew a family friend with a pretty daughter.  It was simple and natural and it worked.

Today it has largely died off in the United States and Europe.  Everyone has headphones in, no one joins clubs, goes to church, or knows their neighbors.  So, they go online looking for community.  That can be helpful at times.  I love Reddit and even my FB feed, but it is not particularly helpful for romance.

Real romance means meeting someone in real life.  It is just that simple, but today that is often a huge challenge.  And, if you never let whatever circle of friends you have you are looking for love it is almost impossible.

But if you get the word out at work, at the gym, and your coffee shop soon there is a very good chance someone will say, ""I would love for you to meet my (sister, daughter, or whoever).""  It often can be an amazing introduction to a woman you would never otherwise meet.

Now, we are on Reddit, so lets cover the depressing downsides, and there are some.  First, the people you know may not know any single women.  This not some nutty seduction advice.  It is real and honest.

If you don't get any feedback don't worry, but try to be even nicer than you already are to the older married women at work or wherever you meet them.  They are your very best sources for endorsements.  A girl might not listen to her brother or even her dad, but if her mom says you are an amazing catch the ball is in your court.

The next thing guys worry about is that if they don't have any chemistry with the woman they have been encouraged to meet the co-worker or friend will be upset.  No, not if you are an old school gentleman and have been polite.

If things don't work out do NOT say anything negative about the woman after your first date to ANYONE (things have a way of getting around) be complimentary and move on.   If things start to develop move a little more slowly than normal - and always be polite to the woman.  (This really should always be the case.)  But remember, the person that endorsed you thought you were great and as long as you are kind, compassionate, and nice their opinion is not going to change.

This is old school traditional dating, but it also comes with a built in support network most modern relationships don't have.  If you screw up and say something dumb and hurtful the person that set the two of you up can probably help patch things up if you both want it.  And in any relationship, there will be challenges.

Also, do NOT - and I mean NOT - do this if you are not serious about finding a relationship.  This is a very bad hook-up strategy, because it can come back to bite you.

But if you are seriously looking for a serious relationship tell everyone you know.  Let them know you are sick of Tinder and tired of Match.  You will find everyone is a matchmaker.

Let them help you.  It worked for the first 300,000 years of human life and it can work for you.

I’ve “talked” to multiple guys and then let my anxiety get the best of me and pushed them away, no matter how strongly I felt about them. One actually took me a year to get over—even though it was completely my own fault. I can be head over heels for a guy and still manage to run away from them because I’m so nervous to just go on a simple date. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

And for a while I joked, “I give up,” but deep down I knew I’d work something out in the future.

But now I feel like I have completely, genuinely lost hope. I can’t even put into words how hopeless I feel. A cute guy will catch my eye in public and I immediately get sad and discouraged, just somehow *knowing* I’m not enough for him, so what’s the point of even allowing myself to crush on him? And when I’m out with friends, they always get hit on, and I’m just awkwardly standing in the back, completely invisible.

I’m not the most beautiful person in the world, but I know I’m not just disgustingly ugly. I’m somewhat shy, but I can hold a conversation with no problem. I just feel invisible. It’s like I’m just completely unapproachable to every guy. I just feel like a non-option.

I’ve started to think about what my life might be like if I never manage to have a relationship. And this sucks because I’ve always been the type of girl who dreams of starting a family as soon as I can, nothing makes me more excited for life than my fantasies of my future husband holding our babies. These imaginary scenarios have literally saved my life in my darkest times, and now I’m at a point where I’m hopeless that they’ll ever even come true. For so long I told myself, “I don’t need a man,” and “I’m just going to learn to love myself.” But I’m done. I spent years learning to love myself. I spent years learning how to appreciate the single life. But that can only go on for so long before you start feeling completely isolated and touch-starved.

So I’ve been seeing a girl for about 2.5 months now. The first month and a half we texted and had video chats because of distance, the pandemic, and me being busy with work. Once I had free time I started to go and see her in person.

Just last week she came to my house for the first time for 3 days and we had an amazing time. I took her out, cooked for her, went out of my way to get her favourite snacks, and tried my best to make her feel comfortable. A lot of laughing, and we ended up having sex too.

I noticed that when she left she started communicating less and I could tell something was off. So I gave her a couple of days and she still wasn’t talking like her usual self. So today I asked her if everything was okay and that she has been noticeably quieter since she left my place. She responded with “Idk I’ve just been thinking you know exactly what you want and I have no idea what I want”. I found that that was a pretty weird thing for her to say since I’ve just been going with the flow. I haven’t brought up being exclusive, nor have I been trying to force a label on what we are. So I asked her if she enjoys spending time with me, to which she replied that she does, but just doesn’t know.

After that I said that I enjoy spending time with her too, so we should just keep doing the same thing and enjoy each other's presence. I said we don’t need to rush and think about labels and stuff like that. Again, she responded with “I just don’t know”. At that point, I checked snapchat and saw she was spending some time with friends on her day off. So I told her that we don’t need to have this conversation right now and to take some time and enjoy her day with friends. I said we can talk about this another time, to which she said “okay okay”.

I plan on giving her space and letting her initiate again when she’s ready. So what’s the verdict here?

I'll give you an example.

I like when people I date are consistent and intentional in their pursuit of me; it helps to build trust, connection, and attraction. It's hard for me to stay open, vulnerable, and interested when someone comes and goes without warning and without follow-through.

When they suddenly change patterns from texting often, calling when they say they will, and not following through on / blowing off a date they asked me out on, I usually feel it's time to move on - I have learned the hard way that if a someone (specifically here a man) stops working to make you feel special, it's probably because you're not (to him I mean). I never confront them to ask what happened, I never write a snarky reply to anything they send me thereafter, and I am always friendly and passive when I see them in person.

I have noticed in those times when I do let someone go without a fight, they may come back, but in a lesser way, and always with a chip on their shoulder as if I was the one who ruined things by 'having expectations'. If they ask for something they haven't earned (like a late night meet-up, especially where I have to go to them) and I in some form or another say 'no thanks, I'm good', or especially after I point out to them the inconsistency if they challenge me on it, they become indignant and sour and write me off immediately. If I ever have given in when they've stopped being consistent and showing up for me, they again will think I have ruined things by being 'too easy,' (not with sex necessarily, but even with my time and affection), they will de-value me and use me for as long as I let them.

Is it wrong to hold someone you're dating to the things he says and suggests? Is it not okay to only stay interested and invested in someone who shows up for me, who doesn't leave me guessing and hanging, who will do what they say they will do, who makes me feel special, who doesn't play games with my heart?

I always thought a standard was something like believing we were going to go on a date on Friday because they said to me they wanted to take me out on a date on Friday, and then feeling disappointed and wary of they for not communicating with me about it or making it happen, which makes me question their genuineness. And I thought expectations were more like anticipating that the date that they said they were going to take me on is the fanciest restaurant in town and that from every date for now on they will have to spend that kind of money on me every time we see each other.

So, what do you guys think? What am I allowed to 'expect' from someone I am dating, and how should I feel about inconsistency and indignation?

He’s 5”5 and a little overweight, he’s not ugly at all - personally I’d rate his face 7/10 and his personality 10/10 truly one of the best people I’ve ever met.

In the beginning it was just casual (in my mind), and then when lockdown lifted I was surprised that he started to plan real dates. Intrigued, I went along on them and a little romance evolved. I met his friends a few times, we hung out a lot on real dates, he never kept me wondering, I always knew when I was gonna see him. It felt different and natural, like it could actually be heading somewhere.

Fast forward to now, in the last month things have changed. I noticed that we were still texting a lot (not LOADS but at least 1-2x a day, just checking in, nothing intense). If there was a gap, he or I would initiate some more convo. But then I realised we were just talking and not making real plans, which I found frustrating. I talked to him about it and he suggested we meet up in person and talk it through. So we did, and he said he was sorry,  wasn't doing it on purpose, and he would make more plans. Some things he did say that I didn't pay attention to at the time but now I am: he was hurt last year and so told himself he should be single this summer, he doesn't know/can't guarantee where we'll lead, he said he was concerned I'd be upset because he has a lot of stag dos and weddings so he might not always be able to make plans. We made one set of plans that day, and since then those plans have been and gone, he hasn't sorted anything else.

Since then, he has still sent me a message or two per day. I asked if he wanted to play tennis because he said he wanted to, but when I ask he says he's visiting home for the week (this week). He never suggested another day etc. Basically I'm fed up and I think I'm going to call it a day with him when he gets back. He clearly isn't that interested and I want something more with someone that's actually going somewhere.

What's annoyed me is that, I have stopped messaging him first while he's at his parents, because I feel like the spark has gone and he's stopped bothering with me. So he messages me asking about stuff today, after we don't speak for 2 days. I reply nicely and also add 'well if you want to make plans when you're back, let me know'. He replies to ALL of the messages apart from that one, essentially ignoring it.

Why is he bothering to text me at all if I've clearly given up and so has he? why text me if you don't wan't to ever make plans and you're always too busy with something.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,841129,public,self,I think this guy is giving me the run around but I don't understand why he keeps messaging me,0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0ykdy/i_think_this_guy_is_giving_me_the_run_around_but/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,
