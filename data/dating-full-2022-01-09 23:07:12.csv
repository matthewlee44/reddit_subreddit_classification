Been dating around since early May. Most of the time, people I've met have been pleasant and easy to get along with but I don't see long term potential with them. There have been a few times where I've felt like my boundaries were being tested or I was being treated badly by someone I was seeing. Overall I think it's been a good experience, but I feel really tired of it. I don't feel excited to go on dates and I'm feeling honestly really burned out from meeting new people. I feel like I keep getting my hopes up then being disappointed in some way. I took a break for about a month and a half and met up with someone last week and he was great, but he said he didn't feel chemistry. While I completely get it that definitely hit my self esteem and made me even more reluctant to go on more dates.

I'm kind of at a point right now where I would like to be in a relationship and obviously that's not possible without dating.

I've known her for almost 1.5 years now but, because of Covid, and because of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and, even though I like her, I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**, however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes another guy outside our class. Of course I respect her choices, but I know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her. We see each other almost every day, if not more. I don't really know what to do.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like her; **big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was going, and now I feel so hollow.**

Also, the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about relationships. In fact, I don't think I have many friends left, other than her.

She probably doesn't know her friend told me; although I've seen some signs, I don't know if she likes me too. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more people at the same time.

What am I supposed to do? 

* Should I let go everything and pretty much start developing a new mindset that distinguishes friendship from relationship, well knowing I will have to spend a lot of time with her, while also struggling to pass all my classes? 
* Should I do nothing and hope things get better?

There she said my friends and I were too much (talking about how when we were drunk we tried ti get her to drink with us). She then expressed her feelings about that trip and said “we can be friends. I don’t hate you because you saw today that we can have a normal conversation.”

She did do that, but when we see each other during the day at work, it’s always that way. She mentioned a lot during that first vent text, but now she seems distant. We don’t have any real conversation anymore.

“You said let’s just be honest with each other.  Nothing is what it was like before between us. I would never want to pressure anyone into anything. That’s not me. I like when people say it as it is. Which is why I liked you. You were real with everything, but I ruined it with the one night on the trip. I honestly wish you wouldn’t judge me based on that night, however, it happened and it is what it is. It’s not something that can be replaced or forgotten.
…
If we are going to be friends then I would actually like to be friends. Not the normal “let’s be friends” where we keep something at heart, but let’s actually forget the past and move on. And if you don’t want to continue being friends then I understand. And don’t think because you don’t want to be friends that I still won’t be there for you..one thing I will always do is hope that everything turns out the best for someone. Talking to me or not.

I (24F) moved to a new city recently and downloaded Hinge, met a few guys but ultimately kept seeing this guy (26M) let’s call him Daniel. 

I started seeing Daniel around October so it’s been roughly 3 months. He and I started off very very casually, to be honest I was initially just looking for my sexual desires to be fulfilled. One night, he drove (he’s like 40 minutes away from me) to come see me and we had some amazing sex. He was a bit upset I tried kicking him out after sex, and we talked that night and he said just having sex gets old so he wants more than that - and if it becomes serious, then it does. So we had both agreed to casually date. 

We worked around our weird schedules with my work involving travel and managed to keep seeing each other, except I noticed in the last month or so, he’s texting me more frequently, he’s much more physically affectionate (prior he refrained from this) like handholding, forehead+cheek kisses, just real intimate stuff. We now engage in PDA when we go out in public together. 

Awhile back I asked if he was sleeping with anyone else (mainly out of STD/STI awareness) and he said he isn’t! We didn’t have much more discussion on that and left it there. Over lunch the other day he had made a lot of jokes about my “side pieces” like I was seeing other people, to which I responded “do you really think that I’m seeing other dudes??” lol. He was like oh I’m just joking around, etc. I felt like that was maybe a test to see how I’d respond on that subject.

I don't know with certainty if she likes me but I think at least she has some interest in me. And if she doesn't like me it's totally fine, not everyone it's gonna like me.



For me all of this it's a success because I had to go out of my way at first to speak with her and to invite her to do something together, and I never did that before with another girl.

Might be a long one so bear with me, and thank you in advance if you do.

Context upfront: I'm 23, just got out of a very strenuous 5 year relationship, and am trying my hardest to get back into the dating game, to varying degrees of success mostly boiling down to me just meeting a few good people online. Dating apps have been of no help, Tinder is a waste of time &amp; attention, Hinge fairs a little better. 

Here's where my little tale begins. This last Wednesday I went out for lunch with a coworker &amp; a good friend of mine. Mexican food, ate our fill and got buzzed at 3 in the afternoon. We both walked down to a Bath &amp; Body Works, because I needed to get refills for that little car scent thing they have. I picked one I liked up and made my way to the register. This girl, pink hair in twintails, and a stuffed animal pinned to her uniform. She was very cute &amp; according to my friend, deliberately made a push to come ring us out. She said that they were running a sale, 3 for $10, so I went and picked up 2 more. She replied to that with ""you have good taste"" or something similar. She had this quirky personality about her, from the way she spoke &amp; how animated she was while she spoke.

Now to the issue. I want to ask her out. I haven't asked anyone out in, well, 5 years. I haven't shown or have been shown interest by anyone during that time, so I'm out of the game (not that I knew how to play it to begin with, relationships have always happened out of luck with me). I believe that there was some level of interest she had in me, even if it was minor interest at best. I think the way to do it would be to just go back there, and if I see her, just do the deed. I don't have much to lose, so if I get rejected, there's no skin off my back. I just don't know, though. I'm worried that I'll mess up &amp; ruin what little hope there is for something here. Anything would be appreciated, be it help, advice, or questions that I could answer to clear stuff up, because I know that I've probably missed something while writing this lengthy post out. If you made it this far, thank you for reading.

I took it personally and everyone I went to about the cases said the same thing. “They’re not interested, move on”

Fast forward some time later…

I found out one guy stood me up because he was car-less after totaling his months prior and too broke to take me where I wanted to go that night. It’s all his fault for how he handled it, but I really took it personally. “Some other woman prettier and more interesting called him and he wanted to do that instead.” NOPE.

Another had ghosted me because he spent all the funds he had left fixing his vehicle and some house repairs and was waiting tables somewhere to try and make every dollar he could, picking up any shift he could, and I think took to doing something else he didn’t want me to know about. He didn’t have the time to see me On weekends or evenings when I was off of work and it looked like he just had no time for me. He knew he was disappointing me so he’d just stop responding. Go home and sleep and just say F it. I have a corporate job and if I knew what he was doing I MIGHT thing less of him and cut him off. (His logic)

I’m leaving out a couple of other situations that are too specific and I can’t elaborate here.

Point is, these men liked me and we happened to meet by chance but the timing was really bad for them. They didn’t feel like themselves and weren’t ready to open up to me about insecurities and who would be at that stage.

I’m just here to say that if you KNOW DAMN WELL you felt a connection with someone and that it was mutual, their reasons for falling back may truly not be about you but about themselves instead. 

Dating isn’t just hard for those who want love and get left, but there are men and women out here who want to give you that but are held back by insecurities and who knows what else. 

Ghosting is NEVER okay. Standing someone up is NEVER okay. But reasons people do this is because of how they’ve been treated when they’ve communicated. — Let’s start welcoming people to speak to us about what’s going on instead of reacting to being rejected or whatever excuses they give us.

The one thing that has changed is that the last time I saw him, I asked if he was seeing other people and he said no and I said that’s nice and that I’m not either, and I’m glad we can both focus on one person at the same time going forward. And we were on the same page about everything. Then this past week I haven’t seen him because I went on a work trip, but I’ve noticed there’s been a major change in our texts since we’ve had that conversation. Yesterday he took hours to reply all day, and didn’t even text me at all after 4 PM and didn’t reply to my last text until the morning. 

And then today, he’s been replying sparsely, but hasn’t been reciprocating my flirty texts saying I want to cuddle or that I can’t wait to see him or things like that. He’ll heart them, but that’s about it. That’s not the same thing though, right? 

I guess they’re only reason I’m worried is because last week and a couple weeks before he was texting me nonstop all day long, sending me lovey-dovey things talking about the future and showering me with compliments. The only thing that’s changed is that we had that conversation, and then I went away. But he was on the same page with me about everything and I even told him that if this was a casual thing that’s fine but to let me know and he said “no no no, I like you and I wanna get to know you better. And I like where this is going.” So I thought all was fine. His texts just don’t match up and there’s such a shift and it’s scaring me. It doesn’t feel good to tell someone that you miss them and would love to cuddle with them right now and then they just heart the message and ask what you’re up to… Am I over thinking this?

Nearly after 3 months after breakup I accidentally matched with a guy who is an acquaintance of my ex, they studied together. Never been friends, but used to be a part of his social circle, they both would attend events with other people and such thing. 

We went on several dates with the guy, it went pretty well ( getting to know each other in all ways). On the third date we slept with each other, he behaved very much romantically and like a gentleman after but then didn’t message me for 3 days. I didn’t understand whether he wasn’t interested anymore or wanted a step from me. I messaged hi, he replied right away and we continued communication. He had a trip booked to a foreign country, went there, still was chatting me from everywhere. Was very cute, romantic and kinda couple ish communication. 

He came back from the trip, drove far to see me, we had a good date that also ended up with intimacy. In the morning I had work, he had too so he ordered me a very high class taxi (some fancy car), made sure I got safe home. After it the next day he messaged me in the evening saying that he was thinking about picking me up but was too tired after training.
I said it’s totally cool and we didn’t have anything planned anyways. That was the end of a dialogue. Next day he still did not  invite me anywhere. (Even though previously he mentioned wanting to watch movies). And weekend is the best time for me,Otherwise I have a very busy job. And I didn’t message either.

If a man has had no likes or relationship experience he is tossed out like last weeks garbage and is considered a ""loser."" Women base their interests on the perspective of other woman. Fine, I can cope with this.

Now for my predicmanet.

I'm a 28 year old formerly overweight man who has never had a relationship before. Sure I've messed around with a few one night stands, but never had a girlfriend. I think alot of this has to do with my perception of self as well as my external image.

Being fat.

Now that I've lost the weight and am edging toward my thirties with no ""true experience"" to discuss, I'm wondering four things.

1. How true is the preselection bias/game?

2. How much of a red flag is it to have never been in a relationship?

3. Based on my disposition, am I utterly fucked or am I liable to face alot of rejection because of this?

4. Should I just lie and just roll with the ""fake it till you make it"" even if I have to invent a fabricated story just so I can avoid pre-selection bias?

I feel really weird about it because I'm not sure if it's appropriate for me to do anything about it.

She comes in once a week for a half hour. When each lesson begins we have a quick conversation for a few minutes but it's just the typical ""hey, how is it going,"" or ""anything new in your life?"" Type of conversations. I do kind of crack a joke or try to extend the conversations a little bit but beyond that they don't go very far. This girl is coming to these lessons to have me help her get better at guitar, she's not there to hang out with me so it's hard to try to flirt with her and get to know her better.

It's made me consider asking her out. I have no earthly idea what she thinks of me and if she would say yes. I think either way it would mean that she would probably be stopping lessons with me. Cause here's all the possible scenarios

She says yes, date goes well, we continue going out, it'd be weird to give lessons to someone I'm dating.

She says yes, date doesn't go well, lessons are awkward now

She says no, now I'm teaching someone who rejected me, not fun

So it's probably safe to say she would stop lessons with me and I feel bad about that a little bit because that's what she initially came to me for.

So what should I do? Do I just leave it be? Do I flirt with her a little more in lessons to try to get her to say yes to a date or is that inappropriate? Do I even ask her out at all?

Or should I just wait until she stops lessons all on her own and then ask her? I have no idea when or if that could happen though, could be months.

Let’s call him ‘R’. Like it was so damn obvious. But the thing is I knew right from the start I wasn’t physically attracted to him. 

So in the past year we get quite close as friends. If he was studying in the library and I asked him to hang out, my friends would legit see him pack his things as quickly as he could to get to me. Also his friends have told me multiple times that he fancies me. I could also sense it over the past year in all our conversations. Mind you, all this time I guess I lead him on cause I never pushed him away. So maybe he always thought he had a chance??? I don’t know. 

So a few weeks ago, there was an event in uni and my friends and I all got drunk… including him. We all then decided to get back to college, but then ‘R’ gets a taxi and he takes me with him. We talked about so many thing during the 30min ride and it was such a good time. He asked me about my type, and even personal questions like “what’s something about you that no one else knows about?”. Like it was so deep and I felt that maybe I do like him. We end up going to his place and he played the guitar of a song I knew in the piano, and we joked around. Then we ended up kissing for so long, and he wanted to have sex but I told him I didn’t then… and he respected it. 

So, I stayed the night and the next day we were fine and i didn’t feel awkward. He followed up with a text asking how I was (from the hangover) etc. The day after this happened up till a few weeks, I could honestly say I didn’t like him like that and felt shit that I made a move on a close friend (didn’t want to sabotage our friendship). So we didn’t bring up about what happened, and basically acted like it never happened. But then a few weeks pass, and everytime I see him I realise I like him more…. Till one day I knew he grew on me and I actually do like him. Maybe it was the distance, I don’t know. So one day I told him we need to talk and I confessed that I I like him, but he didn’t give a definite reply if it was mutual (which hurt). We went for a night drive the same night and had such a good time getting to know eachother. He even said we don’t know much about eachother so I get why he couldn’t verbally reciprocate, but since then he’s been sort of distant. I don’t know if he was after the chase. But thoughts???

He left town to go back to the town where him &amp; his ex use to live. I’m not sure the whole story of what’s going on yet (I didn’t have time to see him before he left town) but apparently, he’s going to pick up the cat both of them use to have. 

Him and I are not a couple &amp; are not seriously dating, but the thing is I’m already starting to feel a type of way about him going back to see his ex. The main reason for him going there is to get the cat but I can’t help but wonder if they’re also going to sleep together. 

I’m a little frustrated with myself because I feel like this is something I shouldn’t care about since we’re not seriously dating. We both should be able to do whatever we want since we aren’t exclusive or had that type of intention or discussion. 

When he returns to town part of me feels the urge to ask him if they slept together but then it’s also none of my business and I also partially don’t even want to know because I will likely feel a little hurt &amp; also may feel less of a desire to sleep with him. I’d feel a little icky &amp; a little bad about myself to sleep with someone who just slept with their ex days prior.

He’s excited about the cat &amp; said he looks forward to me meeting it. His trip is several days which is a bit questionable… it makes me think he is using that time to either 1. Reconnect with his ex, 2. See other people, or 3. Just simply make use of out the money spent to travel there &amp; treat it as a mini vacation. \*Sigh\*… I feel like more than likely they will sleep together and who knows, they may end up getting back together.

Is it possible for someone to see their ex and not want to sleep with them? I can say not all my exs have been someone I wanted to sleep with again after the breakup. 

Perhaps this means I am starting to catch feelings? But I DO NOT want to feel jealous or even feel that I don’t want him sleeping with other people but that’s simply how I do feel. 

What should I do when he returns without seeming like a jealous person? Lol  

Ask him about it directly, or maybe just how his trip was and see how much he’s willing to share, or just let it be &amp; suppress the urge to want to ask and try to pick up where the two of us left off without bringing his ex into it?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1151011,public,self,Should I ask him if he slept with her?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0c4qz/should_i_ask_him_if_he_slept_with_her/,no_ads,0,,,

Background: mid 20s, cis-male, not religious, white, college degree, employed

Yesterday I was on a hinge date that I thought was OK, but she hasn’t texted me since we exchanged numbers at the end of the date. I don’t think I’m worried about it not working out with her going forward as I am worried about both feeling rejected and losing her as a connection of any kind. 

We were very sweet to each other on our first date. She revealed she thought I was cute, which was brave of her to say and I was flattered. I worked up the courage to ask to kiss her goodbye while I waited with her for her bus, which she allowed. I loved our one kiss and it made me super happy. 

I’m a romantic type. I felt connected by our kiss, and I hold very special places in my heart for those that share a kiss with me. 

So now that I’m bracing for rejection, I’m just wondering how I can answer these questions in my heart about why I feel so romantic? Desperate? Hopeless? Why I am the way am?
