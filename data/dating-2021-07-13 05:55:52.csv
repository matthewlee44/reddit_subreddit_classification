2,ojda38,1626174235,Girls..what would you want to hear to know I'm serious? I want to get a yes or a no.,"I dated this girl about 2 years ago and we split because I moved away for a job. Now that I'm back, I want to be with her again. I don't want to call her because that would probably feel super random for her since it's been 2 years. So, I just occasionally reply to a story she posts on Instagram like ""miss ya"" "" or something dumb like ""you're hot, let's hang out"". Nothing of substance, just dumb stuff that doesn't lead to an actual conversation.

She may have no interest in ever getting back with me..and that's fine..but I am also 100% sure she has no idea how I feel. I just want to let her know how I feel so I can stop thinking about it..if she's not interested, fair enough. At least I'll know I told her how I felt and I won't have any regrets. It's going to come out of nowhere for her so I don't want to over-do it. I just don't know how to transition from the random, couple times a month silly message to an actual serious message.

4,ojdmbx,1626175666,[27M] sharing some thoughts about dating and (casual?) sex after a LTR and COVID,"Looking to give back some positivity to this sub. Long post.

TLDR: Had only one partner for 8 years, got cheated on, covid happened, 1.5 years later first tinder date, first casual sex, was bad at first but then fun and eye opening 

Some background:  I'm a bicurious demi, have been bordering on asexual for a long time. To say I wasn't ever big on porn and masturbation as a teen is an understatement, and that certainly played a role in my development.

Anyway, I got into a relationship with my HS sweetheart at 17. We grew together, stayed together, had various phases, moved in together and eventually grew apart, she cheated on me and we split badly.

I learned a lot in the following 1.5 years of covid restrictions and two half assed situationships with friends.
I began noticing how many insecure, codependent and desperate tendencies I had been left with, and for how depressing and painful those times were, they were eye opening and somewhat regenerating. 

I finally started questioning my prejudice about friendships supposedly leading to better relationships, and other prejudices I didn't realize I had against dating apps, and, god forbid, *casual sex*.  

I didn't just want to ""get laid"" for the sake of it as I can please myself quite satisfyingly in single player, I just wanted new experiences with new people without the added emotional burden and frustration which I had had enough of.  

So I finally got on Tinder and landed some matches, one of which clicked more than the others circa a month ago. 
This girl is not only my type, she's much more experienced than me, more extroverted and slightly intimidating. 

Intimacy starts happening fast, and shit I almost feel like a virgin all over again.  

We cross the threshold on the 3rd date, and it's my first time after 1.5 years. It's not a good time. I feel detached from all of it, which is sort of what I was looking for, but also slow, awkward and *too fucking gentle*. Textbook demisexual, right?

It seemed like we just weren't sexually compatible and I was ready for her to call it quits but she was way more understanding and non judgemental than I thought, despite her experience and overall persona. 

That's where I realized that, as obvious as it sounds, *feelings and depth can be found in casual sex*. Yes, even through dating apps. No, they don't have to take over the situation. Yes, people can give you a second chance even if they have other options. 

We met again yesterday as I really wanted to please her and find out what she wanted to do to me. I got out of my head, had fun, gave head, she came.  

The awkwardness came back when she got to my D then she just lost the drive halfway through. Despite the will to keep the mood light and fun, this fucked with our heads a bit and we just said goodbye shortly after.  

Don't know if I will be seeing her again but honestly? I would have cared much more one year or even six months ago. I would have texted, chased, felt insecure AF, jealous about other people she's seeing, I would have questioned my sexuality and sabotaged my self esteem. 

Instead, I've realized I'm learning not to read too much into people's actions, their words, or even my own thoughts.  

Your partners have feelings and insecurities too even if they have a higher ""body count"", if they have never been romantically involved, if they have kinks you don't see yourself into that they fulfill with other people.

If they are in bed with you, they probably like you.  

Be open to change while keeping some distance. Be into it, get out of your head, but don't ever try to get into someone else's. Connection and communication can and should happen even without feelings, or at least before them.  

For anyone who could be in a similar situation, take the leap. Worst that can happen, provided you're both decent humans, is you will have a new experience under your belt.

I hope this can help someone. Thanks for reading!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojdmbx/27m_sharing_some_thoughts_about_dating_and_casual/
5,ojdms1,1626175719,Rejection I can have but I'm not allowed relationships! How may I change that and not have it so people only like hurting me? (~ 26 )," 

I guess if anything were to be what's bad it'd be me, considering what people, life, experiences and whatnot have told me.

I'll tell myself it some more just so it sinks in well though.

Basically this post is some/all of my experiences so far, and I was wondering how I could have it so women prefer knowing me, not hurting me. I don't know how to have it be that way, I'm probably just not the type.

Anyways...

This first girl was very attractive, honestly one of the people I've been most attracted to. I wasn't exactly certain, but she declared her interest in me so that I wouldn't worry. which was pretty nice.

What wasn't so nice was how the day before my birthday she abruptly starts talking to me, sends me some pictures, and before I can even respond and as I get ready to look nice for a picture for her she says that she doesn't like the vibe between us and that we have nothing in common. (I'm wondering how a person can decide that when they offer none of their interests or likes, personally, but oh well)

So be that I guess.

\----

This second one is a bit more fun; for you all maybe. A bit after that first woman I start talking to another, and this person was quite a bit more forward than. Advances were made by her, and I reciprocated.

Plans were made to actually get together, and we traded intimate photos in addition to words and a few others things. We spoke and interacted so much, I don't think I've spent as much time on anyone within a day.

However, as with the last, a day came and all came to ruin again. Turns out she was still in love with another and didn't actually like me at all.

In fact, she said everything was only because she was bored.

...So be that too I guess...

\----

This final one... sucks. Let's just say that about it. (There were three parts/strings to it)

So a bit after that second girl I start speaking to another, not for long I'll admit, but it's about the closest I've been to a proper relationship. Last night we made plans to hang out for a portion of today. whihc honestly gave me sincere happiness, I've been in a city for quite a few years and haven't been able to make any friends or anything. So I guess it gave me some hope, you know?

However, here comes the first of those stings I was talking about; I wasn't the only perosn she invited over that day. She actually had another person over at her place for the morning. which I can't say made me feel the greatest.

How ever, supposedly this guy was so creepy that it made her not want to meet me today. This was the second sting, and it was understandable I'll give it that, I don't hold the ""not wanting to meet"" against her, the reason is sound. (I will say thought that I'm not appreciative of another's actions ruining plans of mine)

So Instead of meeting we just text for a good portion of the day.

But then comes the third and final sting, she spoke about still being interest in some person in a different town and that she wants to date them, not I.

...

...

***Sigh***

So be this too....

\---

TL;DR

Clearly women only like hurting me instead of liking me, how can I make that change? (My Mother's Mother liked hurting me too, intimately once upon a time)

&amp;Where is the wrong I'm doing? I can see the wrong others are, but not I. Could it be because I do none?

(Side wonder) I'm not the only one who missed when a rejection was when you got a ""No"" or ""Why would I"" when you asked if people liked you or wanted anything to do with you.

Aren't these one's games? they make me miss my first rejection, didn't hurt as much as these...

(Update)

Here's more following experiences, shortened.

You know that one girl who didn't want anyhting to do with me anymore because of that creep? (supposedly?) well I tried again with her considering that there was the want to meet up once.

However, now, all of a sudden, she's moving away and doesn't want anyhting to do with me at all now. &amp; She likes to say this bullshit about Tinder not letting her delete it lol...

Oh well, anyways...

This next one's simple. some girl I was speaking with basically said that she liked me enough where she wanted to speak more than just texting.

...this was some weeks ago though and she hasn't said anyhting since. \^\_\^

Fun.... this is what this is not, right?

\---

Now, my life's made me miss out on enough already. Being denied Sisters, my Mother, a Father and given only a life with being bodily-assailed as a kid and one as a inadequately sized smaller dude that's socially and mentally slower could've been quite better, I can see a few way where it would've went great.

I can't have that though, so how do I have a life that actually has women liking me, at all? I hear you kind of have to go through rejection (if you're unlucky) but I figured you'd eventually get a date or something at some point with the effort? When does that happen?

Honestly, at this rate, it looks like I may one day have someone I'm ""with""... but they'd likely cheat before even doing anything with me. :) (Is this all meant to make me see good or be positive? lol...)

Those people who are never rejected and are only ever asked out have me jealous right now; it's likely nice.

A bit nicer than being rejected by everyone, even the people who supposedly ""like"" me \^\_\^

(So, let me list it just in case.

I'm allowed to be raped, as a kid.

allowed to be the child of a Rpaist.

Allowed no Mother or Sisters because they all died together

allowed a small penis

allowed social and mental slowness

allowed skin conditions, especially a mean face one

...I'm allowed all of these, but I'm not allowed to date or anything.

Isn't that nice? I kind of hate how one of my parents is a rapist, cheater, abuser, and pedohile, and he has less issues with women.

9,oje7nt,1626178048,"Do I stand any chance of ever having a partner, or should I consider getting castration when I have the means? 22 Year Old Indian Male here.","I understand that I am way too unattractive to get a partner by myself. And I do not think even in arrange marriage anyone would like me by their own choice (except for my degree). Coz I am that horrible appearance, features, accents and all such other features that make a male attractive to a female. Also, I read EVERYWHERE about how Indian men are look the ugliest and are the worst, written by a lot of people but most of all by Indian women. I am deeply hurt by reading all this and I want to get over this once and for all by becoming asexual by getting a castration. Coz if I get a castration, then the natural need for female companionship will go away and it wouldn't matter anymore than I am too bad looking and that women consider men from here as so bad. As it will not matter anymore if women like me or not if I become asexual through castration.

So I am asking about whether I should consider getting a castration? Or what about surgery to change my skin color into something more fair? Would women like me then, and at least want to befriend me?

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
I have never directly been told by a woman/girl that I am ugly and no one would want me and all that. But that is likely because I have never tried talking casually to a girl. If I tried talking to girls, it is very likely I would be shunned away for being ugly, dark skinned, awful round face, very ""uncool western"" accent etc. Also, no girl has EVER tried to talk to me and befriend me, unlike lot of other guys who have tons of female friends and girls come to talk to them themselves. But that's never happened with me, that suggests something about how girls must be finding me awfully unattractive. 

Also, PLEASE NO funny or joke comments. Please HELP if you think you can say anything helpful, or any relavant arguements for or against what I believe. Please try to avoid any dumb terminology or such stuff against men or women of any type, write stuff only that is either helpful or adds valueble arguement for or against the beliefs I have written.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oje7nt/do_i_stand_any_chance_of_ever_having_a_partner_or/

Why is it that there are no good guides going through a texting phase of the relationship? For example, someone shows the entire conversation from the first message all the way up to the current point in time. Highlights the important bits, gives explanations and reasoning as to why he sent the message x as oppose to message y. Like I get that it’s an invasion of privacy and that different things work for different people, but people need to learn how to text because let’s face it; that match probably won’t go out with you if you’re boring as all hell.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojhlke/no_widespread_guides_on_texting/
29,ojhnge,1626189214,I want to be loved or else become a Single Father,"M25. Canada.

Life is bad for Men. Dating is rigged to the core against us. Women are the employers, Men are the job seekers. We either go over the top to end up with someone who slept around and now wants a guy to care for her now that she is 30+; someone who makes way less; or both. Love and equal partnership is dead. I wish people actually believed in love from 20s till death the way they used to. Being with someone who slept around in her 20s while you kept pure is not love.

I was rejected by my dream girl 3  years ago. Everything I ever wanted in a parnter. Smart, Ambitious, kind, caring, wait till marriage, good with kids - all stuff I brought as well. We got along really well. But she rejected me. Now I respect her right to do so but I cannot find anyone nearly as amazing as she is. Also, while I am expected to accept her grounds, I am not allowed to have standards. I've been attacked for wanting someone who hasn't slept around w/ a bunch of frat guys and now wants a stable guy to settle down with. I've been attacked for not wanting to be with someone significantly less successful, despite me having a tough childhood and overcoming a lot to be where I am. Women still seem to see Men as providers and Men are just expected to be ATMs. (Despite me being good with kids so really I should be the one to marry up).

My undergrad was the only place I made meaningful connections with people. It is where I met my dream girl. School was full of ambitious, smart, 18-22 year olds who enjoy discussing public affairs. It's collegial environment promoted meeting people. Many people find their match there - many of my friends and acquaintances have. Outside there though, hook up culture has just destroyed love and made things hell for men.

And the pressure to enter into a loveless arranged marriage comes hanging from my parents.

Now I really want to have kids. If I was a Woman, it would be easy. Just hook up, have a kid, and extract child support. But since I am a Man. I cannot even do that. I would need to find someone to be with and hope they don't divorce and take the kid. Or someone who let me have a kid with her and will waive all parental claim. Being a Man really makes me screwed. Many times, I just wish I was a Woman",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojhnge/i_want_to_be_loved_or_else_become_a_single_father/

She died with my unborn Sisters back when I was 9, and I was raped when I was 5, abandoned at 2.

He also happens to have a thing for minor ages, likes cheating, trying to get with people that are already with another, and abusing + whatever else.

now, form what I know, am told, learn, can see/etc someone like him is someone you don't want to know, definitely not be with. Someone like him is what shit is.

But... if he had issue gathering attention I doubt he'd be finding these opportunities to cheat and I doubt he'd be always with new people.

I doubt he'd be liked, simply.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's evidently untrue that all of those make a person shitty or bad, I hear people don't want to date shit but he's always with women.

That would mean he's not bad. That would mean what he does is fine, and liked.

I would mean that I'm what's shit, not him.

&amp; As someone who has only

\-a small penis

\-social and mental slowness

\-possible autism

\-Bodily and facial skin conditions

\-can't be muscular, not with a malnourished life anyways

Poverty

\-No Mother or sisters

\-No present Father because he happens to be a rapist and preferred his other ""families""

\-Heart condition

\+ so many other things...

What would you say is shit?

What would you date over the other?

Him or I?

&amp;#x200B;

A Rapist or an Orphan?

So many of the things I hear/see does more to degrade, insult, demean, belittle those with a life like more than those with a life like his. Is it not the same for you?

you could likely tell me of ""jokes"" about orphans, sexually small dudes, the poor, people that're slow, or etc... But what's strange is how nowhere near as much hate or disdain is placed towards those making lives bad.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just those with bad lives that are seen as shit for some reason. The sense astounds me, perhaps because it's not near.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;, I mean, I find it kind of fucked that being poor, or small, or whatever it actually is that's making be worse or less likable than a Rapist.

\---

&amp;#x200B;

simply, There's this Rapist that I know. He made me, and I have to watch his life be so fucking perfect while mine's been withering since I was born.

I'd like to be more likable than a Rapist. If they can date what's making it so I can't and can only be rejected?

I am vaccinated, my whole family is vaccinated.  My sister is pregnant, she's been vaccinated.  Both my sister and I have science degrees, and my family is mostly in STEM.  We live in California in Silicon Valley and the attitude here is very pro-vaccination.  

This guy I've been dating...  I mean I like him, he's affectionate, we started having sex (I know, I know...) and the sex is good.  He's fun.  I don't often meet men I click with, I've been single a while.  

However, I feel like I won't be able to introduce him to my family when the time comes.  

There are other issues too, like I have bipolar disorder and need to take medication for that and he is sort of anti-medication unless absolutely necessary, more into natural healing.  I haven't talked to him about my bipolar yet.

I rushed into things and took down my online dating profile, and we agreed to be monogamous, and now I feel like I was jumping into things too soon.  We have some pretty fundamental differences.  Also, I am a democrat/liberal and I vote and he doesn't vote.

There are some things we agree on though, like he doesn't want kids (I don't want kids either)  and he doesn't want to move in together which I don't want either.  

I am thinking maybe I can just keep this casual, and work on improving myself in the meantime.  I'd like to improve my health and grow as a person.  As long as I can keep improving my health and becoming a better person and he doesn't get in the way of that, I feel like maybe I can continue to have sex with him like once a week.  

The only issue is that it is going to get in the way of me meeting a man who might be more compatible with me.

Things have been going well but I can’t help but feel there’s a few things that seem off. This guy told me that he was abused in his last relationship and was scared to say no to his ex and stuff but I am unaware if it was physical as he didn’t say and I didn’t wanna pry. I understood and told him a few things I had experienced. 

Yesterday I mentioned I was going food shopping and he said he’d make it fun if he was with me and I asked how. He then said he’d slap me with items of food and I couldn’t help but think that was a bit odd, I know partners joke about and play fight and stuff but something about it just seemed weird but I joked back with him and said I’d push him into some toilet roll for a laugh then he said he’d push me into anything then I said well not too hard it might hurt and he then said yeah it might. 

Lastnight we were talking and even though I hadn’t brought up anything sexual, he kept making the conversation sexual and i told him I wasn’t comfortable with it and that he should respect that he agreed and said he would respect it and apologised. I get the feeling this guy is also a little clingy as he asked if I was going to ignore him as I told him I was gonna play Xbox for a bit on Sunday night even though I had literally spoke to him all day. I then told him that I like to do my own thing and I like my own space and that if he doesn’t like that then that’s fine but he’s also got to respect that and he said he would. No issues regarding that so far.

This one is gonna sound stupid but he’s literally just told me like 20 minutes ago that his dog randomly bit a delivery driver that came to his house and had apparently never bit anyone before. I don’t believe him because dogs don’t just bite for no reason, and they always give a warning before hand, he thinks it’s because the delivery guy was pushing the dog down when it was trying to play, just doesn’t make sense and seems odd. He then told me that he sorted the guy out with a plaster and got him a drink and stuff I just felt like the getting him a drink part was totally irrelevant?? Like why would he even mention that? We are still talking about his dog and I didn’t reply for like 5 mins and he sent me another message saying don’t let this affect us please? Like wtf lol

Another Redditor commented on my stream and began engaging in some witty banter back and forth with me. We continued to chat via messenger and eventually moved on to talking/texting everyday. Rapidly things got more and more serious. Neither of us were actively seeking ANYTHING with ANYONE and she just crashed into my life and absolutely changed everything for me. She has become my best friend, my rock, my everything in the last year. After meeting in person we’ve decided we’re going to be moving in with one another and taking our relationship to the next steps. I never thought I would get another crack at love (I went through a divorce in 2019) and she had taught me so much on what love means and continues to amaze me everyday.

There were so many times that I wanted to ask her out, but my personal code of ethics stopped me. After I quit that job (my boss constantly rode my ass from Day One), I finally asked her out, and she said, ""yes."" The day of the date, she ghosted me. Later that day, I saw her driving not far from my house.  Later, I confronted her and politely asked why she stood me up.

We exchanged our Instagrams and I asked her how old she was and she answered she was 24. I told her I'm 20 and that I hope it's not a problem that I'm younger but she said it was ok. I told her that I'd be going on a festival for a few days but after that I'd love to go out with her. She said ""No problem, text me."" I wished her a good evening and went on my way.
The next day I texted her and sent her a short video of the stage. She just left me on read. Where did I go wrong?

The curiosity I’m referring to is mainly to get an insight of the ghoster’s mind.

Me and my bf were dating for 4 months and recently broke up. I was his first relationship since high school(8years) so I thought we would learn together how to make it work. He is a late bloomer so I asked him one time does he think about being with other women outside of me, (just to see where his head was) he admitted being attracted to a girl at his gym and wondered if she was single and that if he could get her number if he were single. That really rubbed me the wrong way, considering I’ve seen him check out other women on the low when I was around. I would tell him that I didn’t want to get in the way of his journey of being a man since he’s experiencing things so late in life. I brought up how uncomfortable he makes me checking out other women knowing he’s a relationship and would assure me that he only wants me and annoyed that I kept bringing it up. I told him that it’s a matter that can I’m willing to break up over if it doesn’t change and he stated to let’s just call it quits now. Now I’m wondering if he truly even planned with me long term or truly focused on me 100% although he’s a good guy and don’t think he’s cheated.

69,ojljsi,1626200470,Does anyone feel like physical appearance matters way more than it rightfully should? It's infuriating.,"When you meet someone, whether it's just checking out people at a bar or making small talk during a social event, the first think you can see is their looks. Unfortunately, this benefits only a small percentage while practically fucking others chances of finding love. Most of us tend to look pretty average, but there are definitely less fortunate people who are considered to be ""ugly"".

First of all, there is no fucking definition for ugly. Social media and television and whatnot have created ridiculous standards regarding physical appearance. This warps people's perspectives of what should be the ideal body. Sadly, not everybody fits the ideal ""tall, handsome, sexy guy"" body. In fact, most of us don't, so don't expect that.

Second, there could be a perfect man inside an ""ugly"" body. It is a shame how many great people there are in the world who deserve to be in a relationship, but no one will give them a chance because they don't bother to look further past their bodies. Admittedly, it is difficult to determine someone's personality just by looking at them. It is much easier to look at one's body and determine attractiveness from there.

I guess what I'm trying to say is: people are not patient enough. People are not taking the time to get to know someone. If you just date people based on what they look like, you're literally dating skin. You're not dating a person. You're dating a shell.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojljsi/does_anyone_feel_like_physical_appearance_matters/

TL;DR: Matched on Bumble, and plans to meet up kept getting pushed back and back for 4 months.

I know what you all may be thinking. It's not healthy and I shouldn't keep getting mad or losing sleep over a girl who I haven't even met yet. Everyone's telling me to move on, and every single nerve and brain cell in my body is telling me to move on. So, I decided to do it. This may sound extreme, and even I am slightly astonished by what I'm about to do, and this was the last thing that I wanted to do. But, due to the wear and tear that this whole thing has had on my mental health, I have no other choice.

The last message I had with her was today when she said ""okay, i'll let you know if i can meet up when my exams are over."" If she actually wants to let me know then she will reach out. Meanwhile I'll end the snapchat streak I have with her by simply not sending anything. If she wants to reach out then I'll answer but otherwise I'll just lay this whole circus to rest once and for all.

I'm sorry I had to do this. This was the last thing I wanted to do. This may sound extreme, and it is. Even I am slightly shocked by what I'm about to do. But it had to be done. This whole thing was not healthy for my mental health. Extreme times call for extreme measures. I'm sorry, but I have no other choice.

So I talked with my best friend who’s a girl btw told me that I should open myself to her. So I called her and I assured her that the feelings are real but I told her that there is something that is holding me back to fully commit to her I didn’t got in details because just alone telling her that there’s something holding me back was really hard.

She said that she found that good that I told her that but she really want to know what is and that I shouldn’t prepare myself because she will get back to that when the moment is right for her.

We have tons of interests in common and we're at pretty much the same point in our lives (finishing uni in december, then waiting 8 months for our master's the next autumn) and tbh, I don't think I've connected with someone on so many different things before.

We finished the night walking around the lake together, and made plans for a second date Thursday. We went for lunch together today, and we're looking to fit another lunch date alter this week, and a proper evening next week.

She has mentionned to me that she took a while to get attached and that she was a little shy, and since she said she wanted something serious, I haven't been pushing much. So far we've only held hands and hugged a couple times. But this being the first time I'm embarking in something serious, I'm a little worried I'm not/won't push enough by giving her too much time and that she'll lose interest.

I matched with a girl and we talked loads! Messaging multiple times a day til maybe 11pm every night. We met and we got on really well! She shared some big things with me and we agreed to meet again this Sunday.

The last few days though, I get the feeling the conversation isn’t the same. She’s not continuing the conversation, more acknowledging what I’ve said rather than responding if that makes sense? We have since we met agreed the times and place of another date in 5 days, which is obviously a good thing, though.

I’m wondering whether she’s not feeling it anymore but doesn’t know how to say it maybe? Maybe she’s the opposite and she’s scared because I’m still around after she told me some big stuff? Maybe I’m acting differently because I’m overthinking? I just don’t know.

What’s best to do here? Part of me doesn’t want to guess and just ask her if she’s still interested, but if she is, I don’t want want to come across as needy (which I realise I do sound. Probably because I am a bit).

I've never had a boyfriend (I've been asked out once but I was not interested), never had sex, and I've only kissed a guy once 2 years ago.

I have social anxiety so dating apps seem like a good option for me as it's literally impossible for me to randomly go talk to people I'm intersted in and because I never get approached by strangers bc I'm very awkward and silent in social situations.

I feel that at my age people one dating apps are more interested in hookups and stuff like that (I have nothing against that but it's not for me, at least currently) but I'm looking for something more stable so I don't know if it's even worth it to try.

A man today goes into society and is surrounded by many attractive women and his sexual desires naturally prompt him to approach them, or, at any rate, he goes on the online mediums and tries to find a woman there. 

But the disciplined man neither submits to women nor does he have a great amount of desire to seek women for pleasure online. He says to himself ""I must do what is good for both my present and my future"" and so he knows that by devoting his time constantly to women, he is focusing more on obtaining pleasure for the present than for preparing himself for the future. 

This is why intelligent women tend to find such men unattractive because they can easily see that he is undisciplined and is interested in them for their bodies. Hence, they draw away from such men and label them as ""creeps"", ""perverts"", ""weirdos"", etc... They say this because they know the truth, which is that the busy disciplined man is the attractive man. 

The undisciplined man, when he goes to a party, immediately starts making himself comfortable and starts looking for a woman to chatter with. He treats everything like it's his living room.  

But the firm and disciplined man doesn't do this. If there is a woman he finds attractive in his company, he doesn't attempt to lavish her or start toying with her brain, as eager men are wont to do, but rather he behaves like himself and only speaks when he feels that what he will say is better than saying nothing at all. This is what makes him mysterious in her eyes and they sometimes become more interested in knowing more about him. 

But sometimes people say that the disciplined man is a prude because he doesn't dance or act silly. This is not true, the disciplined is capable of dancing, but he does so in a moderate way and not in an obscene manner as is common in the vulgar establishments of large cities. 

When people are drinking, he only takes the amount he's comfortable with, when a pretty woman says starts trying to ""pick his brain"" or ""test him"", he responds as if she were just anybody and then informs her that he has to attend to his clients or projects soon.

When it comes to taste in women, the disciplined man would only go for a likewise disciplined woman. He looks for this trait just as much as he does beauty and when people ask him why he does this, he responds that he must be with someone with who he can harmonize and that going for a woman solely for her physical beauty is the sign of the undisciplined man. 

These are the characteristics of the disciplined man.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojo29l/how_the_disciplined_man_restrains_himself_around/

93,ojoc6m,1626208493,Girl from the shop,"Is it weird to ask a girl which works in a grocerie shop to go on a date with me? xD
She's not the cashier, she's filling up the racks with stuff. We've never had any words. I gone there like 10 times in a life (all in previous month and a half) and seen her like 4 times. If I need to describe her physical look I'd say 8/10 (and for me I'd say 7/10  haha) but I've been with more pretty girls and that is not relevant. And somehow I think that she's nice girl and I kinda like her. I'm 24y and she looks pretty much the same age.

But anyway to keep a long story short

She seemed cool, had good energy and was sociable. We walked for a bit, had a small conversation as she was in a bit of a hurry and the road which led to the train station was close. We talked about where we are from, if we are studying/working and how she finds this country.

She said she was a student from South America finishing her master's degree here in England. I asked how she finds this country and she said she doesn't really like how people aren't that sociable compared to where she grew up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojoilt/when_you_approach_a_random_girl_in_public_and/
95,ojokq3,1626209182,Modern dating isn't compatible with backbone industries.,"The best catch you could imagine, you'll never meet. You've probably ghosted them already. 

We aren't home every night, every week or every month. 

We have tons of resources and expendable income but no one to share any of our achievements with. 

We keep the lights on, we keep supplies moving, without us you'd freeze to death, starve, die of untreated illnesses, etc. 

Texting like this can be a burden. Most people can't be bothered to talk on the phone anymore so there's a lack of connection. We can't be bothered with people like that. 

We've all risked our lives to have the things we have some of us have almost died more than a few times, some of us have seen friends and coworkers die lives ultimately changed by severe injury. 

In a modern dating world it seems nobody understands that these kind of people still exist. 

We don't get to go out, we don't get to just make plans to see each other next week. 

When someone asks me where I live and I try to explain to them that I live everywhere they don't get it. 

I've long forgone a home base because I have nothing to go home to anyway. I have nobody. So I just stay out here and continue to generate an income. 

And what's worse is when I have someone in my life for a little while and I show them what I'm able to do and I offered to teach them and allow them to be part of it so we can more than double our productivity and have something and keep her from having to work at waffle House or IHOP, they'd rather sit at home and hunt for a boyfriend that's home every night even if it means he's jobless or a dead end. 

I've had potential S/O one after the other no that they could come out here with me and travel and see the country, get nice cabins or hotel rooms in our off time or hold down the fort and help me build things up there while I'm gone, and have no interest in any of it. 

I don't know what it is you ladies want, but I've got news for you... There's almost no future in jobs that have you home every night. 

You expect your man to get you that big house, the swimming pool, the big Christmas every year, a new car, brand new appliances and extra spending money? 

This is what it takes. 

That little boyfriend barista you have that works at Starbucks and is still going to college in his late twenties to mid 30s is not going to provide you with any of that. 

That guy you've been seeing off and on the last few months that works in IT probably makes closer to 12 to $15 an hour... 

But I often wonder if this is  a codependent personality type... 

I have various women tell me very often that I'm ""looking in the wrong places"" or I need to be ""content alone before I can be with anybody""

These people have no idea what goes on in this world or what it takes to keep the ball rolling. 

I don't know what places they assume I'm looking in and they have no idea what it's like to be this alone for this long. 

Modern dating leaves no room for sacrifices. Going places I've never been before and making the impossible happen everyday is in my blood. 

That's not what modern dating expectations want. 

It's preferable to struggle in poverty together so at least you guys get to see each other every night and hold hands on the hand-me-down couch you got at the yard sale while you stay stressed with one another and your current situation because neither of you can make the rent. 

The last man on the wall gets no consideration. To be clear I am not even remotely talking about military men. I never was part of that fraternity on government assistance. 

There are tons of us that are everywhere and nowhere everyday. And we stay that way because we have no one to go to. 

I get ghosted a lot and I believe it's partially due to the fact that they can't understand where I'm coming from. No I don't live anywhere in particular, but if it was worth it if there was a connection I could come to you or bring you to me. 

Too many people are brainwashed into the 9 to 5 house with a picket fence or an apartment and home every night all the time. 

And in their mind if they can't have that with you you are less than. 

I know a lot of you are lonely, but until you eat sleep work and enjoy off time completely in seclusion, with no friends or family or acquaintances to share anything with for months and years at a time then you can't understand. 

I don't don't understand how everyone's first go to is ""you're looking in the wrong places""

I don't get that if every place I've tried every avenue I've experimented with I get zero response nine times out of 10 and when I do get a response I get ghosted. I even get ghosted by people I wouldn't settle for. 

I see men like myself often get dropped for obvious red flag no future deadbeats. 

If you still have to rub shoulders with people at work, would you at least see your neighbors as you head home, you've got no clue what it's like to be this forgotten. 

That's what we truly are. My lack of friends and relationships isn't because I'm a nasty or cruel person, it's because people move on and I've been forgotten. 

I've been forgotten because I'm out here keeping the lights on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojokq3/modern_dating_isnt_compatible_with_backbone/
