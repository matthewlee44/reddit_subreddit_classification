1,s5rq3x,1642384157,Advice much appreciated,"Long story short I (40/m/divorced) met someone (39/f/divorced) on bumble and we hit it off right away. After about two months of dating she accepted a position with her company that required her to move. She‚Äôs been gone for 5 months and we still text on a consistent basis sometimes daily and some days throughout the day itself. We share a lot with one another on a very intimate level. We‚Äôve had sex roughly 20 times and even experimented with a few of her kinks. 

She now has a boyfriend (I‚Äôm seeing someone as well) and she says that he knows that we talk. From what I understand it seems like a serious relationship though I don‚Äôt question because I honestly don‚Äôt care. 

This whole thing feels weird to me. Is this weird to anyone else? I feel like I‚Äôm being used or maybe I‚Äôm using her. Maybe we are using each other?

7,s5sbzv,1642385884,Difficulty distinguishing sex from (hot) male friendship,"So we have to rewind a bit- about two years ago, I (25F at the time) had a casual FWB situation with 27M acquaintance who ran in the same social circle as me. This went on for about 6 months until May of that year. It was not a secret. I know that the last time I fkd him was May of that year because I distinctly remember that morning he was moving to a new place with his best friend (29M) who was moving back to town. The 27M started dating someone more seriously around that time. Later that summer, the 29M and I were thrown together at some get togethers and that eventually led to us hooking up in late summer. We continued to see each other every weekend (at my place) for a couple of months. Our hangouts were never ‚Äúdates.‚Äù He came over at the end of the day, usually after a late shift of work/after both of us had hung out with other friends. There were times that we spent the entire weekend together. We had fun, sex was good, and I felt that we were mutually kind of giddy around each other. We never discussed the fact that I had slept with his friend/now-roommate. Like I said, I know he knew, but I doubt he knew the exact timeline of things. Anyway, he eventually let things fizzle with me. I ended up calling him one night (alcohol involved but not drunk) and told him I was starting to really like him, was disappointed he lost interest and asking him what happened. He gave some vague excuses to spare my feelings and likely try to leave the door open for future fuckery. I ended up cutting off communication with him a couple weeks after that call (deleted on snapchat, deleted but didn‚Äôt block #) since he was continuing to string me along despite obviously having lost interest. As far as I know he never tried to reach out, but he did mention once in person that I blocked his SC. I told him that was because my feelings were hurt. That was almost a year ago. Since then, we‚Äôve hung out in group settings a handful of times (friendly w each other) and I‚Äôve run into him once or twice around town, also friendly interactions. I‚Äôve been working away from home for several mos and am on my way back. Now that some time has passed, and I still think about him, I‚Äôm wondering if I should find a way to reconnect w him or if he‚Äôs just a master fuck boy who got under my skin.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5sbzv/difficulty_distinguishing_sex_from_hot_male/

10,s5shpg,1642386355,What‚Äôs Your Take On The Situation?,"I‚Äôve been talking to someone for about three months now. At first it was nothing serious at all. Friendly, light flirting. I honestly wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked him enough in that way to be in a relationship with him so I kept it light. In the beginning he was definitely the pursuer about 90% of the time. He asked me to go on a date once and I agreed but he ended up having to cancel. We both are fairly busy, and usually talk the most in the evenings. However over Christmas break he flew home (away from me) and we ended up talking non stop and I started catching feelings. He seemed like he was as well. We‚Äôve talked about casual things and have also gone into serious things and confided in each other. He‚Äôs said the L word more than once, and has talked about making it official more than once. (I am a little more reserved with the L word until I‚Äôm 100% sure). Here‚Äôs my dilemma. He seems serious, yet we‚Äôve only ever gone out once. Some of that is due to covid restrictions and his job, but I feel like if he wanted too, he could. Then there will be almost entire days when he doesn‚Äôt have much to say and a couple days later be apologizing profusely for not paying me more attention. When we did go on a date, even after all these weeks of talking, getting comfortable w each other and even sexting, he didn‚Äôt try to hold my hand or kiss me goodbye. He has admitted before that he‚Äôs very shy and awkward with these things tho. I‚Äôm just a little confused at times if he‚Äôs actually into this‚Ä¶.or just stringing me along. What do u think? Am I expecting too much from something that‚Äôs not official yet?
Ps. ( I did ask him one day to please know he can be honest with me at anytime. And that if he‚Äôs ever not feeling us anymore I‚Äôd rather he be honest and tell me.

12,s5sj8g,1642386479,I don't believe in non-exclusive dating,"If you want your future relationship to work, you need to consider things exclusive from the second/third date. The reason why many people ruin good things is because they believe in this non-exclusive until they negotiate becoming exclusive. Many girls I have dated have done this to me, I'm not mad at them, but from that point onward they lose their right to ever becoming exclusive with me. If you once treat me like friends with benefits, you are permanently stuck in friends with benefits category. This isn't just a rule, It's because from that point I will consider myself as your second option and I can't recover from that, and the stain from that one-night stand or that date with another guy will forever be there, if you think I'm not good enough for you, I will not get in the way of you getting a better option.

I've been single for 4 years and haven't been with anyone for 2 and a half.  This person and I hit it off immediately.  First couple of dates were great. I find them super interesting, fun to be around and smoking hot. Also just seemed like a genuinely nice person. BUT....

Got a couple flags thrown up at the start where different drug experimentation and drug use was mentioned. Also I noticed that they consumed quite a bit of alcohol while we were together. They didn't seem inebriated at all and there wasn't any problematic behavior.  Thing is, I used to live a lifestyle like this so I noticed the mass consumption and drug comments right away. 

So not the biggest deal, but the lifestyle I live doesn't really conform to the schedule of copious drug and alcohol use. I don't think that you have to be the same as your partner for it to work out. Or be on the same schedule.  I fact I find the differences fascinating and the time apart keeps things interesting.

Before our first date he was upset with me because, I would take a while to respond to his text, I put off going on a date with him, and the one day we were supposed to go on our first date, we ended up rescheduling because of miscommunication. I never got ready because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him, but he did eventually text me later that day wanting to pick me up. But i wasn‚Äôt even ready , so I didn‚Äôt want to go. He then said because i never asked him what time we were going out he told me  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt seem interested‚Äù, I told him I was and we just rescheduled the date. 

The day of our date he wanted to pick me up , but i told him I was already out and I would just meet him there. He asked me who I was with, to which I responded it was just going to be me and him, but I‚Äôm assuming he thought I was with another guy? We finally met at the movies and i was thrown off because he didn‚Äôt offer to pay for the date‚Ä¶he lost his card and only brought cash which they don‚Äôt accept. So I ended up paying for both of our tickets and he sent me money for his ticket. But I think he should have at least offered to pay for us both because he asked to take me out. I just left feeling like he didn‚Äôt really care to try to impress me. Even though I wouldn‚Äôt have let him pay for me (because i don‚Äôt want men to think I‚Äôm using them) It‚Äôs just boils down to principal, if you ask someone out you should at least offer to pay for the date. But i do think because he thought I was with someone else he didn‚Äôt pay for the date.

A week and a half later he asked me out to brunch on New Years, but I ended up not going but told him if he wanted to do something later we could. 

He called me hours later, I didn‚Äôt answer.  so he texted me asking if I wanted to come to a party I asked which one and he just replied what city he was in and not exactly the details for the party. I was already out with my friends partying so I didn‚Äôt I respond until late like 3AM. He never texted me back.

43,s5vj2p,1642395677,I have found something so special so pure .. I'm terrified..,"As a child I was physically and emotionally abused by my dad. It was awful, police in and out, protective orders etc.

Then I met my ex husband when I was 20. I fell in love with his broken pieces and he fell in love with mine. However I grew and he became more erratic. 14 years together and years of emotional abuse with some physical abuse at 34 I got divorced and was single for the first time. He was also my first boyfriend.

Now, on the brink of 35 I have so very randomly met someone amazing. He is perfection. He is kind, he's funny, close with his family, keeps a busy active schedule, literally has never been in a fight. Unless he was playing hockey lol. He says the most wonderful things to me. He brings a kind of calmness in my soul that I have never ever experienced. It's freaking weird. And scares the whole crap out of me.

He leaves for Mexico Mexico 3 months in 3 weeks. I just can't believe I randomly met him. There was something there from the first conversation. He talks to me everyday. He asks how I am. Tells me I'm beautiful. 

However it's only been 2 1/2 weeks and speed that he's going is super overwhelming. He says he doesn't find the need to play games, he's blunt and just says the things he says to me because he feels them and believes them.

I had a momentary state of panic and told him I couldn't see him anymore. He basically was like why are you freaking out. That we don't know what's going to happen and that he wants to try with me thar he likes me and thinks we will both regret it if we don't try. That my past doesn't need to take more away from me.

56,s5w89z,1642397951,Looking for your opinions,"Alright, alright I just want to preface this by I am almost 100% positive what the responses are going to be, but here is the story:  

So, I have this ex gf right? It was like 5 years ago we moved in together. We ended up living together for around 2 years. Then our relationship started to go south. At the time I was (M24) and she (F22) and we just really weren't at a point in our lives where we knew what we wanted. Well, I take that back, she was still in college and is finishing a PHD as far as I know. 

Really, I just didn't know what I wanted and I really was just a bad boyfriend. Eventually she broke up with me and I did not handle it well. I got like super needy and begged her and all the stuff an insecure guy does when they get dumped. I know, I know I can feel the shame of past me still to this day lol. 

Since then, I have had some pretty dramatic life events take place that were really challenging for me and I'm really a different person now. Like, I am not just saying that to say that ""I've changed"" but I legitimately have. I have been thinking about her again lately and I kinda want to reach out and say hi. 

But, I legitimately don't know what to say. We haven't spoken in over a year, I have no idea who she is anymore and I really don't even remember her that well because it has been some years since we were even friendly. The things I do remember are that she's just the type of woman I respect and would love to have in my life again.

Again, I don't know if I should or not. You know? Like I was really pathetic for a long time when we broke up and I feel like messaging her is just going to piss her off and get a giant eye roll. If I were to message her, what do you even say without coming off as a total weirdo? 

On another note, I have been single now for 7 months (which I desperately needed I now realize) so it's not like I'm looking for a rebound or anything. I can't really even tell you why I have been thinking about her again. It's not like I think we could just fall back into a relationship or anything. Idk, I just don't know what to do. What do you guys think?  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have been thinking about an ex lately. It has been a long time since we broke up. I don't know what to say, but I feel like I want to say something? Don't know what to do. 

Honestly, I'm probably just a hopeless romantic that likes the idea of some sort of reconciliation...but is that really so bad? lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5w89z/looking_for_your_opinions/
57,s5w9q5,1642398079,Is he actually taking it slow with me or are his feelings lukewarm?,"I (25f) met a great guy (26m) on Bumble about 3 weeks ago. We have a lot in common and had similar goals for the future and what we want in a relationship. However, he got out of a pretty bad relationship a couple of months ago that lasted 4 months. He basically felt that the relationship was one sided and he‚Äôd put a lot of time, money, and emotional energy into it only for the girl to end things and go back to her ex. Because of this, he told me he wanted to ‚Äútake it slow and see where things go naturally.‚Äù

We went on one date and then after that, most of our time together has comprised of me going to his apartment, spending a couple of hours with him, and then we sleep together. We went on another date the other night and have plans to go shopping next week and have our first sleepover. The vibes are always there and he does text me everyday but I feel a little paranoid about how noncommittal he seems. 

I asked him yesterday if he would be upset about me going out on a date to gauge his reaction and he said that it would make him feel a little upset, but that ultimately we aren‚Äôt dating so I could do what I want. That response was definitely not what I wanted to hear. He then told me he likes me and isn‚Äôt talking to anyone else, but I still see him getting notifications from Bumble on his phone.

For context, he has a girlfriend that he wasn't able to see (face to face) since 2017 and they didn't have contact since then.

Last September, the guy and I became a couple. And last October, he opened his FB account so that he can get in touch with me. That same day, the girl messaged saying that she has a problem with her heart (one artery is blocked) but the guy's just kinda brushing her off.

I read the conversation since the guy provided his FB password to me.

At the back of my head, I still keep on asking myself why can't the guy tell the other girl that he has a new one?

The guy's telling me that once he's outside of the facility, he'll tell the other girl about us but I think he's just leading me on.

They've been together since idk, maybe since 2011 or something. 

I mean, he's giving me the same energy that im giving him but i can't help but to think that he's just pretending that he loves me and that he's only keeping me as an option.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5wsil/i_think_the_guys_just_leading_me_on_i_need_an/

66,s5x26z,1642400715,my bf's girl best friend is treating me unfairly and he's enabling it.,"tldr; my bf's girl best friend is excluding me from her birthday party - her intentionally leaving me out is becoming a pattern of behaviour, and i feel like he's enabling it. i'm contemplating breaking up with him because i don't feel like i'm getting anywhere with this situation. 

my bf (18m) and i (17m) have had an okay relationship so far. we've been together for 6 months now, and we treat each other with kindness and respect. any issues we've had we've been able to work through in therapy together and through communication. however, right now, i'm contemplating breaking up with him because i don't feel like he's standing by me and i feel disrespected.

he has a girl best friend, let's call her rose (17f) who he's recently gotten closer with. if they were this close when him and i got together, i wouldn't have gotten into a relationship with him. a girl best friend is a deal breaker for me. my ex cheated on me with his, and i broke up with him because of it. i understand that my current bf is not my ex, but because of what's happened in the past, i don't trust girl best friends, and so it's a boundary i've set. i know that that might not seem fair to some people, but to each their own - this is my dealbreaker. so anyways, rose and her friends have a history of excluding me. they threw a halloween party, invited my bf and not me, and one of the girls there kissed him on the cheek. she was drunk (not that it's an excuse but i'm giving context) and he didn't know she was going to, and he left the room and told me as soon as it happened. however, to my knowledge, he didn't say anything to her about it, and he stayed at the party and continued to party with everyone there. this was back in october. i've since been excluded from a number of other events, all of which i've heard from my friends there that my name was explicitly mentioned, as in ""no let's not invite (my name)"". it sucks. even when my bf and i have bumped into these girls out and about, most recently at a concert, they've run up to him and hugged him and barely gave me a second glance. it was disrespectful. one of the girls even went as far as to hug me and say ""hi nice to meet you"", despite the fact that she's said the same thing to me twice in the past 2 months. 

anyways, moving onto rose, i recently reached out to her via text and discussed the situation with her. my bf wanted me and her to be friends, and so encouraged me to talk to her about this. i told her i was hearing that these girls were intentionally leaving me out (she's one of the girls excluding me, by the way, i just didn't want to directly say ""i heard you did this"" because she'd get defensive and it would be an unproductive conversation). anyways, she told me she hadn't heard anything, and that she wants to be friends with me, so we agreed too make plans. this was about 2 weeks ago. i've since tried to make plans with her 4 times, none of which have worked. the last time, i was at my bf's house, and i invited her to go for a walk with us, since my bf and rose are neighbours, but she told me she couldn't come because her mom wouldn't let her go out, saying she had to study for an exam she had that week. however, after i left my bf's house that night, him and his friend (19m) (also their neighbor) went for a walk, they called her to come out and she did. she stayed with them for about 20 mins. her excuse was that she was walking her dog, and asked my bf to tell me that she was sorry she couldn't come out with me, and only went out after i left. however, i was hurt by this because a) it seemed like that was only an excuse, and b) she didn't text me to apologize herself, which i felt she should've done if she really did feel bad. this all leads me to the current situation. 

she's throwing a birthday party this weekend, and she's invited my bf, but i'm not invited. she invited about 20 people, and so when i told my bf i was upset i wasn't invited, especially since i had spoken to her about how i was already feeling upset about being excluded, he texted her asking to bring me. she said it was okay as long as she was still having 20 people over, because due to covid, she might have to downsize. since then, she's told him she's going to do a smaller party, meaning that i'm no longer invited. this makes me feel even more upset because just last month by boyfriend invited her boyfriend to his party, even though he only invited 7 people, and even though he wasn't friends with rose's boyfriend, just out of respect for her boyfriend and their relationship. i explained all of this to my boyfriend last night, as well as other concerns i had with rose's behaviour, and he told me he'd speak to her today. to my knowledge he hasn't spoken to her yet, but he's still going to her birthday party. he still also wants to go on a double date with her and her boyfriend, which i'm not so keen on. i told him that the only way i'll even consider being friends with rose again is if she apologizes to me, which i can't really see her doing. so right now, it feels like it's me vs. my boyfriend and rose. i don't think he's taking a stand with me, which is especially upsetting since i've been there for him through so much, and have had to make him feel better about some things that rose had done to him in the past. i've asked him to take a step back from his friendship with rose, explaining how a girl best friend is a dealbreaker with me, and he seemed pretty reluctant about it.

some objective opinions would be a huge help, because i'm worried i'm blowing this out of proportion, despite my therapist backing me up on this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5x26z/my_bfs_girl_best_friend_is_treating_me_unfairly/

My current place is small, and I'm looking to upgrade. So, I went online and requested a tour of a few places that fit my needs. Then I went to bed. (I promise that most of that is important.) Around half an hour later, as I was drifting off to Dreamland (7:30 pm, so not an unreasonable time to call), I got a call from a woman about one of the properties I requested more information about. Because my sleep was interrupted, I was less than kind (some would argue straight-up rude) to this unfortunate woman just doing her job. She apologized and said she would call the next day at an earlier time. 

The next morning, my mind was clearer, and I realized how much of an ass I had been and determined that she deserved an apology for my behavior. I was wrong, and I knew it. When she called, I apologized, and we went on to business. It turns out the current tenant is still in the process of moving, and she wasn't ready to show the place. I said that was fine and that my timeline isn't too short. I still have a couple of months after all. Our conversation was pretty relaxed; all things considered, and I was tempted to try flirting with her. Right brain stepped in before I made an ass of myself (again) and reminded... uh... me that she was trying to get a tenant. She has to be nice to me. Her livelihood depends on it. So, I kept our conversation business. She told me she'd call me when her current tenant leaves and the place becomes available. 

My question is this: Once our business has concluded, whether or not I move into one of her renthouses, would it be ok if I asked her out, or is that wrong?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5x57m/is_it_wrong_to_flirt_with_a_realtor_while_theyre/

Truth is, I am a virgin because of me. its not the fault of women or even other men. I have low self esteem and not much of a personality.

However whenever I try to improve myself in every aspect of my life and self I always get discouraged and give up for several reasons.

One of them is that I always see and hear about guys who have so much less going for them and are able to attract beautiful women and find casual sex so easily.

I am not saying I have to become a billionaire or something but should I even bother to make something of myself when there are so many guys with so much less (looks, money, success, etc) that are able to sleep around easily?

I can't help but feel irked that I have to develop a sense of humor, confidence, etc for my inner attractiveness and for other aspects of myself when I see and hear about fat guys, guys on the sex offender registery, serial killers, poor guys, in some cases even homeless guys who succeed with women and dating.

I do not know why but I would rather have sexual relationships with beautiful women when I am in a lesser position in life (if that makes sense). For example if I could choose between having crazy and fun sex with attractive women as a famous 30 year old multimillionaire man with ownership of private jets and boats and mansions or as a average 18 year old guy with average looks and an average income I would choose the latter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5xin6/should_i_really_improve_myself_and_build_myself/

Tomorrow (Monday) is a holiday and he texted me yesterday ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your weekend going? You have tomorrow off as well right?‚Äù

Two days ago when we called, he asked about my plans for holiday and I said I‚Äôm not sure. When I asked him back, he said he is going out with his friends. Then he said ‚Äúso just gonna be at home resting right?‚Äù 

He sends me photos of his cat and links of his favorite restaurant too. Since he asks my day and my plans, I feel that he is interested, but not sure if he is just being polite and doing that to just make me keep liking him. 

What do you think is the reason? 

He said he has been to dates, but was not been on a relationship. And he knows I like him too, I expressed it. 

I just don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs thinking and what his true intentions are. Does he truly like and care about me? Does he have something else in mind and just acting? Does he only want to sleep with me? 

And in the call, he also asked my future plans like if I will ever want to go to grad school. And I said yes, then he asked implying if it would be in the same city/state. 

Why is he taking too slow? Why he doesn‚Äôt he ask me out yet? And he doesn‚Äôt initiate calling or video calling either. The calls were initiated by me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5ym63/we_texted_for_a_month_but_havent_asked_me_out/
94,s5yvgj,1642407299,Online dating has really messed me up emotionally.,"Over the past several months I've realized how deeply 10+ years of online dating has changed me emotionally. I don't trust anyone anymore. I've become hypervigilant to signs of rejection. I expect someone to drop me at any given moment without a care in the world. I've tied my value to being entertaining and valuable to others and think that I am worthless if I can't do these things.

I'm constantly overanalyzing whether I did something wrong, if I could have flirted enough, if I could have texted less, if I could have been funnier, if I was trying to hard, if I was too boring. It's fucking exhausting.

And the worst part is that I feel like I am stuck. Like I have to keep going with these stupid platforms because if I don't then I will never meet anyone. But this isn't even true! I've met people in person before and it's always more pleasant than meeting someone online. Even when I have been rejected I at least feel like a human being.

Fuck these apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5yvgj/online_dating_has_really_messed_me_up_emotionally/
