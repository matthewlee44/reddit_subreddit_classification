0,nhr8g9,1621599859,Am I wrong for getting upset over the negative things my partner says to me even though they said something positive after?,"TLDR; title

I don’t know how to ask my question but here’s the scenario: 

The guy I’m seeing (and another guy I was talking to) both said something positive about me but then said something negative beforehand and expected me to not get upset about the negative thing they said because all of a sudden, it’s no longer negative because of the positive.

For instance, I had a guy tell me that I was being difficult for refusing to have sex with him because he didn’t want to get tested but then followed it up with “however, at least you’re smart.” It doesn’t take away from the fact that he still said what he said and when I called him out, he was like “typical, you’re ignoring what i said after.” 

And then the guy I’m seeing did a manipulative tactic on me by saying, “I don’t see other people because I’m not fed up with you” and then proceeded to also say “i’m also not seeing other people because I don’t want to and have no desire to.” When I called him out on the manipulation, he too said “you’re focusing too much on that and forgetting what i said after,” when I really wasn’t.

I guess this has to do with “picking and choosing what to hear” as some people do, but I find it fair for me to get defensive over what they said.

1,nhrdgd,1621600289,I told a guy I wanted to cut off contact but I'm not sure I did the right thing,"I want to start by saying that I joined tinder out of boredom right after the pandemic started. I (22F) have had a lot of matches but none of them interested me except one. I have had regular, good conversations with this one guy (24M), but decided to delete my Tinder account in the beginning of fall. I messaged him saying that I'm not gonna be on Tinder anymore but he could find me on Instagram if he wanted to and sent him my @. He followed me and started messaging on there. We have been texting like every three weeks or so, he said happy birthday to me, viewed every story etc. Fast forward to March, we meet for the first time and go for a walk. It was nice and he said we should meet again. I haven't heard from him for a while after that, but then we scheduled another date, went for drinks (it could only be done outside due to covid restrictions). It started getting cold and there was nowhere to go, so he suggested we got wine and go to his place (he lived nearby). The first time we met I was getting friendly vibes, he wasn't flirting or anything, honestly it felt like catching up with an old friend rather than a date. I was interested in dating him bc at this point I started to really like this guy, I wasn't into one night stands, hookup culture etc (if you are- more power to you!). The second time, when we went to his flat, he was a bit more flirty, but nothing out of the ordinary. He then suggested we watch a movie so we did. At this point I wasn't even thinking that he was about to make a move and initiate sex (naive I know lol but I just felt like he was being friendly but it obviously was Netflix&amp;Chill type of situation). I wasn't comfortable sleeping with someone who I barely knew, so I told him that and he respected it but seemed surprised that I didn't see it coming, he said things like ""well we met on tinder and you came to my flat what did you expect"" (it was much nicer than that but sth along those lines). I kinda see where he was coming from, but also I wasn't willing to do sth im not comfortable with just to satisfy him or boost his ego. Then we lied in his bed, cuddled and kissed and I left his apartment at 4 am (I realize I should have felt as soon as he started initiating sex but I just didn't). We talked about our expectations, he was nice, but also said something that might have been the most hurtful thing I've ever heard from a guy. He said that he wouldn't wanna date me, but he would really like to have sex with me (he put it differently and not as directly but you get the point). I told him I respected his honesty and I'm glad he said it because now I know where we stand. The next morning after I left, he texted me how was I etc and I messaged him saying that I would rather we cut off contact and it's nothing against him, told him to not take it personally, that the sole reason I don't want to keep in touch are our expectations - I was interested in a relationship, he only wanted to have sex, told him it was okay and nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I wanted, and that I hoped we would find what he was looking for. He have seen the message but hasn't replied yet (don't know if he will). I am wondering if I did the right thing? I kinda feel like I did, because I can now move on and forget about him. But a part of me would also like to hang out with him again but I don't want to get my heart broken so it's best to stop it now before I fall for him. this is the first time I'm in this type of situation so I don't know how to handle it...

2,nhrf9w,1621600445,Ex fuckbuddy wants to reconnect,"4 years ago, I met this guy on tinder for the sole purpose of hooking up . We used to cuddle, watch movies, talk about our personal lives when we hooked up. He made me meet all his friends. He told me that he would never want to share me with anyone. 
After a year and a half, I started seeing someone else and I told him we can't keep this going. But still he used to text me almost every month and said how much he misses me and he'll always cherish the moments that he spent with me. It was so frustrating and twisted because when he realised I was starting to get attached to him he literally ghosted me for a month and after awhile he sent me long paragraphs about how he can't date me because he just got out of a relationship and we also had religious difference which I respect. 
Later, I came across a friend of his where he mentioned that he's seeing someone else too. Thats when I realised he's been texting me all the time even when he was dating. 
A year passed and I called it a day with my boyfriend. My ex fwb again contacted me saying that he genuinely misses me and this time it wasn't for hooking up. He too broke up with his girlfriend and said  that even though he had the best of the times when him and I've been together, he still feels this void. Still feel things are incomplete or like he needs to do little more for me. He wants to meet me and this time he just want to spend sometime  away from the room. Also he said that he wished to get a chance to do it right and he's better with me.
Im still going through my breakup so I just replied that I'm uncertain about meeting him. I dont understand why is he saying those sappy things.
Im really sorry for the grammar guys but can y'all please tell me what should I do? I'm really perplexed by this situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhrf9w/ex_fuckbuddy_wants_to_reconnect/

5,nhrvt8,1621601882,How did i (23M) lose her (21F)," 

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

A week later even though we did not meet up irl she told me she only sees me as a friend, i told her i cant be friends as i had a similar experience last year with a girl and it just broke me, so we went no contact for 3 days and then i said i want to remain the contact as i really enjoyed our conversations and i value our bond. But it makes it very hard for me because i keep on thinking about the what ifs, it makes it hard because the first few weeks she did had those feelings and attraction, as in touching me and giving compliments, and it just vanished like fairy dust. She told me she really needs me in her life and really values our bond.

But i dont know what to do, the attraction was obviously there and now i am friendzoned. Is there any possibilty she can see me as more then a friend after a while or is it not possible as it is clear for her after some thinking she only sees me as a friend?

11,nhsubs,1621604567,The man (30) who I’ve (27f) been exclusively seeing for 4 months made a rude comment on my looks then said it was a joke,"Hey everyone I’m just posting about something that happened last night to try and gain an outsiders perspective. 

I’ve been seeing a wonderful man for a while now and it has been lovely. We are so happy together and connect on every level. We are from different socioeconomic backgrounds but it works, he’s also a dentist (this is relevant later on).

Last night we went out to eat and had a few drinks. We were a little tipsy but not out of it. I was telling him about a sport that I want to take up and how I’ll be cancelling gym membership due to money etc. Then he said “what about your money for getting your teeth done? Your teeth are not looking good, you’ve got an overbite, gaps etc...”. I was honestly shocked and didn’t know what to say. I mean it’s true but he’s always said that my teeth are fine and I don’t need work done. I also can’t afford it at the moment so it just seems cruel and pointless to say.

For reference, he knows I want to get my teeth straightened and plan to in the future. They are clean, healthy, and very white but I’m from a poor background and so I haven’t had much cosmetic dental work done. I’m very insecure over them but I’m an otherwise attractive woman and no one is perfect. I asked if he meant it and he said “yeah” and then he suddenly said he was joking and teasing me because I always bring up my teeth when discussing finances.

He then apologised and said that he wouldn’t have made that ‘joke’ if he knew how insecure I was over it. Surely he must know as I mention getting work done? Also he used to say that I’m better off spending that money on a new laptop and a better quality car for when I pass my driving test soon. So I guess that makes me think that he doesn’t really care?

I just feel so upset and I don’t know if he meant it or not. It’s quite a disturbing joke to make anyway. We got over the topic but it still bothers me so I’m thinking whether to discuss it in person but then I don’t want him to get scared off.

I was honest and I did tell the other person that it was my first time . She seemed cool with it (even though she couldn't believe it) but I was scared that deep down she would see that as a red flag, wouldn't enjoy the intercourse herself and tell her friends about it.

18,nhtuu0,1621607343,First time going on a date with someone I really like from the get go.,"So I'm sort of looking for advice, or just anything to kind of curb my anxieties. 

Tiny bit of background. I'm gay, I havent really dated at all my entire life. I'm 30 and my first relationship lasted about 6 months, and ended 4 months ago after it turned abusive. 

I built myself back up and started dating again. I recently matched with a guy on match.com. And describing how I feel about him is easy. 

He makes me smile and laugh, we share a ton of personality triats, hes kind and understanding and we share similar interests. I was up front about everything I have going on including the inexperience and the trauma from my recent relationship. He told me it was all okay and there was no reason I had to go through that alone. That statement is what really got me in his corner. We have been talking for just over two weeks and have a date planned over next weekend. 

My issue is that my anxieties, fueled in large part by how I was treated in the past, were kicked into overdrive after I realized how much I want this to work out. I have been driving myself insane with what if's and worries about my inexperience and doing things in ""the right way"", if that even exists. He's reassured me that he feels similarly towards me, but I cant help but think I need to always be doing more, messaging more, letting him know Im interested more. But also being afraid im overwhelming him. Part of this I think is the last person I was with, always went out of their way to berrate me in stating that I was never doing enough. Not matter how hard I tried, the love I showed was always lacking, and it hurt them. I've come to terms with the idea that he qas doing this to manipulate me into being under his thumb and always trying to please him. I cant help but think these current feelings are coming through out of habit and past trauma. I'm extremely excited for the date, but the way im feeling now, the anxieties, its not healthy.

""Afternoon! Wowww, thanks for such wonderfully hot messages! I've been wanting to reply them all morning but I was feeling pretty sick yesterday and worse all morning. Thought I'd be better after some sleep, but ended up the opposite :( Don't know what it is, hope it's not corona, especially when I'm supposed to get the vaccine on Friday. If it is, probably from bro who probably got it from someone in college but is asymptomatic, sigh, should've been more careful with all the variants springing up.""

""So sorry for not sending a better message about this, head's not working at the moment. Like just this short message's taking a while &gt;&lt;. I'll be going to a doctor in a few minutes, so just wanted to let you know beforehand. Hope it's not corona or anything that requires going to a hospital but in case it is, I just took down the pics from Flickr in case the site gets hacked or something with all those revealing pics I uploaded there and I'm not in any state to handle that, better safe than sorry. I'll put them back when I get back.""

""Wish my head was working well enough to at least thank you better for the messages this morning and last night, and really all your amazing words recently, I was rereading them this morning between episodes of Fairy Tail. I did start Great Pretender yesterday like I said I would, wish I could talk about that now too, but felt too bad to watch something heavy so just went with the lighter Fairy Tail this morning. Oh wow, just checked the time and I already have to go for my appointment, good gosh I'm so slow now. Thanks again for being SO utterly amazing! Hope your work's not being too mean to you, and hope even more that you're feeling well and healthy!

Hope to reply soon!""

We talked every day non-stop for 3 months. And after that message, I have not heard back from her. I am devastated. I cannot concentrate at work because I am so worried about her all the time. I don't know if she is dead or alive. I keep checking the obituaries every day and luckily do not see her name. But I get paranoid and think that they might have not been updated, or that she is in a really bad condition. She is only 23, but Covid has killed people younger than that and severely hospitalized many more of that age range.

I honestly just feel like dying right now. She was the only happy thing in my life and now she might be gone.  


She is not the kind of person that just ghosts someone like that. She would have just told me if she didn't want to talk anymore.

20,nhu43f,1621608017,"She (24f) isn’t gay, but we’re pretty gay","I (22f) met a girl (24f) among a group of friends roughly 6 months ago and since then we have spent nearly every day together. The mall and the bars on the weekends quickly turned into daily “What are we doing for dinner?” We live in a city and I don’t drive so she would come pick me up every day and take me to hers until we realized it would just be easier to sleep together. We both work from home so I mostly work from her house but on days when it’s easier to stay at mine, we stay at mine. Even a step further, she wanted me to live with her and I of course signed a lease and am moving in at the end of the month. Naturally when you share a bed and every second together you are bound to get close. We have trusted each other with our deepest secrets, thoughts and feelings and I’ve never felt more accepted. Cuddling every night, pet names, sensual touches, innocent but frequent kisses that feel like we both want more but are scared to approach it. This morning, she left for vacation for the week and gave me hugs and kisses before she left me in her bed missing her. This vacation was met with lite anguish from the both of us jokingly saying “what are we supposed to do while we’re apart for five days?” “don’t give my love to someone else”. Anytime we’re mistaken for girlfriends we acknowledge and almost embrace it. In bed together we were talking about how everyone thinks we’re together to which I replied “we are together” and she said “that’s for us to know and for them to find out” I let that roll off my back because we had been drinking. Our friends do call us girlfriends, they’re mostly guys and we are pretty and femme presenting women so they almost want us to be girlfriends as bad as I do but I digress. 

She spends each night wanting me close to her, the literal minute we are alone she pulls me in closer telling me how much she loves my body and feeling on it but in public, every chance she gets, she vehemently rejects being ‘gay’ and even made attempts to question another friends sexuality “maybe he’s not ready to say he’s gay”. She tells select people about me when I’m not even sure they asked. She showed me texts with her ex where she said she spent every night with me in her bed and my cuddles were the closest thing she was getting to some action (for the lack of better words). She followed this message up by saying “but you know I’m not into girls though”. Although , I’m not sure how true that is and frankly I think both messages were unnecessary. It was even more unnecessary that she had shown them to me. I looked her in her face some weeks ago and said that I felt deeply for her and was attracted to her and she said she “loved me differently too”. 

Among our friend group every one knows that I have fluid sexuality and even that I am attracted to my friend. while all that is known I would never try to turn someone queer or force a relationship that is one sided. So I leave the ball in her court and only touch her to the extent she touches me but her almost rejecting what is very real for me out in public hurts my feelings. When some of these things can just be left unsaid. Is it possible for things to progress? Am I wasting my time? Am I reading too much into something that really could be nothing?

tldr: my friend acts like my girlfriend but isn’t “into girls.” we sleep together, with our hands and eyes always on each other. we are each other’s largest confidantes but she seems conflicted and in some instances steadfast about asserting her “straightness” should I leave her alone completely? or is she just working at her own pace?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhu43f/she_24f_isnt_gay_but_were_pretty_gay/

Basically I met this guy off a random app, he sent me a request so naturally I accepted. We started talking, and found out we had much in common. The same exact day, he was telling me how no girls find him attractive, and how he’s been bullied because of his looks when he was younger. I felt pitiful, and told him that he wasn’t ugly, he was average looking, and that I’d always be there for him as a friend. Now this guy took this a different direction. He kept sending me dick pictures, and videos, with the sound on. Naturally, I’d block anyone who’d do this, but I thought he was just going through a tough time so I told him to simply stop because it was making me uncomfortable. He understood, and stopped but after a few days, when we were talking about Indians in particular, he says, “I fucking hate Indians and their smelly asses I would never date one.” little does he know, I’m Indian. I proceed to tell him, and he straight up blocks me. Part of me was glad to have gotten rid of him, but then my attachment issues came up and I started missing him. After a few weeks, he adds me back, and I accept again thinking he’s changed (completely my fault) and for a while he does make it seem like he’s changed. Until today. Today, he started making racist jokes about white people, and my friends in particular, because I have more white friends.

I’ve always thought that we both were just friendly, but recently I told of our fun adventures to some of my other friends and they all said that she’s leaving hints. Can the internet help me out here and confirm if these are hints: 

-She invited me to a skiing trip with her friends and offered to drive me there when we first met
-She suggested that she comes over to my place and I cook lunch while she cooks dessert
-She suggested to go to a museum together
-She offered to pay for my meal when I told her that I’m just barely surviving with my graduate studies stipend
-She lied down on one of my couches at my place the first time she came over

Is she leaving hints, or is she just comfortable around me? She also tends to offer advice on getting other girls’ attention, and was cheering on me for starting to date/look for another girl. I would think she’s just friendly and supportive, but now I’m not sure.

25,nhuwbj,1621610057,I can’t process emotions.,"I think it’s happened to everyone. We meet someone and we fall head over heels with the idea of them.  

I met this guy over a dating site and it quickly turned to a “I’m just looking for friends” on his end. I knew I would not pursue this person because I’m not about that FWB life.... anymore(😂). Even though we hung out a couple times and he never tried anything, so I trust that he was being honest 

From a friendship standpoint he is very nice and chill. I enjoy his company because we have the same outdoor interests, but I was always the one to reach out so I stopped. After our hang outs he would always say “we should do this xyz another day” but he would never actually reach out.

My therapist as told me that I am a very understanding and analytical person. So I understand my feelings/ others intentions but don’t process my own feelings towards a situation. (Aka cry, get mad) 

I know this person is not worth my friendship because it’s a one sided relationship. Though, after months I am still thinking about him because I found him intriguing. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? Or have any advice on how to actually let the feeling of rejection and disinterest sink in?

Someday he would be visible, I would feel really happy when we were together(for an hour or too), but then again he would be lost,away for days. We were in the same college but would see each other in weeeks (he didn't come to college too, he said he was kinda depressed) and when I would fight over him not giving time(in person, calls,text) he would even go faar. I often found him slight flirting woth girls and even found that he was using tinder. It was my first relationship and the trust you know just shattered into pieces when I found him on tinder. He had lame reasons for having it and even fooled me over it. We broke up after 2 months(i tried to get things back but he just didnt), it was a relationship for 7 months and we dated for 6 months. Within a month of breakup he started dating someone else(she's kind of a playgirl) and they came into a relationship, somehow I moved on in 9 months. And then tada!! He was back again. For 2 months he tried ways to talk to me, I couldn't be harsh with him and then we met to talk about things, he cam close kissed my neck and we ended up kising, relationship restarted. It had been 2 months he behaved well, gave time, would be emotionally available, physical intimacy too. Despite everything good I was always afraid if he's still doing some shit behind my back, or would he walk away again.

 Staying together for 2 months I asked for a break for the past was still triggering me hard. I felt I've hurt him with this, when I ask about his feelings for the third time he said,""I think it's fine, I dont have any hopes for the future, I think I rushed things, I think we are just forcing it on us maybe, we aren't meant to be together, perhaps""  while he was the one always saying to stay together forever ans would wait for me lifelong. I don't know if he said it in resentment(on my decision) He even denied to give any past clarifications(despite the fact we decided we'd do it after lockdown) and told that I can only heal on my own, for he tried and if his actions can't work how would his words? 
I still miss him a lot, but going back would hurt both of us again? My exams are really near I can't concentrate. What do I do? We never had a f2f convo/clarification about the past deeds. What should I do. Please suggest. Is it I've not yet healed from past? I even explain to myself sometimes that he explored his options whenever he wanted to while even being in a relationship, shouldn't I explore?

38,nhwdzl,1621613848,"Did he hide his feelings when I ended things, or did he never really care about me at all?","(ESL second language!)  

I (F22) just ended things with a guy (M24), after 7 months of talking and acting like a couple. A relationship was never on the table, because we live in different cities and neither of us are interested in a LDR. 

However, we had insane chemistry when we first met, so despite the distance we’ve spent a few weekends together and talked A LOT. Seriously, I’m talking hours on the phone every night, constant text and snapchat conversations. He treated me very well, and I’ve never felt like any guy has cared so much about me before, and respected me this much. He would talk about things he wanted us to do together, joked about the future, and even told me I was his «dream woman». 

It has been a weird situation because we were never together, but still acted way different from normal dating or ""the talking stage"". He seemed more content with the relationship than I. I tried to keep it casual, but in the end I found myself wanting a relationship with him and ignoring all other men. But he's been very clear on not wanting a LDR the entire time, so i knew that it would never happen.

I Facetimed him and explained the situation, and that we would have to stop talking, because it wouldn't be fair on any of us. I would be constantly wanting more from him, become jealous, and it would just end up with a horrible fight.    

Here’s the problem: I got absolutely NO reaction from him. No emotions or anything at all. I could be telling him about my grocery list, it just didn't seem like he cared at all. He acted like the entire conversation was an inconvenience at most to him, while I was sitting there struggling to keep it together and not cry. He just said he understood, nothing more. 

What do you guys think? Was he sad, but trying to keep it cool? Not show me his emotions or weakness? Or have I misunderstood the entire relationship, and thought that this guy cared a lot more about me than he actually did?

I'm so confused and afraid to have been a fool this whole time. I feel like I've had to let go of someone very important to me, while he acted like he said goodbye to someone after one date.

39,nhwis5,1621614203,All the women I find attractive are dating tall white men (or rarely tall black men),"I prioritize fitness and health in my life. I watch my diet, intermittent fast, and work out every day. If I end up seeing a woman who seems to have even remotely similar body type to me (slim/lean) which I find attractive, she is always with a tall white guy. The only exception is one woman I know I find attractive is with a 6'4"" black guy who is rapidly eating himself to death.

I was out getting a bite yesterday and I walked past a woman I found at least moderately attractive with her bike. She was standing on the corner fiddling with it. It had a basket on the front and I started stupidly thinking about typical Reddit advice. ""Maybe I should try talking to her. Maybe I should forget that most women reject me on sight. Maybe this will go better. What can I say? Some dumb joke about her basket and E.T.? Nah forget it.""

And I walked on by. On my way back, I almost laughed internally as then I see her there with her boyfriend who just came out of the store she was waiting in front of and he's a 6'2""+ white guy with big bones and a perfect face.

It's like every fucking time. I don't even know what the point is. Nowadays it's easy to look people up too on Instagram or other social media, so often I'll meet a woman even if it's in an environment where I couldn't date her and just look her up out of curiosity and it's the same thing over and over.

41,nhwnyf,1621614592,Would it be weird to bring him flowers because he’s had a rough week and hasn’t been himself? Or should I wait and see this evening...,"For context, we [23F &amp; 24M] only had our first date ~2 weeks ago and have been talking for 3 weeks. We’ve met up 2 more times before this past week when we didn’t because we both got sick (him worse than me). 

I realize it’s pretty early but I think we both like each other - besides explicitly saying “I like you” to each other, there’s also physical attraction and our dates last 5-7 hours and only end because the restaurant literally was closing or it’s super late and one/both of us have work the next day. 

I know that he’s had a rough week between being sick, having a stressful job, taking a class, and 2 dogs. He’s usually an extrovert and we’d talk constantly everyday but I think all of this worn him down a little - he said he just doesn’t really feel like talking for long periods of time and was feeling really introverted this past week. I want to and am giving him the benefit of the doubt that he actually means that - not because he’s losing interest or flaking on me... (my severe anxiety has been trying to convince me otherwise though and has me overthinking. It’s probably the reason I’m asking this in the first place). 

We agreed to meet up this evening to hang out. It’ll be the first time in a week and the first time we’re meeting in person ever since I told him I liked him a lot too over text. Since I’m probably going to be going to his house first, would it be weird to bring a small bunch of flowers for him? Based on what I know about him, he’s not the type of guy to get offended or think he’s “too manly” for flowers. I was thinking something happy like sunflowers! Or should I just drop the idea? 

As I mentioned before, my anxiety likes to think of “what-if” and worst case scenarios. I don’t want to get my hopes too high. The flowers are meant to make him feel better - not potentially make it awkward.

We met at work and she became super enthusiastic about befriending me. We literally were talking every day and even went out. She initially wanted to split the bill, but I paid. Afterwards I was planning ideas that would have kept the dates very inexpensive or possibly free where we could enjoy each others' time and I noticed when I brought them up to her, she didn't seem that excited and finally suggested an alternative to an outdoor mall close to where we both lived that I've been to which has pretty/romantic scenery, but the restaurants there cost quite a bit (took an ex a couple times there). Anyways she was mentioning at first checking out various stores with me, but finally pitched eating at one of the restaurants. Well I jokingly said ""well since I got you the first time, maybe you can spot me this time"" and she laughed at that. Low and behold our conversations quickly changed, she was still friendly but the 2nd date seemed unattainable. After trying to get her to see me again for the 3rd time, with me suggesting eating ice cream, and not getting a solid answer, I stopped talking to her altogether for a full month! During that time, she made no effort to reaching out. Finally I did, and she was friendly again, but that was about it. When I told her I didn't want to have her number go to waste, that I missed her voice, she said she was up for me calling her.. surprise surprise, when it came to actually talking, take a guess who started coming up with excuses?! 

I've been wanting very much so, to find a girl who would like me for me, not what I can give her. I thought this once sweet girl was different.

44,nhwxkd,1621615289,"Don't know, what to do anymore","I'm at a point, where I'm just frustrated. Nothing I do seems to work even a little bit.

First, let me tell you my (m28) background. Didn't really date until I went to university. Afterwards I had a hard time, finding a girl with real interest in me. I was looking for a relationship and basically just took, what I got, being kind of a fuckboy until I met my last girlfriend. It lasted nearly 4 years.

Then I moved and I hoped that the new scenery would be a good opportunity to start dating. Met a lot of new people, but nothing...
Not that I didn't try but I always felt like my heart wasn't in it. I flirted for the sake of flirting but no woman really sparked my interest. None of them lived up to my ex.

I tried to get my mind off of her and met a girl via jodel (let's just say it's a German app, kind of a local, anonymous version of twitter). We had a casual thing going, but it never really clicked for me. 
After half a year I moved back to the city I studied in and this is where I am now.
Here... everything stopped working.

The pandemic left me with one evening every week with the friends I had here. No other opportunities to meet new people. No girls in this circle of friends, that would have the slightest potential for a relationship or hookup. Dating apps don't work at all. Few matches and fewer answers. After 4 months of tinder (and others) not a single date. Jodel (the app from before) also stopped working for me.
I go out to work or to buy groceries. So no real opportunities to talk to random women. But even if I had such opportunities, women on the street just don't spark my interest. 

To sum up: I know, how to talk to women, I've been with plenty, I'm not ugly, I do sports,...
But no dates in sight.

Another thought: I know that all of this doesn't sound like a healthy mindset. That I'm so stuck on searching for women, that my behavior mirrors this mindset and therefore scares women of. Also all this stuff about being a happy single, before being a good partner.

I'm able (at least I think so) to be happy during my day, spend time with friends and everything without just thinking about women. But I can't call myself happy single without having the tiniest chance to get a date.

Nothing would ever be worth breaking what we have together and I seriously love him so much.

However, each day on my break I see this same guy and there is just insane chemistry. We used to see each other a couple years ago at his other place of employment because we worked in the same shopping center. We both ended up changing places of work during pandemic, and ran into each other again one day when I found a new place to go to for lunch. Ended up being this place was his new job. It has never gone past the typical, “Hey! How are you?” And one time he acknowledged that he always used to see me at his old job, smiled a lot and he said it was really good seeing me. It has always stayed professional.

Hear me out though. He constantly stares and gives me these eyes every time I see him, like he wants to fuck, really badly. I can just feel it. After I see him, just from the eye contact it leaves me so horny and it lasts for hours. There is just something so intense when we make eye contact with each other, and there always has been. He has always stared at me ever since I saw him at his original work place, and we sometimes hold eye contact and the feeling is indescribable. I always end up looking away though because I know we could never end up being involved with each other. It’s like “wanting what you can’t have”. He looks at me and makes me feel like I’m the only one in the room.

Even if he did hit on me, I wouldn’t pursue it and I would be honest with him about being taken. What do you think his reason is though for not already doing it? Is it that he may have seen my ring, or he doesn’t potentially want to get in trouble since it’s his place of employment? He is higher up than a regular associate, he’s in the management, so. I don’t know, I’m just curious on everyone’s thoughts. Do you think he thinks about this outside of work too? Or could he be feeling this with ten other women that come into the store?

I know I could never be involved with him, but the intensity of our interactions just makes me think about him. Please don’t judge, I seriously would never do anything to harm the relationship I’m in and I would never act on these feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhyec2/if_i_know_hes_super_interested_and_we_have_insane/

Anyway, he said he'd pay me back for his half but he hasn't. He paid for the other dates but they cost significantly less plus I offered to split those bills but he insisted.

57,nhyyyy,1621620569,Monogamy Without Commitment,"I'm a 35F and met a 35M on a dating app a couple of months ago. We live about 3 hours apart but were trading off driving on the weekends. At the end of April, he called and broke it off, saying that he had unresolved feelings for an ex that had moved back to town.

We started talking again literally three days later, and he said that he had felt like we were moving too fast and he had been feeling suffocated, and every weekend back to back was getting to be too much too soon. He said he's not in a place for a relationship, and that he had also decided not to pursue anything with the ex (I think there's some bullshit to this entire story but want to wait and talk to him about it in person when we see each other). Personally, I was really getting caught up in it and neglecting a lot in my own life to make time for him, so him breaking it off ultimately was a good thing for me as I have been able to begin focusing on myself again these past few weeks.

But, I still like him and he seems to like me. Unrelated to him, I have actually been looking for a new job and one of the cities I've considered is his, and when I told him I had been having phone and zoom interviews for companies there, he told me he truly hoped I would end up there and he'd love to have me closer. Within a week of us beginning to talk again, he made a joke about us being FWB since a relationship wasn't going to work for either of us right now. I suggested that we hang out/have sex when it works for both of our schedules (so, not have a formal travel back-and-forth agreement) and see how things go. I'm not seeing anyone and did also ask that if he decides to date or sleep with anyone else that he be honest with me because I don't want to be a side chick and I will not continue to pursue anything with him at that point. He said he liked that, could give me that, and did not plan to get involved with anyone else.

When I told my therapist this, she said we had agreed to monogamy without commitment, which is not a phrase I've heard before. Honestly, I'm still hoping a relationship is in the cards down the line when it works for both of us but who knows. My friends are skeptical of the entire thing. I'm just curious.... do others have experience with this type of arrangement where you are exclusive but not in a relationship and not actively headed towards one? Or, are we actually in a relationship if we aren't seeing other people?

TL;DR: We were dating, he broke it off, now we've agreed to be exclusive without commitment. Do you have experience with this type of agreement/relationship and how did it go for you?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhyyyy/monogamy_without_commitment/

I waited to see if he would text me first. That never happened so I texted him. I asked him a question relating to one of our conversations we had in person so that he’d have a reason to respond. He responded hours later and I texted him back to continue the conversation (in hopes it would eventually lead to us planning a date). He never responded.

It’s been almost a month and he FINALLY texted me back this afternoon. His response was “I’m recovering this from the depths of my messages!

66,ni0et8,1621624452,A Guide to OLD written by a woman to men,"I'm pretty new to OLD, but I see people (mainly men) complain about it, so I put together some observations/experiences I've had that might help.  


1. **Please actually enter something in your profile.**

If all I have to go on is your photo, then yes, I will judge you based on your physical appearance. I can’t see anything else. And bonus - please have more than one picture, especially if you're not going to fill out the profile. 

2. **In your profile, put something specific about you. **

Even if I don’t think someone is the most attractive, I’ll swipe right if they sound interesting. Attraction can develop if we have similar interests. Your bio gives you a shot to show a peek of who you are. Don’t waste it.

3. **Please no group shots. If you must use them, then max 3 people and make sure they’re at the end.**

It is a waste of time to look through and see which person is you, especially in the first picture. Just please max 1 group shot.

4. **Please no bathroom selfies, especially if you aren’t wearing a shirt.** 

It’s not as impressive as you think. I’d much rather see a pic with you at the gym or doing something physical than just abs and a toilet in the background.

5. **You’re better off not posting a picture with another woman (unless you’re looking for a third)**

Anytime I see a woman in a picture I wonder, is that his sister, his ex, a friend? Don’t open the door to these questions. Just post a picture of yourself. Also, not my cup of tea, but if you’re looking for a third, please post pics of both people. If you don’t, I always wonder if the girl even knows you’re doing this and it just makes me uncomfortable.

6. **If we match and you just say hey, I might not respond. If you say something that shows you read my blurb, it’s more likely to pique my interest.**

I filled out the blurb for a reason. I mentioned something about me. If all you do is say hey or comment on how pretty I am, it’s nice but I’m way more likely to respond to someone who took an interest in what I had to say.

7.**Show don’t tell**

If you’re a chef, post a pic of you cooking. If you’re an athlete, show a pic of you playing your sport. If you like to hike, show a picture of you on a hike. It adds credibility and makes for more interesting shots.

8.**Don’t ask weird/inappropriate questions that you wouldn’t ask in person.**

I’ve had men ask about my racial background moments after saying hello. That leads to an automatic ghosting. It makes me uncomfortable and I’m sure it’s not just me. I'm sure there are tons of other questions that people ask off the bat that are rude too (asking men they're height is one that comes to mind). 

9.**Don’t lie about your age.**

Instant turn off. If you say ""I like more mature people"", then recognize its immature to lie about your age. Also, hiding your age doesn’t make me more likely to swipe right. It makes me wonder what you’re hiding.

10. **Accept you may not be for everyone. **

I know rejection (or perceived rejection) sucks but presumably you just aren't trying to match with any warm body. A good match is better than someone who annoys you every time they talk (or vice versa).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ni0et8/a_guide_to_old_written_by_a_woman_to_men/

86,ni3yx7,1621634270,Wish people stopped telling me I can get married in the future through my career,"To preface, I have never had success with dating. I have tried offline &amp; online. Admittedly I haven't tried offline that extensively, I've only approached less than 9 times. But I struggle with being extroverted. So I don't really have the self esteem to cold approach, all of my approaches have been women I've gotten to know for at least a short while in school / work / volunteering. 

I'm almost at the point of giving up. I have a lot going against me besides introversion; I'm somewhat short, have a large nose w/ deviated septum, recessed chin, dark (instead of golden) brown skin, poor frame, softer voice, poor eye shape, etc. Basically very few if any masculine features. I'm a virgin, which is a big problem as at my age this is highly abnormal, and that is a massive turn-off too. I have a link that cites an anthropologist saying 40% of people wouldn't date a virgin, but posting it here gets my submission deleted so you'll have to take my word if you don't believe me. 

What I've been told several times when dating comes up in conversation with others is that because I'm moving quickly into a PHD program with a good chance of having a high earning career before I'm 30, I just need to wait until then and I can attract a woman. This happened most recently with my sister in conversation, but I've heard it many times.

Problem is that this amounts to people telling me I should just ""buy"" a future wife. I don't believe this is good at all. IMO there is absolutely no substitute for physical attraction for love to happen. Any relationship this could get me would be doomed to fail. I have seen this happen a lot, sometimes to those in my family. Money is secondary to the initial attraction. I would 100% end up on r/DeadBedrooms within a year and have an inevitable divorce if I married someone who only wanted my income. 

Basically, I just want people to say ""oh that sucks"" and move on when they hear about my failed dating life, rather than telling me this trope which is actually insulting my masculine identity, and is borderline sexist against women's self judgement.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ni3yx7/wish_people_stopped_telling_me_i_can_get_married/
87,ni43lj,1621634650,I rejected him a year ago but now I have a crush on him.,"So there's this guy from my class that I became really close with. Went out a couple of times, chatted until late, shared personal stories etc. Then one night , on one of our friends' birthday, he got drunk and confessed to me that he had romantic feelings and wanted a relationship. He absolutely caught me off guard so I came up with ""It's not that I don't like you I just don't wanna ruin our friendship. And I'm also not ready for a relationship rn."" Bear in mind that I've never been in a relationship before and I kinda got scared. In the morning he apologized and asked not to tell anyone. I respected his request and kept my mouth shut about what happened. Then he started ghosting me. Unfollowed me on all social medias and didn't talk to me at school at all. I wasn't talking to him either because I knew that in order to maintain our friendship he needed to get over me. After a while he started asking me for homeworks and that was all we talked about. And this went on for a year. In the meantime I started to realize that I may actually have a crush on him and was hoping that he might as well still have something. So I started taking action. I tried to carry on a casual conversation with him (not about school) multiple times but he was replying super dry. I kept trying even though it was a bit pointless. That was during quarantine when we were online schooling. A month ago we started going to school again and thence we started seeing each other every day. We started talking again and I was kinda getting my hopes up. One day we even sat together during all the classes and he was acting super nice and actually kinda filthy. Suddenly he started ignoring me again. A couple of days ago I asked him out and he said he was busy. Then after a few days I asked him out again but this time with a couple of our other friends and he said that he couldn't come AGAIN. He literally shows no interest in hanging out with me but all of my friends encourage me to continue trying even though I feel like giving up. He even leaves me on read whenever I send him a meme or something and he never did this before. So my question is what do I do now. I'm not sure if he knows what my intentions are but I'm really tired of trying to get his attention and show him that I'm interested. I rejected him in February last year...is it too late for a second chance? Should I keep going or leave him and try to move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ni43lj/i_rejected_him_a_year_ago_but_now_i_have_a_crush/
88,ni481i,1621635015,"If you're having bad sex, or not cumming. Its your responsibility to change it.","I've seen quite a lot of posts this year about women not being able to climax during heterosexual sex. Most of the posts have either concluded that this is 

1. Societies fault
2. Mens fault

In my opinion its:

3. Your responsibility to make sure you have the sex you want.

I think that if you're not having  the sex you want ,its  your responsibility to change it. You are the only person who knows your body. You are the only person who knows what makes you climax and what doesn't. If your partner doesn't give you the type of stimulation you need two things are possible:

1. You have not communicated your needs efficiently to your partner, in which case you should start communicating better.
2. Your partner is actually refusing to give you the stimulation you need, in which case you should get a different partner.

Either tell your partner what you like, (clitoral sex, penetrative etc. ) 

Or get a different boyfriend

Life is what you make it. Its not up to society to serve you want you want, you need to influence it. You have the power to influence it!

tl;dr 

If you're having bad sex, its your fault. You know your body. Its your responsibility to change the sex you're having.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ni481i/if_youre_having_bad_sex_or_not_cumming_its_your/

91,ni51gf,1621637438,Rules for Healthy Relationships,"For anyone tired of the PUA/dating-coach advice they often receive on subs like this one, here’s some real advice from an actual, living human being who’s not trying to make money off of you:

—-

Anyone ever notice how literally zero of the PUA/dating-coach types you see in promotional videos are engaged in happy, healthy relationships of their own when you look up their bios? Yeah... there’s a good reason for that. 

Look up how well Neil Strauss’s ‘The Game’ methodology worked for him. By around the time he met his wife he was a suicidal womanizer with absolutely nothing to show for years of ‘expertise’ in seduction and dating techniques, other than a long list of meaningless lays.

—-

Source: Can confirm all information below from personal experience, having dated somewhere between 60-70 partners throughout my 20s.

Last relationship lasted 3.5 years, ended amicably. Current relationship is at six-month point, going strong, and will likely end in marriage. Already looking for rings. She’s the one. Full stop.

——

I’ll keep this as short and sweet as possible.

Relationships cannot and should not be played like a fucking chess game. 

Anyone who does that is either WAY overthinking the process, or they’ve been convinced they should be overthinking it by a Neil Strauss-type who makes his money off of other people’s misery and loneliness.

Success in any relationship boils down to a few very simple, key rules:

1) Take daily care of your basic appearance and hygiene to ensure you’re projecting your best physical self.

2) Live your life, and if you’re single, make an effort to spend a lot of time in new places, meeting new and interesting people.

3) Treat people kindly and without pre-judging them.

4) If you KNOW you didn’t cause the mixed signals, arguments, or conflict, be patient with the other person and do NOT take anything personally or act out and make a fool of yourself. They’ll come around if they’re mature.

If you know you WERE the cause of the problems and want to work on the relationship, then apologize, promise to do better, and keep your promises.

5) If you’re in a committed monogamous relationship, be faithful/loyal to your partner, both physically and emotionally.

6) Be authentic, honest, and gentle about expressing your needs and who you truly are, deep down. People naturally admire and gravitate toward self-assured individuals, not someone who’s taking notes from a money-grabbing charlatan and wasting their emotional, physical, and spiritual energy trying to ‘win’ by treating complex human relationships like a chess game.

7) Don’t take yourself too seriously, and try to develop a sense of humor that you can employ as a last resort when ugly yet pointless confrontations arise. There’s nothing that can dissolve a toxic argument quite like a little light-hearted humor, as long as you aren’t mocking or belittling your partner.

**8) {CRUCIAL} Acknowledge and praise your partner when they make bids for your attention. Just like Dr. John Gottman (THE relationship expert) says, we all have a little child inside that craves attention and approval, especially from those we love. We ask our partners for this attention in all sorts of small, subtle ways. Learn to recognize and acknowledge your partners validation-seeking cues and acknowledge them as a person.

9) Learn to recognize and avoid obvious red flags. If something in your gut doesn’t feel right, LISTEN.

The type of dating advice based on ‘evolutionary biology’ takes notes from the way we mated when we were unevolved Neanderthals. 

Great strategies if you want to date a bunch of emotional Neanderthals anachronistically walking around on 21st-century Earth.

Rather poor strategies if you want a healthy, committed relationship with an evolved, well-adjusted individual.

Furthermore, any person who responds to the sort of emotional manipulation these dating coaches promote is likely suffering from some serious psychological baggage. 

Sure, you can manipulate someone with this baggage into fucking you a few times, but that doesn’t do much for either of you aside from adding another notch to your bedposts, and likely doing untold further damage to the person’s ability to trust their fellow human beings.

—-

You can either waste literally all of your mental real estate figuring out ways to trick people into fucking you until they see you for who you really are and dump you, or you can be loved for your authentic self.

Kind of a no-brainer.

94,ni5p6y,1621639522,Guys I’m humiliated,"The guy I like asked me on a 4th date by seeing if I wanted to go to dinner with him and then have a chilled night (implying going back to his). I’ve been under a lot of stress because of work and last night the worst cold sore of my life appeared. Just my luck right???!!! 

Anyway I replied to his message saying I don’t feel that attractive because I have a cold sore. Do you still want to take me to dinner? 🤣

The point of the message was to see if he is down to see me without any expectation of physical stuff. Also to see if he is a decent person because we’re all human at the end of the day with imperfections. 

He’s seen the message last night and not responded yet - he does works late night shifts and has a demanding job. Normally he does take a while to reply to me so this isn’t unusual. But I am freaking out and a bit anxious for being so vulnerable with him. 

How would you respond if someone you asked on a date said that to you??? 

One part of me is thinking I hope I haven’t shot myself in the foot. The other part of me is thinking I don’t want to date someone who can’t be sensitive and kind to another person and it’s better to find out earlier rather than later if he is a dick... right? Especially before feelings get involved.

Just before I turned 19 I got pregnant and had a beautiful and perfect baby boy. He's three now and he's just perfect. The love of my life. But his dad and I's relationship fell apart after he was born and we've been separated and coparenting for a little over a year.

He and I still talk a lot because we share a son but sometimes we talk more like friends or a couple would. Reality is I still have feelings for him. He's attractive, he's a good dad, but I remember how he was. Somedays he was a sweet guy and others he was angry and borderline abusive about nothing. It's how he handled stress.

I wonder if it's good for our son that he and I don't try to make something work. I live with my mom and my aunt and they both think I should try and mend things with him so our son can see his parents be together. He's asked me on a date a couple times on the past year but I told him no both times. Some days I want to get back with him and some days I can't stand the thought.
