0,ovj86t,1627781550,Would it be useful to have a BMI filter/search function in dating apps?,"I asked in a thread yesterday why there was no weight entry parameter on any dating apps. 

I was wondering why this wasn't included on any app, even though they ask loads of personal questions like your job, income, education, race, height, age, whether you want/have kids, etc. 

The replies were a mix of a few things:

* Women don't want to talk about their weight and the apps are designed to pull women in. Without women there are no men to profit off. $$$.
* Many people would not be able to do the mental analysis to figure out that  a woman who is 5'10"" and 150 lb is not overweight but actually still pretty trim. ie. The weights would get misinterpreted.

The first point maybe can't be avoided. But for the second point, what about an app that features BMI? If you enter your height and weight, it's trivial for the app to calculate and display your BMI. Then if you want to date someone with a similar body size you can search or filter by BMI, same as you can search or filter by age or anything else.

I know people like to talk about how BMI is not accurate because a bodybuilder would be calculated as overweight, but let's be real. There are very few ripped massive bodybuilders messing up BMI readings. Most people with a high BMI have a lot of body fat and that's it. 

Eg. For me to get to a BMI &gt;25 lean would absolutely require steroids. One of my most buff friends who women compliment on his physique all the time has a BMI of 23 and he's muscular and lean as fuck. So I don't really buy it when people say their BMI is 40 but it's because they're ""super fit.""

There is an obesity epidemic out there, not a bodybuilding epidemic, and if you care about that then it's relevant to consider in finding a partner.

Do you think this would be a plus or a minus?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovj86t/would_it_be_useful_to_have_a_bmi_filtersearch/

9,ovkhws,1627787023,Why we all cheat,"

If you are threatened by men seeking loveless relationships and one night stands, then turn to Facebook and ask yourself why so many beautiful women make themselves so available. 


Look traditionally women give sex to get love and men give love to get sex.


But why pursue love. We all seem to seek it but when caught in its grip we do whatever it takes to be released. To be lost in the fog of love sickness is it really fun. To hurt and painic at every perceived slight at every act of indifference. Venus had chains on her ankles and cupid had arrows.  They were the most feared of all gpds. Love creates slavery and pain. It makes you ridiculous to everyone who bears witness. It reverses every condition, cowards become lions, and lions will abandon any cause or person for love. The rich go broke and the pour reach for the stars. The sick are instantly cured and the healthy waste away. Who want jealosy of the very air your mate breaths. Perhaps you are too old to remember its taste, or to jaded by those forgettable loves. Then look to the teens and see the scars they bear and inflict. Only an idiot seeks it. It unfits you to everything else. And reduces you to a state your enemies will pity.


Want proff? Adam defied God and joined eve in damnation than bear to see her banish and die alone. When Paris was offered a bribe of wealth, renown in battle or love. He chose the kings wife Helen of troy and wrought a war on an epic scale. Mark Anthony abandoned his fleets to slaughter on a rumor of Cleopatra death and Caesar became Ceasar",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovkhws/why_we_all_cheat/

Got out of a 6yr relationship which was also my first one so I'm not experienced with this kind of thing.

I met this guy through Tinder and we haven't stopped talking since we matched. We both deleted Tinder a bit after we matched &amp; started texting too. I tried to let it die down because I felt that it wasn't going anywhere but he got the conversation started again so I decided to give him a chance. He finally invited me over to his place after a month of just texting but all we did was watch a movie and then he drove me home. I'm not the most forward with asking for sex &amp; I guess he wasn't either, but it was still a nice time because he was a gentleman.

The next day he still texted me so I guess he was still interested. But then he randomly told me that he hooked up with a girl he just met and how great it was &amp; I was fine with it because we're not really dating. I just wanted to move on from that conversation but he kept trying to drag that topic on and told me he was horny and had to get it out of his system. He also then opened up for the first time about his ex to me which was nice, but I'm still a bit confused. We couldn't get far on our date but you hook up with someone you just met?

Anyway, I stopped talking to him again because I don't want to just text &amp; wait around till he decides he's available for me to hang out with him &amp; go nowhere again. But he always initiates a conversation with me &amp; I can't help but reply because I do like him. I'm just reluctant now that once I do sleep with him, he might stop texting, even though I have a hunch he might like me too?

I guess I'm here for a guy's perspective? What are your motives for bragging to your potential dates about other hookups?

I already knew, but I didn't know for 100% with proof, after today's all day date, i found out she has been 100% talking about me to all her friends and family. Even sharing the selfies we took on our 3rd.

I'm. Also 100% positive, all her friends are married. She isn't. So I know she definitely feels left out there.

Thing is, she doesn't give off any signs that she isn't happy with the relationship and/or is unattracted to me, yet for some reason I can't help but worry i'm not good enough.

There sure are some underlying things. She seems a lot more put together than me and pretty much has all of her goals set out. I, on the other hand haven't really thought so much about my future.

I am also naturally a very anxious person, probably because i come from a pretty broken family background and have spent my childhood stepping on eggshells around my mother. I imagine i unintentionally bring some of that stuff into romantic relationships lmao.

Point is, I find myself worrying far too much that my gf doesn't like me as much as i like her, and that I have to kind of prove that i deserve her love.

17,ovm2jo,1627794011,What is up with women these days?,"Before I start I'd like to ask that only females give answers so that us men can understand your perspective. This is a great opportunity to help men understand your feelings or thoughts about why they strike out or why you simply aren't interested.

Hello mysterious internet people, my name is [redacted] and I have been single for a few years. I've had a girlfriend for about 3 months around 2019 and the relationship was mostly sex. It definitely wasn't perfect for reasons I won't go into. Anyways, I've been single for all my life except for that short 3 month stint. I've tried to put myself out there. I frequented a bar that I grew very comfortable at, I've tried complimenting random women, I've tried becoming more comfortable having conversations with strangers, I've tried dating apps and cold approaches but nothing really seems to work. Although I do feel more happy doing those things.

When I cold approach women I sometimes get numbers or some means to contact them but it doesn't lead anywhere. I don't feel like my situation is entirely hopeless but I've had a complete lack of luck in this area in my life. Older, non-relative women tell me I'm handsome, foreign women tell me I'm handsome, I've had a small number of hookups which I am very grateful for and a decent number of girls around my age have shown some amount of interest in me.
For whatever reason I haven't had much luck actually taking any of those women on actual dates or being exclusive. It has affected my self-esteem a bit but I challenge myself to go out there and keep trying.

This leads me to my question: What is the deal with women these days? I don't think this phenomenon has so much to do with men choosing not to date, because I'm sure there are more men willing to date then females choosing not to. I honestly believe that women are going through some unspoken change where they are avoiding men. I try to be responsible. I go to school, I work full-time, I've started focusing on my mental, emotional and general health. I notice there are alot of memes that are passed around that say ""men ain't shit"" but I want to think that I step up to the plate and try to be the man that I ought to be and the man a woman would want. I know I'm not entitled to a woman or sex but it would be nice to find a healthy relationship with a cool girl or at least date more.

There are lots of posts from men all over the internet that lament this same exact sentiment and many of those men all come to the same conclusion: The men who don't date lack status, wealth, looks, height. OR that since women have more options, they'd rather chase ""the top 'whatever' percent of men."" I strive to be a person who looks at things realistically and I want to cut through the Bull and ask you females straight up; what is it that you want? I know that girls have ""types"" and ""standards"" and that's good but unfortunately many guys fail to reach those standards. Honestly, nobody wants to be forever alone and humans have a desire for love and understanding. It's only natural that things be easier right?

And she is religious, and I am too, but she clearly has deep scars from her ex who pretended to be religious and she doubts I am (bc of that I assume), so she breaks up w me via text, then comes back, then says we can't be together, then says we can, then is super clingy and sweet and emotional one Saturday then Sun she is suddenly not at all and by Tues she is dumping me again via text out of nowhere saying she can't be with me. So, I tell her she's crazy via text bc she is all over the place and all my friends are like, ""red flags all over the place! she sounds nuts!,"" and I try to get advice from reddit about it and she probably read it and hates me, bc I tried to talk to her and she says ""leave me alone!"" and blocks me. And, deep down I doubt she cared for me at all or ever loved me to be honest, but I can't stop thinking about her 3 months later, and all I want to do is hear her voice and have her sit in my lap so I can hold her and put my face close to hers so she can tell me about her life and her new job and how she is.

How lame and embarrassing to even admit. How do you stop loving someone? Is there a trick I don't know? Is it possible? Do I even bother trying?  

It's like I had this amazing thing in my life for this short period, and she just switches from I love you so much to ""I am done"" out of nowhere, and then we immediately stop talking, and I am not dumb, I get that it sounds dumb, but it feels like she died. She might as well be dead to me, and it feels like a great loss that I am still suffering from. I lost my mom when I was in my 20s, and this, oddly enough, feels the same way. I wish I didn't still love her. But I do. But I need to stop.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovmzyl/how_do_you_stop_loving_someone/

But also, it really feels that way. I'm a 31m and have been single for 3 months. I decided to end my last relationship because of differences we failed to compromise on.

Online dating is just crushing me psychologically. I've met up with a couple girls, been ghosted, etc. The girls I've been most interested in always fizzle out and flake out just before meeting. Building a connection with another person feels like climbing Mount Everest. Soon I'll be in my mid 30s.

Idk. Working night shift by myself doesnt help. I go days without speaking to another human being. I just have time to meow at my cat and feed her, them sleep, then go back to work. 

I dont get it. I'm good looking, fun to be around, funny, make girls literally say ""lmfao"" in our chats, have my life settled. I realize these things are subjective, and I'm not trying to to be cocky. I just dont get it. Is this all there is? How is my life this way? Will it always be like this?

34,ovn41n,1627799052,I 22F Told my bf 23M that I love him two months ago and he didn’t say it back,"So basically I need some advice 😅
I told my bf of 8 months I love him, and well his reaction honestly devastated me. I knew there was a big chance he wouldn’t feel the same but all his actions made me think he would honestly. He always tries to look out for me and makes me feel safe and happy. We are two very different people but still. When I told him he told me he couldn’t say it (although he has been tempted to) because it means to him that he loves you as much as his own family. I understood that it just still hurt. Made me feel like all my confidence went out the window, I was constantly second guessing myself after and never brought it up again after. He could tell it hurt me but I can’t blame him he just wasn’t ready. But that was about two months ago and sometimes I find myself feeling like he never will. 
I have a bad sexual abuse past from my ex along with another instance during high school that involved sexual abuse  and we haven’t talked about yet along with other things caused from it that make me get anxious about our relationship. I feel bad but I just feel like I can’t fully open up to someone who doesn’t love and that I trust completely. I never show this to him because it’s not his baggage to deal with . He’s honestly the most respectful man I know and I love and admire him for that. 

I hate that I can’t get it out of my head that maybe he can’t love me because I haven’t opened all the way up to him because I’m scared of further rejection. I honestly never wanted to say those words to anyone again because I was scared of how I’d feel if the person I love can’t reciprocate it or if they’d feel like I’m too much to deal with because of my abusive past. I don’t want to rush him or anything it’s just it hurts because I really do feel like I put myself completely out there just to get hurt again.

The date was fine, lasted a bit over 2 hours I think, no red flags or dealbreakers noted. I dont think I was even 5 minutes out of the parking lot and i already had a text from him proposing an idea for a 2nd date. 

The lack of anything ""wrong"" means I'll go ahead with a 2nd date, but I'm a little concerned I guess that right now I don't feel a lot of excitement about it. I haven't had great past dating experiences. I tend to attach quickly &amp; I'm very anxious about relationships, and I get really addicted to the highs/lows of something that isn't stable.  For the past year I have strictly only pursued FWB type situations because I was tired of getting hurt. 

So I guess currently I'm very used to feeling intense feelings quickly.  I want to take this slow because of the way I attach. But I'm not like, counting down the days until I see this guy again. I'm not constantly checking my phone hoping to see a text from him.

36,ovn6r6,1627799432,How do I get a girlfriend??,"So at the time being, I just graduated high school and I’m not necessarily going to go to college but I will be going back to my high school for a special program where I will learn independent living skills. And yes I do have autism but I have overcame the majority of it throughout my life to the point that I have barely any.
So anyway I’ve been trying to find myself a gf for two years now and I’ve definitely made some mistakes but I’ve learned from them though, one example is not to be super obsessive and clingy. But with all of that aside though I still feel like I’m lacking a few things that could possibly get me a gf in no time. I’ve never flirted, I never know when I should talk to a girl, and probably some other stuff too. Something else that I hear though is that girls are heavily attracted to men who have a passion, and as of for me my passion is video games and not only that but making them is my dream job, but how am I supposed to show girls this though??
Also all of the girls that I ask out always say that they have a boyfriend and it’s really annoying, I mean it’s either that they just aren’t interested in me or that the person they are dating do a way better job at attracting women. So how do I get a girlfriend, when should I confront a girl and talk to her, what do I say to her, what are the best places to look for girls especially for a gamer like me(and please don’t say online because I’ve tried that and it was a complete waste of time), and lastly how do I get a girlfriend who is exactly my type without her saying she has a boyfriend??
For me I’m sort of a variety person, I’m going to name atleast one type of girl that I would love to be with.

43,ovno43,1627801971,I don't know if we kissed,"(18F) So like a month or two ago I had my first kiss with my crush. And well, as most people might have been thrilled, I feel kinda cheated. 

So long story short, I went on a trip with my friends and my crush was there. Later in the night, we all started drinking heavily (he was sober btw), keep In mind I hadn’t eaten all day. My crush kept handing me shots, and when I said no, he would tell me he would take me to my room since I couldn’t handle it. So I kept drinking, and progressively getting super drunk, and well he got kinda touchy :| 

(also side note, I was kind of scared to drink with him ever since we were at a party, and his best friend came up to me to ask me if my crush kept forcing me to drink). 

So I blacked out, the first time it was like for 10 minutes and I remember him standing me up and taking me to my room. I gave him a goodbye hug and he forced himself into my bedroom, “because he had to make sure I was fine”. Then everything kinda got blurry. I just remember memory jumps. Like him carrying me or him hugging me. I do remember in one moment, in where I tried to kick him out, and he pushed me into a wall and then felt his lips on mine. This is kinda weird because I remember the feeling yet I had my eyes closed like I wasn’t really there. 

He carried me and placed in my bed besides him and started touching my butt and I remember telling him to stop that I didn’t like that. He then got on top of me and kissed my neck. It went all blurry from there, but I remember feeling his lips against mine twice, before I started shaking and calling out for my friend. I really don’t know why I started calling out for her, but I remember being terrified. (Side note, I remember him asking me, when he was on top of me, if I was scared :p)

He called my friend and we called it a night, but I was left confused. Did or did it not happen. When I began sobering up, I remember telling my friend, I think I had my first kiss. But then when I asked my ex crush what had happened, he said nothing happened, that he only took me to my room. I have been so confused, because yes I did black out several times, but I remember my body yelling out for help when I was uncomfortable. I also remember, me telling him off when he was being touchy, plus my bed smelt like his perfume. Yet he denied everything. He never told me what happened, or my friend, which is his best friend. And to be honest I was going to brush it off like a dream, until he told me that drunk people always do what they want to do sober, but little does he know I am an asexual.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovno43/i_dont_know_if_we_kissed/

45,ovnyfp,1627803547,How do I get over my fear of marriage?,"I (25F) don’t have a partner and have been single for just over 2 years now, and granted I probably shouldn’t be freaking out about something that’s maybe or maybe not in my future. But even though it might not be that often that I think about it, it still creeps up every now and then so it is an issue. 

I will happily date and stuff, meet people and go out on dates but, I’m not actively dating for marriage or security. I date because I know what I want and would love to experience life with someone else, and to grow as a person and finally give all that love I have to someone else. 

I know that marriage is something that is something that a lot of people strive for, but for me, I dread it. Mainly because my dad died, 11 years ago now, he was an alcoholic and while he did rehab many times he kept relapsing and knew he wouldn’t make it and even told me so. 

Even if I did meet someone who I completely fell in love with, they could ask me to marry them and I’d probably say yes. But the closer it gets, I’d freak out, because I know that my dad would not be there to walk me down the aisle. He would not be there for the father/daughter dance. While I realise I’m luckier than most as I have a stepdad who practically raised me, it would still feel totally wrong even going through with it knowing he wasn’t there. 

Even though my stepdad and brother have both said they’d walk me down the aisle, I’d still feel incomplete and a huge amount of sadness, and if people see a bride breaking down on her wedding day, that wouldn’t be a good look. I have completely dealt with his death and moved on, but this is just something I feel I may not be able to do. Not a lot of things make me cry, I’m quite a strong person and am pretty much classed as the therapist/strong girl among my friends. So I’d absolutely also hate to see my family &amp; friends to see me in such a state. 

This is one of my skeletons in the closet, no one knows how I feel about this, it’s just something so close to my heart I couldn’t share this with people who know me as they’d see me differently &amp; damaged. This is what scares me about dating, cause what if I meet that one person, and it happens, I could communicate my worries, but eventually, the guy would get tired of waiting.

52,ovorig,1627808052,Date with coworker. Totally confused...," \[disclaimer: I am not working the US. Dating between coworkers is very normal where I live\]

So, I invited a coworker (lets call her Tina, 32 y/o) on a coffee date at my place. We have been joking and laughing a lot at work in the past couple of months and she would ask for my advice several times each day, which she had not done in the months before \[I suppose she did so to be near me and get my attention\]. Anyway, the date went well (at first). We hit it off, she was super bubbly and relaxed. We were sitting on a huge lounge sofa facing each other. At some point during the date I moved closer, so while we were still facing each other, we were close enough to touch. I playfully slapped her hand or knee when she would tell me something funny or goofy and she seemed receptive to it. At some point I just kept my hand on her lower leg and gently rubbed it while she was talking. I kept it there for maybe a minute. Again, she was smiling and laughing and did not seem to mind. Anyway, about 30 minutes later she abruptly decided to leave. I asked her if I had moved too close, but she denied. Anyway she was basically out of my apartment within 60 seconds. I was somewhat shell-shocked, as I did not expect this at all. On previous dates with other women, this had never happened.

The week after the date, we were in home office, but the two of us had 2 Zoom meetings. She would no longer give me flirty eyes, but rather a """"I do not care about you romantically"" look"". She would not smile or laugh at my jokes. She was a stone-cold professional, but not angry or dismissive! I thought it was over. 2 weeks after our initial date, the two of us had to meet in person to talk about some work-related projects. So, I suggested ""lets meet at 3 pm"". I did not specify where and I assumed it would be our office. Anyway at 2:30 pm she texted me saying ""I will be at your place in 25 minutes"". When she came in, she was back to her bubbly self and flirtatious and all. I ordered some food and we were talking private stuff before we started working on the project. During the project work, she would be flirtatious and laughing a lot. After I came back from the bathroom, I noticed one of her buttons on her shirt has opened up showing a little bit of skin and bra. Anyway, since this was now a work meeting and she acted so cold the week before, I did not want to make another move on her. I did touch her arm for a split second at some point out of reflex and she did not seem to mind.

So, long story short, I do not know what to make of it. I am somewhat scared to make another physical move, since it went so bad the last time. Does she just need more time? Is it realistic to wait for her to make the next move and touch me? Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovorig/date_with_coworker_totally_confused/

**An Important detail**: we’ve never met, just talked on Snapchat and Facetimed, because he lives 400 miles away from me. He found me randomly on social media. It had to be just a fun way to connect with someone far away.

We’ve talked for 2 months in total now, we like each other’s company but realized we can never actually meet. and I disclosed to him that I think of applying for a college semester exchange and one may be in his state.

He got super happy, was like “you better home here” and said stuff like “if you came I’d definitely want to take you out”. We’ve been flirting a lot and he always compliments me and seems genuinely interested, although sometimes bit sexual (suggestive pics, but I guess that’s normal for young guys, he’s 24?)

The next days he doesn’t really text as much as earlier or put effort in the conversation.

Basically a tl;dr of what happened

She went rogue for 3 days so I contacted her asking what’s up. She blew up and said how she’s got a lot going on and needs to take some time for herself. She repetitively said “I want to stay good friends” and “Just because we won’t “talk” doesn’t mean you won’t be my friend”.

A month goes by and it’s her birthday so I text her “happy birthday”. Nothing. I thought okay maybe she didn’t see it.

Few weeks go by and I was going through some old stuff and came across something of hers and wanted to text her and see how’s she’s doing so I say “Hey it’s been a bit how are you doing” thinking okay if she doesn’t respond I’m just not going to contact her she clearly doesn’t want to be friends but then bam she blocks me.

I felt bad about feeling a connection, because I never planned these meetups to be about dating or meeting a love interest.

I tried scheduling another meetup yesterday with the ones that have joined previously; only she and I had the time. She proposed we stay at her place… Well one thing led to another and we really had a crazy connection and while we both verbally agreed that we’d want something to happen, we ended it at one kiss. I respected her boundaries, but it was hard not flirting with her - despite her saying she has commitment fears of any kind and usually just ghost people then.

That brings us to today. She seems very put off and cold when I text her and there’s hours between replies.. I feel like I fucked up and overstepped.

93,ovttus,1627830633,4 Year relationship and recurring fights over marriage.,"My first post here!   

So, I was married for 20 years and right after my divorce I was sitting at a neighborhood wine bar and met a woman who lived a few blocks away.   

I was newly separated and we started dating.  She had been divorced for a few years already and had dated quite a bit.  

I’m fit and super easygoing.  Very loyal and very affectionate.  She and I became serious but now she brings up marriage often and gets really pissy about it.  

Last night we had a major fight over it.  We were at a friends for dinner with multiple couples and I walk in and I could tell things were awkward and that I felt I was being talked about.  So, I asked what was up?

GF says, “Well I was telling them to ask you what we are doing for our anniversary and when are you going to marry me?”.   She had been acting mopey and pissy all evening so I knew what was bothering her.

I clammed up and just wanted to leave but didn’t drive so I was seething.

Finally in the other room I ripped her ass about putting me on the spot like that.  We said some pretty ugly things to each other and I didn’t stay with her last night and we haven’t spoken or texted today.

We get along and the sex is amazing -but I’m wondering if I just need to cut and run.  I’ve asked her to move in together, buy a place together, whatever but it isn’t enough - she wants to get married.

I can’t take these recurring bouts of pouting and fighting.

I've met a girl (25F) online from the same country as me, and our ""type"" of people are very rare, so I approached her with intentions of mostly being friends, and we just talked about how life in US is different, etc.   


We hit it off, we got lots in common and I asked her to meet in person, and we did. We had a good time and the ""date"" lasted way longer than it should have, but I drove her home and said that I had fun and would like to do it again sometime.   


The next day she messaged me and started asking questions that are a tad specific, and obviously she was letting me know that she's into me. Sent me pretty suggestive memes. 

And she's a fun, smart and an adorable girl that has a great career in a medical field, and honestly that's something I would love in a partner, BUT the issue is she's 5'2 and very petite. And I'm a 5'10 stocky guy and every time I try to imagine us having ""fun time"", it just feels like I'm thinking about doing it with a child.   


But I still want to be friends with her, so how do I best tell her this without making her feel like I don't take her seriously as a woman.

98,ovu7ab,1627831883,Should I tell him how I feel?,"(throwaway for obvious reasons)

So I (22F) met this guy (23M) on the first day of college (about 5 years ago now) and we became good friends pretty quickly. About a year in he told me he had feelings for me and I told him I didn't feel the same but that I was glad he was able to tell me and that I still wanted to be friends. It was a little awkward after that and we didn't talk much for a few months but eventually we got back into our rhythm.

Fast forward a couple of years to when Covid hits and we all get sent home from college. We started to text all the time and I realized that I really missed him and started to develop feelings for him. Ever since last year we text almost every day and we talk about virtually everything, including complaining to each other about our dating app struggles and how we'll get married in 10 years if we're both single.

I'm really conflicted if I should tell him how I feel for a few reasons. The first is that I'm not sure if I actually like him or if I just think I do because he's my best guy friend and I've been really lonely this past year. On the other hand, I suffered from debilitating anxiety and panic attacks in college which made it hard to focus on anything else besides doing well in school, which is maybe why I didn't realize my real feelings for this guy when he told me he liked me back then.

The other thing is I don't want to ruin our friendship by telling him how I feel because he's one of my best friends and I can't stand the thought of losing him. Also, he lives across the country so even if we did both like each other we would have to be in a long distance relationship.

I've been on dating apps for months and I've only liked a few guys because I just keep comparing them to this guy and thinking about how we won't understand each other like he and I do.

I've been thinking about this nonstop for the past few weeks and I'm just so conflicted. I could also just ask him if he still likes me but I feel like that would make things awkward.
