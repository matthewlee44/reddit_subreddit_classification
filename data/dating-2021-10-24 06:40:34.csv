1,qeqo1p,1635076396,Having trouble knowing whether I should walk away from an oversharing guy who likes me a lot.,"I have a history of dating walking red flags, and I've been in some shitty, (pretty abusive sometimes) relationships because of it. I got dumped after almost 2 years in August and recently I decided to get back on Tinder just to try and meet people and have fun.

I met this guy on tinder at the start of October who I find really attractive, and I thought it was just going to be a one time thing or fwb. The date was fine, I wasn't really even sure he liked me that much, but then he kept texting me.

First, I had an issue with his boundaries. Mainly, he doesn't have any. He talked about his troubled past like the first five minutes (he's 5 years sober, was homeless and a meth user) which I understand if you're trying to weed out the people who wouldn't date you. It's all that came after.

After that date, we texted all day everyday. He almost always initiates, he's always texting me or dm-ing updates of his day and sending pictures at work. He's always oversharing about his boss and coworkers and life. Ffs he send me a photo of a blister on his foot after we've been talking for less than a month after he went on a run.

He's also always trying to hang out, and I've made sure we don't more than once or twice a week. He's repeatedly said he really likes me, which I appreciate it but he's taking it WAY too fast. Especially since he also got out of a short term relationship ( I think it as 2 or 3 months with another girl) back around when I was dumped.

Do I like him? Yes, I think the ""normal amount"" you like someone after going on 3 dates and having great sex. He is very nice when we hang out, and I can tell he really likes me and is starting to care about me. But, he recently asked me to be his girlfriend out of the blue and I said we needed to talk about this in person. He responded with ""Yeah of course no problem. No rush though, I don't want to scare you away. Usually, the roles are reversed and I'm the one getting spooked by dating."" Which just sounds like a back track to me. I don't even know if I want a boyfriend right now, and in my opinion there is no way he can know if he wants to date me seriously considering the short time we've been hanging out. 

I've never had a guy like me, to be honest. In a normal way. I've had men use me, and love bomb me. I've only ever been in healthy relationships with women or non-binary people. So having a guy like me is like a little out of my usual lane and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, or if I'm acting appropriately or if I should run for the hills with this guy. 

tl;dr: met a guy on tinder who is very nice but a massive oversharer and moving things way too fast. I'm not sure if to walk away or try and work things out. I'm not very good at recognizing red flags.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeqo1p/having_trouble_knowing_whether_i_should_walk_away/

I am surprised by how hookups even happen nowadays, especially outside of dating apps. Considering the toxic, negative materials in the media that should make women a whole lot apprehensive and not willing to have romance and sex with men.

There's also their past bad experiences like exes, trauma, their friends' and family's experiences in dating, the lyrics in music, The News, movies etc, etc it gives them  unfavorable persception of men in general.

Despite all this, there are men out there who have the ability to meet women in real life, make them feel comfortable, at ease and hooked/interested. They can get their numbers and women will be more than looking forward to meet. Of course sex also happens.  All this happens so naturally that I have to ask the ladies, if that has ever happened to you and what made you say ""yes"" to them.

7,qermhu,1635080157,When is it time to give up and move on?,"Hi all,

So I (23M) ended my 2 year relationship about 4 months ago and have moved on. However, i have never experienced dating or asking a girl out. My ex and i were friends and we just naturally developed feelings for each other.

Anyways, I met this super cute girl at a restaurant near a place i work at. She instantly captivated me as i walked pass the restaurant and saw her standing there. I did a loopy and came in the restaurant to grab some food with the intention of interacting with her.

This was my first time in my life trying something like this so please be easy on me lol. We had limited interaction because she was the only waitress and it was lunch time. I made small talks with her and that was it.

She was real mature and (once again) super cute. I came back in the evening to get take-away (and to interact with her more) but once again it was limited. However, i got to know a bit about her which was nice.

Anyways, a week later (i only go to the office once a week for now), i went back to the restaurant and there she was again. This time she had a really cute Kimono (Japanese dress) on. I interacted with her (albeit limited again) and learned a bit more about her. I did the same in the evening. I found out that she was in her final year of High School (which is about 17 to 18 yo) so i was a bit scared of asking her out.

The next day, on the weekend, I did some stalking and found her Discord ID so i decided to message her (i kinda really regret it now) and asked if she was open to dating someone 23 yo. She never responded so i thought thats a rejection and that was the end of that chapter.

However, I literally cannot get her out of my head and i want to try asking her in real life.

A wise man once told me that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, but I am scared if I am making her uncomfortable or whether i should not.

8,qermv0,1635080195,Plutonic hangout or something more?,"Hey everybody, as a man I horribly inept at understanding the minds of women so I thought I would get some opinions on here.

&amp;#x200B;

It was recently my birthday and my Facebook feed was blowing up with people wishing me a happy birthday. This girl that I've known for about 20 years, since we were teenagers, wished me a happy birthday and said that it would be great if we could hang out sometime. The strange thing is that we never really were close, even though I have known her for such a long time. We had mutual friends and were friendly to each other, but we have literally never just spent time together just the 2 of us.

&amp;#x200B;

This girl is great. She's smart, she's absolutely beautiful, she has an amazing job but it is demanding (lawyer). So I figured why not, and I sent her a message saying that I would love to get together sometime. She was very enthusiastic about getting together and we made plans to hang out at my place one evening. She even said she would bring pizza and a bottle of wine.

&amp;#x200B;

The day came and she ended up cancelling due to work stuff. So we rescheduled for this week upcoming.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as the title states, is this a platonic hangout? Is she dipping toes in the water to see if we have a connection? Or am I completely overthinking this? This girl is very outgoing and is definitely not short on having friends.

12,qesi1x,1635083249,I imagined a perfect date. Then it happened. Now I don't know whats wrong.,"Hello everyone,

so I have a crush on a girl that I know from work. Of course I tried to keep it professional since approaching a woman at work can be difficult or missunderstanding. I still managed to get her number and arrange a date. Actually she did because she asked for having dinner with me. I was surprsied since these things happen rarely (to me). I was very happy about that and really looking forward to it. 

The day came, we met in a town nearby and went to a nice little restaurant. We had a good time, talked and laughed a lot and also had some deeper talk. She sometimes touched me ""casually"". By that time we already had killed a bootle of wine together. Since it was quiet late I asked if we should leave. She said that she wanted to stay longer and that we should just go to another bar. ""Great!"" I thought since that is a confirmation that things are going fine. 

In the next bar she insisted to sit next to me. So we have been even closer to eachother, even talked about some sexual topics, had another cocktail and then it happned: I only once managed to kiss a woman that I had a REAL crush on in my life before. The other times I would often be too afraid, not the right situation, whatever... Took all my courage and kissed her. She was a little suprised but liked the kiss/kissed me back. We spent the rest of the night in the bar laughing, talking, kissing. She grabbed my hand in the bar and on our way home. We hugged and kissed again for goodbye. Best. Feeling. Ever. 

Why am I telling all those details? Because that date was the perfect date I imagined for me and my crush. Of course it's only my point of view but there is really nothing I would have done differently. So now my problem is the following: On that same night we exchanged a few short messages (just ""good night"" messages). The next day I let her know that I really enjoyed the meeting and I would like to see her again.  And she did not really react to that at all. We continued texting a bit about the weekend and that we both have lots of things to do. Now she left me on read for more than a day.

I know that there is a huge insecurity in me. Also I know that although I thought things were perfect she may think otherwise or changed her mind due to whatever reason there could be. What I don't get is: Why would she just leave me on read and don't refer to another date at all? Even if she has lots of things to do and may changed her mind. Why not just let me know? Why not even a message about ""I need some time / I'm busy / Don't want another date..."".

So I'm just curoius, how would you react? I do not want to write another message because I don't want to appear needy and also don't see any good reason. I fear that I somehow messed up this ""perfect"" situation. I know there might be no good advice for me but maybe someone wants to share a similar experience and how it worked out.

27,qetuhw,1635087642,"Guy kissed me after date, mentioned 2nd date, ghosted me later"," I am SO upset. I went on a first date with a guy on Friday to a really nice bar. It was a little awkward at times because we were both pretty quiet at times. Anyway he offered to walk me back after and he did since it was so late and he was a gentleman. He kissed me after and said he‚Äôd love to do this again and take me out again sometime and I agreed. He even texted me again that night saying he‚Äôd love to see me again. I texted back saying something like ‚Äúthank you so much. That sounds great. Let me know.‚Äù No response all day. I texted him again later to try to sound more enthusiastic in case it didn‚Äôt come off that way, and asked when and still got no reply at all. At this point I am feeling sort of played and I honestly just dropped him. I have a repeated pattern in dating where men ask me on a nice, classy first date and sometimes mention seeing me again but it never ends up turning into a second date. They never text me back after the date. I am not sure what‚Äôs going on and I definitely check myself to see if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm doing but I can‚Äôt find anything wrong. I do meet these men through bumble. I feel like shit about dating because Im always told that I‚Äôm so beautiful and pretty. I‚Äôm in very good shape and work out, am very slender. I am soft spoken and kind, elegant, and like really nice things a lot, have a great career and great things going on, and I‚Äôm very feminine. Yet I can‚Äôt seem to succeed in dating and actually lock someone down. This guy from Friday was the first to even mention seeing me again. By the way he did mention some insecurities while on the date like how he apparently isn‚Äôt taken as seriously as older men with more money, and also something weird he said was that he doesn‚Äôt enjoy talking to people... Additionally, one other thing I noticed is that most of these men who never bother asking me out again seem to have less going on, make less than me, and we don‚Äôt connect super well on an intellectual level.

35,qeu84w,1635088797,My ex gf blcoked me,"

So hello guys, i kinda need some advice.
As you can see from the title my ex gf blocked me on social media. 
So a little background history, i broke up with her 2 years ago because she lied to me (some other stuff too but the lying was the last straw) i still loved her at the time but i had to do it. So i didn‚Äôt speak with her like 6 months after that. 
So i ended up contacting her after those 6 months, because i don‚Äôt know i didn‚Äôt want to end on bad terms with her, she still was an important person in my life. I don‚Äôt know if that was a mistake because we ended up hooking up (i swear that wasn‚Äôt my intention) and she started saying that she still loved me and couldn‚Äôt just be friends with me it would be too weird for her. I obviously still liked her too, but i didn‚Äôt want to make the same mistakes, so i said we could se each other some times (without doing anything) and see if we changed and if it woul work if we tried again.
So after seeing her a couple of times, she went could with me and would just text me like every second month or so and sometimes she even left me on read and everything. So i am not really a guy that chases girls so i let her do her thing and i did mine.(it still hurt me of course, but i didn t show my weak side) long story short, she started contacting me more often again and wanted to see me more often, and i of course didn‚Äôt forgot how she was with me so i was getting now colder with her, so after she insisted and called me often to set a date to see eachother and i eventually agreed, but here is the funny part she cancelled on me the day that we were suppose to see eachother. That really pissed me off so i started not responding at all to her. I‚Äôm not gonna lie these last months i didn‚Äôt even think a lot about her, i was in a good place focusing about myself. So my birthday came like two weeks ago, and she came to my work(bc i didn‚Äôt respond to her textes) to wish me a happy bday, i was very cold with her that day. And she kept asking me why i was ignoring her, but i really didn‚Äôt gave her an answer for that, i said she should know that the things that she does have consequences. 
So after that, she contacted me friday saying that she would stop contacting me if i wanted to, i found that stupid, i said to her that i don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs mad bc we had not talked very much these lasts months. She said than something like: ok it‚Äôs good i will not bother you anymore. ( which i left her on read) and then she blocked me.

I know this sounds a bit stupid, and the oubvious answer is to let her go , but it kinda hurt me when she blocked me like we were breaking up again. I really thought i was over her, but i don‚Äôt know for sure now. I didn‚Äôt contacted her since. 

She really isn‚Äôt perfect and i am not either, but the reality is that i have not found a girl and shared a strong connection as with her.

But after a while of her trying to reach out to me, I told her the truth. I told her that I‚Äôm really not a good person because I ghosted her and she should look for someone better than me because I‚Äôm not worth it. I told her about the girl I‚Äôm in love with. However, she kept insisting that she doesn‚Äôt mind and that we can still be friends. I just feel really guilty so I just left a really long message that I‚Äôm leaving because she deserves better.

My mother stood by and watched my sister and I get abused and beaten and she was powerless. She was too scared to speak out against him||. I am in no way promoting the idea that women are worthless; I just included this anecdote because it's relevant to the current predicament. Fast forward to college where I was extremely shy and experienced more trauma because I learned from my mother not to stand up for myself if situations make me uncomfortable.

In college I tried to talk to guys and started a romantic relationship with a couple of them. But it always ends the same way. The other person ends up significantly invested in me while I feel emotionally numb and unable to connect with my partners. And then the relationship fizzles out because I cannot reciprocate feelings of love. I also feel as though it's truly impossible to get to know someone and that human connection is a beautiful illusion. Maybe my trauma is just too deep for me to form romantic connections.

To summarize everything? He didn't really want ME, or a relationship with ME. He basically wanted an instant stepmother out of me so he could use me as leverage to get custody of the kid.

I told him on no uncertain terms to fuck off. I'm not getting within ten miles of his legal mess bullshit. Not going to happen, fullstop. If he wants a nanny for his brat, then he can go fucking hire one, because I am not available in that capacity.

49,qevgue,1635092595,Embarassing shit (literally),"Ugh. Looking to vent and curious how many others this has happened to  ... 

I (52f) have a new FWB (48m) that I met through OLD. We've only been in bed together twice, the 2nd time being last night.  The man has stamina, lasting power etc. (That will be relevant in a minute.)  

We did a lot of talking before we got into bed the first time about likes, dislikes, etc. One dislike we both agreed about is anal sex (amongst other things).  

So, last night, at one point I was fully satisfied and exhausted, muscles in legs &amp; arms were worn out, I did not want to move. I said I was tired, worn out, etc.  He'd stuck a finger in my anus, which I was surprised but I did not object.  So, after I say I am tired, he tries to put his penis in there. I say no.  He respects that. We move on. 

At the eventual end of our interlude, he says "" ooops.  Looks like someone had an accident.""  Being a squirter, I presume he's talking about his soaking wet bed, but then I realize he's not.  I had pooped a tiny little bit due to the strength of the orgasm contraction and him having explored back there.  üò≥

He didn't seem too upset. I cleaned up myself and the bed but I was mortified.  Talk about killing the post sex ""glow!""  

We did talk briefly about it before I left, because I brought it up. In the short conversation I explained that this is one reason I'm not into anal and also that I hadn't prepared for anal (i.e. enema).  Again, he didn't seem too upset. But I am still really embarrassed.

On the second, she asked me what I was looking for, and I said a relationship, to which she said ""me too"".  Fast forward a couple weeks, she brings it back up and says that while she likes me, and wants to continue ""going on dates"", she's coming off a long relationship and isn't ready for another one.  She wants to keep things casual.  

I'm not sure what to make of this because she was very adamant that she likes me- its just the wrong time for her.  But what I'm having a hard time with is that she's reversing course from what she said earlier.  That alone has damaged the trust I felt with her, and really makes me feel like there's something else going on.  Maybe she feels we're moving too fast, or she wants to play the field a little more, or has simply lost interest.  

When I say I'm looking for a relationship, I mean that I want to build one up, and so I'm perfectly fine with it starting out casual.  But there are many ways people define casual relationships.  So far, all we've done is meet up somewhere, do something for a few hours, then go our separate ways.  We've kissed and touched and said romantic things to one-another, and so far its been a natural progression.  I want that progression to continue, but it feels like she's pumping the brakes.  

Would like to know what someone else makes of this.  


Also, might be worth mentioning, at some point since meeting me she has snoozed her bumble account.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qewz81/she_wants_to_continue_going_on_dates_but_isnt/

For context, I'm 29 M. I am going on a 2nd date with a girl this afternoon. We are going for a walk around town and playing somewhat of ""I spy"" or a scavenger hunt. 

My problem is that I have no physical experience with dating. I've never held a girl's hand, never kissed a girl, etc. I feel like that if you don't do anything physically by the 2nd date, the assumption would be that I'm not interested- but I don't know how to do any of that! 

Assuming the date is going well, how do you kiss someone? I'm not a super touchy/feely person in general and it doesn't really come natural to me. Should I tell her about my lack of experience first?

66,qexeu3,1635098418,Dating a girl with Issues with her dad,"Now I know I might get a lot of hate due to using the term ""daddy issues"" but let's just sa my girlfriend had a not so good relationship with her father. He's still present in her life, she still lives with her parents, but she has been verbally and physically abused by her dad.

She's also faced sexual harrasment in school from different guys.

She's 19 currently. I'm 24. We started dating 8 months back. Now while I won't actively go out searching for someone younger, we both met at a workplace (she's working to support her studies). She had a crush on me, asked me out, we started hanging out and eventually got attached. It's her first ever relationship, including first kiss everything. I've been in relationships before.

Things are super great between us but I wonder what possible impact her issues with her dad/sexual abuse might have. I don't mean to ask this to stereotype her or use it to leave her. I wanna understand it better to be supportive.

One thing is, she's pretty close to her mom. I've met her parents. But when I met them, she told me later, that she felt her mother was flirting with me (beleive me she wasn't). Similarly she is afraid to make her elder sister meet me (because she thinks her sister will flirt with me)

Overall, our compatibility and chemistry is great, both emotional and physical. So maybe I'm just overthinking.

We hit it off right away which is rare for me because I feel like it‚Äôs difficult for me to connect with most people. Everything just clicked, I was attracted to him on a physical and emotional level. I never get both. We had FaceTimed a couple times and set up a day to meet. I really truly felt that he was very interested in me and he said endearing and lovely things. We were on the exact same wavelength. The day before we plan to meet I talk to him a bit in the morning, he initiates conversation and tells me that he is going to a family thing but he wants me to know that he is so excited about meeting in person the next day and that he‚Äôll be thinking of me more than a little. I say that I feel the same. I think it‚Äôs kind of strange that he‚Äôll be completely out of reach when he is going to see his family, but I think, maybe he really just wants to be present for them and I respect that. Later on in the evening I texted him asking about a restaurant we should check out, message shows delivered but no reply, and nothing for rest of the night. I am a busy person, I go about my business as usual, not concerned. I wake up the morning and I see that I had a missed FaceTime call from him at 1:30AM. That‚Äôs weird. I figured it was an accident. I text him to confirm some details and no response. My messages are also not showing delivered. I have a creeping feeling something is wrong. I should be leaving soon and text him twice more. Undelivered messages. 
I think maybe his phone is broken, this can‚Äôt be happening‚Ä¶ then did he block me?! I tried emailing and texting from another number and nothing. I am fucking beside myself right now.

76,qeydpu,1635101236,"Girlfriend is broke , has no plans , and has no direction or income stream yet wants to travel and live with me","I met this girl while living overseas and she is nice cute funny and all . However I am starting to see major red flags as we come closer to meeting again - here is some context 

* We both are about to turn 20 
* i am an up and coming online content creator in tech and finance   
* She does palm reading and spiritual stuff -
* My parents grew up dirt poor and raised me to work like hell for anything i want 
* Her parents are business owners and grand parents are kind of rich 
* i went overseas with a purpose a plan and intent (also to have some fun along the way)
* She traveled with no purpose no plan and 0 direction
* She wants to be famous literally just to be famous - so she is almost like addicted to social media always showing and sending me things that make me feel like my brain is shrinking when I can go months with out consuming any social media yet posting almost every day on it
* I dont seek fame but I want to provide value to people and the world - indirectly causing me to reach millions of people and build a decent fanbase -
* I can be very social and have 0 problem talking and connecting to people however i do it every damn day online dealing with all types of people good and bad so I can go very long periods of time with out being social irl because i just need mental space . My family is like this as-well we are close but we do our own thing mainly
* she is also very social and so is her family but its like insanely social to me . Always eating and doing stuff together every single week - my family will do it every other month or so 
* I know to an extent what i want out of life - i have goals dreams and people to take care off and people to pay homage to and it goes beyond just me and my time on this earth 
* She is doing an internship - which she postponed for 1 year to be with me - but is only doing it for her parents and beyond that she doesn't really know 

Here is my problem i like her but when I met her I was kind of having too much fun and wasn't really on my purpose . Basically I was on vacation but doing some work . She was doing some stuff here and there but we just did our own thing then kicked it with each other in the evening . However i am now trying to start a company with some people and grow what im already doing so I can be very established by the time I am 30 years old . So i picked up a job in my town so i can put all that money toward starting the company . I made a bad investment decision that cost me 300K and I am way to young to get a big loan from a bank and my parents are neck deep in bills . Only options i have are to cry about it or go make any extra money  I can to raise capital . But this girl is going to borrow money from her grandparents to live with me and she wants to basically recreate the same vibe we had when we met and travel and stuff . Mind you she has no money , no online job , and no plan . So I talked to her about it and guess what ..... she got mad at me . I didn't ask what she wanted to do with her entire life or what she will eat on may 23 2055 . I  just wanted to know what she has planned to do while she is with me you know ... before she flies across the globe to a foreign land where she cant work and borrows money for something that has 0 ROI . She said ""what if you make all these plans and we break up "" and I dont see how she cant see that we literally could spend a day or two planning that very thing . What scares me is that planning is the easy part ,taking action and being persistent with that plan is what really sucks so if someone cant even plan how can they take consistent action ?? I have tried including her into what I do and it wont work ... she doesn't know what a portfolio is or what an asset is or how to connect bluetooth to a laptop . She even sometimes said while I tried to involve her into the tiniest things "" Just remember .... 50/50 ""

Can any woman please tell me what they would do if the roles were reversed in this situation and i was doing what she is doing???

Yes yes I know we are super young but that is the problem . It does not seem like the relationship we will have irl is even a real relationship . Like what is a relationship with no intent on marriage , kids , or even a six month plan for the future not a plan together but at-least just for oneself . Our prefrontal cortex is probably not fully developed and its sad most people my age just live in the now and thats fine every now and then for me . However I am not going to emotional invest in a "" In the moment "" relationship . I will just have to have fun with her and if it doesn't work out... I will only look at girls my age as solely for fun until one of them proves other wise , Or is that a bad approach to viewing young woman?

We  have been talking for several weeks. I did tell him at the beginning,  that I really hate when things stay online forever, and it never goes  into the real world. I want to go out and have some coffee with the  other person, meet them, get to know them for real, instead of having  this endless back and forth texting.

Despite  that, we texted for weeks. He never actually asked me out. I took the  initiative and asked, on several occasions, whether he would be  interested in meeting in person. He would always divert the topic  elsewhere, or play off my question.

Today  I asked him again, is meeting in real life something he would like to  do at all? And he said ""We can meet if you want to.""  A few weeks back  when I asked this same question he said ""I'm not against meeting in  person..."". But we never met after that...

My  thing is, when you look at these responses, he really doesn't seem  eager at all. ""We can meet if you want to"" is not ""Yes, I would like  to"". Do you get me?

Out of annoyance and frustration with him in the moment, I called the whole thing off. I felt like we would never actually meet.

I  suppose it's done now, and I can't go back, but I have an inkling that  I've overreacted. What are your thoughts on this situation?

84,qez95s,1635103786,Why try when the world is so unfair?,"I sometimes wonder what is the point of trying so hard in dating when the world is unfair with the results. Like, I am currently 28. I have only had online gfs and just kissed a couple of girls, never had sex. Most of my friends are younger than me since I went to college when I was a bit older than the regular college student, and most of them are in a long-term relationship, have no issue with getting into one or having sex already. I am complaining about being a virgin, but I only want to have sex in a long-term relationship though. Either way, I sometimes wonder what is the point of trying. I am old and have issues with dating when babies have no issues. That is like me working so hard in my life to get a cookie when other people just get cookies by existing. What is the point of working so hard to get something that others can get so easily? To me, that just seems like a joke that takes away all my motivation to try. Also, even if I miraculously find someone that likes me, chances are that she will not be the right person and I will need to wait again years to meet someone else that might also not be the right person. Some of my friends had to date a bunch of people to find the right person. To me, it might take 20 years to get what they got in a month. What is the point of that?!   


Please don't say ""the world doesn't owe you a date"" that is the most snobby and heartless thing to say to someone that is struggling with dating. That is like saying to someone in need ""the world doesn't owe you food"" or ""the world doesn't owe you water"", when they are desperately hungry and thirsty, and the other person has no issue getting those because they just got luckier (even though they think that their luck was their ""hard work"").   


It is just so hard for me to get motivated when it all seems so futile and results are not even guaranteed. It just seems like a societal Russian roulette in which some people get an empty gun, and people like me get one with only an empty spot and the rest is full of bullets.

I also don't know if it's worth it since it would be long-distance (I might move to his city next year though)  Do you think I should talk to him or move on?

Hi,

I‚Äôm 19 and never kissed a girl before. I‚Äôm scared that when I do meet someone, they would feel turned off because I have never kissed a girl or dated before. It sucks because I feel like I‚Äôm so behind from my peers.

I have seen lots of people say that they don‚Äôt care but often times it‚Äôs a lie and they actually do. So, is it a turn off? Please help thanks!

TLDR: 19m, never kissed a girl, is it a turn off,",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qezhdw/i_19m_have_no_experience_in_relationships_is_it_a/
92,qezlxe,1635104797,Would it be weird to invite my 1 Night stand on a date?,"The other day I was at a club with my friends and hooked up with a girl from there. We went back to hers had some of the best sex I've ever had for almost 2 hours. 



Then we ended up just chatting for hours and I realised we had a lot in common and I'm quite interested in her. There were a lot of coincidences that occurred for us to meet which just feel so surreal. I've invited her out with me and my friends in the next couple of days and she said she's down to come. 



Would it be strange of me to invite her out to dinner just me and her a few days later? I'm not sure if she sees me as just a one night stand or if she's potentially looking for something more. What do you think? I'd like to get to know her even more but don't want to come across as really clingy if I invite her out for dinner especially as we just met a few days ago from a 1 night stand.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qezlxe/would_it_be_weird_to_invite_my_1_night_stand_on_a/
93,qezn2p,1635104890,I feel like the only way I can have any success is if I change myself to be the type of guy that girls like.,"I‚Äôve tried both ends of the extremes(excluding RP Kevin samuels nonsense) and everything in between and I can‚Äôt seem to find a dating strategy that will yield me any successes. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm bad. If I met a girl with my qualities I‚Äôd date her. I know I‚Äôm not super good looking in the face but my standards are very low for physical appearance. Even girls that are below average reject me.

I‚Äôm just at a loss now. I can‚Äôt get a girl to like me, I can‚Äôt find any girls that already like me, no girl is willing to give me a chance to prove I‚Äôm good enough for her. I‚Äôm just stuck. 

I know a lot of people are going to downvote me and accuse me of not actually trying to improve myself but I really am. I‚Äôm trying to improve myself well still being me and I‚Äôm not sure if girls are just repulsed by the person I am. 

Like the dude bro frat guys I know are always getting attention from girls. Like I even know certain girls that date guys explicitly because they‚Äôre in frats. I‚Äôm not that type of guy but if they‚Äôre getting girls and I‚Äôm not they have to be doing something right, right? Idk if I wanna change myself into a guy like that just to get attention from girls.

Should I maybe just fundamentally change myself if I want a chance at finding someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qezn2p/i_feel_like_the_only_way_i_can_have_any_success/

96,qezuqg,1635105523,Was I slow faded?,"Hey r/dating

Matched this girl on bumble and we spoke for a few weeks. Then she suddenly invites me out on a weekday to a club. We have a good time and then she aggressively pursues me into 3 other dates. I really enjoy our time together. So then I start inviting her out and I get her one more date which was great. But after that, she is more difficult to get on a date. Also she used to text me everyday and then this became sporadic and I had to start initiating but when she responded it was appropriate. I decided that I would try for a date this weekend and she averted me and said she wasn‚Äôt available and She didn‚Äôt provide alternatives which is usually a sign for me they don‚Äôt want to see the other person again. So I decided to send her a text saying basically I enjoyed our time together and good luck with everything take care. She responded with ‚Äúthanks you too‚Äù. 

She had all the warning signs. She future faked me, love bombed me. But seemed like the type of girl to want to pursue and not be pursued. It‚Äôs a shame that that is the person I tend to go for. This is not my first rodeo. 

I just feel demoralized.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qezuqg/was_i_slow_faded/

98,qezzkb,1635105920,Did I get dumped?,"I've been dating this guy since June. We are not officially a couple. He recently left his job. I haven't heard from him in over a week. I figured he might be focusing on finding work but someone posted on facebook him giving a pep talk to a football team that he is an assistant coach.

Today he posted pics of his best friend's wedding. There is one picture where he is with one woman and they have their arms around each other (waist). I was looking at the body language and they were close but not like boyfriend/girlfriend close. Like a typical friends closeness. There is another shot with them and the newlyweds but this woman is next to the groom and he is next to the bride (couple is in middle). His dad commented on their solo photo (the first one I mentioned) that he looked good but his date looked better (I think she probably is a bit better looking than me. She is a blond). The guy I am dating didn't say they were friends. He said ""you should have seen how the bride looked as they had a gatsby theme."" Shouldn't he have said that they are not a couple???

I honestly don't know what to think. He seemed like a decent guy and into me. He has kissed my hand several times last month as we were holding each other's hands. Either he is being really clueless that I would find that photo offensive or he is being a real asshole. He doesn't seem like the type to do something so cruel but it's possible. If they were dating, wouldn't he just unfriend me? Wouldn't that be easier?

I've dated a guy once who was super into me but after a month, he basically ghosted me so I know a guy who you think likes you a lot can do a 360 and lose interest.

Also this guy hasn't been with a lot of women. I assume he was being honest with me.

There is another photo where he is with the same woman and another woman on his other side. They are both wearing red dresses but the style is a bit different so I don't know if the maid of honour wears a different style but same colour than the bridesmaids. I do wonder if she is the bride's best friend because maybe it was an innocent photo and they are just both single or maybe she has a boyfriend. I don't think he was the best man, even though he said they have been best friends since elementary school. He has not talked about the wedding. He just told me about the bachelor party they had in July.

When I spoke to my friend last month about us, she thought maybe we are moving slow as I would assume he would have wanted to label me his girlfriend after 3 months. Seems odd to me. I did ask him if he was sexually monogamous last month so we are but that doesn't mean we are a couple and that could change at any time, especially if he just met someone.

I'm tempted to give the angry emoji for that picture but it would be ironic if I gave it a heart instead. I generally do not cause facebook drama but I am quite pissed. Maybe he's too nice to dump me so just stopped texting me. My last text to him was wishing him good luck for a job interview he had. He never said thanks or anything about how it went.

Any thoughts on this? I'm having a hard time focusing on other things. I have an assignment to work on (due next week though) so I could try to focus on that but I'm so upset.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qezzkb/did_i_get_dumped/

Hello everyone! Yesterday I was an invigilator and me and this girl writing the test were staring at eachother smiling many times during the examination. When the exam ended i told everyone they could feel free to stay afterwards and ask me questions. She stayed and waited for everyone to leave and then approached me. She didnt ask no specific question, just started asking me what i studied etc, just a chill conversation. A random dude came and started asking genuine questions about the test and didnt leave afterwards. He joined our conversation and I couldnt ask for her instagram as I would feel unprofessional. Then i told them both goodbye. Now i regret not asking her for her social media info. I have her name ofc, should i DM her or will i come of as a creep?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf02gr/should_i_adddm_her_on_instagram_or_is_it_creepy/
