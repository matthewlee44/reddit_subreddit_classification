No? Just me? Okay. 

I’m not an emotional person. I should probably let everyone know now that I’m not angry at anyone. This girl let me down as easily as she could given the circumstances and I respect her for that. It still hurts like hell though. 

I don’t often fall for someone, but when I do I fall hard. 
I fell hard for a girl, and we got along better than anyone else I know. There’s a perfect storm of bullshit going on right now in her life, but the only relevant one is that she was recently talking to a guy, and she lost feelings for him but he didn’t. Despite her telling him she’s not interested, he still hasn’t given up. He’s connected to a larger group of friends that we interact with, and they largely have his back. 

Today she told me something that I could tell was a signal meant for me. She told me that she didn’t want this guy thinking that she lost feelings for him because she started liking me. Maybe I’m reading too much into this, but I interpret that as her telling me that she doesn’t see me as anything more than a friend. And that’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that. It really hurts though.

I feel like I got my hopes up over something that I knew wasn’t going to happen. I feel stupid. I’m pissed that I let myself willingly fall in love when I knew how it would end. I just feel empty. I honestly knew this was coming and I was too blinded by emotion to see where this was headed. She tried letting me down easy because it’s clear she still wants to be my friend, but it’s hard. I don’t want to be another problem for her to worry about, so I feel like running away and just avoiding the situation as a whole. I know that isn’t the right or responsible thing to do, but I honestly feel like running and hiding. I want to go back to when I didn’t feel like a burden on everyone. I miss when I only saw her as a friend. I was planning on letting her know how I felt soon, but now I doubt I’ll go through with it.

She always reply’s fast, unlike the girls my age they’ll just reply whenever. I rarely see her hanging out with guys, but I’ll see the girls my age who I text they’ll hang out with other guys often. I feel like younger girls, like in high school are much more willing to date then college girls. From my experience girls in college won’t date a guy unless he’s exactly what she wants. And usually that’s a ripped white guy with money and that’s not me. 

The girl who’s younger, she’s nice. Conversation flows easy with her and she always responds fast. She’s pretty too. She’s a little tall, maybe that makes her a little self conscious and that makes her more likely to give older guys a chance. But I’m not a psychologist so I don’t know. She’s just a chill girl and I’d be willing to give her a chance but idk.

tw: suicidal thoughts are mentioned 

i’m (18f) a high school senior, and i’m going to a state school. i was on a zoom with other people who were planning to go to this same state school. and i saw this guy who i thought i was cute, so i asked his friend (18m) is he (19m) was single etc. long story short, got his snap then his number. this happened about a week ago, and we’ve been talking nonstop since. tonight had the past partner talk. i shared with him i have had 1 past long term partner and we connected because i was suicidal and got diagnosed with severe depression. my past long term partner called 911 because he thought i was going to kill myself. i am not suicidal anymore, but i still have depression and anxiety after this occurred this is what he texted back with

“Thank you so much for telling me. I know it’s probably not easy to say and hard to put into words, so I really do appreciate you being open and honest. Really, it means a lot. I’m honestly not sure if I’d be able to handle it, I’m not even really in the market for a relationship right now, I’m still trying to figure out if I want to try to commit to a relationship or if I just want to do one off events, if that makes sense? I’m definitely not gonna stop talking to you just because of that, so please don’t be worried I’ll stop talking to you. I like talking to you, and if you want someone to rant to or go to, I’m here.

we talked a bit after and he commented on how he is slightly afraid of commitment since our school is so large and there are a lot of people. he isn’t sure if he wants to be in a commitment relationship. but he still wants to continue talking. i told him i would give him space and time and how i would never want him to feel like i was pressuring him or guilt tripping him into anything.

We’ve been dating for almost 8 months. We’ve been living together for 6. Mostly at my place and some at his. We are really in love but lately, he hasn’t been initiating sex, but will make jokes that I don’t want to f him or blow him anymore. 

He doesn’t help around the apartment like at all. He’s very set on living in norcal for forever and I’m flexible (considering LA or NY). 

When we first starting dating he was very interested in fitness and running (I’m a big runner) and now he works out maybe once a week in front of the tv for 30 minutes. 

Anytime I try to bring up anything that isn’t positive or discuss things that may be bothering me (like helping make the bed once in a While) he says he’ll “try”. 

I confronted him tonight about how he says he’ll try but time and time again it’s the same things we’ve discussed. He’ll feed my dog things she’s not supposed to have, he’ll put wet clothes on top of wet clothes on the drying rack, he’ll leave his shaving hairs all over the sink. 

I know these things are minor. What really bothers me is how he responds to our conflict or conversation. He’ll get very stiff, stern and cold. He’ll utter 2 words “ I disagree” or “ I don’t know what to say” then he’ll go sleep on the couch. Idk you guys. 

Pls help! Am I in a hopeless relationship? 

I think we have a lot of really amazing times. But it bothers me when I work, clean, make dinner, make plans for us, work out twice, run with my dog, and he sits on the couch and gets mad when I ask him to take out the trash.

Also when sending pics he would always compliment me/my body. But if I compliment him, he finds it hard to accept it. Im scared he thinks Im out of his league? because i’m not at all. 

Or he’s so busy with work, he’s just too tired and doesn’t want to talk to me.
But if I were in his position, even with work, I would go on my phone during break and go straight to txting him.
Sometimes he won’t txt me in the morning. He apologized and says he’s too tired (from work).

Also this is the only online dating app he downloaded i think because he said. and he was only doing it for the free trial(u can see their likes,etc) and i downloaded it for that reason too.

But we live in different countries. I really want to see him after covid. But im scared he thinks thats a stupid idea, he says plane tickets are expensive.

Im overthinking a lot. and i know he has a life. but i never got a text since yesterday. I had another guy ghost me for 3 days, came back with no explanations
 and acted like he just didn’t ghost me.

I find myself just waiting the whole day for him to text me back. But Im scared he’ll think im clingy or annoying. But I feel like if your on a dating app and match, you should at least have some interest..I feel betrayed and sad after waiting for so long. Im also scared to lose interest because I need attention, and without it, I’ll feel unwanted, and my mind will slowly accept the fact that I was wasting my time and move on but I don’t want to.

I've obviously suffered from depression/anxiety due to my upbringing and how toxic it has been and still somewhat is. All this trauma i've dealt with has shaped who i am and made me more open minded/empathetic.

About a month ago I decided to give up looking and focus on myself, I took a good hard look at where I was in life and realized that my past was having an incredible toll on me both physically and mentally. I came up with the Idea that I wouldn't talk about specifics when it comes to my past anymore, every time I would dive into my memories I would basically be ripping the scab off of the wound and it would have to take time to begin to heal again. That was my first step my second step was to give up looking for anybody to date and to focus on letting myself be happy with who I am and where I am in life. It didn't take very long and immediately my outlook on life has improved dramatically. I feel much more confident now and I'm very happy with the decisions that I'm making for myself.

So them as a couple we’ve been through a lot together considering we are so young, like I had to hide him for the first 6/7 months of the relationship because of my strict parents and he found it hard as his parents are so chill and have been together since they were 15. Then around last year in quarantine I had a really tough time as me and my family don’t get along much and so he was my closest friend and boyfriend and I ended up being horrible to him and a absolutely toxic person because my family were putting a lot of pressure and I have a tendency to bottle things up and then explode and then I used to treat him so badly. Then after him trying to break up with me I finally realised what a awful person I was being and I changed and stopped being that bad towards him and it was good for a long time. Then after a while there was a relapse and like I wasn’t as bad as I was before but once pressure with family was increasing I was being immature towards him and idk it started like going on a cycle in which every month 3 weeks was amazing and then 1 week would be arguing because of me being immature. So 2 weeks ago there was a situation in which everyone was telling me to be careful of his girl best friend and I usually am not a jealous person and I’m super chill but so many people were commenting on them so I got suspicious and also the fact that I thought he completely ignored me on this particular day. So I kind of started asking questions and it turned into a argument because he kept on saying the situation was childish and it felt he was invalidating my feelings and so my emotions were on overdrive partly because of this and partly because of a serious family issue and I was being so unreasonable and he tried to go to sleep and say I love you even while I was arguing. But yeah the next day he wanted to meet up I thought it would be to discuss this situation but he broke up with me and I was heartbroken I knew why he did it and I just felt so rubbish about myself and like it’s all my fault because we both love each other so much the breakup wasn’t a argument it was friendly and we hugged and said I love you. I think I took him for granted and thought he would always be there which was my fault completely and I will always regret it for the rest of my life. But anyways we decided to block each other for a while and 5 days later I wanted to apologise for my lack of communication and so yeah he replied and was like thank you and then we had a bit of a conversation and then he kept on giving me mixed signals because I was clear I wanted to get back together but I wasn’t pushy I was like I know what I’ve put you through so I understand if you don’t want to get back together. But then he called me by our version of ‘babe’ which I was confused because you wouldn’t call a friend that and then the next day he sent me a TikTok even though he was the one who didn’t want to talk. But anyways we had a conversation and I asked him if he saw a future for us and he was like I don’t right now and was like who knows I’m the future it could change and I admit I was being a little pushy and saying like if I’m making steps to change ect and he was quite harsh with me and I guess from there I was like I kinda accepted I messed up a amazing relationship because I couldn’t keep my emotions in check and so a few days later I went to his house and returned loads of stuff be I was like there’s not a chance we’re getting together and he’ll never take me back so I was like I really need to fully move on. Then he got annoyed at me for returning the stuff because we were originally supposed to return stuff a month after no contact and he got a bit annoy at the goodbye letter I gave him as well. But the the next day he said he’ll return my stuff back as well and it seemed we both accepted that it won’t work but then when we met up it was amazing no awkwardness so much chemistry because we are both such good friends and we we’re going gbto have a closure chat and I still made it clear I wanted to get back together and yeah there was a few things that he said if you told me before this would be a different story and then we hung out and cuddled like afterwards because we were both upset and accidentally got too sexy with each other and nearly hooked up before he stopped it happening. But then before he walked me back to my house and drive away we were both like we will always love each other and the he also said like I need to think about things niw before he drive off, which gave me so much hope because I was like he might be thinking of the possibility. When he reached back he he messaged me and said sorry we got too caught up with each other and like I was like oh is he not thinking about us getting back together anymore and so I said things like ‘ even if we don’t get back together at least we will still be friends’ just to sort of keep that doir open for us in the future and yeah he didn’t say anything to that but he never hinted or denied at possibly getting back together. But we reinstated the 1 month no contact again

But yeah I’m so lost now I just want him back so much I’m trying to be calm and I want to get therapy and show him we can work, I miss everything about him if I had my emotions in check more we would still be together and like looking to the future.

my oh my, it’s probably a week before my monthly cycle &amp; I can already feel my emotions being a mess.
IMO - I find myself to be someone who either likes you, or plain out doesn’t. I can’t ~grow~ to fancy someone, it usually is off the bat. HOWEVER even if I do start liking somebody, I find it best to show that I’m not interested, but keep them as a friend. 
I truly feel like the best long term relationships start off as really good friendships. You never exactly know what a person is really like if you’re going into a date off the bat because people will ( USUALLY NOT ALWAYS ) show the best versions of themselves. You won’t see who that person is until you spend time with them. Being a detailed oriented person bites me right in the cheeks when it comes to this. If I’m interested in you, I WILL observe everything. I’ll look at your posture, what you put into your body, how you talk to your friends/family, does our humor match up, what shows you watch or games you play, how active you are, what your hobbies on a daily are .. etc. ALL OF THIS, to see how much we have a in common and see if we could possibly go anywhere from just being friends. I know there is no such thing as perfection, but often times I’ve done this, it all just results in a really cool friendship (which I’m thankful for, no doubt). 
I absolutely detest the saying “ the right one comes at the right time “. Okay but how do you guarantee that? 

Honestly, I can’t say I’ve been trying to put myself out there and ~into the dating world~ mostly because of this COVID situation but does that mean I should? I’m also 21 (young and naive for the most part probably) and going through a small existential crisis sort of thing but it’s rough out here for a college gal.

I used tinder, bumble, and hinge. I got a message from a girl on bumble. I skimmed over her bio and she seemed normal. While talking to her, she asked me out. I was like sure, why the hell not, so we decided to meet for dinner.

We met in the parking lot and she hugged me. And made some small talk. It was cool. However, once we were about to enter, I put on my mask. She looked at me and said, ""ugh. I hate wearing masks. Don't they know they can't make you wear one"". 🚩. She went in without wearing a mask.

We sat down and our server was helping us. We ordered our food and she left. She then said, "" ugh. Foreigners right?! Taking american jobs. "" 🚩

Once we sat down, after we ordered, she changed her position to laying across the booth, putting her feet on the long chair thing, which I thought was weird. We started talking. She was heavily into GOD. I personally don't believe in GOD, but I don't push it on people. I don't give a shit what you believe in. She asked me about my beliefs. I chickened out and said sure, I do. She noticed my hesitation and told me why GOD was real to her. She said she didn't believe in GOD, until she started watching YouTube videos. I asked her, what else she watched on youtube, but it was just GOD stuff.

I changed the subject to our jobs, since I don't believe in GOD or go to church or pray. I work in health care. She asked, ""did you get the covid-19 shot?"" I said no, because if the medication I'm taking, it lowers my immunity. She said, ""good, because the shot doesn't work. It's just a bunch of chemicals the government is injectioning into people. It does nothing"". 🚩

While talking about our jobs, she said she was losing hers, due to the pandemic. I asked her where she worked. She said at a ministry retirement home. She said they are moving the people who live there out and closing up the place. I told her that sucks. She said she's living at home, which is fine, but when I asked her what she was going to do, she said her parents love her so much, she doesn't need to find a job. 🚩. 

I asked her about her education. She said she didn't go to college or have any training, which is weird, because she said she was a nurse at the retirement home, but she did say, she just sat around because it was chill there, so I'm not sure if she needed medical training, if she was, more or less, a baby sitter. I asked her if she wanted to get a higher education or certificates or anything and she said no. 🚩. This tells me, she doesn't want to better herself in anyway. Heck, even being unemployed, like I was, for a year, I tried to focus on myself by exercising and stuff, but it didn't seem like she wanted to do any of that (better herself).

On the plus side, she paid for our bill. I was offering to pay it, since she lost her job.

We left, hugged and said goodbye. Today I texted her, saying it isn't going to work out. From what I've gathered on my date, she's super christian and conservative, doesn't believe in science, doesn't like foreigners or even people with accents, and doesn't want to better herself. Our core ideals don't match up, like being conservative or christian. I guess I'd be atheist and liberal/moderate. I also don't like bigotry either. I felt bad for our server.

He listens to what I say, actually remembers them (even the little details), and references them in later conversations. He can even come over to sit on my front porch and talk/share stories/quietly listen to the bugs chirping together. For once, someone who likes me just as much as I like them.

And now I’ve been getting mixed signals. I don’t get it.

I was shocked that he’d even think that, and my friend/sister/Reddit all told me he sounds massively insecure. 

I’ve been trying my best to show how interested I am by initiating contact more, sending cute photos, saying sweet things... he responds and tries to keep the conversation going but does not reciprocate the sweet gestures anymore. He is just cold towards me. Even if I say “I can’t wait to see you again soon 🤗”, he’ll respond like “Thanks, I’m boarding my flight now. How’s the weather back home?” I asked him to call yesterday because I planned to finally talk about it. He did but I missed the call (I was in the bathroom). 1 minute later I got a “I guess you’re busy, I’m going to bed” text. Why wouldn’t he just give it a few more minutes?

Both very affectionate and very much into each other.

But soon I started noticing that he was talking about himself much more than about me. At first I didn't care/notice it that much, as I was crushing soo hard.

Over time, this didn't really improve. He just tended to shift the conversation in his topics real quick. He did ask me questions and I told him things about myself, but we mostly ended up talking about him. 

I got insecure about it. Should I be more confident? Should I claim my space in the conversation? Should I politely ask him to stay with my topic a little longer? It all felt unnatural. It's something one might ask from family, friends and partners, but not tinder guys you have a crush on.

I spoke to my therapist about it and she told me two things: 1, that if someone likes you they generally want to get to know you as much as possible and want to make you feel comfortable around them so you'll stay. 2, she told me I should test him. Not in a cruel, manipulative way, just observing the conversation and draw my conclusions.

I got the chance the same day when we were texting back and forth again. I told him about a relatively cool opportunity I wanted to pursue and that I couldn't decide on a topic as there were so many options. He Basically completely overlooked that, asked one superficial question and directly moved to his stuff again. This moment it became very apparent to me that I was just some kind of container for his self portrayal. He didn't like me or found me interesting, he just likes the attention and the validation I give him.

Now here's the point: we kinda made it a habit to text or speak every day. It feels unnatural and immature to just stop replying or letting this fade out, but I don't really feel in a position to criticize him or telling go Somethings wrong with him. He might be interested in people, just not in me. I'm not sure how to tell him - quite out of the blue - that's not how I imagine a good relationship (of whatever sort) to be. And for an exclusively physical relationship we talk waaaay too much. I'm pretty sure that at one point he'll ask me what's wrong and I want to be honest but not brutal.

I’ve realised after some soul searching and dating around that I am looking for a committed healthy relationship with the right person and where we can share experiences together but at a slow pace as I am not in a rush to have children, get married etc. 
I own my own home, have a great career and have developed a good support network of family and friends over the years and it would be nice to share experiences with someone. 
I was in a long term relationship of 7 years and this was just the wrong person in the end and we also met very young. 

Issue I’m having is that when I first went into dating I was saying casual which was a big no no as I don’t do hookups or friends with benefits and this is what guys perceived casual as. 

I basically date to see if people match up for a healthy relationship as described above then decide from there so I’m fine with not being exclusive for a certain amount of time. 

How do I phrase this in today’s dating world without scaring someone off at the beginning. They may hear relationship and be scared off but what I mean is let’s see how it goes and if we match for a relationship then we can see if we can take it to the next level. 

I’m happy staying single as long as it takes to meet the right match.

Men ONLY want to get into relationships and hook up with beautiful women. And I'm talking the face of a supermodel and body of a porn star, simply being ""pretty"" isn't enough for them. They want perfection. The only reason why some of them do date women who aren't perfect is because they're settling. If they could get more attractive women, they would. That's why so many men cheat: they're constantly on the lookout for a more attractive woman to come along. And even with the women they settle for, you have to be at least a 7 or 8. If you don't have a good bone structure, big boobs, or aren't skinny, forget ever finding love. The most you'll get is desperate creeps who want to have a one night stand with you and never contact you again after.

All that crap about how men say they want ""natural"" woman is nothing but a bunch of lies. They don't find you beautiful and sexy with no makeup on and wearing sweatpants, they want Emily Ratajkowski in a tiny dress and heels. They just say those things because they'll do whatever they can to get sex. 

I don't even know if I actually am ugly, but I've always assumed I must be because of my experiences with men. I desperately want to be one of those girls like Lizzo and Princess Nokia who love themselves and feel attractive even if they aren't conventionally attractive, but I can't because of men and their ridiculous standards and the horrible ways in which they have treated me. They've made me feel like the ugliest woman on earth. The only way in which I have a hope of feeling better is by spending hundreds a week on therapy, which I can't even afford right now.

Maybe I sound bitter, but I don't care. Men have made me feel hideous, disgusting, undesirable, worthless, less of a woman, and unworthy of love. My self esteem is in the gutter because of them. And I will forever resent them for it.

I’ve been dating someone for just a few months now. It’s early days but it’s going well. We’re from very different backgrounds but we have similar interests, same taste in music, food, and humour. We’ve mostly met outdoors so we haven’t done anything special but have still had an amazing time, every time. He’s a joy to be around and last time we met we were laughing til we couldn’t breathe and were crying.

Anyway, he sent me an invite to one of his best friends wedding late summer. The envelope had my full name on it. I’m honestly touched because I haven’t met his friends and although we agreed to exclusivity, we haven’t got labels as it’s early. It’s a glamorous venue as well so it won’t be cheap to let him bring another person. He obviously sees us being together in the near future. His friend is also from uni so I’ll be meeting all of his uni friends - I won’t just be introduced to two special people in his life, but half a dozen. 

I’m emotional because I haven’t had very nice boyfriends. I’m used to being hidden away, kept secret, controlled, abused etc. I do, however, take responsibility for it because I could’ve left those situations sooner but I chose to stay. I never blamed all men for the way I was treated, as there are good men out there and women can be abusers too. I’m fully over it and I’m elated to have met someone wonderful. I only cry tears from laughter.

Back on the dating scene (33F) . I get chronically ghosted and am trying to hone in on the factors which may cause this. What are some of your best tips for success? I define success as a monogamous relationship with someone after the dating stage is over. I never reach this stage. I did last year and got ghosted after 3 months (cold world). 

Give me anything you’ve got but some specific items on my mind are:

1. When do you choose to sleep with someone? I hate sleeping with them then getting ghosted. I only do so if I feel I want a relationship with them. However I never discuss it in advance. 

Do you recommend establishing exclusivity or intentions of a relationship before taking this next step? 

2. What are some bright red flags for someone who was never serious about you to begin with? 

3. How much of this “hard to get” game do you advise playing vs. just being real with your enthusiasm or feelings? My friends tell me to just act like I don’t give a f*** about the guy, but this doesn’t seem mature or healthy. 

4. What kind of positive feedback have you ever gotten from partners, for example “I fell for you because ___” 

5. How do you recommend battling attachment style issues? I am anxiously attached and always manage to find avoidant men.
