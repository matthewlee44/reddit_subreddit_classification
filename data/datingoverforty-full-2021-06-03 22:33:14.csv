Here's the long explanation of why I'm asking:

About 6 months ago I met a very nice man my age via OLD. We went on 4 dates. Pros: We got along very well, had a lot to talk about, have compatible lifestyles and goals etc, and he was very kind, mature, and respectful. Con: I didn't feel a ""spark."" But I was willing to see if one could develop. 

We kissed a little on date 3, and did quite a lot of kissing/making out on date 4. It was just ok - not bad, but definitely not great. I felt like there just wasn't enough of a physical connection to continue seeing each other so a few days later, I told him that I felt like it wasn't the best match. I also said that I had decided I wanted to work on myself and focus on my daughter before continuing to date (which was true). 

Well, it turns out he works for the same organization that I do (different location but just down the street). About 2.5 months ago we ran into each other and reconnected as friends and have become pretty close. He is great about boundaries and was proactive about saying that he understood I only wanted a platonic relationship and that he was very happy to have me as a friend.  

Since we reconnected, we text literally every day and have also had the occasional phone call and in person visit. I actually like who he is as a person, which isn't easy to find these days. He treats me with respect; he has integrity. He's funny and thoughtful and generous. The more I get to know him, the more attractive he is. 

Most of the time, I think he's ""just a friend,"" but today I realized that I would be pretty disappointed if he started dating someone else. 

If kissing him 6 months ago didn't turn my crank, am I fooling myself thinking that is going to be any different now? In the past, a physical connection is something I've either had with someone or not - I've never been successful in forcing it. But I've also never really been motivated to work on it either. Now that I know what I want out of a partner and how hard it to find it at our age, the equation is different!",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,49836,public,self,Building physical intimacy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nrwf0q/building_physical_intimacy/,some_ads,7,,,278467f8-26b0-11e9-a41e-0ed02cff7b5c,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deciding if we can have a friendship-  No ill will at break up.

Among the many things we discussed, two things left me pondering and I'm struggling with his perspective versus mine. I'm trying to grow and learn from our relationship so I'm taking things in, curious what others think about these two aspects that contributed to our break up:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1- my parenting time w/my son.  I have a 7 yr old (ex has a 20 yr old son who lives far away in college).  When we started dating I had 50/50 custody and thus a decent amount of free time.  Last July I took on 85% custody, my son is only away alternating weekends and some holiday.  His dad is not interested in more time w/our son and moved 40-min away, so overnights on school nights are not feasible.    
My ex -bf was pretty great, IMO, of rolling with the change. Due to his flexible schedule (he has barely been employed since the pandemic started), he was coming  to my place a lot, and he knew my son   
 by then.  However, I feel it was more quantity time than quality time overall, including with my son.  He engaged with us but I wouldn't say he went out of his way to spend time building a strong relationship w/my son.  I did make arrangements a few times to have my parents watch my son (who live an hour away and my dad is disabled, being cared for by my mom so it's not easy) so ex and I could go on some extended camping trips, and my ex accompanied my son and I on a few trips. Not gonna like, his presence added some stress that would not have otherwise been there.

  
He said today that he felt that I made no effort to try and get less time w/my son so that he, as my partner, could have more of it.  I'd never thought about that.  I know it changed things for us, but I didn't know it upset him.  But I also feel like I didn't have many options. It's COVID times- not a lot of babysitter situations would work. I was already spending $950/month on care while I worked anyway, so not a lot of extra cash for extra child care.  All my friends who were in our ""bubble"" have their own kids and are overwhelmed so taking my son for a day or two is not a fair ask. Am I being selfish for not seeing his need for this?  Is it common for a single mom who is dating to look for ways to spend more time with SO and less time with kiddo?  I really like having this time w/my son and I think it could have been more fun for all of us if ex had tried a bit more, but maybe I'm off base? Plus, we had nowhere to go during lockdowns (I live in CA, lot of restrictions) to get a babysitter for anyway.

\#2 - one of the deciding factors for me in our break-up was a lack of words of affirmation.  He never said I love you to me, and always got defensive when we'd talk about it, saying that people lie about loving each other so it's stupid, only actions count.  But it wasn't just "" I love you"", it was positive words in general.  He was very lean on the compliments and heavy on the criticisms.  I'm big on words of affirmation (backed with action, duh). He told me that if I really cared, I'd accept him for who he is and leave it at that. My statement today was that if he really cared then the relationship would be not be 100% of how he needed it to be and 0% of what I needed, there is room for middle ground. Am I off about this?  I know in the end that out love languages are just really different anyway, but is meeting in the middle some kind of antiquated romantic notion I have?

I suppose I'm venting/asking all of this b/c I've only now dated 2 men in 19 years- one I married and was together for 15 yrs, and then my most recent ex. I'm feeling defeated and somewhat like I don't have my bearings. I didn't see the kid time issue, and I am wondering if I'm way off for wanting words of affirmation. I've forgotten what it feels like to have my partner just tell me something positive about me or that he appreciates me, and I don't want to live my life longing for that, but is that a silly, naive, ask?

I'm also discovering that I'd like to have a partner who also has kids in a similar age range, as it might help to have someone in the same life stage as me.

We were going out every few days and really enjoying our time together. During our dates and some text messages he told me how overworked he was and how it was really negatively impacting his life. He was working at least 50 hours a week. Prior to this he was a primary caretaker of one of his parents during their chemo/radiation (during COVID) and he was also divorced a little over a year ago. I'm sure it's a lot to take in and I tried to be supportive of his stress. I shared my own story of difficulties this past year and after my divorce. After our 4th date we slept together which was surprising because I don't like moving that fast but I felt comfortable with him. Our next date he told me he didn't sleep with people that quickly but things were going well between us. Over the next few days everything was fine then he cancels our date that evening because he is working late. I was supportive and we planned to try and get together the next night. He canceled that one too and that's when I said it was okay but to let me know that if he wasn't feeling it anymore that'd I'd be okay with it. He told me he was but his work schedule was debilitating and causing him to be in a funk. I said I was glad we were on the same page and to get some rest. After that he seemed to keep retracting. His texts became less frequent. After I hadn't heard from him in a few days I sent him a text checking in asking how he was doing. He was traveling for work and just sent me his schedule. It was so off and cold. I told him that I was concerned about him and wanted to talk but if he just needed space he needed to tell me or if he just wanted to end things just let me know as I didn't want to stress him out. I also said that I'd like to continue seeing him as I'd been having a great time. A few days later he apologized and said he does this when he is stressed and wants to continue seeing me and needs to clear his head. We chatted a few times but didn't see each other. He went mute again shortly after and I reached out and told him I was concerned with how he was and I didn't deserve to be ignored. A bit about me, I was a social worker and had seen these situations end badly in the past. I didn't tell him but no communication is somewhat of a trigger for me. I haven't heard from him at all since then. After a week of no communication I decided to started a new OLD profile on a new site and saw that he was active on it too. The only text message I've sent to him recently was one checking in on him and still nothing. I've deleted his number but didn't unmatch from our OLD connection. I do have attachment anxiety and working on it along with trauma therapy. OLD has not helped with the anxiety at all. I was trying to be supportive and really felt we had the beginnings of something. Would someone go to these extremes (saying you're depressed, etc) to just not have to see someone again? I've been ghosted in the past but not anything like this. I am trying to be supportive and I think I did make it about me the one night where I said I didn't deserve to be ignored. I thought by reaching out and checking on him was the right thing to do but now I just feel like I bugged or ticked him off. It's hard to know what to do in the future or if he is going to come back since he said he wanted to continue to see me. He didn't explicitly say he wanted space but I should have taken clear my head to mean space. Any suggestions? It wasn't too long of us dating but it felt so good to finally meet someone that you felt you connect with.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,49860,public,self,Mental illness or ghosting,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ns8sjy/mental_illness_or_ghosting/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We as adults have SO much to unpack within ourselves in order to have productive and positive interpersonal interactions. I’ve been on a journey of self awareness for years now, discovering so much about myself along the way and working to improve. I have not met one single person that has this level of self awareness or desire to attain it, which makes it difficulty to coexist and effectively communicate. How the hell do I navigate this! 

The book talks about ways to communicate with an emotionally immature parent so that you can take care of yourself in the interaction. 
Step 1. Assess the emotional maturity of the person

This happened and still going on for almost 2 years. So yes I will admit that I didn’t handle this situation right, and at the time there is no one I can tell this to. I did tell couple people online but it was in the beginning of the event. So they don’t know the rest. So I worked at grocery store and as usual you always get handful of man trynna moves on you. It’s usual for women these days so you just try to ignore it, laugh it off or say you have boyfriend, or if it’s come to the worst use the i’m married card. But never say you not interested it’s only fuel them. Anyway, I had bunch of old men giving me compliments and hinting on taking me out and this is absolutely sickening. I just laugh it off but in my head I just wanna cry. 
So, it’s my job to be mildly nice to customers, they don’t require us to be fake nice(so at times even with my mild niceness customers said that I’m the only nice employee there).
Yeah and for many customers (men)(I don’t wanna sound sexist, but it’s always them who do that) it indicates that I have a micro interest in them. Yeah it didn’t happened that much or that often. But I have plenty weird stories.  
Sorry for losing track. 
So this close to 60yr old man came at my register he saw me stretching my bag and said he had orthopedic office and can offer me free massage. I was like “the hell” in my head, I said I can pay for it with no issues. He look left and I just threw the card away. Couple weeks later he would just come at my register often and leave generous tips. I did not pay it any attention. Then he found me on Facebook (really scary when people do that) and at first I thought it was someone from my photography class(because it was picture of someone behind the camera) so I added and by the time I realized it was him i had no choice but to talk to him. But also it would allow me to avoid unnecessary interactions with him, by saying that I don’t work certain days even if I do. So I was trying to ignore messages from him, but he would come and ask why I don’t reply to him. I would just say I’m busy. He would come at my register and touch my hand I would just ignore it or pull away before he could do it. I told him couple times that I don’t like people touching me, he seems to play dumb. Was I unclear??. He offered to go out to restaurant, or buy me food to bring to my workplace or my apartment( hell to the no I got nosy ah neighbors), or to come to his house, or to go on vacation with him or to the house he brought in another state. All those times I said no. At some point he got mad and said something along the lines” you should say sure” or “yes”). And after many times me saying no he just keeps asking like I’m going to ever change my mind. It’s getting annoying but I’m not gonna break. I just ignore it cuz what the actual hell. he wanted to buy me camera or bag or some gift. But I refused because I live with my parents even if I didn’t. It just smart to never take gifts from the people no matter how much they claim it’s from the good of their heart. I confronted him saying to stop trying to buy me off, but he declined saying it not why he doing it, something about just being friends. He kept saying how he just wanna be my friend (bunch of bologna ) and buy me gifts that my other friends can’t. So it was happening in the beginning of pandemic and I was stressed with classes and it all went online, working with customers got more challenging . And on top of that I got into car accident in the beginning of the year. So I was really stressed. I was getting mad at him and especially at myself because I didn’t know how to handle situation. So couple times he gave $100 for Christmas and new year, I did not wanted to take it but it was during my shift and I had no choice. (So now I’m thinking could I be put brought to court (people be crazy in this country) or require to give it back if I block him without explanation, since I don’t work there anymore so there won’t be any awkward interactions with him). And I told him nice card but no need for money he said something about being friends and all that bs. Also, one time when I was at the register and he came and afterwards he texted me on Facebook saying we almost kissed I was like the fuc I just leaned closer cuz I couldn’t hear what he was saying since everyone wears mask and it’s hard to hear people. even thinking about it makes me vomit. 
So how do I proceed with this ? Block him? Or tell him beforehand not to try and get any information from my previous employer and if he attempts I will get authorities involved ( just bluff him) I don’t wanna get police involved unless he will start stalking me or threatening.

Then my mum almost died of cancer and also her mental state was affected and she turned in me in a very abusive way. 

She’s doing better now but is still terminal. In this time I got close to someone from work who I’ve known for about 4 years.

We have had a tumultuous ride . We fall out a lot over silly miscommunications but we got over some big hurdles and it made us so much closer over the last couple weeks . We had so much hope. It was beautiful . I haven’t felt like that in years. I hadn’t felt anything . 

I really like her and we both feel an intense connection . On the phone for hours and hours everyday etc. I just turned 40 and it’s like I’m having a teenage romance in some ways . She is 29. I feel like I could really fall for her (I may have already ). 

But last night we had such a horrible argument and she basically kicked me out of her flat . I got angry and defensive because she like to take the piss out of me all the time time as “banter” and I just don’t have the mental strength for it . 

My grief has made me very sensitive , I can’t take much judgment . But she constantly ribs me and I usually laugh it off but it builds up and I get stressed out at her . 

In return I give her constant compliments. She is insecure and also has a big ego so she’s always praising herself anyway. 

I have told her about 2/3 times that I am very sensitive at the moment due to my grief . It doesn’t seem to sink in. 

She didn’t react well to me telling her last night to stop it. She was very cold and at the time I was my most vulnerable in front of her , basically asking her to stop, she made me feel like total crap. 

Ever since I have had such bad anxiety . I do every time we argue . I don’t think she will be willing to repair it this time. And I know I shouldn’t either but I do like her so much and also I’m obviously a desperate loser . 

To her credit she did try to address my issues . But I was so overwhelmed by my emotions last nite I couldn’t think straight . I just felt so weak and exposed and I needed kindness and sensitivity and I didn’t get it . 

She did say she didn’t realise , and so on and how she can’t do anything about my grief but wished it hadn’t happened to me. 

Her words were ok it was just her tone didn’t sit well with me . It was not kind. 

Is it even possible to pursue a relationship at this time . Have any of you managed it . Everyone tells me I need to be on my own right now but that’s alright for them . I’m the one struggling every day on my own . She brought me some much needed happiness in an otherwise desperately empty life . Should I just apologise to her and say I over reacted and hope for the best ?

I mean... if you look at most 40-year-olds around you, most of them could be any age from 30 to 55. Some of them even look 28. It's hard to tell these days. I do have people not believe it when I say that I'm over 35, even though I'm starting to feel more and more that I will never have children or a partner, which isn't fair because I really DID want children, a family, and a white picket fence. I wanted to bake, grow fruit trees, sew clothes -- just your basic house brownie stuff -- AND have a career. I see younger women do this all the time. They take a year or two off to raise babies while their husband works. I don't even think this is anathema to feminism, which is another discussion altogether. It is somewhat unsatisfactory that I am only a mother of cats.

But... 40 isn't old! Is it?

This is what I hate about OLD (on-line dating). If you think of OLD and the words ""over 40"" and the word ""woman"", interested men start thinking of Stifler's mom. I look nothing like Jennifer Coolidge. I'm more like the love-child of Bjork circa 1994 and Kelly Marie Tran and (I said) a brownie. I'm not looking for a hook-up. I'm not into that... but for some reason the people who are interested in my profile (some selfies, no total full body shots, nothing suggestive) ONLY want hook-ups. And they are rude when I say no. The few middle-aged men who I met who were not into hook-ups 1) could not stop talking about their careers, 2) made it clear that they were not interested in living with another humans, ever 3) have too many children from previous partners... and their children come first (you will always come second). It makes me think poorly of human beings in general.

I think of that old adage, ""life isn't meant to be fair"", and I think that perhaps it's just not meant to be fair for ME. You might think: well, you may not have children or a partner, but at least you have a career and money. Wrong. I lost those things from being trapped in an abusive marriage for a decade. I'm lucky that I left, but I left with nothing. I say lucky because while some people might say that leaving is an achievement, I think of all the women in the world who are unable to leave, and they are not ""failures"".

Needless to say, starting my life over has been disappointing. Fortunately, I am full-time employed now. Unfortunately, because of my work, which I love, I have almost no time to meet men in the wild. Oh... and before you say, ""it would have been even more disappointing if you didn't leave your marriage"", I'm not interested in the past. 

I'm interested in the present and future.

Now, when I'm looking at guy's pictures on their profile, I notice quickly when they're not smiling! And if conversation is engaged, I'm quick to ask them to post a picture of them smiling...with teeth!! You'd be amazed how many of them stop talking to me when I request this!

I'm 44, never been married, no kids to speak of. I live alone in this cute little dungeon of an apartment with 2 bedrooms, 1 I just...don't have any use for at all and the one I take up residence in is devoid of love and everything else that bedrooms are for. I'm shy yet passionate, a good writer but I'll stutter if we ever speak. I'm not looking for some crazy role-play or violence and bondage. I'm actually not quite sure why all that hair-pulling, choking, devolution of sexuality ever became popular but I...digress.

Guess I'm looking for what everybody's looking for and I tend to lock up my sexuality for a good long time even though there's such a well of passion and curiosity there. So why not post this here instead of arduously hinting at what I want in a relationship? I'm one of those people that strangers come up to and tell their entire life story to cuz I listen. Anyone making a dedicated attempt to get to know me? SO few and far-between. Consider myself quite an open book, a sinner, an Angel of Mercy, someone sensual who loves nothing more than to take an entire day and make it a classic make-out session with the right guy.

That's where it all usually goes sideways! And I'm sure that's true for you as well. Gotta be the 'right' guy. You should be witty. That's actually probably one of my very favorite things in the whole world, unless you turn sarcastic TOWARDS me, then I'll probably experience an epic chipping away at my self-esteem in tiny doses until ... it's over. I like to laugh, it's halfway to getting me horizontal and there's nothing cuter than a woman dissolving into laughter with a twirl of her hair around her index finger and a subtle lip bite to conclude, cuz you now have my attention.

You gotta be intelligent because after all that sex we're gonna have I'm gonna wanna talk about it, about life in general, our pasts, our futures, our everyday lives and anything else we can squeeze out of our brains. I'd love if you had a libido and were clear about that. I find that in my fantasies the men I conjure kinda never shut up. And it could be just the simplest thing but it leaves me reeling, repeating over and over a phrase you've whispered into my ear or said directly to me during a critical moment will push me over the edge every time and I'll adore you for it.

Who wouldn't love to wake up every morning with the potential for a loving, primal tryst? I don't care if our breath is bad, if we smell like sleep, if your hair's crazy, I wanna feel that alarm clock pressing up against my back saying 'Good Morning, Sugar.' And that's just the morning round...I want you to want me beyond reason, to be able to be verbose about how much and why. I want someone I can send naughty pictures to who'll gape at them and think 'God, how did I get this girl...' cuz trust me...I'll want you. I'm a big writer. I've won an award for it, wrote for my township newspaper as a teenager, had teachers keep my essays for future classes to show them how an essay should be constructed. And of course that spills over into love letters. And texts...chats...what I hope to be all day, all night chats if you're that available. I'm a huge multi-tasker so I'll be able to carry on the conversation as well as slay at work, trust me. I do actually want a relationship, not 'just' the sexual aspect.

I'd love to bond with someone over sharing humor, our personal stories and our everyday activities. Oh age-range...You should be I suppose at least in your 30's to 50's I think, though I won't rule out a little younger if I feel like we vibe together. What else...Oh! I'm in the Central US Time Zone in case you're wondering. Midwest girl, northern Minnesota born and raised.

Probably 'nuff said, huh?

And it might feel like a service to ""disabuse"" anyone on here who mentions they think they look younger than their stereotypical chronological age, or that they have been told so by friends, of that notion. You can feel like you are saving them embarrassment, and saving their potential dates disappointment, by making sure we all know that **no one actually looks young for their age**. The comments about it slide into outright mockery at times, and it's become some kind of knee-jerk call and response on this sub. 

But the idea that everyone looks their age is patently untrue, and we all know it. Some people DO look a great deal younger than their age, just as some look older. Especially people who aren't just pasty white Europeans, they often age wonderfully (looking at you /u/MySocialAlt, ironically enough). 

If someone is fit, if someone is healthy, if someone has never smoked, or they simply got lucky with genetics, they can look really damn young ""for their age"". 

Of course, the truth is that there's no one ""look"" for 30's or 40's or 50's, and I think many of us are still stuck in a time when 40 and 50 were considered old, as they were in our parent's time. But ever since Jane Fonda showed us ""this is what 40 looks like"" back in the day, many people have been looking a lot younger as they age, and acting younger, and not capitulating to the stereotypes about how we should look and behave as older people. 

So, I really think we should drop the pretense that everyone who says they ""look younger"" is kidding themselves.

Since I've known one of my friends (55F), she's never had a boyfriend even. In recent years, I started to see the patterns as to why men aren't asking for more. 

She often gets taken with men in their 30s. Usually handsome, professional. They may be divorced with young kids. Some are never married, no kids club.

She really feeds into the attention, as she is one that 'thinks she looks and feels older' However, as much as I care about her and know she does look great - she does look her age (I know we talk about this on here often) and she is not active like she may have been in her 20s/30s. She is in the genetically blessed but doesnt work out category also.

Here is the thing with these men. Whether she meets them through OLD or out on a Friday night. These men arent looking for a relationship with her. She has it convinced in her mind that they are. Then, she sleeps with them and they fade away. She gets upset. Then she doesnt date for a month or so. Then legit seems to forget (as in if I brought up a man's name that did this to her last year - she does not even remember the situation or the man!) and then. She repeats the cycle. 

Last year, she did meet a man her age through OLD that coincidently went to her church. She is ALWAYS saying since she serves ministry in her church that she needs a good Godly man. Well, she was sent one to get to know, and he haooened to also be handsome and so amazing. He took her on beach picnics and surprised her with outings. He was patient about some of her ways of doing things. And....he wanted to be intentional about dating her and looking towards the future. She was not into it. Stopped seeing him. And Then after her adult kids and I said "" Remember when you said ..."" She reached out to make amends but he had already at thay point moved on. 

She is now back to the 30somethings. 
This one is the same type. Never married. No kids. She is texting me talking about how how perfect he is and they are falling for one another fast. It has been - 2 dates. 

I'm to the point that I don't even want tI discuss and set boundaries as she keeps picking it. This younger man wants kids. She is a grandmother. She is basically the GMILF version of the women these guys would marry if that makes sense. 

Does Anyone else have friends in their xircles like this? Have you got to the point where you just have needed to tell them ""enough' or I love ya but I cant discuss your dating life because it is honestly too much of a rollercoaster or hurtful to give you advice then you keep picking men that don't want more with you. 

Also: I dont care for the fact that she will break rules for these men yet impose ridiculous ones for the good ones. Ex: with the handsome 55 yo she was so adamant about ""I won't do this or that' yet then with the 30somethings she is having a free for all with them after just meeting.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,50086,public,self,How are you all handling Friends that keep picking wrong in dating then complain / get hurt over it..,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nuaa0q/how_are_you_all_handling_friends_that_keep/,some_ads,7,628375fa-4425-11e9-9805-0e7c3aad8200,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We spent every possible moment together and never once felt like it was something that was awkward of weird. It was like reconnecting with an old lover. We connected in the best possible way and everything about it was absolutely perfect. 

Imagine, for a moment, that you're excited for something. Perhaps a concert. Perhaps an experience you've been looking forward to. But, you're used to disappointment. You're used to things never working out like you expect them to. So, you prepare yourself for the worst. Something's going to go wrong. The electricity and connection you felt online doesn't transfer to real life. Someone was putting on a facade. The connection isn't there. Just...something goes wrong.

That didn't happen.

From the first moment we hugged, it was pure magic. When we kissed, it was cemented that this was something that was meant to happen. We both have been through a lot in our lives, which was seemingly preparing us to be ready for this relationship. 

We've talked for literally hundreds of hours since last month, between video dates (which typically last 3+ hours), texting, Snapchat, and various other avenues of communication. Our communication has always been open and honest, just to make sure that the foundation of the relationship is solid. Yeah...there have been some awkward conversations, but no judgment from either person. We're both grown-ass adults who have been through some shit. But, we talked about it all, putting it out there for better or for worse.

What happens next? Who knows. It's up to the universe at this point. It brought us together, by absolute happenstance. Both of us considered not posting our comments that sparked this. What if we didn't? Would we have found each other? Doubtful. But, this is a point to take that chance. Put yourself out there and take that chance. It might work out in the most incredible of ways.

1. If it feels wrong - it is wrong.

2. S/he is trying too hard? Involves too much conspicuous and ostentatious effort? It is fake.

3. Too good to be true? It is not true.

4. Verify everything: 90% of the time, people lie and 90% of the time we believe every word they say (90:90 rule or base rate fallacy).

Despite me repeatedly sharing that him giving me the silent treatment for days has been the kicker for me, and that since this last happened a month ago, I haven’t bounced back, he grabbed on to a bunch of other reasons I was calling it off including that I met someone else. 

This relationship has been an eye opener for me. I was madly, head over heels for this man before all the silent treatments, and I’m not even entirely sure why. If I look back he was always one step ahead of me though, and that did make me anxious. 

He had flaws (as do I) but I chalked it up to “price of admission.” I knew I wouldn’t change him, and I didn’t try. When we were getting along well, they didn’t even bother me. 

We dated just over a year, and one of my comments was that it shouldn’t be so hard so early. Sure, relationships are work. But Jesus.

I see a lot of my mistakes which is great. He wanted to cohabitate and things which I did not want initially, I wanted a casual relationship and I was clear about that, but in time I did see wanting to spend more time together. I struggled with this as it would involve blending families which I didn’t want to do as he kept having these silent treatments. A source of tension was that I wouldn’t integrate the families more, and I was burnt out trying to balance both houses.

The silent treatment is very much the way his father controls his mother and I even pointed out today that he can see that as a problem in their relationship but not ours. He refused to take any responsibility for this, and even suggested I met someone else that I wanted to be in a long term relationship with (this is complicated as we had an open relationship, although never physically acted on). But communication was also open and he requested the open relationship. 

For myself, I see that I lost a lot of myself in this relationship. I dressed to his tastes and things because I knew he enjoyed it. I really moved in to a caregiver role because it made him happy, and as my ex husband was always unhappy, I think I wanted to prove I was capable of “making someone happy.”

I’m returning to my thought that casual dating is right for me. I have no desire to cohabitate, mix funds, blend families, and so on. I may have some casual sex in the future, but I’m not looking to date for a good long time.

Female, mid-40s, pretty good looking, but not American so not looking standard blonde American, although I am white and with light hair. Set area for 60 miles to include the larger sprawl. I got some matches, but very few in the over 100 area - a few 108, 109, and some in the 98-104 area. I heard that the top score is 140 and I am hearing from other people that they get 120s frequently.

The reason I am asking is not that I am in a competition or looking for numbers but because I got only one engagement with someone I actually didn't find a good fit. I am thinking that if my low 100s matches frequently get higher scores, then obviously they will put me at the bottom of the pile. So while I consider them high ranking they consider me low ranking and not engage.

Recently, I dated a guy who admitted he never cooked/had home cooked meals and, when we planned to spend a few days together, I told him I would cook for him. I remember really enjoying it. Planning my best dishes, that little bit of high anxiety hoping I didn't screw anything up. Stashing a travel-sized spice arsenal in my bag. Sharing with him some easy cheats he could duplicate himself, when he asked how this or that was made.

Cut to modern day, and the guy I'm seeing and I agree to get ingredients for a mega salad full of stuff we both like. 

Closer to dinner time he says to me, ""I'm going to go finish blah-blah in the  backyard and by the time you put together the salad I should be back.""

Something about it hit me wrong. It was a little too division-y of labor to me, and I remember feeling like I was being told to 'make dinner and have it ready by the time I get back' in a not so covert kind of way.

I let it pass cause a girl's gotta eat. But I remember not enjoying putting together that mega salad. Not wanting, or being excited to impress, and literally not wanting to 'create' for this particular person, as I had for others in the past.

In a word, it was joyless. I was much happier the next day when we each concocted our own sub sandwiches independently, but next to each other at the kitchen counter.

I didn't expect anything from our first meeting but we ended up having amazing chemistry (both sexual and interpersonal) and he's been all around very communicative.

He made it very clear to me that he recently went on a self-discovery journey, and one of the things he realized is that he is not monogamous and really values all the variety that life has to offer (mostly sexually). This was perfect because I'm a PhD student who will periodically do research abroad and am not looking for something extremely involved or serious. But I did make it clear that I wanted something emotionally involved and not purely sexual. He said we were totally on the same page and that emotionally involved is his default. We also agreed to let each other know if we were sleeping with others for health reasons.

Fast forward to now: we parted ways for two months for summer travels. In the past, we had both gone on two smaller trips and he made it very very clear he wanted to see me after each of them. This time feels very different. He never used to go a few days without initiating contact and sending 'thinking of you' texts and now it's been over a week since we talked. I realize that he may be seeing other people, but is it too much to ask for a quick check in once in a while? I honestly just don't feel wanted anymore by him and I have no idea if we're solid upon return.
