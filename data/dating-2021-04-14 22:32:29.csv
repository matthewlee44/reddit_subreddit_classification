4,mr7eme,1618460360,Tips for working on myself &amp; finding a partner?,"So I (24M) have my 25th birthday coming up soon and it's been making me very depressed that I haven't had a romantic partner in my life besides a short relationship that ended due to complicated circumstances. I'm still a virgin, have never kissed a girl, and have never been on so much as a date. As much as I try to pretend that these facts don't bother me I have to admit that they're eating away at me and making me feel like something must be fundamentally broken with me for not experiencing any of these things in almost a quarter century of living. I was diagnosed with social anxiety, and major depressive disorder at 15 and have been on various medication ever since. I also think I might be on the autism spectrum but I haven't been officially diagnosed. My question is this: what do I need to work on or improve in order to get into a relationship? I know that being in a relationship won't magically solve my problems but it would be nice to have a romantic connection with someone. I know social anxiety is a main contributor but it hard to deal with when even on medication by brain shuts down when I try to talk to a woman I find attractive. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Anxious, depressed, socially awkward man would like to know how to work on himself in the hopes of finding a romantic partner",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mr7eme/tips_for_working_on_myself_finding_a_partner/
5,mr7f7l,1618460428,Girl broke things off bc it was getting too serious. I think I‚Äôm just gonna miss the physical intimacy the most.,"A girl broke things off after I introduced her to my friends and bought her a birthday gift, but I think I was trying to make her more of a girlfriend when she was never really one to begin with. I just wish we would‚Äôve had more sex, and we really only fucked one time which is why I thought she didn‚Äôt want things to be casual. 

But we did kiss a lot and she always reciprocated my cuddles and kisses, and the day before she broke  things off we even held hands on the way home while I was driving and she liked to bite my fingers a lot.

I think I‚Äôll miss that more than her and it felt like I had my person who could fulfill that itch of intimacy and one time we just started into each others eyes and kept kissing each other and she would give me head massages and I would reciprocate, it honestly felt like I had a girl pet that would pet me as well and basically we would just let each other.

I‚Äôll miss holding hands and grabbing her butt, playing with her hands and sucking on her tongue. This was my first actual ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù if I can even call it that and I before this I was deathly afraid of physical intimacy but I think now I‚Äôll be a lot more comfortable with it.

I‚Äôm just sad about losing that part and hopefully that will come to me again and this time the other person will actually want a relationship and be available.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mr7f7l/girl_broke_things_off_bc_it_was_getting_too/

He said we should break things off when he moves, because he is going for a year and doesn‚Äôt think that he can control himself for that amount of time. Which I respect. At least he was straight forward and honest. 
He is unlike any man that I have ever met or will ever meet. 
I‚Äôm not sure how to feel or what to do. 
Should I still hope that one day we can be together?

7,mr7llx,1618461205,He asked for space for a few days and hasn't reached out but he has a high-value item that he left at my house?,"I've been friends with a guy for several years and we decided to take things seriously back in December. We both were in relationships in 2020 so we both agreed to take our time. However, a committed relationship has always been the objective, as I am dating with intention and not for fun - he said the same thing. Last week, he got upset (for a valid reason) and asked for space for the weekend. So far, it's been almost a week of no contact and he's pretty inactive on social media. I have not contacted him at all, but did I see that he was watching my stories. I don't think he's being honest about why he wants space due to a conversation we had about the future.

I was honest that I would want a commitment before the end of the year. We already date exclusively and long-term dating with no title is unacceptable to me. He says he has certain goals he would like to accomplish before establishing a relationship. I stood my ground and then he said it doesn't mean he wouldn't commit if they weren't complete. We agreed early on that if either of us wanted to stop dating, we would give the other person the common courtesy of letting them know. We both had previous partners cut us off suddenly.

He has an electronic item at my house that he forgot on accident that's worth $300-400. He left it behind before he asked for space, but he knows it's here. I was just going to send it via certified mail with a tracking number and no warning. My friend said I should give it a few more days and if there's still no contact, send a text to see what's up and mention the item... It's a no for me Lol.

What does a relationship look like? What is a ""talking stage""?

14,mr7vix,1618462469,I (F28) am jealous of a dead person,"I (F28) was with this guy (M24) for more than half a year now. We are not really into relationship because we want to know each other before committing to something serious and we want to take things slow. We do a lot together and we enjoy each other's company.

Yesterday, we were chilling and listening to music, a thing we both enjoy. Suddenly, a sad playlist came and I teased him about it. He told me that listening to sad music was his way of coping up with the loss of his gf. 

For context, he told me about this vaguely during our day 1 so at least I know. He somehow blames himself for her death and I find him staring at her picture at times. He doesn't hide it and explains that she is his greatest regret. He said he is fine now and I believe him since he seems genuinely happy when he is with me - teasing, laughing.

Yesterday though, we were talking about her and I found out more about what happened. It was just recent (2 years ago) and she is the same age as me. As he spoke about her, I realized she is someone very different than me. She is someone I can never become. The way his eyes twinkle when he is talking about her, the longing and staring into space when he remembers her. It sort of hurt me. Those sparks are not there when he is with me. He said he never felt deeply for another person since then.

I know there are part of us that forever belongs to someone else other than our partner/spouse. I also understand that she is already gone but I can't help but feel sad, that despite my efforts, it seems that I cannot reach his heart. 

I am now wide awake, thinking about this. I really love this guy and I really want to pursue an LTR with him, or even more. The way he put it into words made me think what I am to him. I want to ask him but I cannot find the words, because I don't want to pressure him into a relationship with me and I am afraid of what he will say.

How can I broach this topic to him? What should I do with this feeling and him?

The girl who‚Äôs younger, she‚Äôs nice. Conversation flows easy with her and she always responds fast. She‚Äôs pretty too.

I texted him more, and I sent way more pics n stuff to him. He also showed signs he was more ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù? (idk if thats the right word) he said for him or guys in general they get like 1match a day(for me i had like 20+ a day, but i‚Äôm pretty sure theres way more guys on the dating apps). Also when sending pics he would always compliment me/my body. But if I compliment him, he finds it hard to accept it. Im scared he thinks Im out of his league? because i‚Äôm not at all. 

Or he‚Äôs so busy with work, he‚Äôs just too tired and doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me.
But if I were in his position, even with work, I would go on my phone during break and go straight to txting him.
Sometimes he won‚Äôt txt me in the morning. He apologized and says he‚Äôs too tired (from work).

Also this is the only online dating app he downloaded i think because he said. and he was only doing it for the free trial(u can see their likes,etc) and i downloaded it for that reason too.

But we live in different countries. I really want to see him after covid. But im scared he thinks thats a stupid idea, he says plane tickets are expensive.

Im overthinking a lot. and i know he has a life. but i never got a text since yesterday. I had another guy ghost me for 3 days, came back with no explanations
 and acted like he just didn‚Äôt ghost me.

I find myself just waiting the whole day for him to text me back. But Im scared he‚Äôll think im clingy or annoying. But I feel like if your on a dating app and match, you should at least have some interest..I feel betrayed and sad after waiting for so long. Im also scared to lose interest because I need attention, and without it, I‚Äôll feel unwanted, and my mind will slowly accept the fact that I was wasting my time and move on but I don‚Äôt want to.

Im wondering, when i visit him. and while we get to know each other more he‚Äôll start to show interest. and when I go back home, he‚Äôll finally want me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mr9fll/it_sucks_holding_back_mef18_himm23/

34,mr9oqx,1618471248,Dating is inherently discriminatory but not in a bad way,"Dating is discriminatory. If it wasn't we would be dating people we aren't attracted to and the ones we friend zoned but here we are. 

People have the right to reject you for ANY  reason and this does not make them bigoted unless obvious disrespect is involved. People have the right to body autonomy and anyone who is against it is a rape apologist.

Excluding someone from a job because they are fat is wrong and discriminatory. Refusing to have sex with someone because they are fat is not. The difference is a job is a basic human right but dating isn't.

Dating is not a basic human right and someone refusing to date you for whatever reason is not oppression.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mr9oqx/dating_is_inherently_discriminatory_but_not_in_a/

I had felt he was being a bit off since the second date anyway. After the cancelled date he would open my messages and not reply for hours. It could‚Äôve been because of family stuff or he wanted me to get the hint? So in the end I stupidly messaged him and said I thought the vibe is off, and didn‚Äôt want to waste either of our time. He never replied. All I can do now is cringe and wonder why I even bothered sending it, I should‚Äôve just let things play out.

My wife passed, I went into kidney failure, and I spent a good year and a half comming to terms with both ordeals which wasn't the easiest of challenges. I started looking for someone several months ago but I was really having no luck, and everybody but me could see it was because I wasn't allowing myself to heal from my past. About a month ago I decided to give up looking and focus on myself, I took a good hard look at where I was in life and realized that my past was having an incredible toll on me both physically and mentally. I came up with the Idea that I wouldn't talk about specifics when it comes to my past anymore, every time I would dive into my memories I would basically be ripping the scab off of the wound and it would have to take time to begin to heal again. That was my first step my second step was to give up looking for anybody to date and to focus on letting myself be happy with who I am and where I am in life. It didn't take very long and immediately my outlook on life has improved dramatically. I feel much more confident now and I'm very happy with the decisions that I'm making for myself. It must be showing because just a week ago I met an incredible woman who I have a very strong connection with. It was obvious from the moment we met I'm going on my second date with her this weekend and have decided that I'm not going to put any pressure on myself if it works out it does if it doesn't I was learning to be happy with myself before she came around but I do have a good feeling about this.

People say that ""guys like short girls"" but a) I have an unattractive face, which puts them off instantly and b) all of the guys I've had crushes on in the past liked the tall super skinny model types. All it does is mean that when I used to use dating apps I would attract guys who had a fetish for short woman because they were into dom/sub dynamics or whatever, which is something that disgusts me.

69,mrd7x9,1618488258,I ruined my relationship and I don‚Äôt know how to forgive myself and I just want him back,"Me and my now ex boyfriend were together for 2 and a half years and we both genuinely thought we would end up being together forever and we would grow old together as cringey as it sounds. 

So them as a couple we‚Äôve been through a lot together considering we are so young, like I had to hide him for the first 6/7 months of the relationship because of my strict parents and he found it hard as his parents are so chill and have been together since they were 15. Then around last year in quarantine I had a really tough time as me and my family don‚Äôt get along much and so he was my closest friend and boyfriend and I ended up being horrible to him and a absolutely toxic person because my family were putting a lot of pressure and I have a tendency to bottle things up and then explode and then I used to treat him so badly. Then after him trying to break up with me I finally realised what a awful person I was being and I changed and stopped being that bad towards him and it was good for a long time. Then after a while there was a relapse and like I wasn‚Äôt as bad as I was before but once pressure with family was increasing I was being immature towards him and idk it started like going on a cycle in which every month 3 weeks was amazing and then 1 week would be arguing because of me being immature. So 2 weeks ago there was a situation in which everyone was telling me to be careful of his girl best friend and I usually am not a jealous person and I‚Äôm super chill but so many people were commenting on them so I got suspicious and also the fact that I thought he completely ignored me on this particular day. So I kind of started asking questions and it turned into a argument because he kept on saying the situation was childish and it felt he was invalidating my feelings and so my emotions were on overdrive partly because of this and partly because of a serious family issue and I was being so unreasonable and he tried to go to sleep and say I love you even while I was arguing. But yeah the next day he wanted to meet up I thought it would be to discuss this situation but he broke up with me and I was heartbroken I knew why he did it and I just felt so rubbish about myself and like it‚Äôs all my fault because we both love each other so much the breakup wasn‚Äôt a argument it was friendly and we hugged and said I love you. I think I took him for granted and thought he would always be there which was my fault completely and I will always regret it for the rest of my life. But anyways we decided to block each other for a while and 5 days later I wanted to apologise for my lack of communication and so yeah he replied and was like thank you and then we had a bit of a conversation and then he kept on giving me mixed signals because I was clear I wanted to get back together but I wasn‚Äôt pushy I was like I know what I‚Äôve put you through so I understand if you don‚Äôt want to get back together. But then he called me by our version of ‚Äòbabe‚Äô which I was confused because you wouldn‚Äôt call a friend that and then the next day he sent me a TikTok even though he was the one who didn‚Äôt want to talk. But anyways we had a conversation and I asked him if he saw a future for us and he was like I don‚Äôt right now and was like who knows I‚Äôm the future it could change and I admit I was being a little pushy and saying like if I‚Äôm making steps to change ect and he was quite harsh with me and I guess from there I was like I kinda accepted I messed up a amazing relationship because I couldn‚Äôt keep my emotions in check and so a few days later I went to his house and returned loads of stuff be I was like there‚Äôs not a chance we‚Äôre getting together and he‚Äôll never take me back so I was like I really need to fully move on. Then he got annoyed at me for returning the stuff because we were originally supposed to return stuff a month after no contact and he got a bit annoy at the goodbye letter I gave him as well. But the the next day he said he‚Äôll return my stuff back as well and it seemed we both accepted that it won‚Äôt work but then when we met up it was amazing no awkwardness so much chemistry because we are both such good friends and we we‚Äôre going gbto have a closure chat and I still made it clear I wanted to get back together and yeah there was a few things that he said if you told me before this would be a different story and then we hung out and cuddled like afterwards because we were both upset and accidentally got too sexy with each other and nearly hooked up before he stopped it happening. But then before he walked me back to my house and drive away we were both like we will always love each other and the he also said like I need to think about things niw before he drive off, which gave me so much hope because I was like he might be thinking of the possibility. When he reached back he he messaged me and said sorry we got too caught up with each other and like I was like oh is he not thinking about us getting back together anymore and so I said things like ‚Äò even if we don‚Äôt get back together at least we will still be friends‚Äô just to sort of keep that doir open for us in the future and yeah he didn‚Äôt say anything to that but he never hinted or denied at possibly getting back together. But we reinstated the 1 month no contact again

But yeah I‚Äôm so lost now I just want him back so much I‚Äôm trying to be calm and I want to get therapy and show him we can work, I miss everything about him if I had my emotions in check more we would still be together and like looking to the future. It‚Äôs just the fact that before this argument it was so amazing and like even a few days before we were planning our future adventures together and in 1 day it all changed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrd7x9/i_ruined_my_relationship_and_i_dont_know_how_to/
70,mrdhec,1618489209,it‚Äôs hard to date when you want to be smart (ish) but also want something long term,"disclaimer: all opinions are my own, we all share different views &amp; that‚Äôs okay &lt;3 


my oh my, it‚Äôs probably a week before my monthly cycle &amp; I can already feel my emotions being a mess.
IMO - I find myself to be someone who either likes you, or plain out doesn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt ~grow~ to fancy someone, it usually is off the bat. HOWEVER even if I do start liking somebody, I find it best to show that I‚Äôm not interested, but keep them as a friend. 
I truly feel like the best long term relationships start off as really good friendships. You never exactly know what a person is really like if you‚Äôre going into a date off the bat because people will ( USUALLY NOT ALWAYS ) show the best versions of themselves. You won‚Äôt see who that person is until you spend time with them. Being a detailed oriented person bites me right in the cheeks when it comes to this. If I‚Äôm interested in you, I WILL observe everything. I‚Äôll look at your posture, what you put into your body, how you talk to your friends/family, does our humor match up, what shows you watch or games you play, how active you are, what your hobbies on a daily are .. etc. ALL OF THIS, to see how much we have a in common and see if we could possibly go anywhere from just being friends. I know there is no such thing as perfection, but often times I‚Äôve done this, it all just results in a really cool friendship (which I‚Äôm thankful for, no doubt). 
I absolutely detest the saying ‚Äú the right one comes at the right time ‚Äú. Okay but how do you guarantee that? 

Honestly, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been trying to put myself out there and ~into the dating world~ mostly because of this COVID situation but does that mean I should? I‚Äôm also 21 (young and naive for the most part probably) and going through a small existential crisis sort of thing but it‚Äôs rough out here for a college gal. 

PS: I made a previous post before asking on how to shoot my shot at my local barista, well turns out that was the last time I saw him because he no longer works there :-) ahahahaa

77,mre1uv,1618491273,So I got my first date in months!... But it was the worst date I've ever had.,"I revamped my dating profile and I hit it hard. I used tinder, bumble, and hinge. I got a message from a girl on bumble. I skimmed over her bio and she seemed normal. While talking to her, she asked me out. I was like sure, why the hell not, so we decided to meet for dinner.

We met in the parking lot and she hugged me. And made some small talk. It was cool. However, once we were about to enter, I put on my mask. She looked at me and said, ""ugh. I hate wearing masks. Don't they know they can't make you wear one"". üö©. She went in without wearing a mask.

We sat down and our server was helping us. We ordered our food and she left. She then said, "" ugh. Foreigners right?! Taking american jobs. "" üö©

Once we sat down, after we ordered, she changed her position to laying across the booth, putting her feet on the long chair thing, which I thought was weird. We started talking. She was heavily into GOD. I personally don't believe in GOD, but I don't push it on people. I don't give a shit what you believe in. She asked me about my beliefs. I chickened out and said sure, I do. She noticed my hesitation and told me why GOD was real to her. She said she didn't believe in GOD, until she started watching YouTube videos. I asked her, what else she watched on youtube, but it was just GOD stuff.

I changed the subject to our jobs, since I don't believe in GOD or go to church or pray. I work in health care. She asked, ""did you get the covid-19 shot?"" I said no, because if the medication I'm taking, it lowers my immunity. She said, ""good, because the shot doesn't work. It's just a bunch of chemicals the government is injectioning into people. It does nothing"". üö©

While talking about our jobs, she said she was losing hers, due to the pandemic. I asked her where she worked. She said at a ministry retirement home. She said they are moving the people who live there out and closing up the place. I told her that sucks. She said she's living at home, which is fine, but when I asked her what she was going to do, she said her parents love her so much, she doesn't need to find a job. üö©. 

I asked her about her education. She said she didn't go to college or have any training, which is weird, because she said she was a nurse at the retirement home, but she did say, she just sat around because it was chill there, so I'm not sure if she needed medical training, if she was, more or less, a baby sitter. I asked her if she wanted to get a higher education or certificates or anything and she said no. üö©. This tells me, she doesn't want to better herself in anyway. Heck, even being unemployed, like I was, for a year, I tried to focus on myself by exercising and stuff, but it didn't seem like she wanted to do any of that (better herself).

On the plus side, she paid for our bill. I was offering to pay it, since she lost her job.

We left, hugged and said goodbye. Today I texted her, saying it isn't going to work out. From what I've gathered on my date, she's super christian and conservative, doesn't believe in science, doesn't like foreigners or even people with accents, and doesn't want to better herself. Our core ideals don't match up, like being conservative or christian. I guess I'd be atheist and liberal/moderate. I also don't like bigotry either. I felt bad for our server. 

I hold no ill will towards her or anything, but it was just a complete miss match and I laughed about it afterwards.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mre1uv/so_i_got_my_first_date_in_months_but_it_was_the/

We‚Äôd gone on really great dates, he actually took the effort to make them special, and I took the effort to do little nice things for him like baking his favorite cookies and showing up to the date with them (lol), we connected so well, we have all the same interests, I never had to guess how he felt because he was so open, his communication was consistent, being around him just felt so easy. He listens to what I say, actually remembers them (even the little details), and references them in later conversations. He can even come over to sit on my front porch and talk/share stories/quietly listen to the bugs chirping together. For once, someone who likes me just as much as I like them. He even made attempts to define that we are a ‚Äúthing‚Äù and not getting to know anyone else. It‚Äôs only been less than 2 months but I haven‚Äôt felt this sure about anyone since my last relationship, years ago. Listening to my gut here. 

And now I‚Äôve been getting mixed signals. I don‚Äôt get it.

83,mrei7v,1618492805,How to opt-out of a situationship,"So I was seeing this guy from tinder and we had a great start. Both very affectionate and very much into each other.

But soon I started noticing that he was talking about himself much more than about me. At first I didn't care/notice it that much, as I was crushing soo hard.

Over time, this didn't really improve. He just tended to shift the conversation in his topics real quick. He did ask me questions and I told him things about myself, but we mostly ended up talking about him. 

I got insecure about it. Should I be more confident? Should I claim my space in the conversation? Should I politely ask him to stay with my topic a little longer? It all felt unnatural. It's something one might ask from family, friends and partners, but not tinder guys you have a crush on.

I spoke to my therapist about it and she told me two things: 1, that if someone likes you they generally want to get to know you as much as possible and want to make you feel comfortable around them so you'll stay. 2, she told me I should test him. Not in a cruel, manipulative way, just observing the conversation and draw my conclusions.

I got the chance the same day when we were texting back and forth again. I told him about a relatively cool opportunity I wanted to pursue and that I couldn't decide on a topic as there were so many options. He Basically completely overlooked that, asked one superficial question and directly moved to his stuff again. This moment it became very apparent to me that I was just some kind of container for his self portrayal. He didn't like me or found me interesting, he just likes the attention and the validation I give him.

Now here's the point: we kinda made it a habit to text or speak every day. It feels unnatural and immature to just stop replying or letting this fade out, but I don't really feel in a position to criticize him or telling go Somethings wrong with him. He might be interested in people, just not in me. I'm not sure how to tell him - quite out of the blue - that's not how I imagine a good relationship (of whatever sort) to be. And for an exclusively physical relationship we talk waaaay too much. I'm pretty sure that at one point he'll ask me what's wrong and I want to be honest but not brutal.

While I don't mind guys asking me to snap when we first start talking to see what we both look like, it feels as though people seem to prefer this app to talk consistently. I highly value my privacy and person space so I already get overwhelmed when I receive many messages, but on snapchat there's also the pressure of having to show yourself every single reply. What's even worse is some guys won't put in the effort to have a conversation, and rather just send pictures of their face alone. When I don't reply to these, they'll just send another, or even get upset I didn't reply. Not to mention those who insist on having streaks when I specifically tell them I have no interest in following through with them.

My friends seem to think I exaggerate on this but the pressures of online convos have weighed really heavily on me lately, mainly since I started to prioritize living in the moment. I'm tired of having small talks every day with the same people.

I‚Äôve realised after some soul searching and dating around that I am looking for a committed healthy relationship with the right person and where we can share experiences together but at a slow pace as I am not in a rush to have children, get married etc. 
I own my own home, have a great career and have developed a good support network of family and friends over the years and it would be nice to share experiences with someone. 
I was in a long term relationship of 7 years and this was just the wrong person in the end and we also met very young. 

Issue I‚Äôm having is that when I first went into dating I was saying casual which was a big no no as I don‚Äôt do hookups or friends with benefits and this is what guys perceived casual as. 

I basically date to see if people match up for a healthy relationship as described above then decide from there so I‚Äôm fine with not being exclusive for a certain amount of time. 

How do I phrase this in today‚Äôs dating world without scaring someone off at the beginning. They may hear relationship and be scared off but what I mean is let‚Äôs see how it goes and if we match for a relationship then we can see if we can take it to the next level.

87,mrfic8,1618495936,Men and their ridiculously high standards have destroyed my self-esteem,"After years of rejection from men and being treated horribly by men: my (25F) crushes never liking me back, guys in clubs and bars always hitting on my friends but ignoring me, men on dating apps matching with me solely to insult my appearance, etc, I've come to realise something about men:

Men ONLY want to get into relationships and hook up with beautiful women. And I'm talking the face of a supermodel and body of a porn star, simply being ""pretty"" isn't enough for them. They want perfection. The only reason why some of them do date women who aren't perfect is because they're settling. If they could get more attractive women, they would. That's why so many men cheat: they're constantly on the lookout for a more attractive woman to come along. And even with the women they settle for, you have to be at least a 7 or 8. If you don't have a good bone structure, big boobs, or aren't skinny, forget ever finding love. The most you'll get is desperate creeps who want to have a one night stand with you and never contact you again after.

All that crap about how men say they want ""natural"" woman is nothing but a bunch of lies. They don't find you beautiful and sexy with no makeup on and wearing sweatpants, they want Emily Ratajkowski in a tiny dress and heels. They just say those things because they'll do whatever they can to get sex. 

I don't even know if I actually am ugly, but I've always assumed I must be because of my experiences with men. I desperately want to be one of those girls like Lizzo and Princess Nokia who love themselves and feel attractive even if they aren't conventionally attractive, but I can't because of men and their ridiculous standards and the horrible ways in which they have treated me. They've made me feel like the ugliest woman on earth. The only way in which I have a hope of feeling better is by spending hundreds a week on therapy, which I can't even afford right now.

Maybe I sound bitter, but I don't care. Men have made me feel hideous, disgusting, undesirable, worthless, less of a woman, and unworthy of love. My self esteem is in the gutter because of them. And I will forever resent them for it.

So yeah, thanks a lot for that men. Your lies and absurdly high standards have turned who should be a confident woman into a self-hating mess. Hope you feel great about yourselves!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrfic8/men_and_their_ridiculously_high_standards_have/
88,mrfjdc,1618496028,It‚Äôs early days but I (f27) have already been invited to his (m30) best friends wedding.,"Something positive to share. I‚Äôve been dating someone for just a few months now. It‚Äôs early days but it‚Äôs going well. We‚Äôre from very different backgrounds but we have similar interests, same taste in music, food, and humour. We‚Äôve mostly met outdoors so we haven‚Äôt done anything special but have still had an amazing time, every time. He‚Äôs a joy to be around and last time we met we were laughing til we couldn‚Äôt breathe and were crying.

Anyway, he sent me an invite to one of his best friends wedding late summer. The envelope had my full name on it. I‚Äôm honestly touched because I haven‚Äôt met his friends and although we agreed to exclusivity, we haven‚Äôt got labels as it‚Äôs early. It‚Äôs a glamorous venue as well so it won‚Äôt be cheap to let him bring another person. He obviously sees us being together in the near future. His friend is also from uni so I‚Äôll be meeting all of his uni friends - I won‚Äôt just be introduced to two special people in his life, but half a dozen. 

I‚Äôm emotional because I haven‚Äôt had very nice boyfriends. I‚Äôm used to being hidden away, kept secret, controlled, abused etc. I do, however, take responsibility for it because I could‚Äôve left those situations sooner but I chose to stay. I never blamed all men for the way I was treated, as there are good men out there and women can be abusers too. I‚Äôm fully over it and I‚Äôm elated to have met someone wonderful.

89,mrfofx,1618496448,Men and their ridiculously high standards have destroyed my self-esteem,"After years of rejection from men and being treated horribly by men: my (25F) crushes never liking me back (none of them even found me attractive enough for a drunken kiss), guys in clubs and bars always hitting on my friends but ignoring me, men on dating apps matching with me solely to insult my appearance, etc, I've come to realise something about men:

Whether it's for a serious relationship, casual dating, or one night stand, men ONLY want beautiful women. And I'm talking the face of a supermodel and body of a porn star, simply being ""pretty"" isn't enough for them. They want perfection. The only reason why some of them do date women who aren't perfect is because they're settling. If they could get more attractive women, they would. That's why so many men cheat: they're constantly on the lookout for a more attractive woman to come along. And even with the women they settle for, you have to be at least a 7 or 8. If you don't have a good bone structure, big boobs, or aren't skinny, forget ever finding love. The most you'll get is desperate creeps who want to have a one night stand with you and never contact you again after.

All that crap about how men say they want ""natural"" woman is nothing but a bunch of lies. They don't find you beautiful and sexy with no makeup on and wearing sweatpants, they want Emily Ratajkowski in a tiny dress and heels and plastered in makeup. They just say those things because they'll do whatever they can to get sex.

I don't even know if I actually am ugly, but I've always assumed I must be because of my experiences with men. I desperately want to be one of those girls like Lizzo and Princess Nokia who love themselves and feel attractive even if they aren't conventionally attractive, but I can't because of men and their ridiculous standards and the horrible ways in which they have treated me. They've made me feel like the ugliest woman on earth. The only way in which I have a hope of feeling better is by spending hundreds a week on therapy, which I can't even afford right now.

Maybe I sound bitter, but I don't care. Men have made me feel hideous, disgusting, undesirable, worthless, less of a woman, and unworthy of love. My self esteem is in the gutter because of them. And I will forever resent them for it.

So yeah, thanks a lot for that men. Your lies and absurdly high standards have turned who should be a confident woman into a self-hating mess. Hope you feel great about yourselves!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrfofx/men_and_their_ridiculously_high_standards_have/

93,mrfvy9,1618497093,Best pro tips for successful relationships?,"Looking for any pro tips you‚Äôve got!

Back on the dating scene (33F) . I get chronically ghosted and am trying to hone in on the factors which may cause this. What are some of your best tips for success? I define success as a monogamous relationship with someone after the dating stage is over. I never reach this stage. I did last year and got ghosted after 3 months (cold world). 

Give me anything you‚Äôve got but some specific items on my mind are:

1. When do you choose to sleep with someone? I hate sleeping with them then getting ghosted. I only do so if I feel I want a relationship with them. However I never discuss it in advance. 

Do you recommend establishing exclusivity or intentions of a relationship before taking this next step? 

2. What are some bright red flags for someone who was never serious about you to begin with? 

3. How much of this ‚Äúhard to get‚Äù game do you advise playing vs. just being real with your enthusiasm or feelings? My friends tell me to just act like I don‚Äôt give a f*** about the guy, but this doesn‚Äôt seem mature or healthy. 

4. What kind of positive feedback have you ever gotten from partners, for example ‚ÄúI fell for you because ___‚Äù 

5. How do you recommend battling attachment style issues? I am anxiously attached and always manage to find avoidant men.

96,mrg3ru,1618497757,I (28M) have been dating this woman (33F) who really wants to kiss all the time and nothing more,"Ok don‚Äôt jump on me for the reductive title. 

We met on OLN and by our second date we had communicated that we weren‚Äôt looking for the same things. I‚Äôm looking for something more casual and sexual after getting out of a LTR recently, and she‚Äôs looking for something serious and someone to meet her kid and maybe be something to them. Even though we acknowledged we aren‚Äôt looking for the same things, we still have been flirty over text, she sends me unsolicited nudes and we‚Äôve gone on multiple dates since then. 

I‚Äôm confused by this girl because she constantly signals sexual interest in me (and we have had sex once) but most of the time when it comes to transitioning from kissing to sex she always shuts it down. I‚Äôm a very sexual person and I‚Äôve made it clear I don‚Äôt really enjoy hours of making out without it leading to sex. It just makes me frustrated and underwhelmed - we literally make out for a few hours every time and she sleeps over. And she has said that while she is normally a very sexual person recently she just likes kissing and is working through some stuff through this. I‚Äôm cool with being helpful for whatever she‚Äôs going through but I guess I wish I knew what was going on here so I could deal with how it effects me better. Being teased is fun I guess but it‚Äôs hard for me not to internalise the rejection every time and take it personally. And honestly sexless half-intimacy isn‚Äôt really what I‚Äôm looking for. 

She texts me all the time and wants to come over and kiss but it just makes me feel rejected and bad :/",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrg3ru/i_28m_have_been_dating_this_woman_33f_who_really/
97,mrgeyq,1618498681,Having much more pleasant dates with conservative women,"I am not really interested in politics, as long as people aren't too extremist I couldn't care less about their ideology. During the last couple months I've went on a few first dates and I've noticed that conservative women appreciate things that liberal women take as insults -- at least in my recent experience. I'd hold a door for a conservative woman, and she'd thank me for it and genuinely smile. I'd do it for a liberal woman, best case scenario she'd just ignore me, one even said something along the lines of: ""women can hold doors themselves"". 

During conversations with conservative woman, they'd hardly talk about politics (I just knew they were conservative from their bumble profile). Liberal women would try to make every single conversation about politics -- constantly bringing up the patriarchy, complaining about innocuous things such a bartender giving them the coke and me the beer when we ordered the other way around, bringing up male privilege out of nowhere, anti-capitalism rants out of the blue...

I was married for 7 years and just starting dating again couple months ago, so I'm not sure if I've just been unlucky and over-generalizing. FWIW I live on an european capital.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrgeyq/having_much_more_pleasant_dates_with_conservative/
98,mrgk0x,1618499069,"""Adults communicate clearly and directly. You gotta talk about things. Assumptions rarely lead to positive outcomes.""","I saw this quote today and feel like this is very hard to find. In friendships and romantically. People very readily move past issues that affect connection, either becoming passive aggressive or ending the romance/friendship.. instead of just talking about things to deepen understanding of each other and be cool again.

People are not evil and out to get each other, all it takes is a gentle, considerate conversation to repair.

I feel like I am always the one to initiate reconciliation/communication after a misunderstanding. This has been an issue for most of my life, since probably the 8th grade. It makes ME feel toxic and like I always have a problem. But later I find out they had a problem, and just didn't tell me because they don't want to attack me. Can we talk about a negative event without it being considered an attack? If I am the wrong one, please tell me guys.

It makes me so sad. Feels very lonely, everything is surface and only good if we never step on each other's toes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrgk0x/adults_communicate_clearly_and_directly_you_gotta/
