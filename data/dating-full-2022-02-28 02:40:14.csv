Everything is going great, shes a really fun person to be around.   


We're both engineering majors so we both really swamped with a decent amount of work and were both majorly introverted, for some context. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically on the non stressful parts in her life we really connect at a couple, see each other every couple of days and on the weekends, and we have a good life balance. For midterms though, she's ok going week or a week and a half without seeing me at all. Obviously I get that we both have to study for our exams, but sometimes I just want to get a meal or a little break in with her even once or twice a week during exams, just because I like being around her and feel comfortable in her presence. 

  
Which sucks because she doesn't feel the same way, for example ill ask her to get dinner at the dining hall and she'll cancel saying she needs to stay in her dorm and study. And then she'll be like ill see you next week. :/ Like Next week??? I thought this was a committed relationship. 

  
And then when her stressful week is over she'll start asking to see me yada yada yada and then what if Im busy? Im busy obviously with studying and exams but not enough to see my girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I installed a dating app to try and I got a lot of matches. It doesn't surprise that were a lot of women who didn't respond to me. It's weird but ok, maybe they are busy or indecisive. But...

I got two interesting matches. Let's call the two girls with random names, for example, Jessie and Karen.

- Jessie:

She is a very kind girl. She asks me how am I doing, what am I doing and other questions. Problem? She asks me a lot of banal questions and seems super indecisive. I asked what she was looking at she answer: I don't know, maybe something serious; maybe a friend.    Weird...

I couldn't make a good connection with her. She seems to not like anything that I like. Movies, series, videogames, music, etc.

Today she asked three times how I was doing in my day. One in the morning, one in the evening and one in the night. When she asked my age (which is in the profile) and the last: how am I doing I just sayed: You asked me that three times. Then she apologised and ask me for my number. I basically asked her: Well, what will be the difference? She seemed offended because she told me: Ok, that's a no. Well, I'm tired. I'm gonna sleep. Good night.

Idk what to think. She seems interested but at the same seems that she doesn't know what she is doing.

Then we have, Karen:

Very interesting girl. More honest. More philosophical questions. A lot of humor. But...

She answers the messages with a lot of delay. The last thing I asked was 2 days ago and she today responded me: Sorry. Busy days. Tomorrow I will say hello. 

Maybe I'm impatient as fuck but it's a huge turn off for me talking to you about interesting topics and then you dissapear.

Now I came back to work in the same place (now as a Nurse, new haircut, blah blah) and there she was, being super cool and everything. Luckily, it happened that I got to spend the day with her for my induction. 
By the end of our shift on my first day she called me over and said ""Hey, we are going to party!"", I said No as I was just starting working there. Didn't feel like a big thing.

The days went on, and in one of them I was doing some computer work and she just rested her arm in my shoulder saying ""I'm so tired"". Again this is nothing, but gosh for me it was like heaven, I mean even tho we have just met for a few days, the confidence from since I was an intern to now must feel different. 

In my last day, all the nurses left the room we use to eat, it was just me and her. We chatted for a bit and in the end she asked, ""hey where you live?"", I was thinking, why is she asking me this?, So I replied and then asked her, ""what for?"". She said, ""oh, so we could go together"".
She lives in a specific part of the city so, it is most likely that I don't live near her, but she asked anyways. 
Gosh, yes I know, it's nothing, it is just my head, but I really wanted to think for once my crush was maybe in to me.

I agreed to a date on hinge last night, and we met for drinks. After a nice date, I agreed to a nightcap, with the statement that I wanted to take things slow and was down to continue hanging out but did not want to do anything physical. They agreed, and said that we could just hang out and talk a little more. I said I wanted to head home in about an hour but could hang out until then and they wanted to show me their place which was nearby (we had been discussing real estate and properties, etc and their personal reading and music so this wasn't very suspicious to me).

Upon arriving they showed me the restroom, then told me to choose any music I wanted and gave me their seat at their desk. They went to the restroom, but when they returned they pulled up a chair behind me, blocking me into their square shaped desk space then immediate grabbed my face, aggressively kissed me and started pull down my shirt and grabbing at my chest. I tried to remove their hands, but they were forceful. I had been drinking, and am disappointed in myself for giving up and letting this person violate my boundaries rather than start a fight and see how they would react. I never gave consent and they continued to try to remove my clothes. I removed their hands again and tried to move them off me and get them to back away but due to their physically aggressive tactics, I eventually stopped fighting them off and just wanted the encounter to be over. I distinctly remember telling myself, whatever, if this is happening i may as well try to enjoy it in some way or dissociate and at least I will never have to see this person again. They physically moved me to the bed and I was at least able to insist upon protection which I'm very grateful they complied with.

Unfortunately the person also became physically aggressive with me and choked and slapped me multiple times during the encounter without any kind of permission or discussion. I left and got home as quickly as possible afterwards while trying to act nonchalant so that nothing would escalate. I woke up this morning with bruising across my chest. I've showered twice, cried spontaneously and am having trouble shaking this off.

I really did not want to tell anyone about this because I felt that would make it too real for me. I decided to confide in my cousin and also report the person on hinge with photo evidence of the bruising. I figured at least getting them removed from the platform may save some other women from having this happen to them. Hinge was very prompt and empathetic sending resources and let me know the user was banned. I don't know if it's worth filing a police report. I know their building address from calling an uber but not their unit number and otherwise only have a first name that I believe is not real (they were from Korea, but gave their American name). 

I'm new to dating from a long term relationship, and while I've always known about these risks I've always believed I was a decent judge of character and that people more often than not would prove to be good. I also am doubting myself and feeling extremely upset that I could have done more to say no or fight back.

I decided it might be best for me to try dating with less expectations, get to know new people, focus on working on myself and building more stability, and learn more about myself, relationships, and being the best partner I can be. I’ve tried to lower my standards a little bit on who I’m physically attracted to to see if anything sparks, and so far things have been good! I’ve been going on regular dates and have met some great people that I enjoyed getting to know and now I have 3-4 women that I’ll be going on 2nd dates with (one who I can tell is pretty into me). Honestly, I think these women are physically attractive, and fun to know so far, but also haven’t felt ‘head over heels’ (yet?) like I’ve felt in the past with 3 others. I want to be open to the possibility that I could feel that way in the future but I’m starting to feel nervous that I might need some time to figure that out. Maybe it’s through developing a close friendship to really allow myself to fall for these women? Or maybe I need to find out more about what feels important to me in who I get into a relationship with? Basically I feel I don’t have the necessary experience and don’t want to come off as disrespectful, really don’t want to lead anyone on (since I’ve experienced that), and usually express some of this before doing anything intimate - but at the same time am very open to something long term. From reading profiles and opinions, this idea often appears to be disliked.

Ever since I was young it was hard for me to get the attention of girls. I would always have a crush and never act on it. It wasn’t because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t know how. However, who can blame them if they didn’t like me when I didn’t talk to them? I started getting older and I found it somewhat easier to talk to girls, yet I still rarely did so. One day I meet this girl in one of my classes. We talk for a while and I find out that she likes me too. So we are ‘informally’ together for a few days. Then it just so happens with my luck that she led me on. She liked me, but she wasn’t over her ex. All that time and subsequent emotional trauma for what? This was in high school. After this I stop trying with anyone else in high school. What was the point? No one was going to like me anyway and if they did it still wouldn’t work out. Then I get into college. Freshman year. I feel significantly better about talking to girls. There’s this girl on my floor that I try talking to. She flirts with me for a while. One day it stops. She has a boyfriend. Why? Why did you spend that time leading me on? Still freshman year and I’m determined to not give up. I go to a football game with friends from home who came to visit and I see this girl. We sit next to her and her sister. I talk to her and we have a good conversation through the game. They come back to hang out with us. She shows me signs she might be interested by asking to hang out the following days. I like this girl a lot. Probably more than anyone I ever had. And she was showing interest? She even said “It’s a date!” to when we made plans to do something. Haha. Should have know better. She didn’t like you. She isn’t over her ex. She proceeds to be weirded out that I fell for her so fast and the fact that I thought she might like me too. Next up on the list. Hmm let’s see. I have a girl in one of my discussion groups in one of my new classes. She seems cute. I’d like to get to know her better. I go out of my way to sit next to her and talk to her. Keep in mind this is crazy progress for me. I don’t think I would have ever done this before. She doesn’t talk much back but she does elaborate. She’s quiet in general so that’s fine. A few weeks later: Still not interested? Okay :( I go to a discussion class and there’s multiple open seats. She can sit anywhere she wants. She comes and sits next to me. Oh? Are you interested then? I talk to her. We have a good time walking back to her dorm and we say our goodbyes. A few days later I ask her to get some coffee. I get her number. And I going on a date finally? Wow. We go and get coffee. We have a good time. I pay for her coffee. If it wasn’t clear enough already that this was a date I don’t know what to do for you. It ended okay. It seemed rushed but fine. I continue to think through the event and how it ended. People were telling me I’m overthinking. She has to like you the way she was acting. Lmao nope. She texts me back after I said “I had a good time yesterday. I hope you did too. We should do something fun again soon.” She responds with “Sure. I’m okay as going as friends. I’m not looking for anything else”. This is where I’m at. Years and years of being alone. Years and years of improving myself and gaining experience to talk to these girls. Years and years of rejection. I don’t think I can handle this anymore. I’m at a stuck point. I know I don’t NEED a partner. But I feel that I WANT one, DESERVE one, and am READY for one. “People tell me, don’t rush it. It will happen.” Okay when? Next time I pour all my effort and heart out to someone? Or when I’m 45? I am no Prince Charming but I’m not Shrek either (At least he got the girl) but at this point I feel like I must be doing something wrong or I really am much worse than I think.

Well one day I was the the mall and I get a text message asking what store I’m at from the girl I like. I tell her and all that but later on the day I start to think how she knew I was at the mall and so I text her asking and she says her sister saw me. And to let you know yes her sister knows me but not to a point where like she would recognize me without me seeing them you know. 

So that occurred around Christmas time then later on in January I am texting her and I get a notification that her sister followed me back on Instagram. I check to see it and yea her sister followed me back but for like 2 minutes like it was a mistake and it had me thinking that like was she telling her sister about me. 

So moving to this past week on Friday, in my city we have like a anual rodeo so I invite her because why not. So I invite on a Sunday that way we can go on Friday. So invite and she tells me she’ll see. So the week passed by and at this point it’s Thursday and still no response so I was like its whatever like it’s fine that she maybe didn’t want to go.( it wasn’t fine I was low key hurting) but little did I know that night on Thursday I was coming back from the gym and I get a message from her asking if I still had that extra ticket. So I start to get happy and so Friday comes along and we go to the rodeo it all went great, I feel like we got really close as we’ve never hung out for so long. 

Then I began asking myself like…was she thinking about me that like I didn’t remind her and she remembered? Why did she say yes when she could have easily said no I work etc? (FYI I’m like a 3-4/10 and she’s a solid 9/10 10/10) so it’s just like I’ve been overthinking like is she showing somewhat of interest or am I doing good etc?

Women give me sex easily - I literally don't have to work for it most of the time. I am very direct in my intentions to use them for sex, often saying so directly, and yet they continue to give me what I want.

Though, when it comes to developing emotional connections, if a woman give some sex easily, or even at, I lose most of my interest in pursuing an emotional connection with them.

Is this normal?

There is a girl in my life that we spend a lot of time together, and we have been and continue to develop non-physical intimacy, and I'm so attracted to her and I can sense it's mutual. We haven't even kissed, and I just want to spend lots of time with her and continue to get to know her.

Today I (M22) Invited my friend (F22) to church and then for lunch. We had Subway, we spent like half an hour there. 

Then I was ready to leave and she asked me If I wanted to go to a park nearby to sit and talk(I wasn't expecting that, but obviously I said YES)
So we got there and we sat in a bench and talk about different stuff. 
Note that we met thru a dating app; both of us are introverts (I was always afraid to approach girls... and she consider herself as ""extremely introverted""); we been texting for over a month; we had a call a couple of weeks ago, and this is the second time we sit together at church, so there was moments of calm and silence, but both of us made our best to have a conversation.

After over an hour (I'd say an hour and 20 minutes) we left. I wanted to give her a hug but I think I just wasn't ready for that. 

**Here's the question**
During our conversation she told me she's going to delete the dating app where we met (and where most of our conversations are) but that we could still text each other by text messages (I already have her number)

I've seen various posts where people ask for ""exclusivity"" to the person they're dating. Do you guys think this mean she's doing that? 

I know the best way to answer the question is to ask her, but I just want some opinions.

That turned me off and I haven’t really been speaking with him as a result. I mean when he does reach out I say something but other than that I’ve been not initiating as much. 

He’s attractive but I worry about the future if I were to pursue a relationship with him. How it would be difficult to settle down with someone who doesn’t want to go to college or really have goals. He’s in the military but he doesn’t have goals for the military either. It’s conflicting for me because I keep running into this problem where guys want a relationship then suddenly they don’t and go ghost or they just want sex and go ghost. Then I find someone who wants a relationship and they don’t meet my standards.

I met him from Facebook dating and he seems pretty accepting of my life. I feel bad because I feel like I’m judging him too harshly not everyone wants to go to college and have a direction in life. I’m in college for nursing and is it too much to want to date someone who is also pursuing a degree? Or have specific goals they want for their career. 

I made that mistake with my ex and overlooked his lack of aspirations and our obvious incompatibility. Now we broke up and it was obvious with all the verbal arguments we’d get into. I don’t want a repeat of settling for someone that I’m not sure if we vibe on a personal level. I haven’t even met up with him and he hasn’t asked me out I had to suggest a date but he didn’t ask when. 

Idk I’m just unsure I don’t want to jump into another relationship and end up heart broken really. Relationships have caused me to act unfavorably and chase the other person away. So now I’m hesitant to engage fully and trust that it’ll work out. So I end up overthinking things and distancing myself out of fear that this person isn’t right for me. I’m also a mom too so it’s troublesome to date and find time while going to school. My ex doesn’t have that problem nothing stops him from finding a gf because if he doesn’t he’ll be depressed and lonely.

My ex crushes//partners.

First crush, 
7 Years. Grade 1-7.
He liked math, gaming, obnoxious, social.
We had a weird relationship, it was kind of hot and cold.
In our early years we'd chase each other around trees and try to name a bigger number, he was also a dick. He knew I had a crush on him and in middle school he asked me out, despite the amount of time I spent pining for him I ended up rejecting  him because he only liked me after my school popularity spiked for a bit. He was super friendly to me in highschool but I ignored him. 
He couldn't decide how he wanted to treat me when other people were watching.

Second crush, 
Wore shorts in snow, awkward, anime, soccer, family.
This was only two years and he was out of my league, dude was gorgeous.

Third, 
Anime club leader, overshared, doctor who, masc lesbian.
She wasn't a good person, emotional, didn't care about her appearance, was just tryna smash.

Fourth,
Baddie, weed, makeup, Her dog.
My best friend in highschool-middleschool.
We were close friends in middle school, we were inseparable. We became friends with benefits but never took it farther because I didn't see her that way. The relationship turned sour, she became critical and mean.
We met up and became friends again, she was dating a rich football player but she was still kind of a douche. Ended the friendship eventually because she wasn't keeping promises and disrespecting me when other people were watching. This was my longest.

Fifth, 
First boyfriend
Rocknroll, acting/media, indie videogames, booze.
Bruh this was a doozy, rushed in, broke up a few times, got cheated on a one point. Had a genuine affinity for him, he was pretty sweet and I liked how wild amd weird he was. I don't think he liked how wild he was and I think he liked something in me that I didn't like myself as well. Lots of miscommunication, this relationship took such a massive blow to my self esteem. He couldn't decide if he was serious about me.

Interlude (period of time where I was healing but I wasnt ready to date) 

- dude who WAS WAYYYYYY out of my league at my school, he seemed like he had some kind of cool guy syndrome, type of dude to care to much about his image.
Kinda seemed possessive which put me off.

- dude I met In the ""politocs"" tag of omegle, he was charismatic and blunt, we talked about weird spirtual/political views, he had some weird views. did wayyyy to much lsd in his past. Like he referred to himself as a vegetable in certain points of his life. This was short but it was the first crush I developed after my ex.

-this dude I talked to from a small town, he was a stoner who talked to me like I was a kid. Wasn't attracted to him, end of story. Took me a month to break the news to him.

-economic major I met during a dnd game, walking red flag. Posted nothing but memes about sex, being on that grind, fake deep quotes, gym stuff. That's not my personal cup of tea. 


Sixth,
Street fashion, sweets, slipknot, country.
Dude was GORGEOUS. Funny, could bounce off of each other's words really easily, seemed down to earth and emotionally intelligent. The only issue was the fact he was also flirting with a 16 year old at 22 and groped her in public.

My boyfriend and I started off as something more casual. We were a summer fling, especially since he was planning on joining the military and expected to be leaving in a few months.

We hung out many times, at least once a week for several months, and I started getting attached to him. I guess casual relationships aren't really my style, lol. He was the only person I was talking to when we weren't technically together, but I know that he was talking to several other people at least in the first 2-3 months (including one of my friends...). Eventually I told him how I felt about him,  and he told me he really likes me but he didn't want to get in a relationship with me because he was going to be leaving. This went on for about 6 months.

We had that same conversation a few times, and eventually he mentioned that he started calling me his girlfriend to his physical therapist and some other more random people he interacts with. A few days later I asked if I was only his girlfriend to his PT, or if I am actually his girlfriend and he finally agreed to be my ""official"" boyfriend (I know how high school that sounds lol). 

He eventually had his MEPS date, but was not accepted because of his physical, since he injured himself a year or two ago and I guess it hadn't fully healed to military standards. This unfortunately for him meant he cannot join the military for at least a few more years. 

We've been dating for about 3-4 months now, but he still hasn't said ""I love you"" yet. I have been feeling the need to say it for about the past month, but after feeling like I was pushing him to be in a relationship with me in the first place I feel like I want him to say it first. Do you guys think he'll actually tell me he loves me...? He acts like he loves me. He took me out for valentines day, texts me every day with updates, wants to call me at night, I go places with his family, he opens up to me about his fears and embarrassing stories etc. 

Realistically I feel like its unlikely we'll be together forever, since he will now be leaving for college in a different state and long distance definitely doesn't really suit either of us. He is also going several hours away for the entire summer for work, so I'm not sure if I'll really get to see him much between now and his upcoming school year. This makes me very sad, but he hasn't really expressed any worry over it. We haven't even talked about it yet.

He’s had a lot of relationships in the past, two within the last year. I have had one proper relationship in my life, and have dated several people that I didn’t want to progress into relationships. It makes me wonder if this is a genuine connection and the start of a real relationship, or if it’s just the way he operates; that is, he dates and falls for people quickly, then moves on just as quick.

It was the worst thing to say goodbye, we both had a hard time saying goodbye. He wouldn’t even get intimate with me the day I left cause he felt it would make it harder to leave and he strongly believes we will meet again.
 
We made plans on how to see each other again and connect in a couple of months , he was very enthusiastic about the plans and making sure I promised to keep in touch so we can meet again. 
However, I feel like it might be useless because I fell inlove with him and I feel like keeping intouch makes it harder for me and my feelings. 
I feel like asking him to cut all contacts so I could grief and move on. And he still has a couple of months to travel, he could still meet a new girl, even though he said he doesn’t want to get too close again with someone on his travels again but shit happens.

I’ve cried alot since I returned, thinking of how hard it is to just keep talking to someone I love and hoping on the day we meet again.

Long story - I’ve been seeing this guy for 3 months, met him 19/20 times - we sleep over at each other’s every weekend and middle of the week.. u thought it was heading towards a relationship. 

I had a fight with my dad and just told him how I was in a bad mood after calling home. He told me he’d rather stay away from the family topic and avoid it. 

I found this extremely unfair. The thing is, he’s been having problems with his family, I’ve offered to listen to him, and he chose not to tell me yet (which is completely ok! I don’t want to force him). But because he’s been on calls with family all the time, 90% of the times I hang out with him, he’s on his phone calling or texting them or disturbed… 

The thing is, I feel like I’ve been more understanding of his family situation  waiting for him to get off calls in restaurants, walking off from dates so he can talk etc and he’s the one who chose not to tell me..but I found is extremely unfair that he told me he would rather not have me tell him about my family… 

Even if we aren’t dating- isn’t that part of atleast being friends?? 

I told him this and he raised his voice..I told him how hurt I feel and that he doesn’t treat me right..I exit his house at 2 am crying…he didn’t even bother to ask if I’m ok..and he hasn’t spoken to me in 3 days now…

Sometimes, we meet someone, we connect, we feel things, sparks fly both ways and its the most beautiful thing to have ever been. Some other times, interest or feelings might not be mutual. And that, almost reflexively brings feelings of hurt and disappointment.

And I absolutely get that. That's part of the deal of us being human and when we choose to show up and be vulnerable, we open ourselves up to love and hurt alike.

For anyone that love and connection are core values for, we'd be putting ourselves out there as often as we can. Math and probability then dictate that both the chances of finding love and being hurt increase.

i told him i was gonna delete snap and gave him my number. asked him to text me so i had his, he said he would. 

he then unadded me from snap and never texted me. immediately my mind goes to he’s ghosting me, but he had never given any indication that he wanted to stop talking and im not one to drop an issue so i add him back. he accepts me back the next day. 

(btw he had unadded and readded me earlier in the day for a short enough time that i didnt notice until i got the readd notification. he asked if i had unadded him at this time?)

the first thing he messages is that he wants to see me this week and denied unadding me when i asked. he also said he was trying to message me lots. 

i tried bring it up twice more and he ignores/ denies it. im not gonna drop it so i say again im confused and he admits to unadding me because he thought i was deleting snap. 

i blocked him. 

1. why would you need to unadd me if im deleting snap? no logic to that

2. why deny and ignore my attempts to bring it up

3. he lied about trying to message me, because no messages came through when he accepted me again and he admitted to unadding me so i would’ve dissapeared from his friends list

This is what I look like: https://imgur.com/a/Jr7RnvD


Do I really look that bad? I’m starting to feel really ugly. I just meet a girl 2 days ago in the club who gave me her snap and she said to message her to go on a date and then she added me and sent a snap saying what do you look like I was too drunk  to remember before I could even ask for the date. I sent a photo and just said haha this is what I look like, how was your night? And then she views the snap and she removes me as a friend clearly meaning she found me ugly. It’s just so dramatic and over the top do I really look that bad that you have to remove me as a friend. 


Ever since September were my crush really hurt my feelings I have heavily put myself out there in the dating world, by cold approaches (something I never imagine I could do) , all dating apps, and made a move on of my friends who I don’t really know that well, and even gone  to the club  a few times with my friend which I hate clubbing since I don’t drink or dance. 


And all I’ve gotten is a spiral of Ls. Straight rejections on rejections.  I’ve never been on a date ever never even had a gf. I had one tongue kiss from a girl who all my friends say was a 4/10  I just wanted to actually experience what a kiss with a girl felt like. The worst thing is my friend did 90% of the speaking for me then bam kiss. I don’t have the skills to do that myself. 

I have quite a bright future I got a scholarship for getting the highest  grade in engineering. My worst fear is getting a girlfriend in my late 20s because at that point girls just looking at me as someone to settle with as I have money or they could tell I won’t hurt there feelings compared to past relationship which is something I don’t want I’ll rather die alone then be settled for.

The thing is I realised communication started to slow down and change. It wasn't easy to reach her anymore and she kept giving me one or two sentence answers. Then she became sick. I don't really have a lot of free time, maybe 2-3 nights a week, so I was pushy and met her.

He’s smart, funny, kind, and really creative. I typically hate texting as it can feel like a chore, but our convos consisted of very thorough chains of messages. 

We planned on meeting for ice cream yesterday, but I was reverse catfished and he ended up being way more attractive than his pictures do justice. I recognize I am not conventionally (or unconventionally) attractive, but have always prided myself on my kindness and ability to hold a conversation, yet yesterday all basic social etiquette went out the window.

- In the beginning I barely spoke. I eased up at the end, but this man was pulling teeth 

- He offers to pay for my ice cream which I refuse and insist I pay for myself in a NON funny/flirty manner  

- We extend it to lunch, and I do the same with the bill

- I speak with my mouth full?!

- He asks if I’m cold (since my nipples were basically daggers) and I say I’m perfectly fine. Even the waitress noticed, so we ended up sitting inside 


The end was a bit of a blur. As we said our goodbye he takes off his mask and I pull down mine (since I actually really wanted to kiss him), but since we hung out a bit longer than expected I rush out and give an awkward hug as my nipples stabbed this poor guy 

I texted him thanks for the good time 2 hrs later and he (much) later responds with a joke. I’m unsure if I should apologize for rushing out, being awkward, or first date nerves? I don’t know if I should ask him to do something next week out of fear of him not liking me anymore or just coming off as too much especially after the bill situations. 

If he doesn’t hate me and we do hang out again, I don’t even know if I’ll be capable of having a comfortable conversation with him? I don’t want to hold anyone on a pedestal or let my insecurities get the better of me, but I can’t stop thinking about how quickly I reverted to an awkward high schooler around him??
