I'm looking for ideas like 'accidently' forgetting sth at his place so he has to meet you again

2,o0d35c,1623759752,Help! How did you recover your mental health from dating apps?,"I have been on and off for months now on dating apps.

I do not know if I was rejected directly, or the 'algorithms' put me on the bottom of the stack, but I've never felt in my life such amount of rejection and unworthiness.

As a first step, I've already deleted all my dating apps.

The problem is now I do not feel I am even ready for real life dating. And here is why.

The rejection in the apps led me to the conclusion that all women will always prefer some tall, handsome, (or white lol) guy over me, be it online or in real life. That it does not matter who I am, or how successful I am, and be it in real or online life, (all) women will always try to catch the attention of these guys.

I know this is not true, but this is the reason for which I am not anymore able to even talk to a lady, as I feel she has already rejected me.

Please help.

The prejudice is real and I can be the best person I could ever be but it really won't matter because I'm Asian first and foremost I guess.

I've gotten the 'Too bad you're Asian' before... but that in combination with the first part just fucking hurts.

We all have our types and our preferences... it would just be nice to know that I as I am could be that for someone. Its just shit to be close to 30 and realising that there's a high chance I won't be coming across anyone that would be romantically interested or attracted to me for me.

I genuinely have my hopes up for the next generation of Asians in the West that the men won't be going through anything similar, with the popularity of kpop and growing representation.

6,o0e5qe,1623763110,Happy when we're together but I'm questioning it when we aren't,"Long story in the shortest way I can possibly tell it.

I ""dated"" a 19 year old male when I was a 17 year old female. At the time we were both going through the hardest years of our lives with him feeling like a failure for dropping out of college and dealing with anxiety/depression. The relationship was always very passionate but in a lot of ways toxic as he was emotionally unavailable.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then he is now 25 and I am 22. I just graduated college and he now has a career in which he works night shifts. I was in a relationship the past 2 years and he was also in a relationship for the past 6+ months. However, he has always told me he wishes he could show me how much he has changed and that I will always be the girl he is in love with and wants to marry. Because of this, when my relationship ended, he had sent me a bouquet of flowers as a congratulations on graduating and I told him if he wants to see what will happen with us he needs to break up with his girlfriend and he did.

&amp;#x200B;

His now ex and him are friends because they have a nonrefundable ticket for a wedding that they are both attending, although she has sent him some texts such as ""thinking of you"" which resulted in me being very upset and setting a boundary that when the trip is over he needs to be very clear with her that he is serious about someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

When we are together, I am probably the happiest I've ever been - he tells me he wants me to commit to him, knows I will be the girl he marries, has kids with, etc. The relationship is still equally as passionate without the fights/toxicity and I really do feel like he's grown up. But because of his work schedule, he sleeps until 4 pm and then goes to work. He takes hours to respond to my texts when before I felt like he'd make time even while working. When he texts me, he tells me he misses me, had so much fun with me, can't wait to see me, etc... We have discussed in person what we feel about the past, how to work through it, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think it's weird that the 4 or 5 out of 7 days we don't get to see each other, he isn't making time to text/call. I told him I understand that he works opposite hours of me but I need the reassurance because of our past. He told me he completely understood and I think that's why he's always lovey dovey when he does text me. However, for example, I had my first day of my new job yesterday and he wished me luck in the morning but never followed up to ask how it went. Just texted me before bed saying how much he wants to be with me. I know thats a good thing, but I'm constantly wondering if I'm actually a priority and when I ask him about it he tells me he gives me any second he has free and am his entire world.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0e5qe/happy_when_were_together_but_im_questioning_it/

I've been seeing this woman (39) for 5-6 weeks now.  I've been crazy about her, but there's a lot of things I don't like that I've been ignoring.  

Bumble:
- A week after our first date she made a big deal because I was still conversing with other girls on Bumble.  That conversation ended with me removing my profile and uninstalling the app
- 5 weeks later and she still has her Bumble account active 😄
- Also, we had a bit of a bump in the road last week and I told her maybe we should think about ending things.  The next day we got back together and she admitted she was doing a lot of swiping during that time on dating apps

Sex:
-We had a conversation about how many partners we each had.  She's hinted she went through a phase when she was with a lot of men and she wasn't proud of it.  So I told her my number (low 20's) and she definitely lied and was like ""oh yeah me too"".  I even joked ""that was believable"" and she laughed but I dropped it because I knew pressing it would get things negative.  Basically, I feel like she has had sex with a lot of guys and, while not a deal breaker, I feel better with a partner who actually does have my number or a bit lower. 

- she legit told me after an admittedly short (but not bad) sex session, it was under 10 minutes,  that ""her ex used to have sex with her everyday for hours""  I'm usually pretty good, or at least ok at sex, but that just made me feel like shit. 

Relationships:
- I'm in my early 30s and my most recent experience was an 8 year relationship that didn't work out.  She almost 40 she has NEVER been in a relationship longer than 2 years in her life.  She said she considers men disposable and if they stop making her happy she is done and/or them.  

Also almost every story of hers starts out with ""this guy I dated...""  


So, please tell me what an idiot I am because for some reason she has me really wrapped around her finger (she is passionate, strong minded, attractive, makes me want to impress her, etc) even the fact I feel so disposable to her is kind of a turn on because it makes me always want to be at the top of my game for her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0ekny/tell_me_how_hard_im_getting_played/

15,o0fhz9,1623766847,Thoughts on a new relationship/dating app,"Hi,

I have been on dating apps and especially being in India, the dating or relationship making is really skewed. To begin with, dating here in India, doesn't work as in the Western world. In fact, for most of the Indians, dating is not a familiar concept. Most of the dating apps like Tinder and Bumble come with a pre-conveived notion that people are used to dating.

So, I have been thinking the whole idea of these dating apps concept is wrong (In a way, Tinder and Bumble). I believe that people must give time for the relationship to develop and these apps are not doing that justice.

The main thing that these apps miss is the reward system like reddit and stack overflow. The single most important goal of these apps should be to help people make better relationships. So, I am proposing an app wherein the design of it rewards people who will build good relationships. People are rewarded not on basis of how many relations they have but how many good relations they establish.

I know it's difficult to judge the quality of a relationship but this is just an idea and I would like to know your thoughts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0fhz9/thoughts_on_a_new_relationshipdating_app/

I only had one relationship when I was 15 with a 23 year old guy and we broke up after a week because I got scared when he wanted to take the next step. Since then I’ve never dated again. 
I’m not sure why. I know I’m not considered attractive and my personality isn’t great, I’m shy and closed off and a bit awkward so you have to get to know me before i can become who i really am and get comfortable with you. 
I can’t tell when guys are interested if there are any, and I don’t want to make the first move, I don’t want to seem desperate and then feel like I owe them something for going out with me. 
I don’t know where to meet guys, I don’t have a lot of friends, I’m in med school and I spend a lot of my free time as a volunteer in hospitals. 
I don’t really have social media and I don’t take pictures of myself because I am not photogenic and I’m not considered attractive. I used to, but I got some upsetting comments and I deleted them. 
I don’t do dating sites because I don’t
take pictures or the pictures are bad so I don’t get matches.

We texted and talked to each other on the phone for a few weeks before our first date, because I wasn’t around town. He almost already ghosted me once while texting, because he understood something wrong I was telling him. But we clarified and got back in contact. 
Then we had our first date. It went well. He is a very talkative person, so it was pretty easy holding a conversation. He sat very closely to me all the time and smiled a lot. He texted me the same night, telling me he had a great time and would be happy to see me again. He repeated that the next day, as well as telling me, that only because he isn’t texting that much, it wouldn’t mean he is thinking little about me. 
The next day, I asked him, if he wants to meet up spontaneously. He wasn’t answering for several hours, in which I saw him online multiple times. 
I was very nervous then, fearing that he might be playing with me or not having interest in me. So I sent him a way too long text. Telling him that I think it’s weird, that he isn’t answering sometimes or if he’s even having interest. I ignored me then. I tried calling, the same thing. I tried to apologize my exaggerated behavior, but he just ignores me. I tried to reach out every day since then. He didn’t block me, still has my number saved in and didn’t unfollow me on insta, which is all very weird, but I guess meaningless. 
He just seemed really genuine after the date. But he ghosting me and declaring me dead questions everything in my sight. If he was even interested in me or didn’t find me attractive in real life or whatever. 
Or did I just fucked it up with my long text? Maybe he thought I’m a stalker or sth.

Then one week we planned on meeting that weekend and he said he would let me know; I told him I was flexible.

He basically didn't text me for 4 weeks, never updated me on hanging, and then popped up 3 weeks ago and asked if I could go to get drinks with him later that day. Even though it was last minute, I told him I could. We actually had a great time, I feel like I really enjoyed the conversation and we were joking and laughing. He asked if I wanted to watch a movie at my place, but it was totally fine if I had to go to sleep for class (I knew he wanted to probably make out or have sex). I said okay, we watched a romantic movie and then he said he wanted me to get sleep (\*\*yeah right\*\*) began to kiss me and asked me when he could see me next, one thing led to another and we had sex and he slept over. We talked all night in bed for hours. We asked me if I had been on dates after him, which I said yes to and asked him the same and he said no he had not been on dates. He also kept bringing up dating stuff and asked me about my breakup (which he asked on the first date too), but I kept it short because I obviously don't want to talk about my ex. I also told him I usually don't have sex on the first date (NOT that it matters I KNOW but I just didn't want him thinking that I just thought our first date was a hookup because you never know what people are thinking) and he said he didn't care and that he doesn't think like that.

He was SUPER lovey dovey all night and morning. Then, I woke up to get ready for class and when I get out of the shower, he's all dressed! He said he was leaving so I said oh okay can I make you breakfast?! He said no and i leaned in to kiss him goodbye and he turned his face away and hugged me... Then he rushed to the door, and I said wait let me walk you to the door! I went to hug him at the door and he stepped back... then walked away...

I texted him and asked him if everything was okay and he said he was just worried his car was going to get a ticket outside, but we would see eachother again soon. He texted me that day to ask me how my day went, and I texted him back and then all of a sudden he went MIA. He didn't text me back for days, so I ended up texting him and asking him if he would like to hang again. He said he couldn't do a certain day I was free but potentially a day coming up when we both were free. I said okay, that day came, and that morning he said he forgot he had to meet up with someone and would come to my place too late and didn't want to make me lose sleep before class again. I said it wouldn't bother me and he could come because I just wanted to see him! He said aw no don't worry because he would be tired. So I just said no problem at that point since he was making excuses, and then he said actually he thinks he could come down.

He ended up coming down, we watched a movie, had sex, and he was lovey dovey again. We made breakfast in the morning and he helped cook, we kissed goodbye, and then he went MIA on text again. I asked him how his day was, and he replied hours later, and then disappeared again. He also said he's traveling for the next 3 weeks. I said ""oh man I can't believe we won't see eachother for 3 weeks"" he just said ""you'll be fine, you'll be studying for school and taking exams anyways"". I also told him I felt bad when he rushed out last time, and I appreciated we had breakfast together this time, and he said it was because he just likes to get up and get going in the mornings (he changed his answer I guess??).

I just can't read him. He used to be so interested beforehand sending me pics and texting all the time, and now I'm the one texting him all the time. He acts lovey dovey in person, and then when he's gone, he just goes MIA. I really like him and would love if things worked out, but he just seems disinterested sometimes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0h1ba/guy_is_acting_hot_and_cold_any_adviceperspective/

I have been sober for 6 months now with several tries and a few rehabilitations in the past, and this time I feel that it's going to last due to lifestyle and inner changes.

These things are a bit hard to speak of overall but I am able to do so openly when needed.

What I am wondering about is when and how should I bring these things up with a woman I date? I have some kind of perception about this, for example to be honest and straightforward is signaling non-neediness and may be appreciated, but in the other hand I have already had a Tinder contact bail me immediately because the conversation happened to go there. On the other hand I've had one date where I spilled it all out when an opportunity presented itself, and it didn't seem to bother her then but afterwards our conversation has been sparse so maybe she's second guessing.

She wants to take it slow she has told me which is good. I accept that. She apparently had a shitty relationship where the dude was manipulative but she’s been single for 2 years.

I played it off as me being stupid and buzzed but I want to somehow show her that like “I am committed to you” without scaring her off. 

She said all of this and her profile also states that she likes guys that know what they want and go for it so it's like a little contradictory…

She had some bad moments from other dudes from dating sites. One stalked her, one dude professed his love for her before they ever met. Just shitty dudes.

I'm going to be at home for another year while I finish grad school. I can graduate completely debt free with some savings this way. The very last semester of grad school is a full time internship which is nonpaid.

It's very unsexy for a man my age to live at home. Here are some things I've encountered these past 4 months:

1) Phone date last February. I was extremely innocent and new to online dating. She asked about my living situation and I innocently told her without thinking twice about it. Boom ghosted. At first I was confused since she seemed so interested, until my buddy told me what's up and I was like ""ohhhhh.""

2) I had an in person date with one woman where I danced around the question when asked. I said something like ""yeah my parents live around here. We talk sometimes."" 2nd date she asks more firmly about them, and I tell her. She looked authentically hurt that I originally omisively lied to her. Made me feel like a huge jerk, and her interested dropped like a rock. Me being shady painted me with a gallon of ""ick."" I will never take this approach again.

3) Went out on an in person date with another girl, and when she asked I had a conversation about it. About how I'm living at home to save money while I finish grad school which has 2 semesters left, and how it logistically makes sense for me since I'm currently right next to where I work / go to school. I let her know I'm planning on moving out when it's over, and this is the first time in my adult life I've been at home. I was very straight up with her because I wanted to let her know what page I'm on in life. Boom ghosted.

4) Went out on a date with a woman last Thursday. She asked, and I told her ""I currently live at home with my parents."" She responds with ohh that's kool. She literally left 2 minutes after that. She looked sorta mad. She gtfo out of there after hearing that. I later texted her, and she was nice saying ""yeah living at home is one of my deal breakers.""

I want to be clear. Each of these dates seem to be going very well UNTIL that question comes up.

I know the logical answer is to not date, but I mean...I want to date. And I'm willing to take the punches in the mean time. Plus if I meet a woman who likes me over my circumstances, that's going to be a huge green light for me.

So if you were me, how would you bring this topic up? Oddly enough, other aspects in my life are just fine...but they're very overshadowed about my living situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0k561/whats_a_graceful_way_i_can_tell_my_date_that_i/

I'm fully aware that casual dating doesn't mean exclusivity unless explicitly specified, and I'm okay with that. I admit that I looked at his socials because I am curious about who he is as a person.

It's just that I found out that this girl has been seeing him since last year (our timings with him coincide), and from her posts it seems they're in an exclusive relationship. 

Maybe they're in an open relationship, i don't know. I just have a nagging feeling that I should message her find out if they are in an exclusive one. Because if they are, it means he's cheating (since last year) and i want to call him out. But is it really my business? 

Also I'm upset at the possibility of unintentionally being accomplice to a cheater, which probably contributes more to the desire to expose him if he's one.

74,o0lgxo,1623782623,Afraid of becoming a trophy husband,"Gay man here. I've recently started dating and falling hard someone who is in many ways quite different from me. When we are together, we click very well. We have lots of sexual chemistry, we respect each other, and we have a lot of fun, and I think he's a really good person. I think it's safe to say I've never felt a strongly about another person I've dated.

But he is someone who is almost unfathomably successful in his career. I'm going to keep it vague  so as  not to reveal who he is, but he has a very high ranking position that was created for him at a major corporation, and he's also a part time professor at a prestigious university.  And he's only 40. (I'm 33.)

I'm a very normal person with a very normal job who probably will not do anything particularly exciting in his life professionally. At least not on paper or in the eyes of others. I'm happy in my job, but I work in a helping career where there's not a lot of ""growth."" 

At first I dealt with feelings of not feeling good enough for him, but he's really convinced me that he genuinely is crazy about me, and then I just dealt with general feelings of not feeling good enough, comparing myself to him and wondering why I hadn't achieved more. I'm working on that, but I've decided that if I was happy with my life before I met him then I'm allowed to be happy after I met him.

But recently, just tooling around on the internet and googling him, I found an article in which he was interviewed, and he stated that his long-term goal was to be the CEO of a major company, and, with I'm sure a little bit of a joke ""a kind Titan of industry.""

I'm not exactly sure why, but discovering this was a punch in the gut. He has never said this to me, and I guess I assumed that if I were a successful as he is I would want to stop pushing and just be happy with where I'd gotten to. The thing is being a CEO is entirely plausible given where he is right now, and even if he doesn't make it that far, he certainly could be a a big wig in a company. 

I guess I'm sort of terrified of becoming Melinda Gates. Being married or partnered with a fabulously wealthy successful and potentially somewhat famous person is probably many people's dream come true, but the thought of it terrifies me. I don't particularly like fancy parties, and the thought of having to get dressed up on a regular basis and hobnob with rich snooty people ties my stomach in knots. Also, I'm not sure I'd be a very good homemaker and I don't think I would be satisfied just staying at home. (He wants to have a kid via IVF). I guess I'm also just not someone who wants to be a member of the 1% or even the 5%. It's never been my kind of people.

This is such a strange situation I have ended up in. I actually had no idea how successful he was when we started dating, and only slowly realized. Part of me really wants to end it now because I just feel like we will never be compatible, but it feels like such a stupid reason and he's never done anything unkind to me. 

What does everyone think of this? As I said I know that for many of you this would be my dream come true, but it isn't for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0lgxo/afraid_of_becoming_a_trophy_husband/

I got very excited about him and then surprise, he told me he's moving to a different city. We had already scheduled our second date and he told me he'd still like to see me but understands if this changes things for me. I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic so I don't see someone moving to a different city as a major issue if I click with them, so I just thought I would continue dating him with an open mind. We had a really great time on our second date again, and he brought up his situation and what this would mean for us. He told me because of this situation he's not looking for anything serious. I told him I'm looking for something serious and I'm not sure how I feel about what he said and explained that I don't like making such decisions before I know the person well enough and we decided to just not talk about it for now and just enjoy the moment. We were making out and he seemed to want to have sex that night, but  told him that I like to get to know someone more before I sleep with them, which he completely respected. Anyways, we were laying in his sofa, talking and cuddling and at one point I felt by the way he held me and smelled my hair that it felt very coupley, or as if he was falling for me. I felt after that date that I could see a shift in him in his feelings towards me, but ever since that date there's been no mentioning of another date. We have just talked about random things. Today we talked about a series and I made a suggestion it would have been nice to watch it together, and he just completely ignored that sentence and started talking about other things. I understand he's probably confused with what he wants, but I'm getting a bit fed up with trying to guess what he's feeling/thinking. Part of me just wants to ask him straight up if something is wrong, but I'm not sure if it's right to pressure him. Is there something I'm not getting here?

83,o0mg2y,1623785241,how to avoid getting attached quickly? (25m),"for full clarity, I only started dating for the first time just prior to the pandemic as in all honesty, my self image has been massively low since childhood. since doing so I've had a fair bit of success - I had a FWB for a year or so, and have doubled my body count in the last couple of weeks.

sadly, neither girl is interested in continuing things (for valid reasons) and it does hurt a little - more so than it should after one date and having sex once. so I kind of need to know how do i lessen the blow? I get attached very easily and am the kind of guy to reply instantly. 

any suggestions on how to be more restrained and sensible in dating? I neither want to come across as smothering to the woman, nor do I want to allow myself to get attached and down in the dumps after such a short period.

also, if I'm being a wet wipe please just let me know? tough love/stern advice is absolutely important right now. big thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0mg2y/how_to_avoid_getting_attached_quickly_25m/
84,o0mi6q,1623785407,What do you think?,"I matched with a guy on Hinge. We texted / had phone calls for two weeks before meeting in person.

1. Monday: first date at a causal sports bar / restaurant. It went really well. We went back to my place for sex &amp; sleepover.

2. Friday: he came over, we had sex and hung out. No sleepover.

3. Saturday: dinner date out to a nice restaurant. Went back to my place for sex &amp; sleepover.

4. Sunday: he came over; we had sex and hung out. No sleepover.

5. He was supposed to come over again Mon night to hang out but I had a crazy work day so I cancelled.

Honestly by then I was evaluating the situation. He was nice and the sex was great, but we are too different for any realistic situation. I could tell he felt differently (i.e. he was starting to catch feelings).

I started to get a little turned off by his texts. He was texting too much and suggesting things like getting our kids together for a play date and going away for a weekend together (not with the kids). To me, this was too much like “relationship dialogue”.

I just texted less and less. Cowardly indicating my lack of interest versus just telling him outright. He could tell, but I just told him I was busy. 

Thursday (10 days after our first date) I didn’t text him the whole day and he didn’t either. Later that night he did text me: “I just want you to know that I’m not interested in talking to you anymore.” Honestly I felt relief. Him saying this prevented me from having to have an awkward conversation. Woot! So I just deleted the text and went on with my night, which was out to dinner with a group of friends. 

Apparently my lack of response was not good enough and he sent me another text a few hours later: “You don’t care about me.” Well I thought that was pretty immature so I decided to just block him.  He then tried to send me a message in Instagram but I blocked him there too. I was just done with him. No longer interested in anything with him. He’s a nice guy and we had a good time together but I think I just wanted a short intense period of good sex and then I was good. 

Since I knew we couldn’t actually date / be in a relationship one day (completely different upbringings, social class level, education level, professional level, etc), I knew it would just be like a fling. I’m surprised he didn’t understand what it was - I was so clearly out of his league (not on a physical attractiveness level, but everywhere else), like how on earth did he think we could actually be in a relationship? As awful as that sounds. 

Anyway I’m sure I’ll get crucified in the comments. I just wish guys would let a girl do the slow fade sometimes. Why can’t you just let it go sometimes if the girl has lost interest? Just let it go and leave it alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0mi6q/what_do_you_think/
85,o0mjlo,1623785506,First date [31M] in a decade with someone else who's first date was also in a decade [30F],"I met this girl through a mutual friend who tried to set up this date. We talked for a bit and it was a struggle trying to find any common ground. She didn't have any hobbies or interests that I could gather and admitted to being a self described homebody that lived with her mother. We had some coffee and walked around a park a bit and I felt like I was playing detective in trying to find out what her interests were so that I wasn't just talking about myself the whole time. She said she hasn't hung out with friends in well over a year and she admitted to not doing outdoor things(hiking, biking, travelling or even eating out) and she also doesn't do much indoor activities(games, movies, shows). She told me she just worked night shift at her job and was working on an online degree.

I could tell she was tired from probably staying up to do this date so we didn't spend too much time together. She did take my number and I told her she was welcome to hang out with me and my friends on a easy hike over the weekend if she had time. 

I don't really know what to make of that experience. As I said in the title, I haven't dated in a decade so I was wondering if any redditors have any advice on this situation.

88,o0n4oy,1623787070,An incident that ruined dating for me and made me paranoid.,"  

A few years ago I was an international student in England. I am your typical introvert geek student I never approach girls. My hobbies are peculiar such as the nature of reality and other deep topics that I didn't think that anyone is interested in and whenever I expressed those topics I was faced with either confusion or ridicule, so I mostly kept that to myself. One night my classmates invited me to go out with them one was English from York the other two were from Russia and Greece ( all males). I went out with them to a pub I am the only smoker after few drinks I went out to smoke, there was this space outside with a fence. I sat out there smoking then this girl sat a couple of feet away on the fence and asked me if I had a lighter. I gave her the lighter and made a joke and she laughed with the courage of alcohol I started a conversation and she was very responsive, the girl was attractive and was interested in all I was saying, and only then when she moved next to me setting on the fence our thighs were touching, only then I was thinking what are you doing this is an attractive girl who is interested in your boring shit, do something. Then we had a long pleasant conversation, she was very smart and interested in all the nonsense that I never talk to people about but most of all she was attracted to me I could see it and nothing ever felt as satisfying as feeling that feeling. We sat for about one hour and a half we even kissed, then all the sudden this other woman came with her boyfriend behind her, she didn't even look in my direction she gripped the girl next to me by the hand and pulled her ( later I knew she was her sister) and while they were leaving entering the pub I could hear the sister saying ""What are you thinking?! he is a Paki"" That is what they call Pakistanis in England, I am not Pakistani and not until that night that I realized that I actually look a bit similar. My country is actually closer to England than it is to Pakistan. Anyway, I sat there for a few minutes thinking should I go after her or should I give up. I thought how many times in your life will you find a girl that you find attractive and that is attracted to you plus is interested in all your shit? I gathered all my courage and went after them inside, I said can I take your number before I leave and her sister said ""go away she has a boyfriend a very big boyfriend"" I looked at the girl and she was looking at the floor. I just left I didn't even say goodbye to my mates. 

I have gone through a lot of hardship including being shot at by a gun, this felt like the most crushed my soul has ever been through. I don't know why? I was sweating shaking and feeling the most horrible feeling I have ever felt. I went out took a bottle of whisky and went home without even telling my friends, had to tell them a lie the next day. And after that, I am terrified of rejection even if a girl shows a bit of interest I am always defensive, my mentality about dating and approaching girls is ruined, I am consistently terrified of rejection. 

Anyway, I am not here to complain about a culture or a country or whatever, I don't want a change or anything of that sort, I just want to share the story hoping that it will help me get over it because I actually have never told anyone about it. The only reason I wrote this is to get it out and feel some responses.

91,o0ntns,1623788955,"In a weird and unfamiliar spot, and not sure how to proceed without messing everything up","Here's the situation that involves 4 girls. And I know it sounds like a first world problem. But I am getting out of a 10 year + marriage and not experienced navigating these things.

Girl 1 - I have been dating her for over a month. She is 6 years younger than me and has insisted it be non-commital/casual. At times I've questioned her intent and she insists shes confused and doesnt want more right now. However, shes the most intimate and affectionate with me and treats me similar to what I imagine a commited or at least exclusive relationship would be. When i mentioned dating others she quickly retorted and asked if I was (which at the time I hadnt been) and she has asked if I had sex with someone would I tell her, and if I was going to get in a relationship with someone would I give her the chance. She fades in and out as far as intensity goes when not with her in person. But in person its always pretty romantic. I am probably most passionately connected with her over anyone else because we have shared a lot of intimate moments and dated the longest. I have honestly been sort of stuck on her.

Girl 2 - I met her a while ago and just recently saw her. I wasnt sure if I would like her because there was a slight language barrier and our texting was often very dry and infrequent. In person though we got along pretty well. Ive seen her twice and we had made out by that 2nd date but nothing more. I told her I was just looking to have fun and be casual and she understood. I dont really see myself wanting to be in a relationship with her. Theres just something that is off as far as that goes and see her more as just fun.

Girl 3 - She is actually vacationing here and I asked her out not knowing if it would just be friendly or more. And the first time seeing her it nearly escalated to sex. I obviously dont have any long term stock in this, but it seems high potential to muddy everything else

Girl 4 - OK I had been talking to her for a few weeks before meeting here. And she seemed the most similar and relatable to me. Also very very pretty. We never really sexually or romantically escalated the conversation, and when we went on our first date , neither of us really took it to that level. But she wanted to stay out the whole night with me and quickly before I left insisted that we set something else up again and see each other again. And since she has been the most consistent and I am physically attracted, I could actually see her being long term girlfriend potential. But the question mark is with no physicality on the first date (which is fine and I think it makes sense), are we actually compatible ?

&amp;#x200B;

I think the biggest thing Im concerned about is essentially crossing Girl 1 by having sex with someone or more seriously dating anyone. She seems to want to have her cake and eat it too, so I either stop messing with her or ask if she wants to be serious/exclusive...and while I would maybe do that and be OK with sacrificing girl 2 and 3 .... Im not sure I could just give up on Girl 4 when i see so much potential.

96,o0owft,1623792031,Is this girl losing interest in me or is my anxiety getting the better of me," So I (24M) met this awesome girl (24F) on a dating app a little over three months ago and things have been going great, we met at a bar and talked for hours and even hooked up at the end. We have been seeing each other at least once sometimes twice a week and text each other everyday usually. We have gone on a couple of weekend trips together and often times talk about each others lives and whatever happens during the days we don't meet up. We even have virtual dates where we play games or watch movies together. Her friends and family know about me, although I haven't had the opportunity to meet them she talks about me meeting them and I want her to meet my friends. so overall it sounds like things are going pretty good right?

Well maybe it's just me but about two weeks ago we had gone on a date and things were going well, and when i was driving her home i had told her that i was falling in love with her. I didn't even realize i had said it till after it came out and she responded with she knew i wanted to say it for a while. So when we pulled up to her house, we sat in the car and talked for a bit more. She basically asked me what i wanted from seeing her and i told her that i honestly enjoy being with her and talking to her and want to keep seeing her. And she honestly told me that she enjoys being with me but doesn't feel like she is in love with me. i told her that even though i said it i wasn't trying to pressure her into saying it or anything like that, but it had felt right to say it in that moment. And in that moment she brought up some concerns that she had.

I had been honest with her when we first started going out that i had come out of an emotionally abusive relationship about 6 months before meeting her. I had been going to therapy for it and had already been on several dates with other people before meeting her. She brought up the fact that she doesn't want to be just a rebound for me. I told her that it was never my intention, and that i really do want to get to really know her. She then brought up some other stuff that she says i do that makes her feel uncomfortable (which I'm not going to go into since it is pretty personal stuff). I apologized for the things i did that made her uncomfortable and let her know that it was never my intentions. She told me that with other guys she has dated they always start out nice and sweet but eventually things go down hill with them. I told her my concerns that I'm afraid one day I'll wake up and text her and see that I've been blocked or ghosted as it's just an issue that I've had before. She told me that she would never block me with out telling me first if she was going to.

Well after having our talk i got out of the car and walked her to her door. She gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek and i kissed her on the cheek as well. This was almost two weeks ago and we are still talking to each other but i feel like maybe something has changed. Before she used to text me in the morning sometimes when she would wake up before me but now I've had to initiate the conversation almost every time. I've tried asking her out and she tells me that she has been super busy with work and has to wait to get her schedule the week before. To be fair she does text me back after she gets off work even if i have to wait a couple hours since she can take forever to reply.

I want to take her out and tell her that i heard all the concerns she has about me, since I've been thinking seriously about what she told me. I want to talk with her about what we are in-person and show that I'm genuinely interested in her, but I don't know if maybe she is avoiding me or if she is just really busy. She hasn't ghosted me; she replies to my texts and still follows me on instagram. Is she losing interest in me? or is my anxiety and insecurity making me over thinking these things? I know I have an anxious attachment style, but I have been working hard to make sure that is doesn't affect this relationship with this girl.

I have no friends, got bullied throughout school. Took a big hit to my self esteem, but I've been coping with it for years (distracting myself from my loneliness) 

I mostly ignored all my crushes during my school years because I figured I wasn't good enough for them. Nobody wants anything to do with that kid nobody likes, after all. 

I've been feeling really lonely lately and I just don't know what to do about it. I've never been approached by a woman before, nor have I ever received any glares or hints of affection from them. All that makes me assume I'm just way too ugly to even try. 

I often go out to have a cup of coffee, alone, and that's the only outside activity I like doing.

I'd feel bad about picking up an instrumental or sporty hobby just to meet women. I have no interest in these things, it'd feel fake and forced.
