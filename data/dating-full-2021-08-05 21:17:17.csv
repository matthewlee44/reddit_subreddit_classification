Family always say I’m too young, but my mindset is more mature than your average person. I’m a family kind of person, I look after my mum and my siblings extremely well, and take care of them all the time. 

I’ve personally never had a woman be attracted to me and tell me. I’ve always crushed on people but they’ve never reciprocated. I would say I’m just an average looking bloke, looking to meet someone and live life happily. I’ve got a cool job in government, and I do well for myself.

I recently (about a year ago) met a girl at a family gathering, and was quite attracted to her. Not only is she well educated, but she’s very friendly, and caring, and gets along very well with my younger sister (I see that mothering, caring side to her).
She is a year younger than me but she’s doing her degree in medicine , which means she’ll be in school for years to come here in the UK.

I recently saw her at a friends birthday recently but we were all there. Family, her parents, her grandma. She didn’t seem too chatty this time, but pretty obvious given we come from a conservative background that she wouldn’t give a strange guy her attention in front of her family. Either she has no attraction to me whatsoever, and didn’t even think about me in that way, or she was shy.

Anyway: my question here, given my extremely limited dating experience, what do I do to get to know her. Bearing in mind I’ve seen her twice in one year exactly, I can’t exactly just see her to get to know her. I don’t even want anything to happen, I just wanna see what kind of person she is. I’m a long way away from any relationship, I’m too busy focusing on my life and my career. But at the very least I wanna know her and see if she’s the right person for me, and whether she has any interest whatsoever.

I know where she works because I overheard it from a family friend as well. But I can’t just rock up at her store and ask her out, or pretend like its all a giant coincidence, I’d be too awkward and embarrassed. And by the time I get there, I will have overthought every detail a million times. 
So how do I get to know her without looking desperate and creepy? 
Bear in mind my mum really likes her and frequently brings up how good we’d be together.
I’m not lovesick or anything like that, I genuinely just want to see her to get to know her.

I’m 21, about to start my junior year of college, I have a job, I’m in shape, I don’t think I’m ugly, I’m pretty confident, people say I’m funny, I have a very active social life and a lot of friends( a lot of platonic girl friends) but I just seen to have nothing but failure with dating.

I’ve never had a relationship, never been physical in any way with a girl, never even been on a date. It’s really frustrating and I don’t know what I’m doing incorrectly that would lead me to failure. I rarely ever get matched on online dating apps, any girl I meet in person isn’t interested, and any crush I’ve had has ended abysmally. I don’t think I’m a bad option. I don’t go after girls out of my league, and I think I have a really fun personality.

I really can’t figure it out. I’m the only virgin I know. Everyone else around me has this figured out and I seek advice from them but none of what they say works for me. I ask my girl friends to introduce me to their friends but not one has been interested. Out of the the probably 80+ girls I’ve asked out in the last 6 years every single one was a rejection and I’m starting to feel like I’m just not good enough for love or a girls attention.

Both issues share a root cause in my life, so it feels fitting to post this here. Anyways...

I had a best friend for over a decade. We parted ways 2-3 years ago over a growing number of conflicts. I don't really miss him, I'm pretty well aware that if I rekindled anything there, it'd go to shit instantly. Whats bugging me is that this experience has made me realize how poorly I've managed all other social relationships up until this point. I never really cared for having a big group of friends - I generally dislike the company of others most of the time and find conversation tedious at best. So long as I had this guy in my life, making other friends and  meeting new people was never a priority. To paint a more specific picture, since middle school, I have made 1 friendship I can see myself  maintaining for the foreseeable future.

Anyways, now that my best friend is gone, I have had an incredibly difficult  time branching out my social circle in that time to fill the void he  left. I have a small group of friends who are dear to me, but most of them are more introverted than I am, and border on hermit/recluse territory.

I have put in a ridiculous amount of effort into making new friends over the past 2-3  years and I have very little to show for my efforts. I have joined  online DnD groups, posted on subreddits, and offered to stay in touch with people I date, and taken up volunteer opportunities. Most of this has been fruitless. I go  through lapses of being painfully lonely, yet when I try and socialize  with others, I find it to be extremely unfulfilling. I constantly feel like there is something people are getting out of social interactions  that I am not. My close friends are the exception to this, I don't mind  talking with them forever. With the right people, my social batteries never deplete. But like I said, they're even more  introverted than I am. The people who I enjoy speaking to are few and  far in between. I have spoken about this numerous times in therapy and have never gotten a good explanation or answer as to what I could do about it.

This flaw of mine has  had a negative effect on my dating life as well. I'm 25M as of the time I'm writing this. I have had 1 girlfriend ever, when I was 18.  Otherwise, its been one night stands and label-less relationships that  lasted 1-3ish months before I break it off. I just do not enjoy the  company of most of the women I meet. I almost never have crushes either. Its extremely rare for me to feel any kind of desire to pursue someone. For what its worth, I'm not exactly swimming in matches either. I'm an  average looking guy.

None of this is aided by the fact that the few friends I do have, most are super geeky guys like myself. I just don't organically meet women through my  limited social circle. It's almost all through dating apps, which, as sucky as they are, have been my only option.

None of this would matter if I didn't have a burning desire to share my life with someone. I'm not asexual or aromantic. I *do* want people in my life, both platonically and romantically. But I don't know what to do anymore over the duality of needing people in my life and not enjoying their company.

I need a bit of harsh reality and truth from anyone else reading this who feels the way I do and who is preferably a bit older. I am not happy  with the city I'm currently living in, and plan to move in 1-2 years. I  have also quit what was a well-paying job to pursue becoming a YouTuber  (please don't ask - it's about as reckless and stupid as it sounds, but I'm on some follow-your-dreams hippy-dippy shit). Meaning I'll be unemployed for a while. I don't think my job was helping me get dates by any means, but I don't think being unemployed will do me any favors with the ladies.

Beyond the unemployment, that'll basically make me 26 and living somewhere with zero social contacts. **Should I just resign myself to trying to build a fulfilling life alone?** I am seriously looking for realistic advice, please for the love of all that is holy do not tell me to use meetup or something, everyone there is 40+.

The last couple girls I met either have no hobbies or they include sitting around doing nothing. Ugh this is the most frustrating thing in my opinion because I already know that this girl is in no way shape or form going to be able to vibe with me. I feel like I do quite a bit for myself mostly physically but also mentally as well. I enjoy being very active at the gym and being outside. I have had a perma tan since this summer started. I like walking trails near by, riding bike, and most importantly being outside with my dog. I always keep my eye out for girls to approach but jesus my luck isn't that great. Some I see on the trail are mostly listening to music and I'm not trying to air traffic control them to stop. LOL the light up wands on the runway. In my mind I picture a girl (future GF) doing at least 1/2 the shit I do on her own already. Being active and being a genuinely cool girl who knows how to have fun.

I honestly don't think that's asking a lot if anything I should set the bar higher. 

I want to find someone but honestly don't even know where to look anymore. It's been over 2 years and being single is honestly so lame.

I have been single my entire life.  I was lucky enough to have gone to good Universities and had a few women in my life.  Unfortunately those were brief due to us moving in different directions.  I no problem dating, I actually dated two well known ""celebrities"" of the early 1980s.  I fell so deeply in love with a woman in 1984 that it literally hurt my soul.  Also in 1984 I started having symptoms of depression, not the blues, full on depression that changed my personality and made me seek comfort in the bottom of a bourbon bottle.  In 87 ""the woman of my dreams"" dumps me, was kind of not really nice about it, what is done is done.

Fast forward to the early 90s, I've lived in most of the major cities of the Northeast, and I crash, lose a great corporate job with a multinational.  I get dried out, get some of the mental health help I needed.  I rebuild my career and work very successfully.  At age 42 I go to a Ivy League hospital and they diagnose me as bipolar II, just depression no mania, finally I get the meds that level me off.  I'm doing really well again in my profession, and I am able to retire right after I turn 50.  

My issue is I don't know how to meet women anymore.  Social media is really creepy, but I have tried it a few times Match etc.  Not much success.  I'm in good shape, run, hike, do the gym thing.  I have all my hair and teeth, financially independent.  I have found that women I meet in my age range have a lot of baggage, as we all do I guess.  I have dated a few younger women, and that was fair, seems like our interests didn't intersect often.  I have no illusions, I'm not looking to start a family or anything like that.  I'm just looking for someone to hang out with, do things together.  I was approached by two much younger women in the  last 12 months, very nice and attractive, but I have nieces older than them so I demurred.  Ten years ago I met a stunning Asian woman, never asked her age, but I'm guessing late 20s.  She was very interested, but I did the math and it didn't seem promising.

Where do I meet people?  What are some strategies to find people of common interests?  I've been alone all my life, which to be honest used to bum me out, but not so much anymore.

He and I dated all through high school and went our separate ways when he joined the Marines after he graduated. We reconnected last year at his sister’s wedding and recently decided we both wanted to get back together.

Anyway when I started my freshman year high school he was a junior. He secretly started slipping me little notes from time to time complimenting me on my hair or telling me he thought I was cute. It was all really sweet and I we kept our little crushes on each other a secret for a while until he asked me to the homecoming dance.

Then after we started dating he’d write me little notes all the time with these little cartoons on them. He even drew me a little comic book that showed us running off and getting married in Las Vegas then my dad chasing him out of the country.

And hey, he's just the same in person, no misrepresentations to speak of. Maybe the chemistry sizzles on even, and it transitions into something clothing-optional. And sweet nothings are whispered, and plans for next time, but eventually, the night must end at some point.

Matched with someone on a dating app fairly quickly and the person has a stable great job, very good looking and seemed to actively engage with me. I could tell he was straight forward and said he was looking for a long term sexual involvement, but also very sexually open so was into threesomes, group orgies and rough sex and being dominant. Most definitely far more experienced than I was as I haven't really tried any of that. I asked if for the right person If there is a connection, if they would also be open to a relationship and he said yes. (Yes I know anyone can lie about these things and their true intentions online but it's better I asked than nothing)

Since naturally I've been uninvolved with the opposite gender for many years now, I was craving that sexual experience with a new person and getting to know this person so after some intense flirting, I asked if he wanted to meet. He was pushing very hard to meet directly at his house that is quite far from me outside of the city in a rural place and I said no, I need to meet someone first. After asking many times he caved in to agreeing to meeting me in person near me in public and we arranged a date and time.

 Now this date was somewhat inconvenient because he was very busy in the evening for a few hours doing something but he was very eager to work around it and said it shouldn't be a problem so I agreed. He did say he wanted some face photos of me to confirm that I am who I say I am and this is where it gets weird. He had seen my full photos already and vise versa, admittedly I had the best photos of myself in my glammed up look with some makeup and nice clothes. I don't cake myself up so my face wouldn't look that different without it in comparison to some others. We were joking around about how terrible it would be to get catfished.

This time, I was running late from the gym and after an intense work out I quickly snapped a photo and sent him to him. Keep in mind, I now had pretty much no makeup, was kind of sweaty in my gym clothes. However, It was not a bad photo. I wouldn't have sent it if I looked disgusting, I just looked more down to earth, casual and approachable I figured and lots of guys also have said they love it when someone can be casual or even when sweaty after a nice workout. I also didn't think I looked unrecognizably different from my more glammed photos I had up on the dating site. 

However immediately afterwards I noticed a change in his demeanor. There was a brief silence and he said he needed to get back to me for our meetup because he suddenly got really busy. I said that's fine and the next day I sent him a photo of me dressed up to go to work and thought it looked quite nice. I'm also someone who gets complimented and checked out by other people as well now and then. Still, there wasn't a compliment or anything, other than saying I look a little different to what they expected (then saying it's a joke) and they would get back to me later. Not surprisingly, he ended up cancelling and said he was far too busy. When I asked to reschedule, he vaguely said his schedule is so busy all of a sudden he really can't be sure when he's available next. This is going from a guy who was relentlessly wanting to meet up with me to just flat out doing a 180. I gave him a 2 week time window to let me know because I didn't want to wait around forever which he acknowledged and zero messages afterwards. 

I kind of regret now giving him the 2 week timeline because I should have kicked the bucket as soon as he didn't attempt to reschedule. However I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to see what else could be done since I don't like being overtly rude or giving up fast. 

The most bizarre part of this experience is while I know ghosting and flaking is very common with today's dating world, I can't make sense out of what major issue he had with my photos. Do most guys expect girls to look like permanent Barbies these days or something ? Has something similar happened to you where you sent a decent photo and you couldn't make sense out of their sudden reaction? Or had dates flake on you last minute with no reason?

I just wanted to share this also because I think it's important to address previous wounds. I still have deep trust issues so this experience really didn't help. As always, dating like anything is a risk, a risk you play with your heart, mind and body. I'd love to hear your feedback with what you think went wrong with my experience and yours!

I wasn’t sure how to title this but, long story short, this one boy (let’s call him S) I’ve known since grade 7, started to show some feelings for me in grade 10. 

I’m currently heading to university this fall and I realized something when I was in online grade 12 (I was too scared to pursue anything), that this guy was dropping some MAJOR hints on me but I didn’t believe him because I was so dense and he once liked my best friend in grade 7. (I developed feelings for him but I was so unsure how he felt, stupid I know). 

He would always talk to me, I never initiated anything because truthfully I’m really afraid of talking to guys on my own, he’s the only person I talked to and enjoyed talking to me, he always looks after me, I remember his friends looking at me all the time,, gosh I miss highschool so much, everytime id text him it would go on for ages and man, my mom was always teasing me because of it. He once asked me “Hey, do you have a crush?” And I was like,, “what’s yours?” Then he said some girl in our English class, then when I bluffed about my crush he said “I don’t think so, he likes someone else” HDHHS so then i just mentally exploded and said “oh well I guess I don’t have a crush then” and man, once he asked me if I could come to his brothers festival in the winter break, I was with my friend and she clearly knew he had a crush on me, but I didn’t realize (I totally forgot to go to that festival too,, I felt so terrible,, he was probably waiting for me). Heck the whole fucking grade shipped us because we were so friendly and close.

**Now enough of me daydreaming, let’s just jump back in the past to see where it all went wrong:** One day while I was in my grade 10 class, my other male friend, O (he is gay but closeted) asked me “hey the teacher needs a laptop from the computer lab let’s go get one” so I went with O. While I was walking with O, S passed by with his friend! But he looked so upset I was laughing and talking to O, because since then S dry texts me and left me on seen which he never does! :(

I really wanted to apologize but next thing I knew, we never went back to school. I never saw S again,, I told my bestie A about how S has gotten oddly dry for some reason, and then she puts me in a group chat with me her and S- I was so embarrassed, S was talking to A so lively compared to me, I felt so bad I left the group chat. **A would sometimes ask if I’m still friends with S, and knowing how S used to like A, I felt like she was kind of taking her chance in front of me,, and now that I’ve started to ghost her, she started ignoring me and I feel extremely horrible for assuming the way she was thinking,,,**

I’m writing this today because I was talking to my brother about how I really wished I could talk to S again,, and he insisted me to think in a way that A was probably helping me talk to S but realized when I left the group chat that there’s no hope then they stopped. (I genuinely thought A was using me as a stepping stone to talk to S since A and S went to different high schools, and I went to the same as S) He also told me I should apologize because I broke his heart without intending to do so because of misconceptions :(

So I wanted to ask,, it’s been around a year and a half since I last spoke with him, should I even text him back? Or is it too much of a lost cause to even think about? My brother told me I should be taking risks and not hoping for someone to talk to me because that’s not how it goes.

What would I even say to him? I feel like such a heartless person for doing this to him while I have a crush on him but i don’t know if I can totally blame myself for not really knowing what was happening :(",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,939574,public,self,How would I talk to a guy that I haven’t talked to in over a year?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyzl6z/how_would_i_talk_to_a_guy_that_i_havent_talked_to/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

About two years ago I got out of a nine year relationship. There were many reasons we decided to end it, and though it did end pretty badly cheating was not one of the reasons. I was 17 or 18 when the relationship started. About a year later after I moved to a different state I started dating casually again. I was reluctant as I had expectations. After unsuccessfully dating online I gave up. I met a guy at one of my jobs and HE pursued ME. So I’m like alright why not give it a shot. We “dated” for a month and long story short found out he was still messing around with his ex wife. I should mention that I’m a female who has only dated females before. So I wasn’t expecting it to last anyway I wasn’t torn up over it and it was literally only a month. 

After him I met a girl I had pretty good chemistry with. We hit it off and started out fine. She made the first move after a couple weeks of flirting. We agreed to keep it casual and everything was good. We went out a few times and I really liked her. I told her some of my expectations that I was only seeing her and I didn’t care if she was seeing other people as long as she was honest with me about it. She told me she was just seeing me too and she really liked me blah blah blah. Two months into that I found out she was seeing many other girls. I was a bit hurt over this one! Had she just been honest I would of been fine. 

So I decided I’m done dating I’m gonna focus on my goals and just work. I was doing good working on myself when I met another girl through working. This girl was just wow. Made me a weak gooey babbling fool. My heart raced and I got butterflies every time I saw her. It was something straight out of romance movie. She would flirt back and eventually asked me out. I turned her down twice before finally agreeing to a date with her. Her persistence won me over. I told her in the beginning though my experiences on dating and if she was going to see other people to just be honest with me. I won’t get mad we are both adults blah blah. She assured me she wasn’t like that and she only wanted to be with me. Now we had been dating for almost nine months and everything was good minus a couple mood swings here and there. Long story short on this one just found out she was messing around for the last few months of it. 

Seriously it’s hard NOT to think that it’s me at this point. I just cannot understand when I’ve been clear of my expectations and how I will not be mad if they’re just honest!

My girlfriend seems to have what they call a “work husband”. She has been working with this guy for a year and I was kind of curious about him but she never really talks about him. She refers to him as “guy from work”. I’ve meet him only once at a work event. I’ve been getting interesting info from another co-worker she has that knows me.

Apparently she is pretty close with this guy at work. They constantly get flirty with eachother throughout the work day. They pull pranks on eachother, playfully touch eachother and so on.  Once the person who told me all this walked in on her and the guy in the breakroom holding hands while playing some game on his phone. When the person asked wtf they are doing she simply said “ahah its so we don’t cheat with the other hand”. Another time that kid took something from her and started taking it away from him and was leaning all over him and holding his hand taking it away from him. And yet another time she let that kid put a mask on her face because he has some surprise in his hands and so on. They do all of this infront of several people sometimes. So it looks like they have no touch barrier at all. 

They go on coffee runs for eachother all the time. She added him recently on Instagram and facebook. After all of this, I looked through some of their texts and they seem to banter with eachother. He sends her a text that she should get coffee in the mornings and she goes and gets it for him. They send a lot of gif images to eachother.

Another thing that worries me is that she called another coworker girl a skank because she “flirted” with him and apparently my gf was not happy.

I am not sure what to do. Am I over reacting or is my gf acting shady?

I ask my other (F) coworker if she’s flirting with me and she says she’s pretty sure she is. 

Well my hot water heater was out and I brought it up in a group conversation and she offers me to take a shower at her place. I said I’d probably just power through my cold shower or go to the gym if I really needed a hot shower. Then I thought about it and thought “you know what? Screw it, I’ll take her up on the offer”. So I approached her later in private and said I’d take her up on the shower. We exchange info, finish our shifts, I head home to eat cereal. 

I pack a shower bag and bring some condoms because I’m thinking things might go down that road. She invites me in and shows me around, then leaves to take her daughter to school. I finish my shower and she texts me saying I can leave the house (unlocked) or I can stay if I want until she gets back. I choose to stay. She comes back and puts something on Netflix while we hang out on the couch. I’m pretty awkward but I asked her if she wanted to “Netflix and chill” and she said YES, and I went over to my bag and said “cool, I brought stuff just in case.” She says to me “oh, you mean like snacks?” To which I reply “Uhhh… condoms?”

Ladies and gentleman, she did not want to sleep with me at all. 

“CONDOMS? Wha made you think I wanted to *sleep* with you?” 

“You said I looked like a sexy teacher!”

“Because YOU DO!!”

And other back and forth about the logistics of “Netflix and chill”, how unusual it is to invite someone to be naked and bathing in your own home, etc.

Anyways. We had a laugh about it. I apologized multiple times for making things awkward. She said it was cool and said we should get drinks sometime. I drove home and cursed my luck, felt foolish, and went to bed. 😪

I told him he was nice, handsome and we had great conversation etc., but I feel extremely turned off by him because of his statement and dealbreaker of sex.

I work in a kitchen so it's a pretty rough environment. She's been working there a few months now and I like so many things about her. She's the nicest person I've ever met. She does so many little things through out the work day just to try and brighten everybody's faces. She remembers what music different people like and plays them if you're having a bad day. She constantly does more than she has to just to help others. I really can't describe how nice she is.


We also have a great work friendship. We have little games we play with each other to give each other a little respite during the day. We tease and bully each other constantly (sometimes it goes too far lol) but we always make sure the other one doesn't feel bad about it or is hurt. We can talk for long periods of time where it feels like neither one of us is struggling to hold up the conversation. Every night we work together, we go outside and look at the sunset (like a lot of people do at our workplace since it really is a good view.) And we just talk and make jokes. I'm a little worried I'm too into her. She makes me sincerely happy and I love being around her. 


I've been slowly trying to get the courage to ask her out. I'm 60% sure she doesn't have a significant other since she's never mentioned one before but that could just be her keeping her work and home life separate. But I legitimately think she likes me. I don't usually feel that reciprocity with many other girls but I can almost sense it here. She laughs at all my jokes (even my bad ones). She stands super close to me a lot (closer than she stands to anyone else). I notice her looking at me when I'm not watching. She's almost always smiling this adorable smile when she's near me. I got asked just yesterday by a server if I was single (she's really close to to a lot of the servers). That last one may not be relevant. I feel very braggy in this paragraph but the only reason I'm writing it is to show how unusual this is for me and to give you guys context. 

I really want to get to know her better outside of work. She's coming over to my apartment to hang out with me and my roommate (who also works with us). I want to do this a couple of times before I ask her out just to make sure we still have good chemistry outside of work. But I'm pretty sure we will. After that, I want to ask her out.

But I've been out of the dating scene ever since I got out of high school. I needed some time to work on myself. I also never found someone who has made me feel the way she does. This comes with the downside of not really knowing how to navigate these waters. How do I find out if she has a boyfriend? I could ask one of her friends but then she might find out and then everything's ruined between us if she doesn't feel the same way. It also complicates things at work if she says no because then she might start to feel uncomfortable at work especially if I become a manager like I'm supposed to (which would put me above her).

I also took a step back, because I didn't want to be pushy and scare him away, which I have a tendency to do.
But we talked about meeting up again today yesterday, and then I told him goodnight, and he said ""goodnight buddy/friend""
We're not native English speakers, so buddy/friend is the closest translation. 
But, is that a sign that he isn't interested in me? Or is this something people do without thinking?
