**Mood changes**

She's basically a little puppy during the day, we click really well and joke around a lot, but when it gets to sleep time, she turns into an angry Chihuahua. Especially during her period.

I'm a really relaxed and patient person, so I've put up with it and brought it up to her. She apologized, it's something she's working on. 

But, I do sense this slight coldness when it comes to midnight (I only see her on the weekends). She has been single and independent for a while.

She bought me a pricey gift the other day as a thank you for looking after her. She wrote a card, it had a nice message to it, but also that she hopes she won't stuff this (relationship) up.

Overall, the sudden changes in mood scares me.

**Sex**

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy sex with her. But something that bothers me, she gets really sleepy after having an orgasm and I don't end up finishing. I end up jerking off in the shower. This has happened about 3/8 times.

I missed on high school romance. I know that usually high school romances don’t ever last, but that’s usually people’s first taste of relationships and romantic love and sex and companionship. Like by 18 most people have already experienced that, and I’m 20 and I haven’t even been kissed before.

Now in college people are forming more mature relationships. They all have some level of understanding of how they should act in a relationship or what they want in a partner and this is all just a world that I’m on the outside looking in and I’m so envious they they got it and I just don’t. It makes me feel like such a loser to want to hang out with my friends but all of them either, have their fuck buddy coming over, are going to spend time with a partner, or have another date and I’m just in my room alone in the dark watching Netflix.

And even the ones that aren’t in committed relationships are dating around and at least learning how to casually date people or they’re hooking up with everyone. Like back before I moved out of my dorm I felt like I couldn’t walk down the hallway without hearing very loud sex noises coming from at least 6 of the 12 rooms in my hallway. As embarrassing it is, it made me feel so jealous.

Like the sex isn’t even the issue, it’s that I want someone to be attracted to me and want to have sex with me, so before people suggest it, getting a prostitute would do nothing but make me feel worse. 

I feel like such shit all the time. It feels so depressing. If I’m being completely honest the only time I feel good is when I’m at the gym or running. Every other time I feel so jealous and sad because I can’t escape being reminded of how I’m alone and no one wants to be with me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,798239,public,self,I(20) feel like I’m missing out on so much.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlujy4/i20_feel_like_im_missing_out_on_so_much/,all_ads,6,,,,

so since i was young (16ish) i would approach guys ""online"" that i like in real life and tell them who i was and they'd usually reject me but maybe bc i was not so pretty back then. now, 25, still single, still a virgin, still craving affection, i think im pretty, met a guy i am so interested in yet i am so scared of rejection. i do wear a headscarf (a hijab - im a muslim) so men tend to view me as someone who is not open to relationships or passion or sex.

i met him at a bookstore - he works there - i have been seeing him working there for awhile but never went into the store because id never be prepared, we usually eye each other out but yesterday i came in his bookstore and he asked me if i wanted help, i said yes and asked him if he could find me a ""robert greene"" book and he said he was going to the computer system to look it up so he asked me ""whats your name?"" i told him my name then he said ""no whats the authors name...?"" and i was fully convinced he asked for my name first...i dont know if i embarrassed myself though lol.

he came back and we spoke some more about books, then, i asked him where he was from (he looked middle eastern but it turns out hes from germany) and it was nice to for once just to ask a man where he is from...we then left it at that and now i am at the coffee shop above his book store (he comes up here sometimes) and as im typing this he is underneath the coffee shop and i want to approach and ask for his number so bad but i am so scared of rejection. i did look up his name and found his details but i dont want to invade his privacy and come off as a stalker or a weirdo, i genuinely want to approach him because i know once men see the headscarf, they think the woman wearing it is not open to sin lol.

but god yall have no idea i want to just do so many things with him, i am so attracted to him, and it hurts me so much that he MIGHT reject me. i used to it, but im sick of it. then again, why would he reject me? i am a pretty woman who dresses modestly and is genuinely interested in him, as far as social media, he doesnt seem to be in a relationship, but he has 3 masters degrees...in engineering, physics and maths. so hes definitely not a stupid man. thats why when i said he asked for my name he had this quick reflex thing where im pretty sure he asked for my name.

**UPDATE after 25 days:**

so yesterday, i had this sudden urge to go to the same place and i took my friend with me. i can see him in the corner working in the staff room and he never came around - so i told my friend let me write a little letter to him with my number and give it to a co worker. i wrote ""hi danny, i wanted to approach you today but i never saw you around. instead heres my number -----"" and we got up from the cafe, and i sensed that he saw me and came to THE PLACE I WAS AT and i gave my back to him because i got the worst cold feet. after he left i left and my friend - she gave the card to a co worker and the co worker told her that she would give it to him - so when my friend left she saw the co worker going to him. not sure if she gave it tho.

now, im just a nervous wreck because its been almost 24 hours and my phone didnt light up. let me just say that he looks like a major fuck boy because my friend said he always stares at me but when i look he looks away and rubs his hands and licks his lips acting like hes the shit (this is what i observed from the past month of just studying around that area) so now, half of me is saying hes playing the hard game and the other half is just saying that i did all this for no reason.

i will be avoiding that place from now until i get a responses or something, if i dont, ill wait it out for 3-6 months before i go back there and ask him to his face if he knew anything about this...so now idk. what do you guys think?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,798241,public,self,i need advice on this :(,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlukzy/i_need_advice_on_this/,all_ads,6,,,,

In the moment I felt like she didn't care about me but I never really expressed these thoughts with her and kind of just ended it. Well over time I realized how stupid I was. This girl was fucking awesome, super smart, super cute, super caring. And it was me that ruined the relationship. I was too afraid to confront any arguments we had, and that led to me pushing her away to a point where I didn't know what was going on with her. And naturally this made me think she just didn't care so I dumped her. We had dated for about 3 months by the way.

Anyways, over the past month she's been contacting me about small things, which is a good sign she still has feelings. She asked me for my notes for an exam, and occasionally I'd get a notification she was typing something to me but never sent it. 

Well last night I finally contacted her and she responded. I wanted to know how she was doing, and she was responding, but she definitely wasn't enthusiastic with what she was saying. Well I cut the crap and today I sent her a pretty lengthy apology for how I had treated her over the past few months. I didn't talk about how I still had feelings for her, or that I was interested in seeing her again out of fear that I'd overwhelm her. I just wanted her to understand that I knew how I treated her was wrong. 

Well she responded with ""Oh thank you"" to everything I'd said. She saved what I said but still. :/ She's clearly not interested which just sucks.

I'm just wondering if there is anything I did wrong and I'm looking for some advice as to how I can fix this. 

I never mentioned with anything I said over these past couple of days that I want her back, I just kind of said I wanted to make her feel better, so maybe she still thinks I don't want her back? 

Did I fuck up by how I approached her? Because she had been reaching out to me. Do I still have a chance of getting her back?

Did apologizing to her make me seem desperate for love and that turned her off? I feel like she was interested with how she was reaching out, but now suddenly she doesn't seem to want me again. But I feel like if she did still like me she would've really loved what I said. Should I have tried to call her instead?

Is there anything I can do or is this over? I just really miss her.

I met her in person because she started going to my gym and we've become friends, after meeting her and talking to her I do really like her and would like the chance to date her. She invited me out for dinner (a casual thing) last week and it went good, we talked for about a hour over food and we've also done like two other things one on one

However, we went to a concert the past weekend (it was supposed to be a friend thing + she had a date) she was telling me how she didn't want to see him and he ended up being late so she didn't meet up with him. We were talking but it was loud and I mentioned how we actually matched a while ago on dating app and she was drunkish and said ""i'm sorry but i can't date you, you're like \[my friends\] best friend"". She also seems like she isnt 100% over him yet either because she mentioned wishing he was there while drunk.

I'm like 75% sure she is possibly into me and likes me, she was telling me how she has a date tomorrow and I'm honestly considering just shooting my shot and saying like ""Hey, lets go out friday on a date, it doesn't matter that you dated \[my friend\] i don't mind"".

I hope all is well. I met this girl on bumble around thanksgiving 2020 (6 months ago). I asked her out for coffee and she said that she was being careful due to COVID and the numbers were going back up again in NY. I respected that and I continued to talk to her despite no set date to hang. The way we were talking, we were hitting it off really well and I saw something in her so I wanted to be patient. We did weekly video chat dates and texted most days until we met mid January.

She's been very nervous about COVID, primarily because she lives with her grandma who is 100yo so I totally understand. We had socially distanced dates for like 2months, walking around local parks, and dining out. I cut out going to the gym as I feared getting it there, then giving it to her, thus giving it to her grandma as well. I also tried to go out with my friends early in the week so that if I did get COVID at a bar, well then hopefully symptoms would've showed up before I saw her on the weekend.

The problems started after about 5 dates. The first date she offered to pay, I said no it's okay. I definitely like to pay for the first few dates as the guy. The 5th date, as I went in to get the food, in a nice way, she threw money at me as if to say no no I got this one and she refused to take it back when I said I'll pay. So I said to myself okay she's not a girl who expects a guy to pay all the time so I figured I'd casually bring it up one night saying hey lets just take turns or split the bill instead of us being unsure as to who is gonna pay every time we go out. Well, the next day after i suggested that, she texted me this long rant saying ""I'm at a loss for words, you're grouping me in with your friends talking about splitting checks"", etc. She was pissed and I talked to her on the phone just trying to explain how that's what I was used to in my dating past (I'm not very experienced, I'm 26 and was only in a 5 year relationship before her so that's all I've known) and she went on saying she's never heard of that before, that she's only known me a couple months and that we're already talking about money so it sounds like we're settling down. That's honestly the most ridiculous shit in the world to me. If we were settling down, I would be talking about how much we both make, how much debt we have, how much in savings, not discussing how we're gonna take turns paying at a damn restaurant. So the argument eventually died down and I just went along with what she was used to because I liked her enough to compensate with her on that.

But then the issue arose again in April. We were walking back from a nice time at the park when I just casually said to her how I was going to treat her to something nice today, and then I just said how it's nice to treat each other every once in a while, and that I enjoy being treated too. She thought that sounded weird that I said that. When we got in my car, we looked at food to order on her phone and then I joked pointing out some fast food restaurants on there (she doesn't like fast food but I laugh at her reaction to it whenever i talk about getting mcdonalds with her). Well when she called the order in for a burger restaurant on her phone, the guy asked for her card number to pay for the food. She looked very annoyed as she went to reach for her bag to get her card but she did. On the way to get the food, I asked her what was wrong and she went off saying that ""It's usually the men that treat the women, i don't know why you're talking about getting treated, I'm in for a rude awakening, I don't know whos wearing the pants in this relationship..."" Then she brought up the prior argument about money and that she said every time since, she's had that argument in the back of her mind when i go to pay for food for us. Again, eventually the argument settled down.

We've had a few other issues since, like how I told her I'm not really the type of guy to open car doors every time we go out but I wouldn't mind doing it on big fancy date nights for her or in front of her mom as her mom raised her like that. Well she blew that up into an argument and the last problem was a week ago when she took issue with the fact that I wasn't very engaging in our conversation when I asked her about her day. Admittedly, yes, I wasn't very engaging but I told her that I was just tired from work/all the interviews I've been doing as I'm trying to change jobs but I just enjoy laying there and listening to her voice while she talks about her day. She blew that up into an argument and we haven't really spoken since. This was last Thursday.

My point is, I feel like I've done so much for her but haven't gotten much in return. She's blowing things up and it's like she takes issue when I give my defense/side of the situtation and says that I don't care about how she feels and such.

We decided to cook and maybe go for a walk later. (F33, M36)

While he was cooking one of his neighbors was outside riding a motorcycle with an extremely loud exhaust, back and forth, round and round. At one point I couldn't stand it anymore, I almost shouted out loud, but quieted after one syllable. He told me to not yell. 

Then I got up to close the window, he told me not to. I said I had to or else I was going crazy, as I closed the window. When I sit back down I saw this annoyed face of him, disgusted even. I asked him if he was annoyed and if he wanted me to open the window again. He denied it, told me everything was good, that he just didn't want me to yell.

A minute later we were getting ready to eat. He told me to move his laptop on the desk to make room for my plate. (No furniture, no table.) So I closed his laptop and moved it away a bit. And he got mad again. Obviously by ""move the laptop"" he didn't mean I could close it up because he had unsaved work. 

I apologized and sat down to eat. He sat a few feet away behind me. I started crying because, A) PMS, B) it's hard to be yelled at by someone I just started to trust and open up to.

We didn't talk the entire time we were eating. 10 minutes later I stood up and told him I was going home. He asked if I was OK, I didn't answer. He said ""I'm talking to you."" and I opened the door and walked out. He just locked the door behind me.

After that, we've been meeting once or twice a week and we've spent the night 3 times together. The issue is, I have no idea what he wants.

In the beginning, he was very affectionate and he would compliment me often but now I feel like I am the affectionate one. When I try to do something nice for him or compliment him he refuses to take my kindness because of his low self-esteem and feeling like he doesn't deserve it. He was broken up with 2 months ago and I think he is still somewhat upset about it, he says he doesn't know what his identity is outside of a relationship since he's pretty much always been in relationships. 

On one hand, I feel like I should steer clear and look for other people. I am still on the apps since obviously the thing between us is not committed yet so I am on the lookout, but I am having a hard time letting go of this. I find him very attractive, I love our conversations, and I feel very comfortable spending time with him.

I basically told him how I felt he did me wrong &amp; how I felt he lost interest &amp; started liking another female. How he pushed me away &amp; hurt my feelings. 

He tried to deny it saying it was bc of his business &amp; that he wouldn't have been able to give me the time and attention I needed. 

I said that was partly true but I felt there were other factors too. I knew he was lying &amp; I knew there was another girl he fell for. It ended up not working out with them but by then I'd moved on.

I moved on pretty quickly actually. We didn't date long but we were friends before but the ending really destroyed our connection after that as he really betrayed my trust I felt. He told me he didn't want a relationship then even though he pushed for one initially. 

Now he seems like he wants one &amp; he even told me just now that he really likes me a lot &amp; likes spending time with me. I told him thanks &amp; that I liked (past tense) him a lot too but that after the way he treated me in the end forced me to walk away &amp; move on.

And I did. I met someone else &amp; quickly fell for that guy. He was the opposite of the other guy. Really sweet, gave me time &amp; attention, made the effort.

I will be starting classes again on June 1st so hopefully I can try and meet people... With that being said after hs I've had trouble making friends. This past semester I thought I made a friend. We studied together every Sunday and she even spent the night. Now when she rarely answers my texts it's days after and I haven't seen her since the final for the class. I know making friends outside of him is important but don't know where to start??

I guess what I'm asking is how do I cope with his absence. My bed feels so empty without him and it's only night 1... I know I should be able to be alone but it's so weird knowing he's half way around the globe.He has already asked if I would meet him at the airport and I legitimately can't wait for that... Thank you in advance.

I’ve always had anxiety and in highschool this affected me as I definitely didn’t see myself as good looking and I was pretty shy around friends and girls. Flash forward to university and I started going out more. As I went out more I started to notice that a lot of girls were interested in me. I would have girls come up to me and start conversations and want to dance and get drinks etc. I found I didn’t have to do nearly as much work and conversation as my friends did to go home with girls and sleep with them. I found a lot of the girls I met and brought home were going home with me based on looks generally. My friends who I had met throughout university saw this and kept saying how I was great with the ladies and kept asking for advice on how to get ladies and I just kinda laughed them off and was thinking “ man I don’t even know how I do it !”.  Now some of the girls I take home I try to start conversations with the next days but it always fizzles out within a week. It just made me feel like although these guys and girls think I’m this ladies man who can get what he wants I still don’t really know how to talk to girls and build that relationship, Basically I’m a fraud. I keep having this feeling that when girls get with me and start talking to me they think that I’m going to be this guy whos going to sweep them off their feet , basing this on my looks,  and then when they see the personality doesn’t live up to the bar the good looks have set they leave. I feel like this empty hole I’m feeling I just fill up by sleeping with girls to get some type of connection however when I want more it always seems to never work out. Is there any way I can get past the initial meeting of looks and build a relationship with a girl ? Should I be meeting girls in different places? How should I approach the scenario in my head where I feel like my conversation has to live up to the high bar my looks set? Lastly should I set my standards lower ? I’ve had a couple girls I talked to that were nice however, and this will sound judgemental, I didn’t feel as attracted to them on their Looks as I thought I should be to form a strong relationship if that makes much sense. Any advice would be great . Sorry if that sounded cocky or douchey , I’m not trying to be at all it’s just what my experiences have been like. 

Side note: is there any book suggestions on how to express your sensitive side and communicate your feelings? Not many people know this about me but I’m a pretty sensitive guy and I keep my feelings in a lot of the time.

Tl;dr- I was shy in highschool and didn’t realize my good looks until university where I slept with lots of girls. I can’t find a relationship however and I feel like this Persona of being a ladies man is a fraud.

Congrats to you I hope you will be happy in the purest form. 

To the others: OLD is a waste of time that could be used better elswhere in your life. 

So you started online dating and the matches are or aren't there. First you feel good or bad from the start depending on success. Then if you've got matches you start dating and realize how many worthless women are out there. They literally add nothing to your life apart from physical aspects meanwhile you waste your time with them or on these apps instead of developing yourself, your skills or your health.

To the ones who barely got matches or no matches at all that's alread a good indicator to improve yourself in the first place. Go out there socialize, get fit, find a passion a hobby, learn something new every day instead of wasting your precious time or your money swiping away.

Most of the girls/women on these platforms are princesses. All they care about is to get attention for their fragile egos. If they're wasting their time on these apps that means they have nothing better to do, there isn't enough going on in their lives. And that's already a big red flag. They are there because no one wanted them or are socially inept.

I'm not saying the dudes are any better I just don't know the other side.

A man's worth for a woman exponentially grows as his hustle gets better. It is just biology they are instinctively looking for a man who can take care of himself. No need to be a leader type or the alpha of the pack just have your life together. 

Successful people aren't on these platforms because they don't have time for it. OLD gives them no value.

So go out there and live your best life. Be better than you were yesterday, live your dreams or work for them and relationships will find you in the most organic way.

I also sent her my message so it she’d know what I said. The morning later she hadn’t responded to my message and after some thought I realized what I did was out of line and something I should’ve just left to her so I sent her an apology, which she has yet to even acknowledge exists, and hoped for the best. I thought after thinking I knew her well for what feels like a long time 1 1/2 years she is just basically blocking me out of her life with zero explanation other than what I assume is because I spoke out of line to a kid she barely knows and will probably never speak to again. (also as a side note my messages stopped after my apology which was short and sincere so I know I wasn’t message spamming or anything) I feel like I at the very least deserve to hear why she doesn’t want to speak to me so I don’t have sit spend my work day wondering why the hell she’s so pissed off about something that seems so arbitrary. But anyways a few days into it I’ve heard from some mutual friends that she and her close friends are angry at me so now I guess I’m either really getting the short end of the stick or I really am supremely at fault for some stupid impulsive thing I said. I just hate how this whole situation is being handled and that I’m literally just grasping at straws and crying in my car trying to get myself ready to maybe move on. I really want to make us work, I’ve never had someone get me as much as I she does and I don’t want to lose that. But maybe I’m wrong as usual.

I met this guy 7 months ago. He talked about exclusivity from the beginning. When we talked about relationships he said he wanted to go slowly but he seems to have little time. His job demands a lot of time and is studying on the side and has family in another city so we see each other once every month. He always says that we need to do things other than sex and get to know each other better but meeting once a month we need the sex so that's what we end up doing. For context, I already told him sometimes I feel unconfortable just having sex and leaving. 

So for this last date, he told me to go to his house and that we'd have dinner together after that. I planned for that and actually didn't even get something to cook for myself that night. We had sex like usual, spend quite a lot of time pillow talking and cuddling, had sex two more times and then fell a sleep for a bit and when I woke up he looked at his phone and it was almost 10 pm and he said I'm so sorry I have to get to work at 7 am the next morning so let's leave dinner for another day, I owe it to you. 

I don't know whether that is a legitimate excuse (it was still early?) or he just got tired of me being there given that we already had sex enough times and he needed me for nothing more. And I need some insight to see what to do because I have feelings for his man and after 7 months he called me 'my love' for the first time and I thought we were progressing... That date made me feel otherwise.

I’ve always liked being totally shaven. It’s my personal preference and makes me feel tidy.

She noticed and was grossed out by my behaviour (100% in her right). I honestly got caught up in the moment of how cute she looked and snapped the picture. I immediately deleted the picture and apologised for my gross behaviour. I suggested that I leave because my presence was obviously making her uncomfortable. Which was the last thing I wanted. I feel horrible of how I made her feel. Afterwards during the car ride back I texted het to tell her there is no excuse and that I am genuinly sorry. Can someone advise me on how I can rectify this?

I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. She also just got out of a relationship and we related on a lot of levels. We spent a week talking every night, had some videocalls and played videogames. We were flirting a lot and I was having a lot of fun.

Days later we had a date and it was actually amazing, best date I ever had. We kissed, held hands, and had a lot of fun.

I was OK with that. Now this has all been weeks ago, so last night I decided to text her and check how she was doing. I was hoping that maybe she was willing to pick it up where we left off.  
Basically she told me she was doing better, but she also told me she had gone on a date with someone else and had a lot of fun. Obviously not what I wanted to hear but I know we weren't exclusive so she can do whatever she wants.

I hate myself for liking her so much and getting so attached to someone so quickly. I just really liked talking and connecting with her, and it frustrates me how I don't understand what I did wrong. Now I'm feeling sad and semi jealous about someone who isn't even my girlfriend.
