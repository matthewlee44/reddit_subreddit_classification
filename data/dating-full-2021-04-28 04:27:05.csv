So I downloaded bumble for the first time about a month ago after ending a 6 year relationship last year. My reason for getting on it is because I am ready to meet new people and learn what kind of people I gel with... considering the last person I was with made me challenge my own sanity. 

Well, I met someone pretty quickly who wanted to meet up. He was the first to actually make me excited to be meeting someone new. He was playful and interesting. Well we met up and got along super well. So well that we kissed on the first date. It wasn’t long after that we started regularly texting and I slept over a lot over the past month. We’ve both lost track of how much we’ve seen each other. 

We make each other laugh and I genuinely look forward to seeing him. Problem is, we really jumped into it and think we may have moved too fast with sleeping over and regularly talking every day. He recently confessed that he’d like me to be committed to him, even though that’s not what he originally intended when we first talked. He said there’s something between us that clicks compared to his previous relationships. Thing is, I told him i’m not looking for any commitments, and he understood where i’m coming from since i’m trying to learn more about myself and stuff. 

However he still wants to talk and date anyway, and honestly it’s hard at this point to deny that I really like him and want to keep seeing him. So... i made it clear that I don’t want to be held down to just him so soon... and he said we will slow down a lot and try to reset as much as possible. 

So I had someone else ask me out yesterday who clicked with me at a job i took one day maybe 2 weeks ago, and well I said yes to a date because in my mind, I thought we bonded well and i’m trying to get myself out there. However, the past couple days I feel immense guilt and confusion for how I should be feeling with the first guy I met. I realize I have a big crush on him and would probably be a bit jealous if he were talking to other girls. But damn I shouldn’t be like this. 

Part of me feels bad for trying to meet someone new even though I really like this current guy. But the other part of me feels like i owe it to myself to see what’s out there. When I think about it, it makes me sad if i had to cut things off with the current guy if this other relationship works out really well. How do people juggle this stuff?

I’m already overwhelmed. I have considered retracting and telling the second guy i’m not ready to date just yet, since i’m still having fun getting to know this guy, but idk. I kinda feel like i don’t want to see anyone new if it means i have to say goodbye to him. I’d be real sad. 

Maybe I should just go on the date with the new guy anyway? It’s just a single date? I’m not technically in a relationship with anyone so I’m not tied down, but part of me feel guilty and feels obligated to tell this first guy I accepted a date.

I started seeing someone and it escalated quite quickly. He consistently takes me out, pays for everything, was the first to ask me to be his girlfriend and was the first to say “I love you” very early on. We’ve been apart for only a day or 2 and he’s tells me he misses me. He also bought gifts randomly and would surprise me. When he got a new apartment he even said I could move in, but I decided it was too soon and said we should wait. It’s now been about 3 months. He told me from the get-go he has family matters and an ex wife, his kid will always be priority which I get. He has worked hard to juggle them and also made plenty of time for me. 

Now it’s getting to that stage things are starting to unravel. His affection towards me has become less and less. He’s been going through some family stuff I am completely unaware of as we both know it’s not something I can and should be involved in. His way of coping however is to detach, he won’t tell me what happened (not always) and will shut off, needing space or to do an activity to take his mind off. I don’t try to pry but I wish I knew what was going on. I find it hard to not internalise this expecially when I don’t know the direct cause of why his behaviour has changed suddenly. I find it hard to just switch off and do something independently when I’m left with questions about wether I’m annoying him or if he’s losing feelings now the honey moon phase may be over. 

When I ask for a hug he often hasn’t been in the mood and continuing to ask for things like affection has been getting on his nerves as he says it feels “forced”. The drama going on in his life along with some of my own insecurities / anxiety have lead me to want more closeness with him, I’ve tried to lighten the mood, give him massages or tidy his apartment as a thanks to show my gratitude. Last night he really snapped at me at a dissageeement and said he needs some time apart to take a break. He didn’t specify how long and said it could be a couple days or a couple weeks. He just needs to figure some things out in his head. Although he’s shown his love for me, my anxiety is killing me thinking I’m going to get dumped. That maybe he’s considering rekindling with his wife or losing his feelings for me. I’ve put a lot of emotional energy into him after he did the persuing I really fell hard. I know he does love me and I need to get my own life. I don’t have any family in this town and my life has just been working on weekends and spending time with him.

Basically I’m wanting to be more independent and need to trust his word that he’s committed to me. I am already planning things like doing volunteer work, hobbies, go out with friends. But him consuming my thoughts is scaring me. There is an age gap of 10 years and I worry maybe I’m not yet mature enough for him. I can’t relate to having a child or a 15 year marriage / bond with her. I want to make things work but him being a lot more financially stable and independent could create a power dynamic. Do you think this break could be him trying to wean me off? Was I being love bombed and now he’s sick of me? Or am I just being really annoying by spending too much time with him? Im going to give it 2 weeks and avoid texting or calling. But I’m also trying to prepare myself to move on if this doesn’t work out which I am not ready for heartbreak again.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,741741,public,self,Need a break,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n076mr/need_a_break/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

My (F23) boyfriend (M26) and I were messaging the other night when suddenly he stopped replying. I noticed he had not opened or responded to my Snapchat but was active on Facebook. It may be dumb, but it annoys me when people are active on social media but won’t open or reply to my messages. 

My old roommate deals cocaine and I noticed on Snapchat maps he was in my boyfriend’s garage which was weird because my bf said he was going to go to bed soon before he stopped responding to me. 

My boyfriend and I have frequently discussed how this roommate is not a good person and not good company to have. We also decided we want to better our lives and make healthier decisions. I stopped smoking cigarettes, weed, and stopped doing any hard drugs (which I wasn’t doing any more than once every 1-2 months anyway). He agreed he wanted to stop too.

Anyway, I had a bad feeling this night when he wasn’t responding, so I drove to his apartment that night (feeling crazy btw) and found him with my old roommate drinking and doing coke. He admitted to me that he probably would not have told me the next day had I not gone there and found him. 

This may be stupid and petty, but it’s important to me and I feel betrayed. Especially since he lied. Is this worth breaking up over? My biggest issue is if he lied this time, how would I know he hasn’t lied in the past about this and other issues and how do I know he won’t continue to lie?

Then she said she immediately deleted the nudes when she opened them. Since then, she has deleted all social media to earn my trust back...when I offer to go places with her, she talks me out of it.

Great face great body. She replied to a question I had with saying hey here's my ig. She's one of those people who. Posts everyday (nbd) and her ratio had much more followers than followees... Makes sense bc of tits right.

I ask for her number on ig and she gives it to me and we have a pleasent convo. I ask her out for a drink Thursday she said she can't until next Monday (yesterday). I'm like np I'll set up some othrt dates in the mean time (did go on a another day Saturday and am seeing the second girl again this Saturday)

The whole time from Friday to Monday she's sending me good mornings and good nights and pics of her day. I play along bc I don't wanna insult her. 
So Monday roles around and we meet at a coffee shop. She's as gorgeous as her pics and I can tell she likes me. She didn't wanna get a drink bc she doesn't like to get drinks with guys she's never met before so that's why I suggest coffee instead. Coffee goes great and it's easy to talk to her and we're laughing. She says okay she trusts me so we can get a drink after coffee but I'm hungry so I suggest sushi instead. She obliges and we stay at the sushi place until closing.

It's a bit chilly outside of sushi so I ask her if she wants to sit in my car so we hang talk more she says yes. We get in my car tlak for a bit. We both eventually say we need to pee. So I say I had a fun time, she says the same and we start making out like hard core. Things get hot and heavy and I invite her over she says yes.

We get to the bedroom and I'm about to stick it in and she doesn't ask if I'm tested or anything. So I ask her if she's on bc and she says she is and is clean. Now I haven't had sex without a condom for over 2 years (because I always wear s condone) at this point and holy shit it feels so much better. But I regain my compusre and make sure not to cum in her.

We go a couple more rounds and I'm sometimes protected other times not but there is some pre cum so I might fucked up. Anyway she goes iny my closet and is like we should match for our date Friday (agreed before making out we'd like to see each other again) so she's like we should both wear a same type of shirt. I think it's cute so I'm like sure nbd. I offer her to stay but she says she has to go, nbd. She also politely says I get a shirt and shorts on walk her to her car. I'm not an asshole so I do.

She texts me when she gets home and says she left some jewelery and to make sure I clasp the bearing. In my head I'm like why does it matter but it's alright. So I say gn kissy face and she responds with kissy face with hearts.

This morning were texting all day. And she calls me after work asking what I'm doing. She wants to come over bc she has some time to kill. I already had plans so I told sorry and why. She understands and we talk for like 15 minutes before she reached the place where she wnatd to kill time.

After I'm done with what I was doing. I texted her goodnight and how her movie was  just bc weve been doing it this whole time and she sends me good mornings so I feel bad if I don't. Also I do like her so I don't think I'm leading her on.


She ends up calling me again (this is 2 times the day after we met) to explain how her night went. Again I'm not really putt off but this but then my friend is telling me shes crazy for attempting to come over the day after you first met her and that she called you twice and trying to coordinate clothes on the second date.

This vent comes from something that's been annoying me esp for the last couple of weeks. So I have this friend and prior to a couple of months ago, he was very unmotivated. He'd just play games all day whenever he wasn't at work at a job that he disliked. He was gaining weight and not eating the healthiest. All in all, he just wasn't in a good state and wasn't actively doing anything to fix it. 

Me and him would always converse about our exploits on dating apps and just other experiences in general with dating as we both really desired to be in relationships and craved it so much. The difference on my end is that I am a very self-motivated individual. So despite not having the crutch of a loving SO to lean on for motivation, I always found it within myself to make my life atm something to be proud of. I'm a studying engineer who works hard to get good grades. I've successfully scored an upcoming internship that will look good on my resume. I spread out my time to include my well-loved hobbies of training in music and art. And I also love working out so I've managed to become quite fit and with a healthy diet. In other words, naturally on ny own accord, I'm doing everything that falls under the classic dating advice that people love to give which is: ""Work on yourself first"". So then take a guess just who out of the two of us managed to find a girlfriend and who is all of a sudden, a huge burst of motivation and energy...........I think you can see where my frustration comes from now. A guy who was so underdeveloped with himself ended up finding a loving relationship compared to the guy who gives his all everyday and has still found nothing :(

 For context, my friend is now eating better, sending applications to better jobs that he'll actually like, and getting started on a bunch of new creative endeavors. Let me be clear, I'm happy for him. I'm happy that with this new girl in his life that he'd able to find so much motivation and passion. What annoys me is just the feeling of how unfair all of it feels. It makes me have doubts and feelings of hopelessness and to be totally honest, it gets me so sad. I know life isn't fair, nothing is. But that doesn't mean we can't vent about how shitty that fact still is. Alright, I think I vented pretty much what I wanted to get off my chest.

On the second date we spoke quite a lot and on the train home she even was lying on my shoulder while we were chatting. I paid for everything on both dates as i chose to.

We speak every day on snapchat (that's just our main way), i do have her number and what not but yeah. She works a lot and is always busy and on top of that she lives about 40 mins on the train away (not too big of a deal), however it can be hard to just catch up in the afternoon or plan to just hang out for an hour. I feel like sometimes the conversation can be really dry and sometimes really good, sometimes she replies quick and sometimes it takes hours (mostly during the day when she is working, which is normal). After our second date (last friday - 4 days ago) she told me we wont be able to do something for 2 weeks as she is quite busy and that's good and all and fair enough.

I feel like everything is going good, she's still talking to me so i think she likes me and we have hugged and stuff a bit (we almost kissed at the end of the second date but she told me she doesnt really kiss anyone til she is in a relationship and thats okay, i can respect that). I'm not trying to be pushy or clingy or anything, just trying to be me but sometimes i feel like i come off needy or something when i dont mean to, i have backed off with how quick i reply to messages and what not (she is the first girl i have dated in over a year and a half).

We both agree that honesty is super important and last night i told her i liked her cause its been on my mind and i wont be able to see her for at least 2 weeks so i just said it to her. She told me 'I appreciate the honesty, i like you too' followed closely by on the topic of being honest that she has been/or has seen others (i cant remember how it was worded) since we arent exclusive, and its true, we aren't its only the second date. It threw me off a little bit but i had expected it and since we aren't exclusive it's expected. She also mentioned it takes a while for her to truly like someone, which is fair enough since its still early, right?

I guess i'm just a little confused with the signals, she tells me that she likes me, held my hand on first date, hugged me and talks to me every day but still (maybe?) seeing others. Is this a normal thing? Am i over thinking?

So there is this girl that I like and talk with every day, we met at work and it took me a week to get her number, It has been 2 weeks now since I have her number and we have been talking on the phone for about an hour or more every day, (And we both hate calling) we had a little date last Sunday where we went on a walk with her dog, It was so much fun! (The dog really liked me and that's not something the dog does often)

At first reading this you probably think well what's wrong then, and the thing is that she told me that she has commitment issue's, she has told me that she left most guys out of nowhere in the past because she felt that it all went too fast and she was scared because of it. I totally respect that and don't want to rush into things, but I would not know when she would be ready, because she finds it hard to tell that too.

I just need some advice on how to deal with this, I am someone that likes clarity and hate it when I don't know when or how, for her, I can wait but I don't know for how long, she has also stated that she does not want to lose me as a friend and I told her the same thing.

She is the most amazing person that I have ever met and I have never had such a connection with someone like I have with her, we also have a lot in common.

All I need to know is how I can deal with this situation, in the best way possible. I was thinking about telling her not to tell me when she is ready, but just to tell me to say ""Let's go on a date to a restaurant"" that way it would be more normal without it being direct.

He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in pjs.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similiar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. Date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since. The past few days he's been messaging me. The other day I realised I didn't look at one of his stories and he would have known. So, for the first time he decided to not look at my recent story (for the first time).

about a week or 2 ago, i texted the girl and asked her what our deal was and if anything had changed between us. didn’t ask her out. just asked her if there’s a possibility that we’d become something in the future and if there wasn’t then i wasnt going to put my feelings into that anymore. she got kind of mad i guess because i think that she thought that i was asking her out. she went on about how “she likes to wait and build foundation for a long term relationship.” but then she proceeded to tell me that “she’s not in a good place in her life and that she didn’t know if she wanted anything with me or not.” so i told her “okay. that’s all i needed to hear.” 

i told her what the outcome would be if she didn’t want anything. she said that she wasn’t sure what she wanted. and i didn’t feel obligated to wait for her to make up her mind, so i started to push her away or distance myself from her because i felt like if i didn’t do that, then all of my feelings for her would still linger and i felt like i just needed to get over her. so i pushed her away. i didn’t ghost her. i feel like ghosting is when you block someone so that they can’t make contact with you, she can text me whenever she wants for anybody wondering.

He reached out for a final time and I agreed but then I felt like he just wanted to free himself from guilt, told him that we should only catch up in the future if we both want to be together. Told him that he has a habit of unilaterally choosing whether he wants me in his life. He said there was a bit of truth in wanting to free himself from guilt but thought it would be healthy in general, didn't think it would still be really difficult for me but naturally understood. He wished me all the best and apologised for the hurt he caused me. I told him the next day that I just wanted to have a nice evening with him, I didn't want him to catch up with me just to tell me how sorry he was and told him that I felt nervous when he said he wanted to clear the air. He gave me a really ambiguous last text and almost stood back and thought (or so I thought) and said ""Ok, I can understand how it could have caused that. Sorry, it was the furthest from my intention of making you feel that way"" I don't know why but it confused me even more, as if I was in his situation, I would have said that and maybe said ""Look, you're probably right.

I am a 35 year old man who is back on the dating scene after the ending of a very long relationship, last December. Thanks to our friend Covid, the contacts I have had with girls in recent months have been based exclusively on dating apps. After several unsuccessful dates I finally met a person who not only got my interest, but with whom I think there is real alchemy. We talked for a couple of weeks before we saw each other, and our first time was incredibly enjoyable. Lots of laughter, lots of understanding and complicity. Despite that nice first date (without any physical interaction), our tones remained cordial, no evolution from the point of view of communication. Two weeks later we went out again, and this time it went even better! Half an hour into the date we were kissing, and beginning to getting more intimate (verbally speaking). We stayed together all day, until 2 am (don't tell to the Italian authorities!), when she asked me to stay and sleep at her place to avoid my cycling back at night. I was reluctant at first, but when she asked me again i accepted. We slept all night hugging, without sexual interactions (given the mood, it was not the case. Week day, roommate in the next room etc etc. There wasn't sexual tension at that point, just affection). In short, the next evening she confessed to me that she felt very embarrassed and confused, and felt the need to warn me to take things slow. From that day a week ago, I perceived a wall between us, i feel her being colder and less interested in conversing. But i may be wrong. I feel a bit stiff now, circlyng mentally on what went wrong (i'm not blaming myself, i'm trying to understand her). 

I would like to invite her out again, but personally (maybe I'm still emotionally unstable) now I feel like I'm walking on a rope. I'm afraid to move in any direction. I like her. 

She is 33 yo, and ended a even longer relationship last december. I think she's looking for a stable partner and that she doens't fully trust me, considering where we met each other. During the second date i did a thing that made her look at me with ""love"" and that she defined as one of, if not,  the most romantic things someone ever for to her.

Other times it's less clear. Lately a guy asked me out for a drink who I saw for a few months. I kind of liked him but didn't want a boyfriend then. He definitely wanted to be my boyfriend at the time.

I ended it and haven't thought about him much for a while, and it has been over a year. Weve talked a handful of times.

Now my explanation for the title of this post is simple. There’s a confirmed drastic imbalance of men to women within the online dating space. Look it up on Google. It’s about 9 men for ever 1 woman. It’s probably worse now. 

This creates a situation where most men are simply not even going to get a chance with most women because it is mathematically impossible. Only the most attractive men have a chance. As a result, the majority of these highly attractive men just utilize their advantage for mostly quick sex because why settle down for a single relationship when you have access to the majority of women within these dating apps?

The average men are fighting over each other just to mostly likely be ghosted, flaked on and majority of the time, not even acknowledged because they are choosing women that are either average like themselves or above average. These same women are choosing only the top men. The below average women are not desired by the average men or above average men. These below average women tend to be the ones that end up liking and messaging the profiles of average men and above average men due to their very low desirability. The below average woman however can still get dates and maybe even a relationship unlike the below average man. 

Below average men are completely invisible so I’m not even going to elaborate on them any further. 

This leaves average and above average women selecting from the top echelon of men. I’ve heard countless times from women that yes they get a bunch of likes and messages but finding a guy who’s not just willing to only do a hookup and is actually worthwhile is very difficult to impossible. This brings me back to my first point where the majority of these most attractive men these women are going for are not going to settle into a relationship when they can get easy sex because of their looks. 

When faced with tons of options like average and above average women are, it’s only natural that they try to select the best of those options. With online dating, the best profiles are rated by looks. BIO isn’t as important.

You also have algorithms and ELO’s in place which further ruins everything by placing the profiles that aren’t swiped right a lot to the bottom. Keep in mind, the 9 to 1 imbalance of men to women. So now you have average men and some above average men only being shown to below average women. This is due to most of the men getting right swipes being the top echelon in looks. The most attractive men are shown to average and above average women. 

So when you break this all down, it makes sense why it sucks for most men and women. It’s a combination of a horribly skewed ratio of men to women. Algorithms and ELO’s in place to punish accounts that aren’t model looks level. And guys inherent nature to want sex so much they will forgo relationships if they know they can easily get sex because of their looks.

Lots of matches but have been extremely picky and immediately delete anyone who comes across as overly pushy about sex because that’s not all I want anymore. Last week, though, I matched with a guy (22M) who was extremely nice and respectful, super cute in his pictures and works in a similar field to what I’m studying. He asked me to dinner pretty soon after we started talking and I agreed.

Y’all, first dates rarely go well for me, but this was amazing. We laughed the entire time, talked about our travel adventures, stayed at the restaurant for nearly four hours until we were the only two people there. He took the long route driving me home and hugged me goodnight and kissed me on the cheek goodnight. Made no moves to come into my house, which I guess could mean he wasn’t interested but sex on the first date is a no for me so it made me really happy. He texted me immediately after he got inside that he had a great time, said I was “even cuter in person and super fun to talk to” and asked me if I wanted to meet again the next day. I was a little hesitant because it seemed a bit soon but I figured what the hell, why not.

But the next morning he told me he wasn’t feeling super well, said if he felt better we could make a plan for later that night. I told him that it was no big deal and that I would be making plans during the day but he is welcome to text me if he’s feeling better later. He didn’t.

I am not a mind reader, have no idea if he genuinely just crashed because he’s not feeling great or if he lost interest. I haven’t texted him yet and a part of me wants to just tell him that it’s okay if he doesn’t want to see me again but I’m not interested in chasing him.

The general question is “what’s up with the whole ‘liking someone too much’ ick feeling?” but I don’t think it’s that “social value” theory that misogynist PUA types think and I go into detail why. **

32F here. Been single since August when my only real “this is the one” relationship (38M) ended because, among other things, I loved him “too much” and it made him feel inadequate. He had a pattern of that sort of behavior so I wasn’t surprised. He had told me a lot about how terrible his childhood was with his drunk absent parents who would abandon him on his birthday every year and while there wasn’t really a lot of “abuse”, didn’t really treat him with the love a kid normally gets from his parents. He didn’t have a single girlfriend until his late 20s and even in the relationship he thought would last forever before me, she never thought enough of him to get him gifts he’d actually like and never put in equal effort to surprise and delight him. Hearing that broke my heart and I endeavored to show him the love I felt he deserved and had been denied for so long, which apparently made him feel bad for being depressed and being sort of numb a lot of the time and eventually he broke it off because getting that kind of love (even from someone he found attractive and fun) made him feel bad.

I’ve never experienced that before. The men I date generally treat me pretty good (except for the stalkers and creeps who don’t count) and I don’t tolerate bullshit, so my reference point for “likes me too much” is high, and whenever I have felt that way, it was about someone I already had a little bit of an ick feeling about and their behavior came off as desperate. 

Cut to: the guy I’m talking to now (41m— I have been calling him Steve on Reddit). Steve is super sweet, sensitive, intelligent and interesting and is an incredibly talented artist whose work I have admired for years before we started talking online. I got to know him a bit more after I hired him for a short contract and then we started following each other’s social media and flirting a little bit and that all blossomed into a very intimate friendship that if we lived closer to each other would already include a sexual component. 

Steve is also mentally ill— I am thinking probably bipolar disorder, because he oscillates between this wild mania stage where it sounds like he is coked out of his mind and these rock bottom lows that have him like, crying unexpectedly in the middle of sentences. He is in a low stage right now and has some artistic frustrations as well as some trauma he’s working through, and because I am treating him with kindness, he is glomming onto that with a fervor that is unexpected. Like every thing nice I say to him, he reacts like it’s the thing that just pulled him off the ledge. (Tons of !!!!!!!!s. All caps. Enthusiasm so palpable it makes me uncomfortable even written) And maybe it is, I don’t know. But he has a LOT of friends all over the place who just adore him and he’s non-monogamous so I know he has other girlfriends and it’s not like a lack of love in his life. 

I still like him a LOT, enough that I’m willing to ignore a bunch of stuff that might make our relationship harder (such as him being non-monogamous and the distance). I can’t stress enough what a sweetheart he is, very generous with his time and affection, and even though he’s short and not conventionally handsome, I definitely think he is super super cute. Like at times I think I might be starting to love him. But I oscillate between liking him a lot for those things and finding the level of enthusiasm from him at times sort of... off-putting. And I don’t really know why except that it feels somehow inappropriate.

I met X, 30M on Bumble. The first date went really well and we ended up sleeping together. No issues there and he finished and was aroused throughout. 

The morning after I noticed certain behavior like the way he'd talk and move his hands were completely different than how he was the day prior. He gave me some gay vibes but I didn't know how to understand this as he kept complimenting me sexually, saying he found me so attractive and even having sex the morning of. His tone was different, his body movements different too. I thoughts I was overthinking so I decided to give it time and see. 

Well last night was our second date and after we smoked weed it's like gay vibes fully jumped out. He spoke exactly like every gay man on a sitcom down to the topics he wanted to discuss. He seemed to check out our make waiter and even make more joke when he came around. At my place we were kissing and he said he didn't feel like having sex because he didn't want to make my roommates uncomfortable. I had told him this is not an issues and that my roommates knew I had company. The whole night he proceeded to talk about how full my apartment was and how he could give me some bright color. 

I finally asked him if he was only into women and he got offended and said no, that I shouldn't ask him that ever again and that many gay guys have gone up to him and asked if he was gay. 

I'm up now and it's hitting me full on that this guy is closeted. I feel like an idiot for not having a ""gaydar"" as much as I thought I did because I didn't see any signs on date one. One date 2 everything came full frontal down to his walking and talking as well as others behaviors. 

This guy has poured his heart out to me about how much he likes me and how beautiful he finds me already by date 2. How do I have this conversation with him so we can hopefully be friends? I enjoy his company but I want him to be his true self and I'm ok with a friendship only situation.

However there are at least two times when I think ghosting is appropriate and I'm going to explain when those two times are and why.

The first example is if you're certain that your partner is cheating on you or cheating on someone else with you. Here's why I believe it's better to ghost in these situations. Because if you talk to your partner and explain all the red flags, clues, and or slip ups he or she made then you're basically giving them tips on how to hide their infidelity with the next person. Do not do this. Allow them to make the same mistakes with the next person too. Having a conversation where you say A, B, and C made you suspicious and X, Y, and Z was the final nails in the coffin, this person may try to cheat again but do their best to hide A ,B, and C as well as X, Y, and Z from whomever they date next. It's better to just let them go and allow them to be ignorant. 

The next example is if the person you're dating just doesn't put in the effort or energy you feel you deserve. Now this may be controversial since we all have different opinions on how much effort we feel we deserve, but for me it's simple. If you're putting in all the work and you're partner is barely trying then that's enough to know that the relationship is not 50/50 in their eyes and you need to walk away. So why ghost? Well here's my philosophy on that. You've put in the effort to make the relationship work, now you're putting in the effort to explain why it's not working. That's too much effort on your part. It's time for you to take a break. If you're constantly the one planning the dates while your partner doesn't, making the drive to their house while your partner doesn't, trying to free up your schedule while your partner doesn't, then why should you also have to put effort into the break up? If your partner was serious about you they would have put in the effort, if they don't, then don't feel bad about not putting in the effort in leaving them.

We’ve only known each other about 2 months now. He lives about 35 minutes from me so I usually end up driving to his place to stay, which I don’t mind because he pays for everything else and treats me well. 

The last week we got back together, we broke up on mutual terms but felt like we belonged together so we started dating again after a week apart. 

Last week, Thursday to be exact, I went to see him and spent the night. We had a wonderful time as always. It was like we never broke up. 

That Friday morning I left around 730 am and was only about 5 minutes out when someone rear ended me at 35mph. It was the most horrific thing I’ve ever experienced. The steering wheel and airbag fucked my face up terribly, my car is totaled. I called him as soon as the accident happened, hysterical, my face was full of blood, he calmly told me to call 911, I did. I left in an ambulance and went to the hospital. The rest of the weekend I spent recovering at home, I could barely walk. Whiplash, sprained wrist, horrific abrasions/burns on my face. Just a really horrible experience altogether. 

The following few days he hardly texts me. Doesn’t come see me, doesn’t call to see how I’m doing. I found this so strange, almost as if I was an inconvenience to him. Like? I drove all the way to see you, spent the night with you, and then I leave and get in a horrific car accident that wasn’t my fault and you can’t even call to check on me? He was the one who strongly wanted to get back together and is now treating me like an afterthought. I have no idea what to do, it’s now been 5 days since the accident and he’s been very distant with me. Not only am I so sad about my car and my body being mangled but now he’s acting like he doesn’t care or even really care to talk to me. 

Just venting, I really don’t understand his behavior. I understand we all get busy and have lives and jobs to tend to, I totally get that. But for me to have be injured so badly and he’s not really making an effort to talk to me or check on me... just really off putting. I’m not quite sure what to do or if I should even keep dating him. 

What a terrible week. 

TL;DR Started seeing my ex again, on good terms previously, and was in a horrific car accident after visiting him. He’s now acting very distant with me and seems to not care of my existence.

Yeah it’s probably been said by other a million times but I’m always feeling down about my dating prospects nowadays. With the pandemic and lockdown still a thing here in Scotland I don’t think how’s the time to date but I want to after being dumped last year during the height of the pandemic here. Since then I’ve been annoyed with myself thinking I didn’t make the effort even when I physically couldn’t due to lockdown and when I did I ended up being called boring and then dumped so she could meet other guys which made no sense to me as we were still in a pandemic but oh well. 

I’m trying to apps but again I don’t see the point despite what my friends have told me. With restrictions easing it should be a good time to meet people but I just can’t muster the energy to do so and my trust issues after my last relationship are through the roof while my confidence is basically on the floor. Any conservations on these apps are typically started by myself and and do go much really. I see a lot of people on these apps saying things like “if you don’t have much to say or just say hello don’t bother” etc and it annoys me as these people seem to think they are above everyone else or deserve something different even with everything that’s currently going on. 

I might wait until bars and clubs go back to mostly normal and try them but who knows when that’ll happen. Even then I’ll be worried about bumping into my ex as we went to a lot of the same places and it’s not a fairly big town, I’m blind to bump into someone I know. My best friend wants me to start going out on the town with him and getting somewhere with girls when we can but I just don’t think I’ll have the confidence and I don’t think I’m particularly interesting or attractive or enough of a bad boy as I’ve been told basically by my ex who didn’t have that mindset until literal weeks before dumping me. I have a decent job as an architect, I’m not attractive, I’m 5’7 so I guess that’s a turnoff to a lot of girls but I can’t help that. I’m trying to get back into shape after months of being lazy and eating junk to tide me over.

I met my now gf at the start of February and we fell for each other and made it official about two weeks ago. She works at a gym so I've been stopping by to workout with her every chance I can see her. She lives 40ish minutes away so I see her twice a week, three times at most. The thing is I grew up not really having many female friends, thats just the way I was raised and brought up. My gf on the other hand has guy friends and girl friends, which is something I've kind of accepted.

We have had one argument so far and it was related to her wanting to spend her day off with a male coworker. To be fair she did let me know ahead of time and was open with me about it, but I still felt a little uncomfortable as I thought it was just an acquaintance that she wanted to go on a 1-on-1 outing with (it turns out he wasnt just an acquaintance and they were pretty good friends, he has met her family). She ended up cancelling plans with him that day and we talked about it a bit more and after she explained the relationship with him a bit more I wasnt as uncomfortable with it.

Yesterday she lets me know that a new guy had started working at the gym, a personal trainer, and he had asked a couple of the girls if they had wanted to get a workout in but they had declined. My gf took him up on it and they exchanged numbers and scheduled a time to workout together. She wanted to know if I would be okay with it before she actually said yes, and although still uncomfortable with it I let her know it was fine. I dont want to be that bf that is controlling and doesnt let his gf have a life of her own but i still cant help feel weird about situations like these.

The second part is the most important and if you want to skip to it, start to read after the ==================

I only added the first part so you guys can understand the full story.

My ex (19 at the time) and I (20 at the time) met on college and since the beginning we really hit it off. We became good friends, we even slept together without having sex some times, and also made out 3 or 4 times but nothing special. We then started to date in secret , and some time later, we started a relationship still in secret, because we didn't want our friends to medlle into our relationship, and only after 1/2 months since the beginning of our relatoinship we ""came out"" to our friends.

In the secret dating period, we went to a friend's birthday party, she got drunk, and started to play truth or dare. I was outside smoking weed with some other friends, so I didn't knew exactly what she was doing, but I knew she was playing that game. When I got back inside, I went to the bathroom and I had a gut feeling something wasn't right because I saw her leaving a friend of mine and going to her chair. She followed me there, and when she saw that I was bottered with something, she asked me ""Are you mad just because I kissed \*?"". I was really pissed and stormed off.

The next day, she was at my place, telling me she was sorry, saying she was told the dare and had to do it, that it was just a game, that she looked at me and I nodded, giving her permission to do it, even though I wasn't even inside. She swore that she only had kissed \*. We broke up for 2 days, but then we got back together. I understand that it wasn't a good decision because I didn't trust her now, but since I still liked her and cared for her, we got back together.

While we dated, she had a highly toxic close friend that my ex wanted to break things off but couldn't do it because she lived with her, and her ""friend"" was really good at manipulating her and making her feel bad. I helped her get rid of her ""friend"" (I didn't kill her, if it's that what you're thinking) and she even told me she would not be able to do it if it wasn't for me. Also, I had a friend that , before I even met my ex, started to spread that she had sex with him, even though it wasn't true, and that was something that really bothered her. She asked me for help, and I called him so she could talk to him and make him admit he was lying and to tell him to stop spreading that. She thanked me again since this was a difficult position for me since we were friends (we aren't now).

In this period, I was not the perfect boyfriend. I smoked too much weed; I was lazy; since I'm used to be alone and do things alone (I am not antisocial, I actually make friends pretty easily, I just like to be alone) and because she was my first gf, maybe I didn't make her feel fully appreciated. Also, I never told her I loved her because I couldn't trust her (because of the truth or dare thing) even though she would always tell me she loved me.

I also don't think I was a bad boyfriend. I never hit her, cheat on her, called her names, I always listened to her problems, when she would start to cry I would always hug her and make her feel that she cared, and even when we were in bed ready to sleep, I would either spoon her, or hug her and caress her hair until she fell asleep, and only then, I would try to fall asleep. Even though I never told her I loved her, I would always try to make her feel good and show her that I cared for her.

We dated for 5 months. The the last month it was long distance (we lived 1.5 hours apart). During this period I tried to be with her sometimes, but since we were working summer jobs and had different work schedules (she worked a night shift, and i worked a day shift) we could only meet on sundays. She had her birthday on a Saturday, but she told me not to come because she would not be able to be with me because she had to work at night. 2 days later, she went to the city our university is to take an exam, and during this time, she called me some times and told me she was sad and felt lonely there. I took 2 days off so I could go there and be with her. Gave her the birthday gift I bough for her, and we spent the 2 days together. She failed her exam and spent the day crying while I comforted her. We were together one more time when I went to her hometown to be with her. 

3 weeks later, I wanted to be with her on our 5 month relationship birthday and we planned that I would go to her hometown to be with her. 3 days later, on a friday, I called her to confirm our plans and she told me that in the meanwhile, she had planned to go somewhere with her friends on the same sunday that we had planned to be together. I told her that we had plans on that day, and after some conversation, she broke up with me on the phone. I was really mad because I felt that I treated her well and even though we could be together in two days, she had the guts to break up with my over the phone.

She was going to study abroad on the semester after the summer (first semester), and since she was afraid that she would feel lonely, while we dated, I promised her I would call her every week, even if we broke up. I promised this because I never thought she would break up with me over a phone call, and when she called me some time later, I told her to free me from my promise (because I always fulfill my promises) but she didn't want it, and we agreed we would talk once or twice a month.

====================================================================================

When the second semester started, my ex came back, and we were on friendly terms.

There was an afternoon when we were at the bar with some of our friends, and she (20 at the time) asked if I (21 at the time) wanted to have sex with her. I told her yes, and I asked her if she wanted to be fwbs with me, since I didn't want to be in a relationship. She told me she didn't want to be in a relationship either, and we agreed. We had a fwb (on and off) for 4 months.

I realize now that I wanted to be her fwb because, even though I didn't want to be in a relationship with someone that hurt me like she did, and wanted to move on and be with other girls, deep down, i still liked her and I knew that if she had regular sex with me, she wouldn't feel the need to be with somebody else. I did this because I knew that if I saw her or knew she made out with someone else, that would destroy me.

We stated some fwb rules such as: This is going to be a secret; If any of us gets a bf/gf we would break things off; If any of us starts to develop feelings for the other, we would break things off; If any of us made out with someone and the other saw, we could not go interrupt; we would not spend the night together after having sex; we would not have dates with each other; etc; she even said she wanted to know when I had sex with someone, even though i told her I didn't want to know that.

I realize now that this was a bad idea and I should not have asked her to be my fwb.

Some time later, I was throwing a house party and I told her there was a possibility that a girl I was interested could be at the party. Just to give her a heads up like she asked me to. She started to cry and then, I felt like really bad and like an idiot for being naive enough to believe that she didn't have some feelings for me. I comforted her while she cried and then I broke things up.

Some days later she asked me to talk to her. We talked and we ended up having sex, and carried on our fwb situation. I know that this was a bad idea, but I still wanted to be with her, but I didnt' want to be her bf. And that was what I told her. I told her that we would never be in a relationship again, but she told me that at least she wanted to spend her last semester with me. I was always honest about my intentions. There was nothing she could do or say that would make me want to be her bf.

Some time later, she said that, since me or her didn't spend the night after sex, she felt used, so we broke that rule. We also went on some dates, so we broke another rule. She started to tell me she loved me, she would cry and tell me that I didn't want to be her bf because she hurt me and I didn't trust her (that was true, but I didn't confirm it), and that I wanted to keep it a secret and didn't want to be close to her when we were in a group setting because I didn't want my friends to think I was her puppy, since she hurt me in the past (that was also true, but I didn't confirm it either).

In that semester she cried a lot, about a lot of things, but even though sometimes by the end of our fwb arrangement I was not as interested in her problems as I was in the beginning, I always listened to her. Again, when we slept together i would spoon her or caress her hair until she fell asleep and only then I would try to fall asleep.

Every time we had sex, or at least most of the times, I would tell her she was really pretty (because she was), that i loved her body (because I did), that she always smelled good and that her skin was really soft (because it was true and I wanted her to feel good). My love language is ""touch"" so sex, hugging and spooning are the only ways that I'm comfortable showing I like and care for people.

She also complained that sometimes, we were really hitting it off, and out of nowhere, I would pull back from our friendship, and become cold towards her. I did this because sometimes, I felt bad for being with someone that didn't treat me well while we dated (e.g. she kissed my friend while we dated, broke up with me over the phone, lied to me, etc), and I would just try to keep the sexual part of our fwb alive and not have a true friendship with her.

I felt bad for her sometimes and I broke things up with her another 2 times (3 in total), but we always ended up together.

Some time later I found out that, on the truth or dare night, she had kissed another friend of mine. She swore to me that she had only kissed \*, so I felt betrayed. I kept pulling back and tried to only have a sexual relationship for some days but ended up breaking things off for the third time. I couldn't be away from her and eventually, I started to spend more time with her again, and there were even times where we spent the night together whatching movies and tv shows without having sex. But still, I couldn't forgive her enough to be my gf.

I thought she knew that I liked her and cared for her (even though I didn't want a relationship with her) because, she told me at least once that, when we slept together and I was sleeping and she was awake, I would hug her and kiss her. There was even one time when a friend of my ex gf was too drunk, so I took her home, and this friend told me on the way to her house that my ex had told her that the sex between us was good because we liked eachother.

On her last day in the city our university is located, she called me to tell me she wanted to spend her last day in the city with me, so we had had sex for the last time. We talked two more times during the summer and I thought the things were good between us. She even asked me when I was going to be in our University city again.

This was 2 years ago.

Last week, a friend of mine told me she said that I emotionally abused her, and that I made her sign a contract.

I talked to him and his gf, that are good friends of mine and my ex, and told the whole story between us (even more detailed that the one I'm writing to you guys) and one day later I called her, so we could get closure.

She told me that I didn't make her feel good enough:

1. that I told her she wasn't interesting,
2. that I talked about other girls in front of her,
3. that I didn't make her feel pretty,
4. that I did not make her feel heard and understood, and that sometimes she would talk and I wouldn't respond.
5. and that I had left her with some emotional scars.

&amp;#x200B;

What I remeber happening and what I felt:

1. I did feel that she had interests that didn't interest me even a little, and that I thought were basic, but I don't remember ever telling her that because I'm not usually an Idiot to the people I care about. I am only 70% percente sure I never told her this, because I have told other girls this, but those were girls I didn't care about.
2. She told me about a girl that I had a crush on before we started dating, and that I talked a lot about her legs. That girl is tall (maybe 5'8 or 5'9) so the only things I can think of about her legs were the fact that they were long and skinny and she didn't have a butt. My ex gf legs were actually better, she was hotter and prettier that this girl she mentioned. The only thing I remember talking that include that girl's legs are the fact that that girl walked with confidence. I also don't think I talked about other girls in front of my ex because I remember the fact that, when I mentioned to my ex that I was throwing a party and there could be a girl I was interested in, she started to cry and I felt really bad. Maybe I could have said that some girl was pretty, but if I did, I didn't said just to make her feel bad.
3. I remember well that when we had sex I told her several times that she was pretty and that I loved her body. So I'm 100% sure that this didn't happen.
4. Since she complained and cried so often, and since listening to people's problems isn't my favorite thing to do, by the end I may have showed little interest in her problems, and sometimes I thought that she did create the situations she complained about. But, even if I was fed up with her complaining, I always listened to her and never said that I didn't want to listen to her problems. It's not because I'm not saying anything that I'm not listening.
5. that is not really up to me to decide.

The contract she was talking about was the the the fwb rules we discussed. Me and her wrote the the rules, and I sent her a picture of it. She said she signed it, but I don't remember if it is true or not. She was dealing at the time with some mental health issues, and she said I took advantage of it and set some rules so I could benefit from the ""contract"", even though I broke things up 3 times and she was the one that would come to me to get back together.

I know this is a really long post, but I wanted to explain the situation well, both sides of it so you guys could give me a honest opinion.

I can understand that she felt like she was not good enough, because, as I said before, there was nothing she could do or say that would make me want to be in a relationship with her again and sometimes I pulled back from our friendship, but I was always honest with her, when I saw that she was getting too close and suffering from it, I would break things up, I just wasn't strong enough to keep it that way; Even though I was still hurt from our relationship, I didn't want to play with her feelings.

Before me, she had a boyfriend that cheated on her, lied about it, and when they broke up, talked badly about her to his friends. She also had a boyfriend that cheated on her and hit her. I never did those things.

When I called her to get closure, she told me I was the worst boyfriend she ever had. I realize that our fwb relationship wasn't healthy, that it was a huge mistake, that even though we liked each other, we hurted each other as well, but I never thought that she thought that of me.

I don't think she is lying. I really think she believes what she is saying, that she felt that way when we were fwb, and maybe she replayed those scenarios so many times in her head that she now thinks I really did say those things to her. Maybe I did and don't remember. But when I think about the time we spent together as fwb, I don't remember that. I remeber us being together, and even though she cried and complained about life a lot, I was there for her.

I want you guys to give me your opinion and tell me if I really emotionally abused her, because, honestly, I don't know what to think. Does this count as emotional abuse?

TL;DR: Me and my ex had a fwb relationship after we ended up our romantic relationship. I didn't want to be her bf.

I also didn’t find her on social media until today and say on her timeline that she started a relationship in May 2016. However, I didn’t see any likes on her photos (which she just uploaded on Saturday), and when I clicked on her “about”, it didn’t say anything about a relationship with ANYONE. One of her photos is a group gathering at Disneyland at night but I can’t see her or any possible boyfriend or friends or family members in it.

Like many others, I (22F) have had a rocky history with dating and have some trust issues when it comes to guys treating me like an option or ghosting. 

A month ago I started talking to a great new guy who has acted more interested in me than pretty much anyone before him. He texts me every day and asks to call a few times a week. We have a lot in common and it’s great.

But things have gotten to a point where I’m starting to feel anxious. I really like this guy but since we live in different healthcare “regions,” covid restrictions state that we can’t meet in person until sometime in June-July most likely. A part of me just wants to cut him off because it makes me anxious I won’t be able to meet him for so long and I’m scared he will just find someone whose in his region between now and then and ghost me.

So I'm (24M) and I'm having strong feelings for a person at work (20F). We both are in college and work at our university's dining hall. She's really nice and kind, and I've wanted to get to know her more outside of work and eventually ask her out, but there are a few things that are a bit complicated and stopping me from doing so. And I want to preface that the things that are complicated are things that have to deal with myself, nothing that has to deal with her.

First thing is that I don't ever want to make someone uncomfortable at work and this is something that could do that, I feel like it's risky to try to get involved with a coworker. The second thing is that I'm extremely introverted, nervous and shy, has to do with my anxiety, so talking to her and just trying to get to know her more has been a bit of a struggle because I have to fight through my anxiety which is stopping me from doing so, but when I do talk to her it's great, and it's a highlight of my nights at work. I just really like talking to her, but I know I need to do more in order to get to the phase of asking her out. 

Another thing is that I know that there's someone else at work who is interested in her and last night I saw the two of them talking more and hanging out together at break. Now I know this doesn't mean anything definitively, honestly he's doing what I'm doing but better, and I can't tell if she's interested in him like that. But because I know his intentions it does make me apprehensive towards letting my feelings be known. It's weird too for me because the guy came to me asking for advice on how to talk to her without him knowing that I like her, he still doesn't know. While I didn't know 100% that it was her he was asking about, I could piece it together from context. I still gave him advice, because the guy's nice and it sounded like he needed it, and apparently I like making things complicated for myself.

The last thing, honestly is that I'm just afraid that she might not feel the same way. Usually I can tell when someone doesn't like me in that way, but with her, I'm on the fence. I know that she likes me as a person to work with and talk to, but idk if she likes me like how I like her. I'm still trying to gauge that. Sometime I do think that she could like me, other times I feel less inclined to believe so. Maybe that's just my self-esteem, which I admit is low. That's why I've at the very least have wanted to ask her to hang out outside of work, that would help a lot.

The reason I'm struggling so much with this is because I don't fall for people easily. There has really only been one other person besides her that's made me have these intense emotions. It takes a lot for me to want to pursue someone romantically not because I'm picky or anything like that but just because there has to something special, in my eyes, to that person to make me not just like them, but be interested in a relationship with them. That's why I'm so conflicted here. I like her, I like her a lot. I think about her more with every passing day, and when I think about her I can't help but smile. I'm having dreams just about being around her more, and talking with her, trying to get to know her more, just as a friend, has been really rewarding. She's beautiful. I just don't want to make things awkward, I don't want to lose the opportunity of having a friendship with this person, or you know, maybe something more. But I also can't deny my feelings anymore. Surpassing the feeling that I could make things awkward, is the feeling that if I don't tell her how I feel then I'm fucking up. It's the whole reason why I'm making this post. I know I'm overthinking a lot of this and I may be too caught up in this already, but this is kinda uncharted territory for me, so any advice would help.

So I’m currently having an issue with a guy (26M) I barely started technically dating this past Friday. I say technically because we’d been texting since the end of February. The reason it took us a while to meet up was because the first couple of times he tried to set us up on dates I had to reschedule then we were both busy for like one week then he cancelled a couple of dates we’d had set up after that. We also already had an argument in between all this because we didn’t talk for a week because one of the times he’d had to cancel was because he was feeling sick and had to go get COVID tested. 

He said he’d let me know once he got his results back but a week went by and he never did. I never replied to that text though. I ended up reaching out to him at the end of that week and asked him if he ever planned on actually hanging out because if not I wanted to know just so I could move on. He claimed he’d “left the ball in my court” and assumed I’d lost interest but I don’t understand how that makes any sense. After some clarification he did admit it was his fault but was glad I reached out again. 

We then planned a date to hang again and this time we actually did it. We met at a bar and were there for like 4-5 hours and had a good time IMO. He opened up about personal stuff like his substance abuse issues, he’s been clean for a few years now. And his sexuality, he’s bi (I am too) but he’s only out to a few people including his mom. We have so much in common and I felt like we really connected. I let him know once I got home cuz I drove myself to the bar, and I also dropped him off at home afterwards because I wanted to since he took public transportation to come meet me. The whole way home he was super touchy feely and I was enjoying the affection. 

He let me know he did really like me and wanted to date just me and I told him I felt the same. He asked if I wanted to hang out again Tuesday i.e. yesterday and I said yes. We went to the movies and everything was going smoothly. He held my hand the whole time and was being super affectionate again and trying to cuddle me as best he could cuz the theater I chose has recliner seats. Towards the end of the movie we were talking and he asked if I wanted him to take me out to dinner on my birthday because it’s a couple of days away. 

He’d kinda mentioned it at the end of the first date as well but I didn’t think he was being serious that time or this time but this time I politely declined, or so I’d thought, but I think I made the mistake of mentioning that I thought him taking me out for a birthday dinner for our 3rd date was him moving kinda fast for me. I didn’t get to elaborate but I was just trying to say I didn’t feel comfortable with him spending money on me like that even though he’d already paid for the first couple of dates. 

His mood did change a little after that but I didn’t notice until after the movie was over and I asked what he’d wanted to do and he said he thought I was gonna go home and sleep because I’d seemed tired throughout the movie because I kept yawning which is true. But I still wanted to hang out with him so I asked if he’d be ok with driving around the city so we could find something to do before the night ended. He said yeah but I could tell something was off. I told him I needed to get gas first and asked if he could just pump my gas for me cuz I didn’t wanna get out of the car. 

He said ok but our drive to the gas station was quiet. In the middle of him pumping my gas he told me was gonna go home. I said ok but when he was done pumping my gas he opened my car door to get his phone and leave. When he did that I told him to stop bullshitting me and tell me what was wrong cuz I knew something was off. At first he just said he was in his own head and I asked about what and then he started trying to say about how if I thought we were moving too fast that he could take it slower or something but I didn’t connect the dots to what I’d said earlier about my birthday until I was telling this story to another friend.

I thought he was talking about physical stuff cuz we haven’t slept together yet and I’d told him I wanted to wait. I did get a little pissy with him in my approach cuz I was just super confused cuz he was just being super sweet. I asked him if he wanted to be done and I don’t know what else but said that if that was the case then I didn’t care which I think upset him or something because he then stormed off and said “Whatever I’ll text you later, maybe” and I was just left confused as all fuck. He did mention previously one time when we were texting that he was bad at communicating but I didn’t think he meant like this. 

I’m just so frustrated because I don’t really open myself up to people and I already have feelings for him and thought we were doing good. I’m gonna wait to see if he messages me on my birthday but even if he doesn’t I think I’m still gonna reach out soon and apologize for being insensitive. I feel like this was all my fault and I don’t know what to say. I know people come and go but I really don’t want to lose him. Even reaching out that one time he went silent on me took a lot cuz I have a lot of pride when it comes to shit like that. Please someone offer some insight.

It just blows my mind that with all the drugs the pharmaceutical companies release no one has made a pill to make men whiter. Personally I don't care what color my skin is. It makes no difference to me. If making it whiter would get me more dates I would happily do it. I don't consider my skin color my identity either way so it would be no different than hair dye to me. But there are no real safe or effective methods for doing that.

I feel like this would improve the dating lives of so many men. Or is it possible that it wouldn't help because then instead of wanting a guy who is 6' and white, if there are more white men, women would want a guy who is 6'2"" and white instead? ie. The requirements will just go up in other areas?

He's quite work orientated, so communication can be a bit dry based on work and just life but definately after about a month of talking he's made more of an effort with the texting front and in the last 2 months or so our phone calls are more frequent. Anyhow, when we do talk, it's lovely, really connect on an intellectual level which I love. 

We both have a lot of commonalities, working towards the same kind of goals etc. So it's all good in that sense (so far). At the moment it's a LDR so we don't get to spend as much time together, i find it hard because my love language is quality time and physical touch so I find it tough. I've told him and since this chat his communication has improved. 

At the moment my biggest worry is that he isn't flirty as such and sometimes I feel like this is just really platonic (although we have talked about having children together). He's hinted at his ""cheeky side"" and I made a sorry joke once which he didn't even realize. I get the feeling he's quite inexperienced/possibly shy talking about sex/being flirty etc. I tried to reassure by saying ""we all have needs"", and that I want to know more about him and all his sides. 

I don't want to rush any conversations about sex and make him uncomfortable or pressure him. However, I am eager to ascertain our sexual compatibility especially with how long we've talked I'm worried that when it comes to the down and dirty we could be poles apart. I don't really know how to broach this really. In an ideal world I would imagine there would be some flirting and we feel attracted, and that kind of paves the way but I'm not sure how to approach this really.

We have a second date coming up and I am contemplating being flirty with him or something to try and open the door so to speak. I'm just not sure how to go about this really.
