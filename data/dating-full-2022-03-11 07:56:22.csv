Especially in the last year I've been actively dating and looking for a partner. (In the other years I did have dates but I wouldn't say I was actively seeking).

Anyways, there is a pattern that keeps repeating itself (among the guys I end up liking): first date goes amazingly well, second date most of the times something is off.
Then some reach a higher number of dates, some stop there, anyways it is pretty much always the other person that either ghosts me or somehow makes me understand they are not interested anymore.
Never me
And that fu*king hurts my ego so much.
I mean I absolutely get it that you're not everyone's person, but nobody's?

I have been analysing myself for years now, trying to understand wtf I'm doing wrong, but I can't seem to reach any useful conclusion

I have once even asked a boy friend of mine who's friendship with me actually started exactly on that pattern. But all he told me was ""nothing at all is wrong with you, it just didn't click""
Don't really know to what extent I should believe that.
I feel like all the people close to me are too scared of hurting me and nobody says what they actually think.

Please correct me if you think I'm wrong:
I feel like if the problem was physical appearance first dates wouldn't go so well or maybe even not exist at all

I know you have zero info about me and therefore cannot really help me out here
I just needed to get this off my chest, and who knows, maybe some of you still have good insights

We quickly became good friends after sharing common interests/life goals/mutual attractuon/etc. 

I'm someone who is strongly attracted to compatible personality traits/interests and with good vibes as well as personality. I might have gotten a 24% match rate when I was on tinder (straight male) but the options I was given didn't really vibe with me that much as I talked to them. Hence I deleted the app. 

FYI, I'm 6'2, white-passing mixed brown/white guy with light skin, light brown hair. I have what I'd consider to be an average body but with some shape since I'm pretty athletic. She's hapa. 

While first talking to her, she came off as quite strong. She saw my face (I saw hers) and she constantly complimented my appearance. She did tell me she's into fit guys who take care of their appearance and didn't want either of us to let ourselves go. She's pretty slim. 

She lives 2 hours away from me by road but I decided I would give her a chance as she was also a highly educated, smart and pretty type with a seemingly good personality. I rarely find such women on apps and she seemed the whole package. 

When we'd talk, she'd try to direct the convo towards dating, our mutual hobbies, our future goals/dreams, her life with me involved and the things we'd do together. I totally gave into that.

She arranged a date and I had it last month with her in a pub. It went well. She displayed signs of strong interest - hair twirling, intense eye contact, blushing, flirting, etc.

She'd even talk about her dates she had off hinge and told me she'd usually only go on dates with people with severe trauma/substance issues because that's who she attracted on the app mostly. She said she wanted someone with a clean lifestyle. 

I live a very clean lifestyle. When we spoke she also tried to tailor her preferences so it matched me as a person. 

She considers herself a bad texter and would text longish paragraphs every 24-48 hours. Of course I'd reciprocate. 

We continued to talk about similar things for the next month. I had a facetime call with her this weekend and all of a sudden this week she dropped off in communication. I did the unthinkable and left 25 missed calls (oops) and a couple of follow up texts on her device as she'd often want to talk to me on the phone during the midweek. But she snapped at me after sending a message and I quickly apologised. I'm hoping for closure here because I've admitted to my mistakes.

She even invited me out for another date during that call over in my town! What on earth is going on? 

She still has me on all her social media and hasn't blocked me anywhere but doesn't even talk to me anymore. Just stalks my social media.

She seems to have a fearful avoidant attachment style. Her only relationship lasted 3 months.

Idk from the moment I met her I felt something was off about her. The way she walked the way she talked the way she looked she was like a female version of me and something kept pulling me to her and eventually we fell in love.

Unfortunately it was our first love and we were immature and inexperienced and the relationship that started with huge fire/passion ended after two years. 

I went through the classical stages of break up of being extremely depressed - feeling you wont connect with someone like her again working on yourself and going out realizing there are good people out there and eventually forgetting about her.

I'm happy with myself and my time is filled with things that I like to do but I still miss that feeling of love. I started putting myself out there more and meeting new people for the sake of making friends and maybe I will find someone but Idk it just doesn't happen.

I just don't develop crushes or interests anymore and idk why maybe its part of getting older? Maybe only teenages are able to feel strong passion/desire? Im not sure.

Like I meet I see a pretty girl with 1-2 common interests between us on social media but I still don't develop a desire to chase her and even if I decided to chase her I don't think 1-2 common interests will be enough to make her attracted to me and probably she will think I'm just interested in her looks idk.

I don't compare anyone to my ex and I don't think about her anymore and I think everyone is unique/beautiful in their own ways but that got me thinking how did the attraction build between us then ? And when I look back there were so many common interests between us like our humor - taste of music - quotes - movies - books - so many things.

Idk how does dating work and I want your advice :
Should I pursue a girl even if I'm not into her/crushing just because shes pretty and we have few common interests ? Or should I wait for someone that clicks with me on deep level ?

Also one last thing I knew second love will be more happy and beautiful because you both know what you want and you are a better person but I'm wondering does it burn with passion as much as your first love?

At the same time, we understand each other so well and we have a good chemistry which is super important to me.

However, I’m realising that I will probably never be attracted to him physically so it’s better to try and be friends.

 I wanted to go clubbing with a lesbian friend of mine.
She wasn't into the idea at first, but quickly changed her mind (the third time we did something together)

● She followed me the entire time in the club around
- I'd say that's normal, because she wasn't in a club for the last three years + is an introvert

● She told me all about her kinks and stuff she is into + wanted to know in what I'm interested in + if not the same stuff, what's the reason behind that
- Can be seen as just being interested in the person, but talking about that stuff the first time you actually do something? (She didn't consume any alcohol that evening)

● After clubbing and heading back home (40 min drive); we were five minutes away from her place, so I asked her if she wants to talk more or head home (she was talking like a waterfall)
""Yeah, I'd like that""
""Mine or your place?""
""Your place, Schusta""
- Again, confusing to me. Seems like platonic interested, but going to a guys place ar 3 am?

● We were at my place, the first thing after we set down from her was ""So... you are not into hookups?""
I was literally dying and didn't know how to react, because I was sleep deprived.
- Can be a ""normal"" topic + she told me several times she is gay, but again. Situation and time make it really tricky for me to evaluate what I should think.

● around 5 am in the morning:
""XY, I am dead, I can't think straight anymore. I'm gonna head to bed. You sleep here or want me to drive you home?""
""I mean,  rather sleep at my place, but your place is fine aswell.""
I drove her home, since that she has been texting me nearly every day.
- Obviously that was the last strike. I can't tell if she is a weirdo, trying to look if I'm platonic and not romantically interested in her or she literally wanted my dick.

I don't know, help or something.

He doesn’t really have a consistent schedule, but whenever I did see him, it was always around the same time. The first time we talked was when I had dyed my hair and he came up to tell me that it looks pretty (aw). After that we never interacted despite seeing each other UNTIL a few weeks pass and I ask if he’s using a machine which then leads to him complimenting me again and telling me that “he never got my name.” We small talked for a bit and went back to our own workouts. 

The next day, he was there again. He didn’t come up to me the entire workout and so, on his way out, I decided to take initiative and wave to him. He came over, small chatted, asked me if I had a minute,  and finally asked me out on a date. Unfortunately, literally right before this I had just found out that an old friend of mine passed. I wasn’t sure how to cope (and still don’t really know how in all honesty) and was overwhelmed. I didn’t expect him to ask me out that day and just wanted to say hi to initiate small talk as usual. I told him “I’ve been here for about 2 hours now, ask me next time?” in a reassuring and optimistic tone.

He came again the next day, but didn’t come up to me. We didn’t interact at all. And ever since then, it’s been over a week and he hasn’t shown face. As mentioned earlier, he was never consistent in his gym schedule and actually had a week before when he didn’t come at all. 

Did he change his gym time / location because of this? Did I ruin my chances? I’m scared he got embarrassed or felt like he read the situation wrong and decided to go at another time.

I (24M) was recently seeing this girl (25) whom I met on tinder.  The first couple of dates went really well and on the 3rd time seeing her she let me stay the night and we had some saucy relations.  She's telling me what a great person i am and how she likes me and she cant stop thinking about me.  Everything was going well and when i asked her to hangout one weekend she said she had plans with friends. Okay, im cool with that people need to have their own lives.  
 Come the night she's hanging with her friends, she makes an instagram post of her with another guy with a lovey dovey quote underneath. Totally destroyed me as i was given no indication of that happening. 

She talked to me the next day saying she didn't see anything else romantic between us. We had a good conversation as adults. I told her i thought she used me like a free trial and led me on a bit. She agreed and said i did nothing wrong and that she had been honest with me about her feelings, but essentially she met this guy and he swept her off her feet. 
She tried to friendzone me but i basically told her that was going to be on her because im not going to be friends with someone who i just developed feelings for. 

Which like im not going to try to change her mind i want to be where im wanted but my questions really are:


At what point is it not okay for her to talk to someone else? I understand its tinder and thats implied, but i feel like when you go on multiple dates, have sex, and ""cant stop thinking"" about said person, she couldve at least given me a heads up.

And

Am i wrong to think that i was done dirty here?




Thanks in advance for the replies. This one just fucked me up and idk how someone can say the things she said to me then turn around and get a boyfriend posting ""i love you"" to each other a week later.

We're both 27

Known each other for 27 years and friends for 4 and more for 1 year. 

Everytime we met, the room vanished and nothing but us remained.  Both very well educated and family friends with similar background. 

I saw the red flags but it didn't seem like it.  And I have flaws too which he accepted without me asking

If two people were in sync,  it's be us. And he told me this  too.

We went on a holiday and had sex.  I thought everything was perfect.  He couldn't stop gushing about it.  

But then everything changed. He didn't ghost me but trailed away...reasons to talk became excuses not to

I tried asking as polite as possible but he said nothing was wrong.  I didn't know what more.  I don't really like the idea of jurry and judge or playing prosecutor.. so I didn't.  Besides he could tell by my facial expression if I'm feeling off so,  he definitely knows what he is doing. 

So I let myself out.  Haven't talked but it still feels like he ghosted me and left me.

All for sex? The questions keeps coming back to me. Leverage friendship amd the connection we had for sex? And I know a part of him cared about me. He could have told me and I would have ended it because I respect honesty.  He knows,  I told him so.  

After my previous heartbreak,  I was careful to give myself time and put in energy.  

Now I don't know who to trust. How to trust anyone. I feel like a part of me is broken.  Tried therapy and everything.. all the getting better routine.  I haven't been able to trust anyone.  

I flinch when someone comes close to me now.  I want to cry and runaway when someone wants to talk to me.  I feel horrible every second.  

I pretend to be fine.  I look fine. Dress up.  But the second I pause, I feel like I'm crashing down.

I love to read up on reddit as I'm sure alot of you do on how other peoples experiences with dating go, whether it be good or bad I enjoy reading about it learning also maybe some things to do or not to do when I begin dating, red flags to look out for.

What I've come across most of the time is a Women explaining a date she went on or someone she is seeing, the guy generally being very disconnected or vague but doing some very simple things too 'Woo' them, they have sex very early on and then the guy loses interest or is only into that side of things and doesnt want anything deep or meaningful.

Am I wrong here but it seems like 99% of guys now just want to have a sex partner but not an actual beautiful relationship when you can do all the deemed 'Traditional' things in a relationship such as:
- Going out on dates at restaurants
- Nice long walks around a beautiful lake or beach
- Nights in with each other just cuddling and enjoying each others company maybe watching a movie or TV show that DOESNT lead to Sex afterwards.
- Just having someone at home you look forward to seeing when you finish work
- Having such a great connection you feel comfortable yo maybe introduce them to your family 

These things all seem lost in 2022 and It makes me feel a little sad because it seems like alot of women are searching for this but never seem to find the right guy to share it with, makes me wonder why I have never found a women I click with to share these experiences with.

It's sad to know that there are alot of women out there that are not getting their Feelings, Needs or Desires Filled because the vast majority or Men do not want this it seems. I really hope that everyone no matter who you are can find someone special you want to spend your time with to do all the fun things with your partner not just 'Sex' because truth be told the other side of the relationship is sometime I'm personally looking forward to far more.

Things are going good. 

On the women's day, she asked me if I could go to a restrobar with herself and her friends, as you know, they provided free domestic liquor for women that day. I accepted the invite and went with them.

I actually planned and wanted to have a relationship talk with her on our next date but since she called me unexpectedly and also her friends were there I wasn't hoping to have the relationship talk that day.

As both of us became a little tipsy, we started making out and were a little physical. Her friends were constantly teasing us and were very nice to me. I already knew one of her friend.

We were in the smoking room and her friends left us alone giving us some very much needed privacy. Only the 2 of us were there in the smoking room at that point. She suddenly asked me ""What do you think about me?"". I said, ""I will tell you but will you even remember what I say?"" She said she will remember and wanted me to answer.

I told her that I like her, for which she wanted to know if I am looking for something casual or serious. Actually, the thing is I am not sure of it myself. I haven't dated anyone for 3 years before meeting her and I wasn't even looking for anyone to date. I was never so tongue tied before that. I didn't give her a proper answer. I said something so diplomatic and vague. She didn't accept that for an answer. And when I asked the same question back to her, she was like ""I won't answer as I asked you first and you still haven't given me a clear response"". 

Then, she left for the powder room. Still I was in a clearly confused state. Her friends came to me, they were shooting questions at me like: 1. Do you like her? I said yes, I do like her. 2. Do you want to just hook up? I said No, i don't just want to hook up and be FWB. 3. Why won't you commit to her? For which I literally told them, ""I don't have an answer yet"". 

Her close friend told me, My date like me and she is just thinking that about how things will pan out between us in the future. Asked me to continue doing what we are doing without taking any pressure and the both of us will eventually get to the point where we will know what to do. She also told me, that she trust me to be a nice person and will be happy to see us getting together in life (she wants us to eventually marry), which I felt was a nice thing to say. She then told me to talk with my date about this again when we both are sober, which I am planning to do tomorrow. We have planned a date for tomorrow. 

Yet, I am confused because I don't know how I feel myself. Since the talk is already out, I cannot just ignore and not talk about it. I do like her but not yet to the point where I would like to marry her. 

Now that I know both of are attracted to eachother on the same level and we understand eachother's thought process to a point where talking is just putting it out there. But still the thought of doing it after her friends sit down with me kinda makes me scared. 

Any opinion / thoughts / advice on this?

We quickly became good friends after sharing common interests/life goals/mutual attractuon/etc. 

I'm someone who is strongly attracted to compatible personality traits/interests and with good vibes as well as personality. I might have gotten a 24% match rate when I was on tinder (straight male) but the options I was given didn't really vibe with me that much as I talked to them. Hence I deleted the app. 

FYI, I'm 6'2, white-passing mixed brown/white (hispanic/english/Iranian) guy with light skin, light brown hair. I have what I'd consider to be an average body but with some shape since I'm pretty athletic. She's hapa. I've got a masters in maths and work for a good set of money in the geography and earth sciences field. She has a bachelor's in psychology but doesn't work in psychology - instead she went to do an apprenticeship in a completely unrelated field but is working for a good sum. 

While first talking to her, she came off as quite strong. She saw my face (I saw hers) and she constantly complimented my appearance. She did tell me she's into fit guys who take care of their appearance and didn't want either of us to let ourselves go. She's pretty slim. 

She lives 2 hours away from me by road but I decided I would give her a chance as she was also a highly educated, smart and pretty type with a seemingly good personality. I rarely find such women on apps and she seemed the whole package. 

When we'd talk, she'd try to direct the convo towards dating, our mutual hobbies, our future goals/dreams, her life with me involved and the things we'd do together, including holidays we'd go on, and that she'd move out to an overseas country I'd move to (e.g. The United States, most of my Hispanic mother's family live there now) since I'm not 100% interested in remaining here to settle down. Most of my family live overseas! I totally gave into what she said...... 

She arranged a date and I had it last month with her in a pub. It went well. She displayed signs of strong interest - hair twirling, intense eye contact, blushing, flirting, etc. Gave heavy vibes of wanting a relationship. 

She'd even talk about her dates she had off hinge and told me she'd usually only go on dates with people with severe trauma/substance issues because that's who she attracted on the app mostly. She said she wanted someone with a clean lifestyle and uninstalled the app as soon as she found me. 

I live a very clean lifestyle. When we spoke she also tried to tailor her preferences so it matched me as a person. 

She considers herself a bad texter and would text longish paragraphs every 24-48 hours. Of course I'd reciprocate. 

We continued to talk about similar things for the next month and she upped the flirting. I had a facetime call with her this weekend and all of a sudden this week she dropped off in communication. I did the unthinkable and left 25 missed calls (oops) and a couple of follow up texts on her device as she'd often want to talk to me on the phone during the midweek. But she snapped at me after sending a message and I quickly apologised. I'm hoping for closure here because I've admitted to my mistakes.

She even invited me out for another date during that call over in my town! What on earth is going on? 

She still has me on all her social media and hasn't blocked me anywhere but doesn't even talk to me anymore. Just stalks my social media.

She seems to have a fearful avoidant attachment style. Her only relationship lasted 3 months.

I went on dates with guys I met on dating apps, but nothing made it past the 4th date at most. I was so miserable during that time. I know I should be happy whether I’m single or not, but I can’t imagine spending the rest of my life without a S/O and remaining happy. 

I met my bf on tinder, and I’ve thought for a long time I was going to marry this guy eventually. We live together as well. But in the last month, everything has changed. I can hardly function and be an adult, and I’m turning 27 this year. Im struggling financially and I barely do chores around the apartment. I have been very unstable these past 8 months due to a horrible and borderline traumatic experience at my last job. And at my current job, the first meeting my coworkers and I had with our boss, he accused me of not working the past few days (I was working on training for my employer, I’m a contractor for the company I work for) because there weren’t any updates to a shared spreadsheet we’ve been working on from me. I explained the work I’ve been doing, and mentioned the fact that I had reached out to 50 suppliers that day concerning products we sell. He asked me to share my screen on the projector in the meeting and pull up my sent box from my email. I scrolled down slowly showing all the emails I sent, and he said it looked like 20 emails to him. Luckily my other coworkers chimed in and said it was at least 40. He then asked me to pull up my employer’s training material to verify I’ve been working On it. I politely declined, as I believed that was a policy to not share my employer’s training material to someone outside of the company. He didn’t say anything. Since then it’s been fine, but I will never forget that.

Anyways, I also worked a parttime job in retail to make ends meet. I owe $1400 every month to student loans/rent/bills alone. However, my bf has paid off his student loans already, as he went to a much smaller school. He makes $5/hour more than me, and works from home since Covid happened. I am required to go into the office 3 days a week, pay for parking, pay off 2 loans for my car, and pay for gas. Since he does not have his license or a car, he states he does not have to pay for any of this because I use my car more often than him carpooling with me. However, he expects me to pay rent very close to 50/50. He covers internet, but he decided to choose the fastest internet our provider offered, so it’s much more expensive. 

I barely make ends meet as it is, and getting a second job had run me down completely. I worked 8 hours on Saturdays, and 4 hours 2-3 evenings during the business week. The managers at my parttime job were awful, I was made to train someone in without being asked. I was unable to take 15’s, and was yelled at by a manager multiple times, including when a coworker of mine openly accused me of lying to her and making up rules for her to follow (a lie) and I stood up for myself. I recently quit, and my last paycheck is not going through. I am likely opening a wage claim through my state’s dept of labor. It’s been so stressful and my bf has criticized me for being unable to complete chores around the apartment when I am so, so tired all the time. I’m lucky if I got to see him during that time, as he would go to concerts or hang out with friends most nights I would have the evening off coincidentally.

His family is very, very rude. The first year and a half of dating we had to see his parents once a week, which is very uncommon for me. And for the past 2 years we play the same game, every time. Because I get tired from having two jobs at around 10 PM, his dad gets upset and says “well, (my name) is getting tired again, you guys better head home.” There’s been multiple occasions when his dad requests my BF stays behind and I drive myself home to sleep. He also tells his wife to shut up constantly, and yells at her when she gets tipsy because she acts a bit goofy. It’s so uncomfortable and unhealthy, his sister and parents are constantly arguing and shouting everytime we visit. I mentioned this to my bf and he got very upset, accusing me of criticizing his family. In addition, his best friend has publicly humiliated me at a party recently. Again, I can’t talk about it because he’s his best friend.

I’m losing it. I’m trying to get a psychologist for help, but the last 2 I’ve had don’t know what to do. One even asked how they can help me, which I feel is her job to know? If I knew what help I needed I’d do it myself. It’s hard getting new psychologists nowadays too, everywhere is booked for months. 

Last night was the last straw for me. When we discussed finances and how to split them so I don’t lose all my money, he said whenever we go out he’d cover me. He doesn’t want me to move out. He invited me to dinner downtown with his friends before a concert, and didn’t acknowledge me much at all. He didn’t listen half the time I talked to him. when the checks came he said “We have to go, concert is starting soon. I’ll have to venmo you later.” And they left while I waited for the waitress to pick up my check. After I paid for my food, I had to pay for my own parking in a ramp and went home alone. I mean, it’s not a ton of money I had to spend, but he broke our deal. He did not keep up his promise. 

Seems silly to break up over something like that, but I have no energy left to keep this going. It’s all been adding up over time, and every time we talk about my needs from him he interprets it as criticism and scoffs/rolls his eyes. I am so invalidated constantly, he tells me I talk to much and interrupts me when I am complaining about my jobs and how awful they are. I work so hard and he gets to stay home, and 75% of the time watches YouTube or plays games because he doesn’t work unless he’s asked to fix something computer related, which some days never happens. 

I’m exhausted, I’m losing my mind, I can’t do this anymore. I’m considering going in for treatment because I am having mental breakdowns so often nowadays. But I can’t, because I’ll miss work, and I can’t pay my bills if I don’t work. It’s not a possibility at this time.

I love him so much, but I can’t do this anymore. I’m a wreck, I am not having my needs met, and when I ask for them he says i dont have to do that for him, so why does he have to do that for me?

I was so, so miserable dating for 3 years. I felt so hopeless, like I would never find someone I liked but also could put up with my manic and annoying personality. I found someone finally who I love so, so much. Someone I can talk to about anything. At least… I thought I could. He makes me laugh, he doesn’t judge me for my mental health issues. 

I know logically I can’t continue this, it’s not a healthy relationship anymore. I know that. But I’m so scared, I’ve promised myself after trying to make it work with past boyfriends after we’ve broken up that it’s just not possible for it to last, there’s too much pain and bitterness once you’ve broken up once in my experience. After being in an emotional abusive relationship with my first boyfriend in HS, I became so, so depressed for years knowing he didn’t love me anymore. And I don’t want to feel that way ever again. Im scared I will if we break up, I’ll be heartbroken. 

If we break up, I have to move back to my parents and try and make more money. I can try dating, but based on my luck in the past I don’t really have the energy to. It’s so much work, and everytime the date doesn’t lead anywhere my self esteem drops. I know this is all mostly personal issues within myself, and I have to change my mindset if I want to be happy after breaking up. But oh my god, I’m dreading this so much. I want it to work between us so bad, but it’s not getting much better, and idk if it ever will. 

I’m so terrified, I can’t breathe. I’m spending today and this weekend at my parents, but I would not be surprised if we break up by Monday. He told me a few days ago he was considering breaking up too based on the fights we’ve been having, but not seriously. And that crushed me. I’m so scared, idk how I’m going to function. It’s all too much right now.

Long story short - me and my boyfriend talk almost every single day to each other via texts. Since two - three weeks he has been gone to his home town and I visited him this week for 3-4 days coz I was missing him. I never bother him during his work. However it's been a day since he messaged and well the entire day I just kept checking my phone that there will be a message from him but nothing. Now it takes not more than a minute to message back and just to let me know I am caught up. Since we have been going back and forth in this set pattern of messaging any change to it does matter to me considering I am also a person with anxious attachment style trying to break out of it. I dropped him a message now after giving in that ""Does it take a day to reply to a message, and he been that busy? Did I expect a lot from you? If that's the case I won't message you and bother you"" and I have been feeling shitty since I sent that message coz I feel that it is toxic, but tell me is it too much to expect a simple text message? I ended up crying after sending that message to him and decided whatever his response might be I am not going to message him this weekend and hopefully focus on anything else

My friends said to leave her on read and see if she'll text back first, so I did and about an hour later she texted back asking about how my day go. She did say that she wants to hangout after her beach trip when she gets back. My friends are saying have her ask me to see if she'll start putting more effort into it.

So I like her, I really do, and I care about her. She was there for me when I was at my lowest a couple months ago when my dog passed, when I got injured, and has supported my goals on moving up within where I work. I've been there for when she would freak out about school and work, always supporting her and her goals while cheering her on. We really kind of support each other alot. Whenever we see each other at work, if nobody is around, we'll tease each other briefly and when people are around, we keep it professional. She has family who works in the same area has she works and I was told the other day that I will have to start helping in the same area for a couple days of the week for a few weeks.

So the plan was to ask her out as my girlfriend the next time we hangout, problem is, I can't get a good read on her. It feels like she's dodging me, but will always text me and if I leave her on read, she'll text me back first.

I remember when I used to get nervous with girls before and I assume its the same feeling. I used to be a shy guy some time ago. 
She is one of those pretty girls who doesn’t have too much experience with a lot of guys, so I think that’s why she gets nervous.  She also sometimes won’t stop glancing at me at me and sometimes won’t talk to me but stare from afar.

So  not sure if this is the right sub to post but here goes.

Im a 22M, currently single and i ve come up with a fear that i never thought about.
Context: I’m a guy that simply cant be with a girl “just for fun”, when im interested in a girl my main goal is to date her. Because of that i have only liked 5 people which i ended up dating. And i’ve always played the stupid game of not expressing my feelings verbally but instead we get to a point which is “ ok for sure we should kiss right now”.
And since my life has been like this, when i start to get jnterested in the girl I do everything that i can in order to get her ( in a good way). Also all my dates were girls that were on my school/uni so I had always ways make a “move” and didnt have to ask her out or smthg.

But lately i have been talking with this girl that i see in the weekends only and not all of them, which i would love to get to know her better and lately date her but i do not know what would her answer be if i expressed my thoughts to her(it would be my first time declaring to a girl). 

So because of that my mind started thinking about the option of getting rejected and I feel like I cant “go foward” with my overall relationship with her because im scared of hearing a “No”.

I would love to know what my mind is thinking wrong and what advice could you give me in order to be brave and talk to her because my mind just thinks “ i dont want to lose this chance because its almost like a hearbreak if she says No”",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163303,public,self,Leading with fear of rejection,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tbrcad/leading_with_fear_of_rejection/,no_ads,0,,,,,

Just wanting some outsider opinions of what I might be too involved to be able to take an objective look at.

I have been seeing a guy for a total of 3 months (most of the first month spent messaging on dating app then WhatsApp as we were with family in different countries over Christmas). Our first dates were dinner/movies/etc and then have morphed into being primarily, because of my schedule (have lots of off days during the week, whereas he works 9-5 with weekends), my going to his place and him making me dinner/then watching a show or just talking. I tend to stay the night with him as well. I asked if he was wanting to pursue a serious relationship during the first few dates, and was satisfied with his answer of looking to date someone with the intent of getting into a relationship.

He's great, I love being around him and have started missing him when we're not together the last few weeks. We spent a long weekend together in February, and after that I noticed an energy change in that our texting went from being ongoing conversations (like they had been since we had been messaging only whilst waiting to meet in person) to just about when/where we'd be meeting up. He does make most of the offers to see me, offering to make me dinner etc. We tend to see each other maybe once or twice a week (again usually me at his, every now and again if I'm free on a weekend, he might come to mine or we might go out). I noticed that he was not texting/calling me in between us seeing each other, going up to 4 days without contacting me in any wya. He respond as normal if I contact him though. I addressed it upfront and told him I would like communication in between our dates, and he was fine with that. The communication picked up a little bit thereafter. I have also noticed, and he has said to me, that he seems to have been in a different headspace over the last 3 weeks, seeming more.. subdued and less upbeat than he previously was. Despite the dip in communication, when I reach out to him or we're together in person, nothing has changed apart from us getting more comfortable with each other (which is good, in my book).

We had a disagreement 1 week ago which had to do with our having different communication styles. (he is quite blunt, and I had asked him to take my feelings into consideration when choosing his words. he feels that's him being insincere/sugarcoating). We both got upset whilst I was at his. Part of the reason I was upset that evening, but didn't fully communicate this to him as I was worked up at the time, was that I felt he had sidelined our plans for the weekend. The week prior, I had mentioned in passing that I was free this weekend, and wanted to spend time with him out doing something. I didn't specify a day. He said it sounded good and that 'he would think of something we could do.' I then found out on the evening of the disagreement that he had made plans to hang out with a friend of his this Saturday. He does not have a great memory and I have a feeling he simply forgot what was said in passing about us spending time together this weekend. He then initially offered to do something Sunday after sensing I was upset about Saturday, but I was feeling hurt and simply said 'I suppose, maybe we could.' Later that evening, after our disagreement in which I felt he was masking how upset he was, I asked if he did want to do something Sunday and he told me 'he hadn't thought that far ahead' yet. I was not happy about that (he thought far ahead enough to plan to do something on Saturday..) but put it down to him not being happy at that moment, as I was as well.

We weren't able to resolve it that evening, and I left the next morning with it being a little awkward. He seemed to be trying to pretend he wasn't upset, but I could sense he was. He gave me a kiss and left for work. I called later that evening, mostly because I knew I would be anxious waiting to hear from him for a few days (based on our recent communication, I felt he probably wouldn't call/text). I apologised for the way we left it and suggested we pick a time to video call (I have been working late all this week - didn't have time to meet) and talk about what happened, conflict management/what we're like upset etc.. This was at the start of the week. He agreed but said he wanted to see me in person to talk and offered to come to mine. I was happy to hear that. He said he'd be able to 'towards the end of the week'.

I then didn't hear from him all week after that brief call (again becoming the norm). I've decided we need to have a proper chat in which I ask where he stands on us dating and if he is interested in seeing where things go. So I texted him asking what day/time he was thinking, and he has now gotten back to me to say: 'Let's go for a walk sat/sun morning. I'm busy both days. Sat going to watch sport with my friend (which he had told me about the evening of the disagreement) and going to an event on Sunday (didn't know about). I'm wondering when he planned the event on Sunday, because he must have not had it planned last weekend when he first suggested doing something then instead of Saturday. I don't know that if I had not texted him to ask what was happening, he would have contacted me.

I'm leaning towards going on the walk sun, even though it's not the situation I I want (I wanted him to come to mine, we make dinner, and sit and talk) because I won't be able to see him for the next 2 weeks (unless I go to his, which I am not going to be doing until we talk) otherwise. I just want to have this 'where do we stand' discussion so that I can know upfront exactly what we're doing and if I am going to stop putting effort into this. I'll be sad if the outcome of this discussion is that he either admits he's not into it anymore or I sense that he's baiting me along with his answers, because I am very into him, and feel a sense of comfort/playfulness/peace with him that I haven't with any other dates in quite some time. We mesh.

I am aware that I tend to have relationship anxiety, and I jump to the conclusion that men I'm seeing are trying to pull back, and this stems from my past crappy dating experiences and a very out of the blue breakup.

Bear in mind, the main issues for me are decreased communication (could argue we were just texting more often at the start because we hadn't met yet) and what I am not perceiving from today, is a lack of prioritising me. I don't feel great about being fitted in for a morning walk in this busy weekend of his when he told me he would come to see me.

I haven't been waiting around for him to make my weekend plans, I'm getting on with my life and have got plans with friends. Just want to know if this is perhaps something he's going through or a clear sign of yet another slow dating death, that I can't see coming until it's happened.

I've been dating a guy for a few months now. We were passing acquaintances for years before he asked me out and I always had a huge crush on him. In the beginning, everything was great. We were both very sexually attracted to each other and had amazing chemistry. I don't know if it was simply lust or infatuation or if I was falling in love, but I definitely felt the ""spark"". However, as I got to know him better, I became really disappointed. He is already displaying what I consider to be huge red flags. He has a lot of untreated issues and won't do anything about it. Besides that, he displays what I consider to be major red flags and does some truly weird things. But aside from the main issues, he is a different person that I thought he was. I realize he has been interpreting a persona all along. We all try to impress the person we are dating, but he really went out of his way to put up a facade that doesn't reflect him at all. And I realize I fell in love with his persona, not with the real him. 
Since I don't like so many things about him and he didn't live up to my expectations, I'm starting to lose feelings for him. And I wonder if this is normal and healthy, because a lot of people describe love as an irrational force, whereas it's proven not to be that way for me.
Attraction and chemistry are necessary, but they are not enough for me to fall in love. For me, in order to turn infatuation into love, I really have to like someone as a person, in addition to being attracted to them. Which means: no major character flaws, deal-breakers and signs of serious incompatibility. 
If any of the above are present, I can still be attracted to you for a while, but eventually my infatuation will fade. I can't really open up and connect with someone that I don't admire and trust, and I can definitely not fall in love with them.

I have high anxiety and i'm positive i'm depressed. I was feeling kind of desperate so I installed a dating app. Over the next 7-8 months it felt more like a mobile game than a dating app and made me feel hopeless. But I matched with a girl (20F) a few days ago and we chatted for a day or so before agreeing to meet. We like similar things and text conversation flowed ok. I wasn't sure what to do for the date so I gave her a few options and she chose dinner. I don't think that dinner went too badly. I didn't really know what to talk about but I gave it my best shot. Things started well but it got very awkward towards the end with long silences and awkward laughs.

Now I kind of like this girl. Again, we are into similar things but (this is probably rude but its to help explain) i'm not super attracted to her. She isn't ugly by any means, but she doesn't quite look like her dating profile pictures. With it being my first date and all, I knew I was going to be very anxious. But that's the thing, I wasn't anxious until I actually sat down at the table. I'm always anxious about everything days before they happen, but this time I only felt the anxiety of meeting someone new and not ""holy shit im on a date"" anxiety. I didn't feel excited and I felt like I wanted to leave during parts of it. I don't really feel anything. I thought I would feel something, but I'm just indifferent.

It's been a day or so and I still feel the same, on one hand maybe it's my anxiety trying to back out of something and i'm being too picky and should force myself to stick with it. On the other hand it could be the loss of all interest that i've experienced with everything else that I need to work on before I enter a relationship.

So I feel like I need to stop seeing her, because it wouldn't be fair to waste her time on a person who feels nothing in her company. But I feel bad and I don't want to hurt her (she said that she feels lonely a lot and doesn't have a lot of friends and grew up pretty isolated.) I think that she really likes me based on her matching my body language the entire time and how she seemed a very flustered, but I just can't say I feel the same. She is really nice and we have similar personalities, but I just don't feel like I thought I would. I also keep thinking like what if this is my only shot. Like I've been trying my whole life and a girl comes in that likes me and shares interests and i'm really gonna throw that away? 

I don't know if maybe it's my anxiety overanalyzing the situation and I should stick with it to see if it gets better, but I also don't want to lead her on to something that is going to fizzle out because I'm not feeling it. I already feel guilty about going on a date and making her feel I am interested when I might not be. And of course my dumb ass already told her on that day that we should get back together soon.

So do I stop seeing her or go on a few more dates to see if things change? If I do stop seeing her, how do I go about telling her in a way to not hurt her feelings? I am not sure what to do, any advice to help me out?

I've been with my gf for a year. When we first started dating, I never envisioned it going anywhere, i never thought i would fall in love with her, but here i am. I love her to bits, shes my one and only. Part of why i didnt think we would last very long was because she had a very promiscuous past, and i didnt think we were compatibile becasue of it, and that she wouldnt want to be with someone far less experienced than her.

To compensate for that idiotic belief of mine, I lied about my past with girls. Hookups I never had, GF's I never had, just to make it seem like we were on hte same playing field. I dont need to be told how dumb this is, i know. My ego couldnt handle it. I was fragile, insecure, it was dumb dumb dumb. One of the lies I told was about a girl I dated for three months (That i actually didn't date). I just used the name of some girl i knew briefly at a summer time job back when i was 15 or 16. I never really talked about the relationship, it was never a point of conversation between me and my current gf, but nonetheless my patholgoical self felt like I had to lie about it.

The problem now, my GF is going to work at the company this girl that i never dated also works at, and no doubt it'll come up between them, and my current gf will realize that I had been bullshitting about this the whole time. I will undoubtedly lose her. It is my fault, i had no idea what I was doing. I felt remorseful about this before she had gotten the job, but now that she has it is compounded by anxiety, fear, self loathing. How do I handle this situation? I know this is bat shit crazy.

That break up was so hard and after two years I think I'm ready to try again however I'm not having any success. 

First, I'm a medical student and I started to get to know other girls in my class but I'm not finding anyone whose personality resembles mine and most of them have overinflated ego anyways so I tried cold approaches a few times in public places but it seems the chances of meeting a compatible person are extremely thin. Online dating isn't a thing in my country (Egypt). I started looking into my interests and activities around them (I play the piano - read - work out - sometimes make fun videos ) so I joined a reading club, took musical course, joined mixed gym, posted memes/videos on social media but again so far I'm not finding anyone. 

I see most girls care about travelling - partying - appearing cool on social media and even girls that read they usually read stuffs like poetry - literature and I honestly don't care at all about these things.

I just don't develop crushes anymore if that makes sense maybe it's part of getting older ? I found 1-2 girls on social media that seem nice and we have 1-2 common interests however :

1. I don't feel 1-2 common interests are enough to build attraction 
2. Medical study took a dull on my personality and I don't think I can make them interested
3. Even though I have a little interest in them it's not really that strong desire or crush

As for my social circle it's very limited and I met friends of my friends and they also don't seem to match with me : /

I hear the phrase ""There's plenty of fish in the sea"" and that there are 7 billion on Earth whatever but day after day I feel extremely limited to people around my social circle and study/work : /",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163306,public,self,2 Years since my first break up I think I'm ready but I'm having trouble finding new people.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tbukry/2_years_since_my_first_break_up_i_think_im_ready/,no_ads,0,,,,,

So, my question is...can he really be serious about me if we just met like less than two weeks ago? He seems a honest and genuine guy but I'm confused about this... especially because we met through an app.

I do this stupid online dating thing and for months I never find anyone to my liking and then I find someone I’m totally into and I fucked it up…… I wanted to respect the fact she wanted space which is why I didn’t try and bother her when she wasn’t responding and then to think that I got blocked after was such a shitty feeling after being told they like you. 

I don’t know. I feel like I was within my right to be a little annoyed at the idea of being blocked.

To give a little context, I've gotten out of a pretty long relationship and I'm into this girl from school. I used to be able to sense certain things, but it seems I've gotten rusty with time :) I need some advice on how to deal with the situation with this new girl.

We are colleagues, but never really talked that much. The pandemic also didn't help. However, we've gotten closer lately, as friends, and, getting to know her, I realised I genuinely like who she is (or at least who I think she is). There are just a couple of things that I planned to mention since this attraction is quite new. 

Firstly, whenever we're out in groups, we talk and laugh together, make fun of each other, and look at each other without reticence (perhaps a little from my side), but in a quite casual way. However, we've had multiple instances where we were alone and, out of those, only a few went smoothly, so to speak. For instance, my colleagues and I grabbed a coffee after school and she was there as well. Everything went well and we had fun. But later, when I drove her home, it was very silent. I wasn't really in the mood for talking and laughing anymore, but my silence was more a result of me being nervous. She didn't really say much and we just said bye to each other when we arrived at her place. My dilemma is that I don't know whether these things happen as a result of her nervousness as well, or if it is just a lack of interest. 

Secondly, a few days ago, we were alone (one of those situations). It was quite well, but she was quite goofy, might I say. She said some things that straight-up made no sense as if she was actually nervous and just messed up a little. Other than that, we kinda laughed all the way throughout the conversation and teased each other a little. 

Other things that are, perhaps, worth mentioning, are that she remembered some silly jokes I made the past few weeks, since this connection - that's what I hope it is - started, she opened up about her past and her current situation, which involves a lot of personal things regarding family and all. 

I also want to mention that since this is quite new, we didn't spend a lot of time alone, and we haven't got to the flirty part (if we are ever going to), so it's just like a possibly-transitional phase from a platonic friendship to something else. 

The reason I like her is her suffering. That's why I am deeply interested in her. I've suffered quite a bit throughout my life and have come to know that suffering makes people bitter and resentful or empathetic, and caring. And I don't meet a lot of people who have really suffered deeply, and, out of those, the majority turn bitter. She, however, gives me this sweet vibe, so I have a very well-rooted, values-oriented appreciation for her. She is also gorgeous, but she has always been gorgeous and she didn't stir my interest, until recently when I found out more about her soul, so to speak.

We fooled around but didn’t have sex. I made it clear that I was the type of girl that is open to a relationship and he said he was too. Now I don’t know if he was just saying that Bc he was drunk but whatever. He also told me that he got out a relationship two months ago but that the relationship only lasted 5 months. 
So after spending the night with him he texted me two days later to set up a date for that week. The date was great we ended up going back to his place fooled around but I stopped him and told him I need to know someone for a while before sleeping with them and that I need exclusiveness. He right then and there said he would be down for exclusive but then I told him let’s wait a little longer and he agreed and said he doesn’t want to rush me and that he is fine with waiting Bc he likes seeing me and it’s not only about sex. So almost everyday after that we have been texting on and off throughout the day. Not too many texts but keeping in touch. We ended up sleeping together on the fourth date (so the first time was almost two weeks ago)Right before doing it I reminded him how it’s important that we’re exclusive and he agreed to it. We’ve been texting the same as before and just last weekend he let me sleep in at his place without him as he had to get up early. The only thing that bothers me is that when he goes out on the weekends he doesn’t include me in the plans. It’s more like if we’re talking and find out we’re both out he will tell me that if I want to come meet him and his friends I can. I think they go pretty hard when they go out and they go hard all weekend. Idc about that but I’m not sure if it’s a red flag he doesn’t try and include me in weekend plans? Another thing that makes me sensitive is that this week he has been pretty slow with texting. He even went a day without texting me and I didn’t text him either Bc the most recent text was from me the night before. Is this normal dating behavior for 2 people  that have only known eachother for a month? We probably see eachother once a week and I have met him out while he is with his friends so it’s not like he is avoiding me.

My boyfriend saw my post a few hours later on and he started to get upset and annoyed. First, he dm's my post to me and says that I'm being a copycat, and then shortly after he texts me and accuses me of being a thief.  I first played this off jokingly as this is not something to get triggered over but then he further texts me which really shows how bothered he is and I'm in disbelief to the point he has gotten me really annoyed at him over this. 

First, he questions why I would post the exact same picture as me and tell me to do something different and how he doesn't want somebody to be copying him. He doesn't seem to like how my whole look, scene, and presentation of the his picture is like his. Then he tells me to stop trying so hard to act cool as it's a turn-off for him. I don't know what he is talking about here because I'm not trying so hard on anything I'm just being him.  When I had the picture taken, my intent wasn't to directly copy him. It just turned out to be the best pic and I went ahead to post it. And now here he is acting all upset over one post that just turned out similar to his from a few days ago. I would understand him more if I kept copying him all the time and then he gets upset and wants me to stop. But here he's acting petty, childish, and immature over this. 

Anyway, I would like some thoughts. Am I in the wrong for in how he ended up feeling or is he just overreacting?  He now says he's over it but to me it does raise a big red flag about him overall.....",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163312,public,self,My boyfriend got upset over my latest Instagram post because mine is similar to his from a few days ago?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tbynbc/my_boyfriend_got_upset_over_my_latest_instagram/,no_ads,0,,,,,

We went on a date after 2 weeks of texting and calls an ft, date went really well. He then texts me after the date that it wasnt an easy decision but that we would be better off as friends. I was very confused but not hurt by it, i assumed he was going to ghost me bc it has happened before and i had the intention of also ghosting him. Well we ended up talking and being friends, he tells me that he isnt healed from a past relationship and that he doesnt want to put me in a position where I would be hurt. Long story short, we went to a concert. He bought me a drink and during the concert we were holding hands, he was very physical and kissed my face a lot. We ended up having sex that night and never spoke about it til a week later. We agreed to be FWB. 
Slightly confusing how i ended up here. While I did agree, something in me is genuinely bothered by this. While at the concert he was very touchy and it looked like we were dating by the way we were both acting.

Cue to now ,known her a for a good 4 months I accepted it as friendship, we hang out practically every week 1 or two times always just the two of us. But thing is I keep thinking I’m seeing “signs” that she wants to be more ,the whole (starring at you non stop, being close and “accidentally” brushing up on your arm , I can tell she puts in effort to look nice when we hang , always makes a point after we hang to say that she REALLY loves spending time with me etc) 


But what gives? I took it at face value that she just wants to be friends, she is a shy person naturally, once told me she has a hard time expressing her emotions idk if that has anything to do with it

I’m thinking should I make a move again (try and kiss her)and see where it goes or talk to her and see, if she has feelings for me just to get it out of the way?…. Pr am I just over here reading too into this. I truly appreciate her friendship,  but I also still do have some feeling for her , out of respect for her I just repressed those after she rejected me at first, and always though of her as just a friend but I ain’t going to say no if she now wants to be more.
