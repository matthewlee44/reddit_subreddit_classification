0,qtz1tr,1636922841,Male best friend of over 2 years sending extremely mixed signals and now I don’t know what to do.,"TL:DR;

My best friend of over 2 years started to become extremely touchy, talk to me for hours everyday, pick up my tabs here and there, post me all the time, and get mad over every guy I talk to yet whenever mutual friends ask him he says we’re just friends. He has an EXTREMELY abundant love life (so do I but not to his extent) yet I’m the one he calls for hours and sees every weekend. I’ve been confused for months and I’m drained from constantly wondering why I”ll never be enough for him, how he truly feels and what I should do. I’m afraid if I tell him it’ll ruin the entire friendship and he’ll become extremely awkward.

Whole story: 
Over the course of our friendship, he’s always been there for me through everything: bad relationships, family problems, and other traumatic events. We always saw eachother as sister and brother.

From the beginning of this summer, everything changed. He started being more touchy, calling me for HOURS everyday (around 3-4 on a normal day and sometimes 7. before we would still talk for maybe 1-3 hours but that would be it). He also suddenly started being extremely touchy. Like caressing my hair and tucking it behind my ears while looking into my eyes, having me sit on his lap and not saying anything, being pressed up against him and placing his hands on my lower back yet then pulling away, putting on necklaces for me and grabbing my neck, the list could go on but we haven’t kissed or done anything that would give a clear cut answer.

He’s also been extremely emotionally open with me. And he’s stated multiple times that I’m extremely attractive but it was never in an “I’m hitting on you” type way. Everywhere he goes, I go, and vice versa. However he also has an extremely abundant love life, and has been talking to many people casually over the course of all this, yet i’m the one he sees every weekend and talks to for hours everyday and posts. I realized something was up when a couple of days ago after he posted a picture of a girl he posted a picture of me because I looked “extremely good” and how he loved “this new era of me”. Yet whenever mutual friends ask him, he says how he doesn’t like me/i’m like a sister. 

This on and off cycle has TORMENTED me mentally, and I don’t know what to do or how to approach this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qtz1tr/male_best_friend_of_over_2_years_sending/
1,qtz5bu,1636923113,Feeling like I'm stuck in a rut.,"This is the most recent example as it's happened a few times, and kinda what's pushed me to venting about it on a subreddit on all things, so please be patient with me.

So on Friday I went out with a big group of people, mix of guys and ladies, some I knew and some I had met for the first time. Fairly early on in the night at the starting bar, I started talking to one of the girls I didn't know and we hit it off, it was really nice, cracked jokes about the jacket I was wearing and how she wanted to buy it off me. It all seemed like smooth sailing. Then our group moved on to the club, me and her were dancing together, then she asked for my number. I gave it to her, we danced some more, then it became obvious that she was pretty drunk and the anxiety set in. 

""Shit,"" I thought. ""She's gonna regret giving her number to some random guy she just met."" But I tried to play it off, kept dancing with her, chatting to her while having a smoke etc. Eventually I settled down and was just enjoying the night regardless. At around 3am when everyone was starting to make their way home, one of her friends asked me and my friend if we wanted to go back to theirs. Of course I said yes, and my friend knew what was going on so he came with.

Anyway a group of us went back to theirs and we picked up more booze as well as, something with a stronger kick than alcohol, if you catch my drift. We had some of the above then she wanted to show me her fish tank! She had kind of sobered up at this point but obviously there was more than just booze involved. I helped name her new fish, then we got into a very deep talk about religion, then her family, then my family. This went on for maybe an hour or so, I can't really remember. At this point, I really regret not making a move and seeing what happened if I kissed her.

We rejoined the others, had a cigarette, talked more as a group, then all sat on the sofa listening to music and chatting. There was only 4 of us at this point as others had left, but me and her were cuddled up on the sofa and making quips to each other, trying to speak in French (we're both learning). It was cute. Again, another moment I regret not kissing her at this point when we had a moment to ourselves.

Then it was morning. The vibe got a bit stranger. She didn't seem as affectionate and they were talking about work. When it got to 9am, we got our stuff together and left. She got very anxious and distressed about the aspect of trying to sleep after that heavy night, and she didn't seem to be that interested in me anymore. We hugged and said goodbye as she got in bed.

I messaged her Saturday night asking how she was feeling, and she obviously replied ""I've felt better. And you?"" And I made some goofy comment about a small creature wrecking havoc in my brain then asked if she slept okay. Didn't get a response. I haven't messaged anything since then.

I feel like I've just become the guy who girls regret giving their number to on a night out. It's happened a few times in the last few months, but it's really hitting me hard today because of the nice conversations we were having and the ""spark"" that I felt. Of course, this could have been a completely superficial interaction brought about by alcohol and substances. I'm debating asking her straight up if she wants to go on a date this week but at the same time, her friend and housemate really liked hanging out as we had similar music taste, so she said we should all hang out again sometime. I don't wanna particularly sacrifice a new group to hang out with because I was pushy with her friend. This has gotten to be a really long post and I already regret writing it, but I'm too far in to just discard it. I hope someone has some wisdom to share with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qtz5bu/feeling_like_im_stuck_in_a_rut/

The reason I 19M want to break up with her is because she just doesn't talk to me anymore. I'm not sure what happened tbh, everything was going fine, and then our conversations became less and less. I will text her every morning, and she will sometimes not reply until the next day, or sometimes not at all.
Now here is the funny thing. Because she doesn't talk to me, every time I try to bring up wanting to talk about our problems, she doesn't end up seeing it or she ignores it. 
I decided to ask her to meet up so I could break up properly in person, again I hear nothing from her.

6,qtzjii,1636924194,He started antidepressants and it changed him completely,"We (he M40, me F33) started dating in June and were really liking each other. 
He is such an amazingly interesting introverted man. 
But I’m afraid he doesn’t see himself that way, asking on multiple occasions how it is possible that I’m interested in him. Especially if he would notice that I’m getting quite a lot of attention from other men (that I always ignore btw).

After 2 months he told me he was suffering with health anxiety and it was really bad for him at that moment.
He said that he had never told anyone about the anxiety although he had anxiety in the past before. He told me that with me he felt really comfortable to open up about it. We would not have sex anymore because that triggered the anxiety (although we always did it safe before).

After a lot of talking for a couple of weeks I convinced him to see a therapist. 
The therapist prescribed him Citalopram, he was worried to begin with the medication because the first week can actually increase the anxiety. So I tried to be there as much as possible for him the first weeks. Distracting him with long walks and other outdoor activities, making and bringing him healthy food because he was not really taking good care of himself. It helped and after 2 weeks he started to feel better. We had a couple of good weeks together although he was still really hesitant to have sex, but I was understanding and didn’t force it.

Then he started to become distant, not really texting me anymore or making plans to see me. After 3 weeks of not seeing him, he finally found time to see me, by this time he was on the medication for around 8 weeks. 

He told me the medication made him feel numb and that his libido disappeared. We talked about that he should talk with his therapist about this and maybe his dosage could be decreased. 
I asked him if he still wanted to be with me because he had been avoiding me, he asked if he could think about it and if I could give him some time. He suggested to meet after 2 weeks and then talk again about it. In this 2 weeks we had some contact and after talking to the therapist he decreased the dosage of medication. 

But the day we would supposed to meet he cancelled on me. Sending me a text that he could not find the energy to meet me. 
I send him a message back saying that it’s ok and that I get the feeling that he wants to end it with me but doesn’t know how, and that I will do it for him then and that it is ok. I also told him that he can always call me if he feels bad, that I still care and I hope we can have a coffee sometime. 

He responded to me (a day later!) telling me that he guesses I am right and thanks me for being so understanding and that we will of course see each other. 

I feel so bad and I have the feeling I am doing something wrong here but I don’t know what else to do. When you are in love with someone it’s hard to not take it personal that he distanced himself from me. It all feels so wrong.

7,qtzjm2,1636924202,Does he seem interested?,"So I met this guy at a bar who I found attractive. We went on a first date that started out as a dinner date where conversation flowed, it was upbeat and lots of fun etc. He wanted to go with me to a pool hall after that and the whole thing lasted several hours before we said goodbye. He kissed me on the cheek. Then I had surgery which kept me out for almost a month. We texted about once a week during this time and I saw him last Thursday again once I finally got better. It was not really a ""date"", more of a ""seeing mostly him but also everyone else there after being gone for so long"" kind of thing. We ended up talking most of the time and he gave me signs of wanting to get closer like close proximity and casually touching arms legs, trying to impress me etc. He seemed nice and I felt the chemistry again so when he walked me to my car he gave me another kiss on the cheek for goodbye. I turned towards him after that for a real kiss and he returned it. We texted a little bit the next day. But he hasn't said anything about wanting to see me again or ask me out. It's been three days now and he hasn't asked me out again. What does this mean? 

What should my plan of action be? Do I ask him to make plans? Should I try dating other people and back off a bit?

8,qtzthw,1636924979,What does “dating” or “seeing each other” mean to you?,"I (28f) recently started going on dates with this guy (29m). We started talking about 3 weeks ago. We went on our first date about a week and a half ago. Since then, we’ve had 4 dates along with a phone call/FaceTime everyday. I thought from the beginning that we both were looking for something serious as he said he wanted to take things slow. I ended up spending all day with him yesterday and stayed overnight (the 4th date).


Today he texted me asking “are we dating?” I had no idea what he meant, so I asked him to FaceTime. He basically said that he wants to know if we are dating or seeing each other if someone asks. I asked him if he means exclusivity, and he said no. He then brought up the word “situationship” to which I was very confused. I reiterated that I don’t want something casual. He agreed, so we just kind of dropped it and agreed to continue going on dates. 

To be fair, I’m American and he grew up in India, so maybe there is a cultural difference here. He originally came to the US for grad school, but he got a job here and is planning on staying permanently. 

I guess I’ve never been asked this before, so I wanted to get outside opinions. I had assumed that we were dating (just not exclusive or official) because we are going on consistent dates. I didn’t think that had to be defined. What do you think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qtzthw/what_does_dating_or_seeing_each_other_mean_to_you/

11,qu0ap2,1636926330,I Went on 3 Dates in One day,"It was 4 am of a rainy Saturday, my head was hurting because of excessive drinking from last night. I checked my phone, there was a shareable taxi leaving to the nearby city in 30 mins. I tried making some excuses and locked my phone, but opened it again and saw the Wallpaper ""NO EXCUSES"".  Got up, called the driver, he said thanks for waking me up and blabbered something else in Russian. FINE. Let's GAME. I WILL APPROACH EVERYTHING THAT MOVES.

* It's 7 am and I'm here, standing in rain, hungry and in pain. there is this cute girl standing on the bus stop, I tried walking towards her but the Approach anxiety kicks in. (Let's eat something first, she will reject me, there is an old lady standing with her. etc.) but then I started moving my legs and told myself I've done this thousands of times, just say Hi. after a smiley introduction she tells me that she is going to work and has a boyfriend. we wish each other good luck and I leave for KFC.
* I ordered cheap burger and a coffee from the machine and then saw this beautiful blonde sitting on a table alone, i walk up to her (all the excuses are still there), she looks at me and then says sorry, i've a bf. I was like fck this is Amazing I'm not wasting any time and the fear is gone.
* My order is ready, there is this cute short girl on the other side of counter, screaming my number, i walk up, she  greets me with a fake plastic smile, I go a bit closer halfway to the counter and whisper, ""you shouldn't smile at me, my wife is a jealous woman"" she starts laughing. and says ""i know, hope she doesn't find out"" Her manager, was looking at us, so i gave a statement of empathy and took a picture of her instagram profile quickly.
* After 6-7 rejections and some numbers, my coffee addiction kicks in, I saw some people near McDonalds, the place is filled with people, I order a small coffee, saw this cute girl with curly hair and glasses standing and waiting for her order, I tease her on the unhealthy lifestyle, she gets hooked instantly looking directly at me with her big brown eyes. i advice we can sit on same table, she agrees, sat with her for 20 mins in a corner table, flirty banter, some physicality, due to logistical problems couldn't meet same day. made plans for next time I'm in the city.
* I was feeling Great after this one, started talking to more girls, 3-4 rejections in weird situations like grocery stores and traffic lights. nut it doesn't affect me, then i see this amazing girl just standing near mall to save herself from rain. I said, you forgot the umbrella, she smiles says ""yeah"", I say ""that's why we broke up 30 years ago, you always forget important things""   she starts laughing. I introduce my self and then invite her for a walk in mall because it's cold outside. we start walking, she is super feminine, tells me about her goals in life and what kind of things she likes to do. we sat in the KFC on the top floor of mall, some physicality, my hand is on her shoulder, most of the talk is flirty, other than that i'm just ranting about my Youtube channel and other hard work, after 30 mins, she had to go. Made plans for next time I'm in the city.
* She left and i felt a bit down, because i was very calm with her, didn't want to start approaching again. then thought fck it maybe something more amazing will happen. i started walking, while exiting the mall saw this amazing girl running to enter the mall, i stopped for a bit. walked towards her, said something cheesy, she started laughing, my vibe was very calm and that's what hooked her attention. She is also a medical student like me, we start walking, she says some stuff about how confident i am and she feels very calm with me, it's never happened with her before, we sat in the KFC (that's the only thing i could afford that day), her vibe is much different than the last girl, this one very quirky, full of life. After a few minutes we start flirting. about 15 mins later, my phone rings and it's the driver, he is coming in 30 mins to pick me up. the place we agreed to meet is not far so i told him okay.

After some minutes of deep eye contact and slow talk i go for a kiss, but she is not comfortable with it, I back off, we talk a bit more and it's my time to go. she gets sad, says we will meet next time, i'm in the city. Okay.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On the way back, i tried sleeping in the car, my phone ringed there are 4 notifications. 1 from the Girl working in  KFC , asking where I am?   
&gt;  
&gt;Other 3 from the bank, reciepts of the money I spent in KFC.

He took a picture with me to show me later of him holding the camera and smiling and me passed out as a joke. 

Then I vomited in his toilet and peed myself. My dress and leggings were wet. I also got his bath mat wet. He took my dress, leggings, and panties off and put new underwear on me from my overnight bag and then dressed me in his sweatpants. I woke up and felt awful. I apologized profusely and made self deprecating comments like “you should’ve just left me in the car” as a joke.

I let my guard down and allowed myself fall into the fantasy again. What could’ve been, right?

I’ve turned down so many good guys because of a lack of “spark.” In retrospect, I’m lucky to even have had a chance to talk to them. Ivy educated doctors, engineers, PhDs, CEOs - 16 of them this year. They were so interested, I just didn’t feel any spark so I said goodbye. Joke’s on me. They all would have been just fine. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t say goodbye 16 of those other times, or any of the other times before then.

I feel like I’ve lost my identity in this dating game. I’m nothing but a swirling mass, lost in the world. Yet, I don’t have any room to complain because I did this to myself, thinking I’ll actually find something with someone who has that spark. Woe is me, and karma’s a b.

26,qu1kw9,1636929953,Help this overthinker figure out where they stand,"TL;DR at bottom

Her \[25F\] and I \[27M\] are in the same grad school program. We met through a group project several weeks ago and have hung out a few time since then, almost always in group settings. In those settings, we've definitely gravitated toward each other conversationally and were in each other's ""orbit"" so to say. Lots of talk about interests/goals (e.g: what do you want to do after graduating, do you want to stay in this city, etc), things to do in the city, and other ad hoc topics. Lots of eye contact and smiles. We've even made indefinite plans (i.e: let's go there sometime).

Most recently, we ran into each other by coincidence at a school happy hour, and her and a few mutual colleagues accepted my invite to a friend's party that evening. The following day, her, I, and her friend and boyfriend went out to go laser tagging - something she had stated she really enjoyed and we should go do - and for dinner. Her friend I was half expecting to come (and I think she was in the same boat since invites went out during the party the night prior after a few drinks) and her boyfriend was a last minute addition, but everything went great - fun was had by all and we all have an indefinite agreement to go out again. I'm totally inexperienced with dating so it seemed more like hanging out than a date personally, but if this is what double dates are, I really enjoyed it.

On an individual basis, I just don't know. All signs seem to point to enjoying each other's company, but I cannot tell whether this is strictly platonically or as something potentially more. When she's told me of other stuff she has going on, she seemed to be deliberate in specifying ""friend"" with no mention of a boyfriend. We follow each other on social media. We're comfortable enough with each other where we've shared drinks, and after the aforementioned laser tag outing, just us two stopped for ice cream and shared that two before I dropped her off at home. We have plans for coffee at the end of the week.

Where I'm confused, and this is where my overthinking becomes obvious:

Texting time can and often does take several hours. Our school uses WhatsApp as a primary means of communication, so I can see read receipts and last activity on the app. However, she's a Chinese international student and our school has a pretty sizable Chinese international student population so I'm aware that WeChat is also a more favored method of communicating. Also, we're grad students - we're busy, we have stuff going on. I get it. Reddit probably has me all anxious because of the common advice ""if she's interested, she'll make time.""

Not a lot of physical touch going on. I can only recall one brief instance she touched my arm in conversation, and another was a goodbye hug from the aforementioned party. After I dropped her off at home the other day, goodbyes seemed almost rushed with no hug or anything. She's far from a recluse, but definitely seems to lean hard on the introverted side; I'm in the same boat. Not sure if there's also cultural differences at play or if it's an introvert trap or if it's just a lack of romantic interest.

Lastly, the lack of 1:1 time. We've met up a lot in group settings, which I understand can be more comfortable for the woman. This generally hasn't prevented us from having a good time, but it's making it hard for me to tell if there's any romantic interest or if things are strictly platonic.

TL;DR: Classmate \[25F\] and I \[27M\] hang out in group settings and get along great. Conversations are of relative substance and flows naturally. We have common interests and remarked activities/places we might like to do/go together in the near future. Question marks include lack of physical touch, prolonged periods of time between texts, and lack of 1:1 time, but could possibly be explained by cultural differences, we're both introverted, or simply being busy.

I don't want to stealth date. I also don't want to be an anxious mess overthinking things. I owe it to myself to remove ambiguity from the situation. Next time I see her in person (or when we get coffee), would it be offputting for me to say something among the lines of ""Forgive me if this is a bit forward, but can I take you on a proper date?"" While I would hope for the best, I also want to be able to handle rejection maturely because I am also fine with remaining friends, I just need to remove any ambiguity. At this point I've rambled long enough, so I would very much appreciate the perspectives of online strangers vis-a-vis where you think I stand and how I should proceed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu1kw9/help_this_overthinker_figure_out_where_they_stand/

29,qu1v0z,1636930793,Confidence and value!,"since my break up last year broke me emotionally I've been working on myself, lately I've been putting myself out there a lot and now I feel like I'm confident for the first time! 

I had no confidence because of my body image it was still bad even after losing 119lbs, I just got tired of looking tough and strong outside but brittle on the inside my insecurity ruined  a developing relationship earlier this year since sex was how I measured my worth and since I had 12 partners in the past 10 years  made me think I was worthless and ugly. ( I'm 29 male)

how did I get over it? by a combinations of introspection and exposing my self to getting rejected, remember the first time you got punched? I do! it hurt so much but as I got punched and hurt more the pain was lessened but still there. 

rejection is much the same first time I asked out a girl and got rejected since high school hurt so badly I wanted to swear off dating but I tried again and again now it doesn't hurt as bad I can now just laugh it off and have a good light hearted conversation with her after is things go the route.

I have yet to have success but I know I have a lot to offer as a person my penis isn't the end all be all, while writing this I realized the biggest thing you'll need to be able to handle and take rejection is knowing YOU have value and only YOU can truly measure it so take on a hobby, take up responsibility and have life goals and you will have value you can share with that special someone!

I told him that he tell me if there's any other fwb... Because I would not be comfortable and would like to end our fwb so that he can pursue other options. And I'd be his friend after. I said that I'd do the same for him without hesitation.

He argued that he'd have to loose me if he started to think of having sex with someone else. It's not fair. That if it didn't pan out well, then he'd have no one to have sex with.

I said that I want to take photo graphs as we would be going trekking and other stuff for our trip. 
It's both for sex and for general having fun as friends.

33,qu1yh3,1636931060,Addicted to a former crush… Help!,"So you all can understand, I’m currently in a position where I’m foregoing all dating in order to focus my attention on resolving my financial/career issues… So far, it’s been almost 2 years since I’ve been on a date. For perspective, I’ve also been practicing semen retention during that time (for those that don’t know, semen retention is the act of foregoing all sexual pleasure/acts [Porn Masturbation Orgasm]) in order to become a more productive individual… Once all my financial/career problems are resolved (8 months from now), is when I’m planning to go back into the dating world to search for a future wife. 

Now that’s out of the way…

I recently connected with a woman on social media who posted a public complaint about her ex boyfriend cheating on her claiming she wanted to become a villain in the process. I responded through her DM opting for her to choose the more positive route (that goodness will win in the end). She has tons of followers on her page so I didn’t expect her to respond, but her response was nearly instant! She liked my DM and instantly deleted her post… I was flabbergasted that my words could have that much impact on someone’s actions (especially someone with 1000x my influence on social media). 

I sent her a follow up message letting her know of my plans to date in 8 months and if she’s still single, we should catch some coffee… No response, fine.

She continued complaining about random aspects of her life and I sent her another DM urging her to remain positive and that life would work out for her. She didn’t respond, but, her online actions said otherwise… She began posting positive content which is when it was clear I was having a positive effect on her, it couldn’t have been coincidence….

I felt an instant romantic connecton (I could not get her out of my head, I was smitten)… I’ve dated plenty of women, but with her, there was something different, my heart was pulling me towards her unlike any other woman I’ve ever dated)… 

But, my mind saw her red flags. 

Some of her previous posts (before I came into her picture) were posts denigrating men, risqué photos of herself, etc… Long story short, I knew 8 months from now if we ever dated, those posts would be major issues in our relationship, so… 

I decided to address said issues by messaging her this: “Gonna be honest with you. Next summer, I’ll be looking for a future wife/mother of my children. And she’ll need to have a clean public/online reputation.”

Her response: “*MyName* I don't know who you are, if you're a fake account, or a stalker, but this message is unwelcome and makes me uncomfortable. Your personal business is none of mine, and I am none of your business either. I am blocking you now”

She blocked me.

A major blow to my self esteem… After that, it became a drug to check her page through burner accounts and coincidentally, I discovered she removed most of the dirty posts she had bashing men and the risqué photos of herself…

It’s extremely confusing to me…

She blocked me, yet obviously took my criticisms about herself to heart and decided to make said changes…

My heart still cares about her, but my mind (since she blocked me), is telling me to move on. 

I’ve now created a check-list of all the days that have gone by that I haven’t checked her page… 

I’ve never been through this before and it royally sucks!

once i got moved here, i had a super rocky start with a bad roommate situation and he let me live with him until my new apartment opened up - in total i was there probably two months.  since moving into my own place, i've had a really hard time with him. he has a lot of issues and insecurities from his previous relationship which lasted six years and just ended may 2020. he doesn't want to do things that i like with me because he is nervous and insecure because his ex used to make comments to him (in this case, it was a dance class and cat yoga). he has lived here for over a year, but doesn't have new friends here and wants me to make friends for the both of us, even though i have a hard time with that, too. he is not great or even good at communication, a lot of the time, if he is upset with me for something, he holds it in until i get him to talk to me and somehow, literally everything comes back to be my fault. 

the current situation is this: i asked him two weeks ago if he would pick up my sister from the airport when she visited because I would have work when she needed to be picked up. He told me yes, continued to say yes, until the day she needed to be picked up. It was going to take 40 minutes to an hour and a half to the airport depending on traffic and when he left; he asked if we could just get her an Uber instead (we hadn't financed that in bc we knew she had a ride setup). it wasn't for any reason other than the time it would take him to get there and get back (even though, if he had said it was for his dog ((who ate chocolate chip cookies)) and wanted to stay to watch him, i def would've understood and worked something else out like leaving work early). I was (i feel) understandably upset because it was hours before my sister was supposed to arrive when he was trying to back out and she had boarded so i wasn't able to coordinate anything else with her. in the end, he picked her up from the airport for me. However, now he's upset with me because he doesn't feel appreciated enough and told me that if we couldn't afford her ride from the airport, she shouldn't have taken the trip**.** he's also upset bc i had a table delivered to his apartment (after having packages stolen from mine and was told him by him it was okay to have them delivered to his place) and had asked him if he could bring it and some stuff i had left at his place when i stayed (and invited him for dinner bc i wanted us all to hangout at some point). he told me the table and my things weren't his responsibility and my asking was the icing on an annoyed cake. i had been asking for days if we (me and him) could bring it over to my apartment. he refused basically every time i asked because he didn't want to and would talk about how heavy it is and he would do it a day his friend could help. well it never came so my sister and i moved it over last night. i was shocked and upset he made it sound so heavy before and like i wouldn't have been able to help because if my sister and i could move it, he and i def could have, too. 

i don't know what to do or say. my way of showing my appreciation for what he does for me is to cook for him, and when i stayed with him it was cooking and cleaning (between classes and going to work when he wfh every day). i don't have a lot of money to spend on taking him out places or buying him things, so i cook because thats what i know and what i can do. as for everything else, i'm confused, frustrated, and hurt because it all is coming back to be my fault. he absolutely didn't have to bring the table if he had come for dinner, but for him to make it seem like my fault for asking... i had asked for days? and repeatedly was told no, but i couldn't have moved it myself and literally don't know anyone else in the city that could've helped me (i have only been here since august '21). i just don't know what to do or how to talk to him, there's a bit more other stuff that has my head spun and i'm having not a good time. i constantly feel like i'm apologizing for things i don't know i did or am doing and he doesn't say anything unless i pull it out of him. and i mean, i cant get him to talk about *anything* \- not even his past relationship or his family really (they aren't close) and it makes it hard to know what to do in our relationship because he won't/doesn't talk about these things with me. really sorry this is so all over, just having a hard time all around and can't really get my friends from home to answer or talk to me about it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu2z0w/incommunicative_boyfriend/

60,qu31hv,1636934394,Am I in the wrong here?,"Alright so I (28M) had been talking to this girl (27F) for a few weeks off a dating app and we decide to finally meet up for drinks. I initially thought she lived close by but after finding out she’s kinda far away I offer to drive closer to her which ends up being about an hour and 20. No big deal at all, I insist I meet closer to her as I wouldn’t feel comfortable with her driving that far and I am happy to do so. We go to this sushi spot and have a few drinks and split an app and talk for about an hour and a half. Overall I thought it went pretty well and she’s engaging, funny, and beautiful. 


The bill comes and I immediately grab it and go to get my card but she snatches the bill out of my hand and is like “no way you drove so far to meet me I wouldn’t feel comfortable with you paying”. Meanwhile I fire back like no way are you paying etc and we go and forth about 5 times on this and she just keeps saying “no” whenever I tell her I’m paying for it 100%. So then at this point I’m like alright well can we at least split it, there’s no way you’re paying for the full thing and she keeps saying “no”. So I don’t want to make it awkward or weird because we just met that night and be like all macho and take the bill back, but this girl was insisting over and over that she pay so finally I’m like ok fine and I thank her a couple times while we’re still there and I thank her again when we part ways by our cars and say bye.

I get home and txt her that it was great to meet her and I thank her again for paying and that I was completely caught off guard by that. She txts me back: “I talked to my parents and they thought it was concerning that you actually let me pay for the bill so they don’t think it’s a good idea that I speak to you again but I mean I had a fun time with you and I would like to see you again sometime”.

I respond saying how embarrassed I am and that we went back and forth about it multiple times and didn’t want to make it awkward. I also ended up venmoing her what was probably more than the actual bill total after her txt to me.

She then goes on to say that she also thought it was strange that I let her pay and that she’s never paid for a first date but that it’s no big deal and don’t worry about it but that her parents think that I’m not serious about her since I let her pay.

I’ve never had a girl pay for me before but after our multiple back and forth about it and her insistence on paying I finally just gave up at the risk of it getting weird and awkward. She was adamant about paying but then txts me after saying how strange it was and that she’s being told not to talk to me anymore. Now I just feel awful about the situation and really bad that she feels that way but didn’t express it whatsoever at the time.

63,qu38hc,1636934981,How do you keep a girl?,"I (24M) have never been in a relationship that lasted more than 6 months. I was never interested in anything serious. I had a very real conversation with a friend of mine before summer when he asked me if I was ever going to settle down. I said I want to and I meant it but only if I meet someone I really like. After that conversation I met a few girls, some of them I really liked but they weren't looking for anything serious and some I didn't want to engage with anything more than just a one night stand.  


I have been hanging out with a FWB, I find this girl very interesting, she has travelled half the world, she's super into hiking and outdoorsy stuff and have crazy adventurous stories meanwhile I have never been outside of the city before. Every time we hang out I can feel her loosing attraction for me as most of my stories involve me getting drunk and she found them really fun and crazy at first but now it's just boring, something dumb I did when I was drunk. And I thought about it and it's not that I'm getting sucked into her personality, she has asked me multiple times let's do something that I enjoy. But for past 3-4 years of my life, all I have done is work my ass off, go to bars/clubs with my friends and gym, tho earlier this year I did get into snowboarding. I am not interested in making her my girlfriend but I really consider her a friend. Yesterday we were at a bar and I could tell she was clearly bored while talking to me to the point where she said she just wants to be by herself in a very polite way and just kissed me goodbye (We weren't going to go home together as we both had different plans for later on). Even tho I felt a bit relieved, I felt really empty and hurt.  


It really got me thinking about how I have never been platonic friends with any girl after high school and how my previous FWBs never hung out with me outside of late night sneaky links. Even my ex girlfriends would start to loose interest in me after 3-4 months into the relationship. I don't think I'm a boring person, I think I'm decent at getting girls but I suck at keeping them and I fear that if I meet someone I really like I'm going to loose them if I keep doing what I'm doing.

69,qu3mgj,1636936194,I (29F) started dating someone (27M) a few months ago. It started off amazingly but he's going through a rough transition and I'm not sure if I should try to weather things out...,"After 3 exasperating years of being single and online dating, I met a really amazing guy a few months ago. We both wanted a meaningful relationship and clicked immediately with great emotional and physical chemistry. I honestly couldn't remember the last time I felt so happy and anxiety free when dating someone new. We both decided to be exclusive quite early on. Unfortunately, this honeymoon phase only lasted a month. He is a non-traditional student who just started his BS at a very competitive institution. The transition has not been easy for him. His workload is insane, and he's got some personal quirks that have made the experience even more difficult. As a result, our communication and time spent together has dropped off very significantly over the past two months. I initially felt extremely anxious because I thought things were fizzling just like with many previous guys that I liked. We had some serious and honest talks where he very genuinely assured me that while his feelings were not fading, he felt horrible that he couldn't give me the time that I deserve and that he doesn't want me to stay in the relationship if I'm unhappy.

I'm feeling conflicted on whether or not to continue things. We've only been dating for three months, and I wonder if it's worth all the effort. On one hand, I really love that we can have difficult conversations with one another, and he seems to want to put in the effort to improve things, but I question whether or not he has the capacity to with everything he has going on. I think I want to continue the relationship and try to make things work, but I find myself constantly fixating on whether or not they will which I feel is unhealthy.

72,qu422l,1636937576,An experiment I did many years ago on OKC | I'm a man BTW," A while back, about 5 years ago, I did this experiment on OKC. I made an account around Pinkie Pie. The Human version. Not from the series. This was before the series so it may be farther back. I made this account based solely on her personality. She wasn't dating, just looking to chat. Nothing sexual was added, just said at best she's straight. I talked about her family, friends, the bakery, and even Gummy, her pet alligator. I tried my best to sound like her. Yes, I was a big brony back then and loved the show. I was able to mimic her very well in being silly.

 That night, within 20 minutes, 10 guys messaged me. I let them know I was not catfishing and I too was a man. I told them that I was doing a small experiment to point out how easy it is for women. Even tho I told some men I was a man as well, they were too desperate to listen to me. They kept asking me to ERP with them. NOPE. 

Men, you're too damn desperate. I can't tell you how often I'm on dating sites and all I read are profiles of idiot women. Do you not want a woman with a brain? I know a lot of women want the same things. I've met plenty of women who love intelligent conversations. I've also learned, the more intelligent a woman is, the likelier she is kinky too. 

This experiment was to prove a simple notion: Women, you can get basically anything you want from a guy, just be simi good looking. Men? We have to not only look good, we have to have money, a car, a mansion, the cutest golden retriever. If we only have 1 of those things, we MIGHT get lucky. I actually pride myself on the fact I look decent. I'm no 10/10 but I know I'm decent. I've had my fair share of gfs in my life so far.

I just don’t… FEEL like doing it.

Some context: I’m a 23-year-old man, working a corporate sales job by day, and a side-hustle after work and on weekends. I got out of a 5-year relationship this past January and am STILL riding the euphoric high of my newfound freedom. 

January - October, I went quasi monk mode, just focusing on my path, purpose, and my guy friends. No dates, no sex, nada. Lately, I’ve been dipping a toe into the world of online dating, and have matched with a couple of cool chicks. Background check on social media says I’d enjoy their company.

Thing is… even after being a free, single man for 11 months now, I still don’t feel like dating. 

But at the same time, there’s this part of me that feels like I “should be” dating. Like, it’s good for me, or something. But man, I just don’t feel like it. Like, at all. I’m enjoying life as is, I’m on my path and purpose, I’m making bank, and I enjoy the company of family and friends. 

Thoughts? Should I get back in the game even if I don’t feel like it? Or should I just keep enjoying life and wait until I actually feel even 1% like going on a date with a chick?

75,qu4616,1636937933,Dating as a closeted trans woman who is medically transitioning but not out to the world yet is difficult. VENT,"This is just a VENT / RANT and I don't necessarily expect any advice. It feels good to flush out some thoughts though.

Dating as a trans woman:

I'm a 25 year old trans woman who has been having a slow medical transition over the last 4 years. I have not socially come out yet to my employer or distant acquitances / distant relatives. My immediate relatives are aware that I'm trans but are unsupportive. For these reasons, I started medically transitioning while holding the boat off on socially transitioning until I'm in a financially more secure position. 

As for most of everyone else, dating is a human need for me too. 

I'm a bit at a crossroads of how to approach the issue with a potential date mate.

Physically, the changes are significant enough for them to see that I'm transitioning, so I have to be honest and tell. Which I'm not opposed to at all because I want them to get to know the real me and not some façade. 

There is a fear from my end that they won't be fully conscious of how heavy witnessing a transitioning process from close by is. They will need to be aware of the fact that I will undergo gender reassignment surgery at latest in two years and that this comes with a lengthy recovery. 

There is the fear that the other person will see my existence as a fetish and that they will not understand that I want to live my life as just a normal ordinary woman like there are a dime a dozen. 

There is a fear that they will want to touch my genitalia while I have not yet had my surgical bottom correction, which would cause me discomfort as I do not identify with my current set of genitals.

Sometimes I feel I should put dating off until the entire process is behind me and I'm physically done with everything (vagina in place, socially transitioned etc.) but then I think to myself that I can't be the only one who has ever gone through this thing. Through this ambiguous dating nightmare. Then I'm thinking to myself that there must be someone out there who will want to rock my world and look further than the medical fiasco that I'm currently experiencing. 

Then I have hope that I will find someone who will be willing to stay by my side for the long haul and stay with me through the entire process and afterwards.

But then the headache starts of how to express your situation correctly to that person and where to find that person.

So then I'm back at square 1 and think to myself: just wait until it's over and you have completed your transition. You will have less explanation to do as a fully transitioned woman than as an early transition woman.

Dating is never easy but it's even worse if you have to go through it as a trans woman who is mainly into men.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu4616/dating_as_a_closeted_trans_woman_who_is_medically/

Or if one of us organises a date it always ends up not happening. I will try get their number or snapchat after showing interest, then they will take hours to day(s) to reply after a little time chatting.  I'm at a loss here.

85,qu537o,1636940895,Stuck between wanting to text her daily and not wanting to be the guy that's chasing or repels,"Hey guys, i really needed some advice and positive/constructive input on this 

Im 27 (m) and we matched online a few days ago, (shes 24). Weve been talking every day since which has been really nice and we even video chat when we both are free. The vibes are there and were going on a official date on Thursday. (3 days from now) and she told me how excited she is about this 

Backstory: Turns out she hasn't been on a date in a year (since she ended a long term relationship last year) and she shared with me that I'll be the first date shes been on in a year and she feels like she trusts me and would love to go out with me 

Main Point: I'm in this headspace where I high key want to talk to her each day and hear how her day is going and just connect; but i also know that doing THAT can also be what could cause some women to lose interest. I don't get attached quickly to people and im not one of those guys who NEEDS to talk to someone on a constant basis (I have a life and I  run two businesses and barely have time to see my friends in my own personal life) but I like to hear from her and just know how shes doing.

Is that wrong or needy? 

I havent heard from her today, which is fine (she told me the day prior that she was gonna be busy going to a rodeo with her parents and family)  but I still felt kinda bummed to not hear from her at all. I sent a text (i had to ask her a question about something she told me she liked a couple days ago) and she replied, which was nice but havent heard from her the rest of the day. Which again is fine bc i know we all have busy days

But I struggle with understanding the texting rules. Idk if sending double texts are acceptable and i dont wanna come across as needy if i dont hear from her tomorrow.

Is sending a ""hey was thinking about you today and hope you had a great day."" text acceptable or should i just not text her again and wait for a reply 

What if shes one of those girls who likes when a guy double texts bc it shows initiative?

Im obviusly thinking too much into this but i wanted to know at what point is it okay to want to hear from someone and it become annoying",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu537o/stuck_between_wanting_to_text_her_daily_and_not/
86,qu53f2,1636940913,i can’t tell if im in the right with an argument or if my hormones are messing with my head.,"(19f) i brought to my boyfriend’s attention some things that were bothering me from today. (i don’t want to go into specifics bc i know he was in the wrong for it but i don’t want the incident to overshadow the context of this post) 
it started with him noticing something was wrong so i told him i was angry at abc and he kind of sat there and just said “okay”. no apology, no other acknowledgement of my feelings in the situation, nothing. just “okay” and he kind of turned away. i kind of tried to converse about it but he seemed to not understand why i was upset about it. after the same response again i decided to go cool off in the bedroom bc i was getting agitated at this point. he came in after about 30 min and asked if i wanted to talk so we started talking again. i told him why i was frustrated, again, and he essentially just asked if there was anything else bugging me. i told him yes and explained the lesser thing bugging me and he ended up barely acknowledging my concerns, yet again. 

im still getting worked up at this point and i’m now wondering if he was actually acknowledging (in his own weird way) and i’m just hormonal right now, or if he was seriously just not being cognitive of my issues. 

he ended up hyper-focusing on the lesser issue i’d brought up and started asking questions and getting defensive all the while im just sitting there getting more and more worked up bc it’s not the issue i really care about. 

the conversation ended with me telling him that i was upset that he didn’t understand why i was upset after telling/explaining to him a dozen times. i got up and locked myself in the bathroom. 

idk i feel like he’s trying and i’m hormonal (pms a week before my period) but i also know i’m the type of person to put the blame on myself for these kinds of things. i want to stay mad bc i feel like i have a good reason to be mad and want an apology from him, but i hate when we fight and i hate being mad at him in general.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu53f2/i_cant_tell_if_im_in_the_right_with_an_argument/
87,qu53w7,1636940954,How do you feel if someone has sex with you right after they had sex with someone else?,"This is a question for all genders. I'm talking in the same day, maybe even in the same hour. I think my FWB does that sometimes, but I've never asked. The reason I suspect it is because he came over with two condoms one time, instead of the usual 3-pack still in the box. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I'm guilty of this too but I've always felt *guilty* when I've done it, and really try not to make a habit of fucking two guys in the same day. I have no problem with him seeing other people but something about him seeing me right after someone else feels very dirty to me even though I always use a condom with him.

I just think maybe im getting a little overwhelmed by everything happening in my life. Im a 21M currently working almost full time as a server and full time college and the stresses at both of these places is just driving me crazy.

I got rejected a few days ago by a girl i really liked ,(she was actually a customer i served lol) and while ive processed it and know where i went wrong. Id be a liar if i said i didnt cry about it at work and when i got home that night i had to stop myself from crying in front of my remaining tables that night.

I just dont really feel like ill ever be enough, ive been rejected by countless number of girls for various reasons and it doesnt help that i dont really have friends or family to talk about these kind of things. Asian families dont really talk about this kind of thing so i have to resort to reading and videogames to help numb the pain. I go the gym i have a skincare routine im working on trying to be an active listener and fixing my flaws but sometimes i just wish i had a girl to kind of pick me up after a long day of work and uni.

Im trying to love myself i really am, its just hard when it feels like im all on my own with no one really to confide in. I guess all i can just do is just hope things get better :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu58tf/is_it_normal_to_just_not_feel_good_enough_or/

93,qu5n2i,1636942638,Confused about how I feel,"I met this girl last year in college befroe covid. I got her number a few weeks before we were sent home and away from each other. We kept in touch throughout the summer and began dating each other in the Fall. We're from the same state but on opposite sides, so our dating situation was always distanced. Dating was and is new to her, I just started dating just a few year ago myself. We're both 23 years old.
I finished school and she graduates in a year. We've seen each other as many times as possible this year and have told each other that we want to make things official and exclusive. But there are some problems. Her friend group seems to be influencing her in a weird direction that I'm not sure how to respond to. She's been drinking alot lately &amp; hitting me up while drunk. We've both had our share of intoxicated moments with/around each other since we started dating but it's starting to become a major turn off. It's kinda disgusting knowing how much she's been drinking and frankly it's not a good look for someone that I'd like to call my girlfriend. So I've been ignoring the late drunk texts and calls because I'm simply not entertained. Acting like I don't care as much, when i really do. She's also displayed a lack of discipline and some insecurities in other areas as well.
We aren't perfect and I'm certainly not. I'm willing to help her in certain areas and I expect the exact same in return because that's what I think relationships is good for. I've given her some encouragement in the past and I'll continue to because I do care about her. I don't even know if I'm asking for advice, maybe I just want to hear someone else's view before I talk to her about these things. My bro says that when I bring it up to her, I shouldn't have a critical tone of voice but I'm annoyed by her behavior.
Mind you, I typically haven't been badgering her about anything but she's been complaining about why we don't talk as much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qu5n2i/confused_about_how_i_feel/
94,qu5rpc,1636943049,"Best sex of my life, insane chemistry/connection. She seemed completely into me, now basically unresponsive. That's not the problem, the problem is how much this consumes me","Short story is I had a one night stand that blew my mind. The spark was there, which is pretty rare for me. Most of the time I'm lukewarm, then every 2-3 years I meet one that I really connect with. I've never been so instantly attracted to someone, the sex was incredible. She left the next morning and we made out at the car, all seemed right. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then she's slow to respond over text, so I leave it alone for a few days. Then I ask her to meet up again, no response. That part's fine. I should just be pumped I had a great night of sex with an incredibly hot girl, but instead I'm fucking anxious all day. It consumes me. I don't mind being rejected, and I never double text. If they don't seem interested I let it go. But this felt like a real connection, hard to find chemistry. So it's harder for me to let it go. I find myself unable to focus on other things. It affects my appetite, I can't enjoy my day, and I don't wanna do anything. I keep incessantly checking my phone to see if she responds.

We kind of fell out of touch since graduating, however, she is now single again, and honestly I've never really been over her, smh.
