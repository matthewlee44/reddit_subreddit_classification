1,mwwt6e,1619188971,"""I wish there were more people like you""","I mean... *why?* What's the reason people tell you this?

Ugliness? I don't think so. People around me (all of my friends in short) tell me they wanted to look like me, and I hear like, A LOT, parents, friends, ex-gf comparing me to a young Rodrigo Santoro and some other famous people that are kinda handsome (my alias on university was Hollywood). Me myself, if I had to rate me as a whole, I guess id be 8/10, I don't find me as pretty as other people say, I mean, I guess there's a lot of people out there prettier than me, but the ones around me usually tell I'm an almost perfect 10/10 (Not trying to brag ofc, but if I sounded arrogant or smtg I apologize).

I used to be a nice guy and that was getting me tired af, I used to be a insecure people pleaser, and nobody wanted to be my friend except when personal interests were on the table. I worked on myself and now I live a pretty happy life, I do a lot of hobbies, go to the gym, eat healthy food, but I'm also kinda nerdy, I love to read, watch movies, learn about politics, I really like meaningful and good talks with people that are inteligent and interested on the world. 

People find me funny and cool, and everyone likes being around me without second hand interests, I have people calling me to hang out with them as friends and wanting me close to them, and It really shakes my heart because for so long on my teens people didn't liked me a lot, and now I'm living a good life on a good place, with a good job and people that really care about me by my side... it's a pretty good feeling.

BUT, since life isn't a bed of roses, I struggle a lot at having a relationship. I'm only 21, and altough I never really cared a lot of depending of someone to be happy, nowadays I'm getting a huge frustration because of that. It seems that nobody wanna date me, you know? I mean, I already dated like, 3 times on my entire life? So it's not like I'm a newcomer. 

""I wish there were more guys like you out there"" is probably the thing I've heard the most before they broke-up or when trying to win someone over. From my 3 datings, 2 broke up with me after a year or so with the same talk.

The first one broke up with me to hang out with an abusive guy that beat her up and don't let her talk to anyone else neither hang out with friends, we almost lost contact but sometimes she creates fake accounts to talk to their friends on secret, including me, and she tells me all the time ""I wish there were more people like you out there. You was the one that gave me the happiest years of my life, and I guess I still love you, but attraction is attraction, I love this new dude too, but I recognize breaking up with you to date this guy was one of the worst choices I made in my life"".

The second one was kinda fair, she exchanged me for a small team basketball player, and well, she tells me she's happy with him... and that's fine.

I mean, why girls tell me ""I want someone like you, but not you"" all the time? My friends all have girlfriends and some even are getting married, and girls use to hit on them all the time when we're hanging out, and I'm really really happy for them for real, but I don't know why this happens to me. Like I said, I don't care a loooooot to that, but it's pretty frustrating seeing all of your dudes getting engaged on cute carefull relationships with people that really like them romantically while you is stuck at loneliness

It's very uncomfortable being the only one who's asked ""Man, for REAL that you don't have a girlfriend?"" by my friends and parents, But mainly my the people I try to hang out, it's kinda like:

She: Man, you're so cool, funny, hot and interesting, I wish there were more guys like you/I wish I dated someone like you/The woman who'll date you clearly have a gold mine on their hands 

Me: But... I am someone like me.

She: I mean, you, but... not you... you know?

Me: ***?***

Hi guys, F21 here. Dated a guy briefly this winter, but we both agreed to not pursue a relationship. However he’s a great guy and we are still good friends, and I do want to keep it this way.

Unfortunately, and of course i feel sooo stupid about this, I still have some feelings for him. We talk a lot, he cares a lot about me and he’s pretty sweet to me as well. It feels like we are still more than friends, and sometimes kind of like he’s my boyfriend.

So I’m struggling with this, and I think that the best option is that I lose my feelings for him asap. 

The weirdest thing about this is that I dont think we’d work as a couple at all. We’re very different, he’s not my type looks wise, and he’s not a perfect person (me neither obviously). However we still have suprisingly great chemistry, and I keep thinking about couple-y things I want to do with him. 

TLDR; Do not want to date this guy, but still have feelings for him. Do not want to cut all ties either. Any experiences/tips?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwx32a/is_it_possible_to_lose_feelings_for_someone/

I have used dating apps to meet girls for about 2 years now. All of the dates I’ve been on and girls I talked to never led to a real relationship. But I just keep on trying I guess. Anyways I haven’t been on a date in months technically not since 2020. I’ve been on and off dating apps these past couple of months. And I’ve been in this really weird drought lately. I haven’t been getting a lot of matches. And the matches I do make our conversation never really goes anywhere. I use apps like hinge, tinder, bumble. And even ok Cupid (when I’m really desperate) I know online dating for lesbian is hard but I’ve never had this much difficulty. My question is how do I get more matches?

12,mwy0v6,1619192274,I got burned again and don’t know what to do or how to trust again. Is there any hope?,"Hi. I’ll try to keep this brief.

I’m (26F) pretty old school. I don’t date multiple people at once. For me, exclusivity is both a matter of respect and trust. 

I matched with a guy (29M) online and really hit it off. 
I mean. We spent three months texting non stop daily before our first date. I didn’t force him to do it. I wasn’t forced either. It just happened that way. 
And three months in and countless deep conversations- I told him that, if we date, I’m the kinda girl who expects something serious. Casual just isn’t for me. I also was open to him about the fact that my previous experiences (my exs) I caught them all cheating. So, the exclusivity rule, and focus on trust, honesty, communication and respect is a big deal for me. 

Out of respect for him I wanted him to be sure what he was signing up for. And he agreed. Despite my warning him of having trust issues. (I want to be fair. Anyone should know what they’re signing up for. The good and bad. But please know that I really have been working hard to heal my traumas and trust issues. Which is why I’m so straightforward about them and my needs/expectations and boundaries.)

Anyway. 3 months of talking and we both had already agreed that we aren’t talking to anyone else, seeing anyone else or intimate with anyone else. And we finally meet for our first date. It goes swimmingly. Really good. We have another. Also good. And we agree on dating exclusively again- and that we have deleted our dating profiles. We continue to date and talk daily, until I noticed a shift. It was like he had become complacent. Like suddenly now that he “got me” he didn’t bother trying anymore. All the sweet stuff and effort seemed to be zapped. 

Talked to him about it and he started insisting that that’s just how he is. He’s not soft. We back and forth on this a bit because I point out that the sweet stuff and effort was there in the three months before we met and in the first dates. Unless is was an act?

He insists it wasn’t. Just was out of character. 

I decide to concede here. Because I realize. Hey. Everyone has their hurdles. Maybe he’s going through something? 

Meanwhile I’m doing my own work on myself toward growing from an anxious attachment style to a secure one- I figured. It’s fine. I can live without the sweet stuff and affection, without the reassurances or the validations... I am a strong and confident woman who has a lot to offer. I got this!

Well... I thought I did. I was doing ok. And continuing learning about attachment styles and healing and growth. I realized the guy I’m dating might be a dismissive avoidant. So I made sure to be especially considerate of him and careful so as not to trigger him. 

We continue dating and I learn to be more confident and ask for what I want or need. To not shy away from telling him how I feel while also being mindful to ask him how he feels. Checking in with him
Trying to make sure not to overstep any of his boundaries or limits in a way that is proactive and yet soft. Not aggressive. 

We seem to work it out. 

Until I found out that he’s back on tinder.
So... after 3 months of talking, and 4 months of dating exclusively, I found out he reactivated or made a new profile and is back on tinder...

Behind my back. 

I was crushed. It felt like such a blow. Especially knowing my prior history. After all the effort. The commitment and everything. It felt disrespectful too. 
And then I committed by bigger mistake. I decided to check his Instagram because I noticed his following and followed count had been increasing very fast lately. And I realized it’s all been girls. And that’s when I felt totally knocked out. 

So. I messaged him about it in a calm manner asking him for the honest truth about the whole situation because I didn’t want to jump to conclusions. 

He fessed up to the dating profile. He says he hasn’t talked or dated or been intimate with anyone from there at all. I choose to believe that he’s telling the truth for the most part, but idk. 

And furthermore. I really care about him. So I told him he has a choice. I’m giving him a chance. We can work things out and continue dating or call quits. 

Hw says he wants to continue. We both do..

We talk more about how we feel. Open honest communication. And I lay down some hard truths and boundaries on him. 

-If we do this. It’s exclusive. You have to be willing to delete any and all dating profiles. And honestly, it’s doing to take work for us to rebuild trust. So, know what you’re signing up for. 

He agrees. 

We return again to the topic of what happened and why. In essence he doesn’t even know why he did it either. Like it was a bad decision at a bad and stressful time. 

He continues to say that he really didn’t sleep or do anything with anyone. 

But then he keeps saying that his words are worthless given his actions and having been caught in his dishonesty. And that I won’t believe him anyway. 

Like he’s resigned and expecting that I’m done. 

Granted. I do have a hard time believing those new girls he’s following on Instagram aren’t from tinder... so I explained to him my reservations. Why I feel anxious and triggered. My logic behind it. Why I interpreted it the way I did. 

He says they’re either from school or friends of friends. That he’s trying to network given that he never had the opportunity to before. But I have a hard time believing that. 

You don’t just randomly add someone you don’t know just because you have a mutual friend. Especially if the accounts are private. And I don’t know. My gut says some of those profiles are definitely “met on tinder” ....

Anyway. That’s not even the point. 

My issue is. 

I really have feelings for this guy. 

And I don’t know what to do. 

-Is it possible to rebuild trust? And if so, how?


-Am I being an idiot giving him a second chance?

13,mwy45r,1619192530,I want to share my story in hopes of getting advice. I'm extremely frustrated.,"I am 26 f, conventionally attractive although a bit overweight right now (but nothing I can't get rid of as my weight tends to fluctuate a lot anyway). I never had a real relationship until I was about 20 because I lived in a home with very restrictive rules at the time. I met this guy, got into a relationship and subsequent engagement, where he proved to be emotionally abusive and toxic as all heck. For example, I was working minimum wages jobs and he was forcing me to go into debt to pay for our wedding- myself- no help from him. When I bought my wedding dress, he called me up and verbally berated me until I cried. Etc etc.

Well about the age of 21/22 I dumped him before he drove me nuts. I got a slightly better job working AP at a big electronics store. The assistant manager there, a man about 12 years my senior took a liking to me, unfortunately. He ended up preying on me in my emotionally vulnerable state and I foolishly jumped into a relationship with him that ended up being even worse, by orders of magnitude. This person was a narcissist, textbook. Maybe worse. He ended up raping me and also cheating on me with a 17 year old- a girl literally half his age. Classy.

Well, after those two incidents, I was real messed up mentally and emotionally. I had straight up PTSD from the second guy for a while. It's been going on 6 years since all that, and I can't go on a date. Yes, I have had therapy. But maybe not enough, because the idea of going on a date gives me such a fear response that I can feel my heart rate rise as I type. I'm also demisexual, for whatever it's worth, and need emotional connection to experience attraction or desire. So that doesn't help, really. 

It's been 6 years like I said, since I went on a single date. The only thing holding me back is the terrible fear and past associations of bad things. However at 26, almost 27, I'm lonely, and worried about fertility (I want to have kids). I don't want to be a spinster. But I'm happiest on my own where no one can hurt me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwy45r/i_want_to_share_my_story_in_hopes_of_getting/

She started being uncooperative negotiating how far she has to drive and she only has an hour to meet and I told her that it looks like you rather be at work have fun. And she says I have to go there no matter what. I told her you’re disrespectful and she said how. I told her I canceled my plans to see you and she said ""what the hell why would you do that 🤦‍♀️"".

20,mwyma8,1619193895,Thoughts on taking a 2 week break?,"I (M20) am just in a stressful position with the end of the semester and sometimes this relationship hits bumps over stupid and menial things. We’ve been together 8 months. Overall, I think we’re both fairly mature people. I think sometimes my stress leaks into the relationship, which results in more stress, creating a feedback loop.

I want to ask my girlfriend (F19)for a week or two of a break where I can just focus on school and getting proper rest because this relationships has been stressing me out recently which just makes it hard to focus on anything. The thing is I know her and she’s very insecure. I’ve been with no one but her and she thinks the reason I’m with her is because I have not experienced anything or anyone better. She is going to think that I’ve met someone or I am trying to find, date, or fuck other people but I am not. She’s not going to believe me, not because there’s any indication of that sort of thing from me, but because she’s been cheated on in the past. She was also in a position where she told her previous gf that they needed a break, and she then proceeded to break up with her. 

She also broke down the other day because she had a nightmare about me moving on from her and falling for someone else. I just have a feeling that me throwing the possibility of having a break out there would just implode the whole situation and cause irreparable damage.

We went to the park as our first date and it was a bit awkward at first but I'd say it went well. He told me he had a good time after, and we texted for the rest of the day/night, we also planned the movies next. 
But recently he's been acting weird over text, he sounds like he's nonchalant over text? Or his responses aren't really giving 100%? I always have to text him first to initiate conversation. We also don't really call anymore. It's been like 3/4 days since we called and we've only been texting strictly. This kinda makes me uneasy and confused if he's interested or not because he throws mixed signals?

So I’ve been talking to this guy. He was a friend from college and we caught feelings for each other and hit it off. (We’re long distance btw) I’m really consistent in texting/calling him but he isn’t the best with communicating. One day I got really upset because for a few days he was barely talking to me I told him that and he was super apologetic that he made me feel that way. He said he was really busy with school and that why. This past week he was moving and had midterms and hasn’t texted me a SINGLE time this whole week. Not even once. I myself was moving a few weeks ago so I know it’s hectic but I would still respond to him and text every time. Is this a fair excuse for him, like am I being to hard on him or needy for not calling/texting me at all this whole week?? We’re not officially in a relashionship yet so I guess he dosent owe me a lot of communication but i’m scared that when I do get into a relationship with him that this long distance thing isn’t going to work based on how bad he is at texting me now. Should I depend that things going to change when we start dating? Am I asking for too much? Can he really be THIS busy to not reach out to me a single time?

We had been talking ever since. We've hung out twice in person, no sex but have done other things and have had a sleepover. Early on he told me he used to be a ""manwhore"" in his early 20s (his words not mine), has slept with 50+ women, partied a lot, and used to lie and manipulate to get his way. These days he claims he's a changed guy. Obviously I took this with a grain of salt.

One late night last week I revealed to him that I still thought he was trying to play me. Probably not the best thing to say but it happened. He said that he wasn't and would have said ""everything I wanted to hear"" if he was just trying to sleep with me. Fast forward to today and he tells me that he thinks it's best we stay as friends because I clearly have some ""inner resistance"" and trust problems. He still wants to hang out with me.

Quick backstory, I met this guy off of tinder back in September/October 2020. We talked for a few weeks and our first date went great. We texted after but then he went mute. Then he’d text me saying “hey sorry i’ve been super busy let’s go out”. Ok fine we go out, great again! But what happens? He goes mute, mind you this entire time i’m stalking his instagram. I reach out because I was feeling super lonely. This mf didn’t even recognize my number OR NAME and said all of his contacts were lost. I let it go and we hooked up. It was absolutely trash lol. He reached out to hangout a few days later and it was late so I used that as an excuse to not go. His next text (a few weeks later) is “I’m available on X”. I simply say “I’m not” and I got no response. I check his instagram (at this point we are following each other) and he’s having a movie date with some girl (holding hands). At that point I was completely over it and unfollowed him. This happened all from September until like February of this year. Now, this past Monday he texts me “Hey. Ive been thinking about you”. I laughed!!! I didn’t respond. He texts me again Wednesday with “👀”. Sir, I AM GHOSTING YOU.

Did I think maybe I should just say I’m not interested. Maybe I should give myself good karma. But this douchebag has been so manipulative and gaslighting me. Moral of the story, sometimes you just have to GHOST.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx0jok/i_ghosted_him/

He’s my best friend from college and I can tell you guys the story of you wanna know but I just didn’t know how nice people could be. One major thing for me is that I don’t like giving oral sex, I’m extremely uncomfortable about it and after some really negative forceful past experience I don’t think I ever could go about it. I always thought guys would never wanna be with me because of that and I understand the whole reciprocating thing. I don’t even care to receive oral but he said he likes to so that’s cool I guess lmfao. Anyway when I painfully and awkwardly told him his response was basically telling me that he doesn’t want me to even think about it, and that he’d be real cross with me if I tried. Idk at that point I was tears because no one has ever really cared so much about how I feel it’s just so new. He’s my first ever real boyfriend and I’m 20, kinda embarrassing I know. But I’ve just been scolded in the past or just disrespected by me. for my own feelings as well as likes and dislikes. I’m honestly just saying I’m utterly shocked. I think I need to be more open minded about the people on this planet and if anyone out there shares the same “oral sex fear” as me, know that it’s gonna feel like hell to talk about it at first but if they’re a decent person, you shouldn’t have any problems.

39,mx1cuk,1619201321,Any “sweet” guys ever gone all Count of Monte Cristo later in life?,"When I was in my twenties, I thought the key to getting sex was to be in a relationship.  This meant always being super respectful on first dates, usually not going for a kiss till the second date, and if I was really, really lucky there’d be sex on the third date, and maybe after that the woman would want to be my girlfriend.  And since I was looking for a girlfriend, I was always kind, thoughtful, and emotionally available.  I was truly “myself” on dates.  I would also try to only date one woman at a time, and focus all my attention on that woman.

And every single time I got rejected.  Then I became roommates with a guy who was really good looking.  Women would just approach him and want to have sex with him without him even having to do anything.  He was just hot.  And seeing that changed my life.

I’m 35 now.  I work out six days a week and eat healthy.  I’ve found a hairstyle I like and clothes that complement my physique.  And I’ve now slept with more women than I can remember.  I’ve already fucked five this year.  I don’t even know how many times I’ve been that “emotionally unavailable” guy at this point.  “Not looking for anything serious right now, but happy to keep doing what we’re doing.”  Most of the time that line will get you a few more fucks, at least.

What’s sad is, I was a really nice guy.  I still am.  But that’s not how the game works, so I did what I had to do and act how I need to act to get laid.  It is what it is.

Now I do not know if I was wrong to assume he was only having sex with me. I thought all of that meant I was the only one. I was wrong. He was having casual sex with other girls all along. I was so naïve and maybe my lack of experience with this hookup culture added to it. 

Why was he so inconsiderate of my feelings? How did he have the heart to sleep with other people and lead me on like that? Nothing is making sense. Now I am just laying here wondering why I was not enough for him to commit. Why was I not good enough for him to develop feelings for me?

Been seeing this girl for like 3 weeks now that I met on tinder, it looks like she likes me a lot and she had said herself lots of time, we already had sex,not the best sex cause I was nervous but she understood,still texting and talki ng with her the other day I ask her a question via text I wanted to ask her in person but she kept saying just tell me here through text I asked her so what do you even want with me or what do you expect this thing we have going on with to end up in and she said she gonna answer me that in person. We saw each other again and she answer me that in person she said that I am relationship material and she wish she was ready but now she said she is not ready cause she got out of a 3 year longterm relationship and she still gets mad about her ex from time to time and thinks about him and she doesnt want to put me in that position and also that she is super busy with work and school, that we can keep seeing each other like we were doing till she feels ready that we should take things slow I said I was down for that,no problem.


 We had a conversation about tinder in which end up both of us deleting our apps in person even tho we are not exclusive yet, she said she likes me a lot that she is not looking for anything in tinder I said the same but here is when things dont add up atleast to me, I reinstalled the app a few days later just to see if she was active there (I got a lot trust issues due to past experience with women so I always try to see if the next one is lying) the only way I know to see if someone still active in tinder is if their location changes and hers is changing even tho Im not even moving her tinder one day says 7 miles then 1 mile away.


 Days later I posted a video on my IG storie (btw she is always the 1st one to watch my stories and comment most of the time) about a guy using tinder while his date went to the bathroom and she commented my storie saying ""thats you on tinder"" and I said no I deleted it tinder and she said I deleted mine too she said she deleted it so I dont get jealous and also due to respect each other I believe her but yet her Tinder location keeps changing even tho I always open the app in the same location(my house).My question here is, is she lying or does tinder change location even if you are not using the app or dont have the app installed.If she lying then why would she still be using tinder if she said she is not ready for a relationship yet suggest to keep seeing each other etc, I even told her in person when she said why she was not ready for a relationship that everytime I hear that is problably cause she is letting me down easy or rejecting me and she said trust me is not that I like you if I did not liked you,I would not be wasting my time seeing you. 



Another confusing thing is she gets jealous for the slighest thing I post on IG even tho we are not exclusive then she said she is just playing then the other day told me ""so you are in IG posting stuff and entering whatsapp but dont even text me? If you dont wanna talk just say it and we dont waste our time"" even tho I did text her that day.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx1lx8/is_she_lying/

But I told him I wasn’t interested in anal sex, when we were in bed, he was naked, and had my clothes on, I took it off because he asked me to and I didn’t think it would drive him to do something. He grabbed me and pushed me down the bed, I told him not to put it in and he said ok. Even though I felt he did, I kept saying no but he said “this isn’t me putting it in” even though I wanted to believe he is right. I felt like it was in and I got even more nervous, he put it in suddenly the first time, I wanted him to listen to me so I kept saying please no I wanted him to understand. But he kept saying “I didn’t put anything in” he did it the 2nd time. Even before all this he went to his bag and when I asked “what did you get?” He said “none of your business” then I looked at the dark and asked “did you get a condom?” He said “yes”. I’m not sure if this is rape or no, was it considered rape? Or was it an assault? What’s the right word for it? Anyway, I couldn’t sit around any longer so I called a cab even though he said he would
Take me back. But I couldn’t wait until 4 pm, so I left, before I left, he said. “I’m sorry if I was harsh on you.” I just didn’t say anything and I walked out of the door.

What was this? Sorry again. Thank you, it’s been eating at me all day since then.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx2n3k/something_happened_a_few_days_ago_im_not_sure_if/

I'm 22, Male and I'm Asexual (I do not feel sexual attraction to anyone, however I am not Aromantic which is the lack of a want to be in a romantic relationship)

Long story short, I've never been in a romantic relationship in my life. When I turned 20 this really started bothering me in a meaningful way. Call me a late bloomer, but all of a sudden I developed a really bad crush on a girl at university but because I have no experience and the fact I had really bad body issues at the time, I didn't even try to pursue it.

After this I started working hard on improving my mental and physical self image, which included losing weight which I have done somewhat (I'm still chubby but not outright fat anymore) and I've tried to work on my mentality to think better of myself which has also worked. The problem is whenever I meet a girl who I'd like to get to know better I always end up telling myself that it's come too soon and that I haven't yet done enough for anyone to want to be with me, this also keeps me away from any kind of online dating too. I don't know if I'm putting barriers up because I'm inexperienced and scared to take the first leap but it's been a mental block I've been struggling with for about 6 months now and I'm finding it hard to overcome.

60,mx42xn,1619208943,Why do men treat me like shit? I thought I was attractive...idk.,"Feeling like scum on the ground right now...

I (23F) met this man (27M) on Bumble. I'm finishing my last semester of college, he's in his first year of residency (a doctor). We started talking on the app, and right away he asked for my number, moving the conversation to text. He would only text once per day. I instantly got a crush on him even before we met, he was so cute and a very handsome doctor haha! I felt lucky as a college student to be going on dates with someone like him.

He asked me out, and we went and got dinner within a week of matching. I have to say, I felt like before we went on our date I really didn't know much about him at all. His texts were super, super, superficial and he only texted once per day. I thought this was because he was working 80+ hours per week. He is super busy, after all.

Immediately after the first date, he texted me asking if I wanted to come over to his place next time to cook and watch a movie. I said I would love to. I was traveling for the holidays for two weeks though, so we weren't able to have our second date for three weeks after the first date. We did stay in contact those two weeks, although again, it was extremely superficial. He texted me once every 1-2 days, and often it was just a short sentence; we didn't learn anything new about each other. 

On our second date, I instantly got the vibe that he was being extremely flirtatious. He didn't really ask things about myself; rather the vibe was just very fun and flirty. We started watching the movie on his couch, and he started kissing my forehead and holding my hand. I really liked it, and pretty soon we were on his bed making out. I’m a virgin with past sexual trauma so sexy things can be difficult for me. I told him I had sexual boundaries, and he said he wanted to respect those boundaries and make me feel safe. He was pretty assertive/a teensy bit aggressive though with trying to touch my chest. I did have to tell him more than once to stop doing that. When we took a break from kissing to watch the movie he asked if he could put his hand in my bra and play with my nipples. I thought that was a little weird but just thought this guy was super into touching boobs haha.

Once we got up from the bed and I was getting ready to leave, he kept kissing me in very loving ways. He kissed my forehead, put his arms around me, and while we were cleaning up from the cooking, he kept kissing me randomly. I really thought this guy was super into me. He walked me home, and before he dropped me off at the door, he pulled down my mask and gave me the biggest, sexiest kiss ever. I loved it. He didn't ask for a third date though.

We kept texting for a few days after this second date. Again, the texting was very superficial and light. I really just thought he was a very bad texter. I texted him a few days later asking him to get together again. He took a few days to get back to me (not unusual for him), and he apologized for this saying work was super busy and he suggested a date which would be within 2 days.

I texted him asking him if he wanted to come over to my apartment and I could make dinner for him. He said that he already had dinner plans but would love to hang out after. He asked me if I wanted to just come to his apartment like I did last time. I said sure, although I was kind of disappointed. He didn't seem like he wanted to put in a lot of effort. I asked him what time he wanted me to come over, and then he responds an hour later stating that he was starting to not feel well after getting his COVID vaccine the day prior. I felt really sad; I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I then texted him two days later, asking him if he was still interested. I told him that he had seemed super interested on our second get-together with the kissing, but his texting and this past weekend were giving me the vibe that he wasn't interested. He responded apologizing for his lack of communication and told me that he had an awesome time the last time we got together, but that due to his schedule the next few weeks with his residency he didn't have time to hang out and ""give me the time and energy I deserve."" He also said ""But I hope we may be able to hang out in the future"". This was three weeks ago. I haven't heard from him since. I just don't understand why a guy would be so sweet and give me loving and caring touches and kisses on a date, and then just never want to see me again. What did I do wrong? Was it me or was he just not looking for a relationship? I'm definitely looking to have a serious relationship with someone, but I had never stated that to him. In the beginning, he had seemed like he was willing to put in effort because he biked to a restaurant that was super close to my place on the first date, but then the effort got less and less. He had seemed so eager to see me again on the first date, but after the second date everything dwindled. What happened? Some people have suggested to me he only wanted sex, but if he just wanted sex, why not just ask a random girl on tinder to come over? Why meet a girl for dinner and cook with her if you’re just looking to fuck?

Fast forward three months later, we end up matching on Bumble. I reach out via text to tell him “Hey, I saw we matched on bumble, how have you been?” and he literally just never responds 😢 I could cry so hard right now. I wish he had thought our kissing was wonderful and wanted to do it again. I wish he didn’t just ditch and kick me to the curb.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx42xn/why_do_men_treat_me_like_shit_i_thought_i_was/

For the record, I'm asexual and would like to know if the concept of a guy wishing to protect you, take care of you and impress you and act like a stereotipically manly man sounds to you as a modern, liberated woman like a cringeworthy, old-fashionable and even laughable and out-of-place thing.

For a partner, probably you would prefer a feminine, metrosexual guy who you would share hobbies, literature and general life viewpoints that better relate to yours i.e. he does your makeup, paints your nails, wear lingerie (look it up, it's quite common) is very much in touch with pop culture, celebrities, women fashion (he can even give you tips on your dresscode) loves broidery, cats and knowlegeable about periods and feminine higiene. You can have a nice girl talk 9ver a glass of wine. Doesn't it sound like a better dream partner as far as modern life/society is concerned? Wouldn't it provide a better bond, harmony and chemistry in your relationship?

For the women who disagree with this and prefer man to be traditionally man, are you from a traditional, conservative area/family/country who wishes to preserve that? Are you not influenced by the society, ""gender norm"" shift and modern life?

However, now we’re together (we live only 15 minutes away from each other) but I feel like we’re growing apart.

When I read about things couples do or how they feel loved, special, cared for- i can’t relate at all. i know it all seems prettier online, but i rarely ever feel that way with him anymore. He doesn’t go out of his way to make me feel better regardless of the love language. He doesn’t go down on me for long enough (physical touch), keeps checking his phone when we’re together (quality time), gives really generic, basic compliments (words of affirmation) acts of service and gift-giving are only reserved for special occasions. words of affirmation is relatively higher, however it’s my last love language so it just doesn’t cut it for me. 

on top of that, while we had broken up and were still talking to each other, he kept lying to me(which he later admitted to when i confronted him about it). that just makes me not wanna confide in him anymore. we did have a long talk regarding his lying and he is going to therapy for it, but i just don’t think i can ever achieve any sort of vulnerability with him on my behalf.

i do really cherish him though and i wanna make this work. i’ve spoken to him regarding me feeling under appreciated and the love language thing, but he’s generally bad with people so i think it takes him a while to get around to it ¿ but still, i would’ve appreciated little check-ins into our relationship, or small notes, or good morning voice notes. even when he takes me out on a treat or buys me something, it’s only after i’ve explicitly made it clear i want it. for my birthday, he just gave me what i’d given him for his birthday (a letter). 

any advice on how we can revive our romance would be great.

**Contestant #1**

6 months ago, meet a woman at a friends 30th birthday weekend getaway.  She instantly clings onto me, wants to go for walks alone.  I am thinking, ""woman where is your radar for safety with men you don't know?"" She declares us as soul twins on social media.  She declares the next week she wants to ""cuddle everyone"".  I suggest a threesome or an exotic bedroom lifestyle.  I wind up having to pick up a guy buddy later that day.  I mention he's the wrong person to have a threesome with, but we do lots of level setting and ground-rule setting beforehand.  He's just an extra on the movie set.  We have a threesome with the guy.  She thinks I am getting clingy and goes and hangs out with him the next weekend.  If I had the smaller penis, I would have been truly crushed.  I tell this woman, ""look I had a friend in college who wanted emotional intimacy and then slept around, can't do that,"" and then this woman takes this as an invitation to do exactly this.  She declares she never wants children.  She's 36.  Of all my over-30 friends, none of the advice stuck except they would tell me they wasted time (i.e. 2 years) waiting for someone to change.  The only advice that really stood out came from my 27 y/o friend.  I had to go back into the 20's to get out of this ball-crushing loop.  He said, ""dude every woman over 33 without kids is a loser.""  That helped.  Sorry single ladies over 33 :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Contestant #2**

===

A month and a half ago, I am fully in rebound mode from that heartbreak.  Dating again.  Multiple women in my ""rotation"".  Sorry ladies, it's not how it seems, it's called being single and we do it too sometimes.  My rules are 1) don't lie 2) try to be up-front so no one gets overly hurt.  I meet a girl with fake boobs and no tan lines on her buttcheeks.  Lol, I am smitten I guess?  I actually think nothing of it.  She throws herself at me night #1 kinda (this is usually how it happens for me, I guess).  She abruptly leaves my place because some neighbors of mine were partying on my building's roofdeck, and I connected with a neighbor who I hadn't talked to in months and got her number because we're now in a similar business situation.  This was construed as me ""getting a girls number"".  Fair claim, but not reality.

Ok.  I text this girl the next week asking to take her out properly.  I plan a great set of dates.  She is blown away and invites me on a trip she's going on in 2 weeks.  I agree and buy tickets.  I take off work.  For the next two week it feels hard to even see her.  She comes over for a party I throw and doesn't stay over.  She denies my attempts to cook her dinner before traveling to another country.  The next time I see her is 8a.m. as she's picking me up for the flight.  Hindsight is 20-20, this was my mistake to ignore this sign.

We go to another country to celebrate her friend's birthday.  She again gets defensive because I brought condoms because we were sleeping together w/o condoms.  I said I thought she was on her period and a dude always prepares.  It had been 4 weeks and she didn't want to see me before the trip (buddy said she might be on her period is why, it added up).  I spend much of the first night on vacation calming her anxieties and insist I am into her.  I take her onto the dance floor of some gay club and the entire club is cheering us on because no one else is dancing.  We both discuss we haven't been seeing or talking to anyone else since going on our dates.

The next day, we get pretty drunk.  She asks me to be her boyfriend.  We go back to where we were staying and basically she tells me she's been seeing another guy on the side who it sounds like she's into.  She says she wants a family though, and that's why it can't work with this guy.  I completely lose my shit in that moment.  I over-the-top lose my shit.  I messed up, but her games had worn me down, and so had the number of gay venues we were going to to please her friends.  It felt hard to communicate with her before the trip, and she even smelled like another guy the last time I had seen her before the trip.  I wasn't upset because it wasn't like I had significant feelings for her, but situationally her behavior seemed utterly careless and clueless for being 35.  It felt totally disrespectful to the efforts I was making and the risks I was taking.  

I wound up crying hysterically because it became obvious that it made no sense to continue this vacation with her and her group of friends.  I am decent at handling myself, but finding a random hotel not sober on a whim in a foreign country felt hard.  The attempt at love and romance felt as shattered as my track record for finding love and romance.  One of her friends was a total shithead toward the experience.  I wound up paying about $800 more than I had anticipated due to this.  Didn't make a stink of it over text.  Tried to keep drama to a minimum and just offer explanations of why that turned so bad over text.  Even tried to keep the door open, but let her know how extremely hurt I was.  She would rightfully have been angry, but there was zero dignity given to my side afterward.  Just plain ghosting like she did the first time when she thought I was getting ""a girl's number"" (my neighbor).

**Conclusions**

===

I tried to re-engage someone I was sleeping with before contestant #2 but she doesn't want to let herself be a rebound.  It's like, ""dude you're 39 you can't have kids, but you know I'm not an asshole to tell you that directly"".  I am just going to move forward with other women who were in my rotation prior.  It sucks hard, I am deeply heartbroken.  These were two bonafide attempts at love on my part in the last 6 months.  I am for sure vetting these women up-front.  I just gotta improve my discipline as the interest builds.  I shouldn't have gone through with that vacation with contestant #2 without having a talk before; I for sure tried but I tried to keep it ""casual and cool"" when she wasn't receptive to a talk which was a mistake since traveling with someone in month #1 isn't really casual and cool in terms of dating.  I did mentally think it could go sideways and of course I did basic research of where I was going.  With contestant #1 I did progressively react when she kept putting me in the emotionally intimate position and basically gaslit me to go down the road of sleeping around.

I'm just in disbelief and the older I get, these pains just turn me into yet another avoidant dude.

I know there's no such thing as a ""magical answer"", but I'm really curious about good ways to use my 3-4-5-6 photo slots.

And just a little observation: I know that there's no use in having a well-made profile (good pics, interesting bio, etc) if the owner has shitty conversation skills, bad personality, zero game, etc.  
But the reverse is also true. I mean... Imagine how horrible it is to be an interesting person who gets a lot of left swipes because of a poorly profile? I don't want it to happen with me, hahaha.

  
So... I'm just wondering what can I do with the photos section besides a bust shot and a full-body shot.

She actually did. We textet like 4 messages. Then again no response. The next morning (today) she again tells me she‘s sorry. I just kinda ignored it. Today we then send voice messages back and front and found a lot of things in common. Then suddenly again no respone anymore since 8 hours. Like i didnt say or do anything dumb or weird. Im not replying instantly. We just have a good conversation and she always just dips. I dont need to be texted 24/7 but this texting pattern is just weird to me.

It felt really romantic; she described the dates with me as the best she's ever had, she would talk about having sweet dreams about me, we'd have deep talks and shared almost everything about ourselves, and we slept together twice. There were no other problems either, we both had our lives going well and mutual friends and family thought we were cute together. However, after our second night together (which went really well), she comes back in a few hours the next day telling me out of the blue that she can't handle a relationship and only wants to be friends. From my experience, this means that the girl isn't interested anymore. Went no contact with her since and only heard from her once asking how I was doing and apologizing for what happened.

1. There could be a boom in dating!
Everyone haven't been able to meet people so maybe girls and guys alike will be eager to see each other and maybe people won't be as overly picky.

2. It get worse.
Mental health has declined for many people so there will probably be a massive increase of ghosting, conversations become more painful (I always get girls who cannot hold a conversation and expect me to carry it Pre-pandemic), and most likely people will be 10x as picky, overall dating will most likely become an even bigger cesspool than it already is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx6c0s/how_will_dating_be_affected_by_the_pandemic/
79,mx6gho,1619216072,Relationship ended and not sure how to process situation—was it my anxiety or did I have real cause for concern (30F /31M),"I was seeing this guy for about 6 weeks.

He asked me out to dinner after casually chatting for a few weeks. After that first dinner we started to see each other 2x a week for the next 6 weeks. These meetups mostly included going out to dinner &amp;amp; sometimes ordering in while watching a movie. He was always a gentleman, thoughtful, kind, did nice little sweet things for me (picking up my favorite candy to surprise me with, ordering me my fav. desert, keeping the car warm for me before picking me up) &amp;amp; treated me kindly. We did not get physically intimate until a month in although most of our dates ended up with me sleeping over at his place &amp;amp; him driving me home at 4am so I can make it to work the next day.

After a few weeks, I noticed he’s not the biggest texter ( isn’t this always the issue) We would text in between our dates but probably not as often as I had wanted. I had a chat with him about it &amp;amp; he assured me he just isn’t the biggest texter &amp;amp; that “ you know, you can always text me too”. I got the feel from the conversation that he genuinely didn’t think it was an issue. I felt calmed so I let it be. About 2-3 weeks in, he had mentioned he wasn’t seeing anyone else &amp;amp; I wasn’t either so we were exclusive.

After about 3 weeks in, my anxiety started to rise ( I struggle with anxiety-specificity in dating, some low self esteem &amp;amp; massive insecurity) One evening, while we were texting, he mentioned he wasn’t feeling well. I immediately came to the conclusion that he was trying to get out of a date we had planned the next day. I was so anxious I asked him if I can call him at the end of my shift (so I could get to the bottom of if he was faking “feeling sick” to get out of the date or not) He mentioned that’s not what was happening &amp;amp; this ended up being a 4 hour long conversation about how I was feeling, my doubts &amp;amp; worries, and about what was happening between us. He spent the 4 hours listening to me and even at one point asking me “ if I saw this working out” or “ did you ever think this could work” This statement assured me &amp;amp; after all was said, I got off the phone feeling reassured &amp;amp; “ safer”. We had our date the next day.

The next day, we were laying in bed and talking and we ended up talking about my past relationships. He mentioned some about his ( the last girl he had dated broke it off via text &amp;amp; started to see someone else, the girl before that he was serious about &amp;amp; she ended things with him after they were on &amp;amp; off for what I’m guessing was a year, or close to it) He mentioned he hasn’t had a long term relationship and that he doesn’t know if he’s a “5 year relationship type of guy” I thought this was a red flag so I asked him to elaborate which he said “ it just hasn’t happened for me” I asked him if this meant he thought of us as short-term or casual which he said no to both. A little into the conversation he asked me where I was at and that he didn’t know if he was “ emotionally there” I asked him if he was trying to say that I’m more into him than he is me and he said he just wanted to know where I was. I told him I was getting attached. A little further into the talk I asked if he would call me his girlfriend. He said yes &amp;amp; asked me if I would call him my boyfriend, to which I said yes &amp;amp; there we had the DTR talk.

After the talk, I felt more secure with the label but him mentioning not “ being a 5 year relationship type of guy” and “ not emotionally there” made me confused. Why would he agree to be exclusive/ bf/gf if he wasn’t emotionally there? Was he settling out of being bored &amp;amp; lonely? Did he not want to hurt my feelings? Or is it too soon to have deeper feelings 4 weeks in? All these doubts caused major conflict &amp;amp; problems. We had more lengthy conversations in which he would reassure me, but he was growing increasingly frustrated with my doubts /issues. On one of our many talks, he told me to “ do my part in making this work” and that he treats me well &amp;amp; is feeling like he’s failing.

He broke up with me a few days later after I mistakenly accused him of cheating / talking to an ex while we were out at a nice dinner. He told me he was exhausted &amp;amp; couldn’t take it anymore.

I had reached out more than once where we discussed the situation multiple times and for multiple hours as I was trying to get the “real” reason for the breakup. He repeatedly told me he was drained and couldnt deal with the behavior, that I never believe him, he treated me right and tried to make this work, etc. but I don’t believe him. I think he was never into me. 

He has now blocked me and refuses to speak. But I still want to reach out? 

TL:DR- Was seeing this guy for 6 weeks. Anxiety and insecurity started creeping in from feeling disinterest and certain comments about where he was at emotionally. He had reassured me until I mistakenly accused him of cheating. I’m having anxiety and confused by the entirety of the situation.

80,mx6i7d,1619216211,Annoyed with Dating Experience,"I, a 22-year-old male, have had horrible experiences on Tinder with people either ignoring my messages or telling me that ""they're going through an emotional period in their life,"" so dating isn't an option. I decided to take a break from Tinder because I couldn't handle the rejection anymore. I downloaded Bumble because I heard that people are generally better on that app compared to Bumble. I match with a few people, and one person really sparked my interest, so I put in more energy talking to him. We talked for a few days on Bumble, and he asked for my Snapchat, so I gave it to him; he followed me on Instagram too. We continue talking on Snapchat, and I eventually ask him if he would want to go on a date, and he responded with ""sure"" or ""sounds good to me."" 

We continue talking, and he ends up cancelling the date because he wasn't feeling good from his vaccine shot, so he asked if we could reschedule for the next day - I agree with him and plan it for the next day. The next day comes, and I get ready for the date. I walk to our meet-up location, and I ask him if he's on his way only to find out that's he's still in bed because he was hung over. He asks me if I still want to go on the date, and I tell him yes because I was already there, and I was looking forward to it all week. 

He arrives, and we walk around my school's campus for about an hour talking about how our week went and other information about ourselves; I really enjoyed talking to him. I even gave him a note at the end basically saying that I'm glad he decided to go on a date with me and how I feel a lot more confident. I also wrote my phone number on it. My thought was that he would text me about it but a few hours after the date, I don't hear anything from him. I Snapchat him asking if he liked the letter, and he only mentioned how he was glad I feel more confident about myself. We continue talking throughout the week, but I notice that he would start to message me on Snapchat instead of sending pictures, and his messages were always short and simple. I would always start the conversations, and he would never message me first. 

A few days ago, I ask him if he would want to go on another date, and he wasn't giving me a direct answer. Eventually he told me that he would tell me the day of because he had homework to work on, and his assignment team would need to message him. I end up sending him a message basically saying that I'm hopeful we can hang out again because I enjoyed the first date, and he responded with ""Why?"" Eventually we start talking about relationships, and he said something about how you should know what you want in a relationship, and I told him I'm looking for relationship. Well, I was a bit shocked when he told me he wasn't looking for a relationship right now... Even though his Bumble profile clearly included it...

Now, I just feel super horrible about myself, but I'm also annoyed that he let this go so long. I gave him plenty of chances to say no to a date, so I don't understand why he couldn't have been more direct earlier or even about me.

84,mx6tki,1619217196,I deleted Tinder... and it felt GREAT!,"When the app prompted for a reason, I selected ""I've had a bad experience on Tinder"". In the 500 characters it allows for explanation (as if anyone but machine learning algorithms will read it) I said this:

&gt;""9:1 men to women ratio. Tinder ELO scores. Wall street tech Bros commodifying dating actually does change culture. It leads to dehumanizing commodified interactions between people. It leads to women getting 40 matches in an hour, the illusion of choice. It leads men to spam swipes due to how remote of a possibility matches are. This leads to pressured and inauthentic encounters for both parties. I don’t want to be part of it anymore. 95% of dating apps are owned by Match Group, and we’re worse off for it.""

I hit continue, it prompted again for me to pause and not delete. I hit delete... and maaaaaan did that feel good. I'd suggest doing the same if you're feeling like I'm feeling. There is a great big world out there that doesn't involve turning the process of finding your person into the equivalent of catalog shopping. After deleting Tinder I deleted all the other apps too. I'm taking a break from dating at large. You have to listen to yourself sometimes, and this was looooong overdue. I started dating 6 months after divorce a year and a half ago, and have felt exhausted by it almost the entire time. I felt pressure to continue, like some imagined window was closing (40 yo male, I'd still like to start a family). In the meantime I'm just going to keep on working out, working on music, prioritizing the people I love in my life, and the activities that bring me actual meaning.

97,mx7vdx,1619220615,Finding Out Where I went Wrong,"I Found this girl online while gaming a few weeks ago, took it outside the game and talked intensively for 1 week and even made rough plans to possibly meet up and do something sometime in the summer even though we’re a 9 hour drive away. It was amazing and more, staying up all night just talking, telling each other how cute they are etc etc. 


I’ve never felt this for so long, and 1 week may not seem like much for most people but she was so sweet and a straight 12/10 (and that never happens to me ever) that I could envision a life with her (lol). I couldn’t believe this girl liked me and was wondering how I got so lucky. (Looking back how quick she left I’m beginning to doubt this was true) 

Anyway I had introduced her to a few of my friends and invited her to a discord channel. It was going well. Except now for some mysterious reason the talking got less, the passion definitely dissapeared somewhere. Before she would reply right away and be wanting to voice call anytime I asked but now the reply times are longer, the voice call questions get met with an excuse. She used to just follow me around everywhere wanting to do whatever I do (even though I wanted her to choose what we should do). 

The last time it was going great was 2 weeks ago, the last time it was going okay ish was maybe a week ago and lately? She doesn’t reply to my messages, when I see her online she’s always playing with this one dude from the discord server (like 5+ valorant games a day 7 days a week ). Whenever we’re both on she prefers to play with him. For a while I was getting really jealous and wanted to confront her about it but I don’t know if she’s doing the same stuff with him she did with me. It might just be a game only thing and I chalked it up to he’s better at valorant than me so that’s probably why she sticks with him now. These days I invite her to play and she doesn’t reply, I even message her to play still no reply. Even when we play in a full 5 stack team she doesn’t really acknowledge me in the game anymore. She used to send me kisses in chat (cheesy I know!) She also doesn’t really reply to me on discord but I’ve never tested the waters double or triple texting as I feel that would just ultimately result in a block. 

I know I know I should take the hint she wants nothing to do with me but why? I’m trying to find the reason or the flaw in myself that made her peel away without any real explanation. Sure we had a couple minor issues (she wanted to play an unrated game and it wasn’t clear that’s what she meant, I ended up queuing competitive, we ended up losing badly and she got pissed cuz it was her rank up game. 1 of 2 issues like that). 

I have been looking at older conversations reminiscing about our time but also trying to figure out where exactly did this boat turn around. We did voice call a few days ago and it was really good, almost like nothing had happened.

I have been meaning to voice call her one time, and just confront her about how I feel and finding out what’s wrong and why the change.  However I just feel this would push her away more. 

It’s hard to let go when a person like this only comes in your life once every few years and  to just forget about them without getting some sort of explanation. 

Lastly to be clear, she hasn’t blocked me on anything or unfriended me on any of the games/platforms we talk on. However she has left me on delivered on Snapchat for 2 days now so I gusss it’s almost the same thing tbh. There hasn’t been any ultimatum or argument that had resulted in a separation. Just slowly yet rapidly without a real explanation just what it feels like she wants nothing to do with me. 


Is it because I’m bad at the game, that she doesn’t want to play with me and then ultimately doesn’t want to talk to me, something I said, or did she simply lose interest. I wish I was a mind reader so I could get answers because all I have are questions. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice or possible next steps. Sometimes I think I really need to man up and stop letting this girl control my emotions and cause me to be sad for days just because she won’t talk to me, but it’s hard.

98,mx7wuv,1619220750,Wtf did he unmatched me?!,"I met a guy yesterday whom I started messaging on bumble. It turned out we have a ton in common, are looking for the same thing, and just seem to vibe really well. He messaged me all day today as well so I offered my number and told him to text me instead. He said “maybe I’ll FaceTime you tonight if that’s ok” and then continued on with our conversation in the app. I responded with “ok that’s cool” and continued talking there and it was just about travel and our favorite places, nothing problematic. Well I go back to the app to see if I had a message and he unmatched me just then!! Out of nowhere, after he said we would FaceTime. We were literally making plans for next week in the app! Like wtf?! Do you think he took my number down and will get back to me? I don’t have his late name to look him up and I don’t want to be creepy but we were really getting along. I’m honestly a little bit hurt lol can anyone offer any explanation maybe??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx7wuv/wtf_did_he_unmatched_me/
99,mx803d,1619221052,The scariest men are the ones who are good at faking it.,"I briefly dated this guy who seemed wonderful. We blamed it not working out on timing. But now it’s clear as day that he was never into me. He just pretended to be and did the bare minimum to get me to stick around. 

I recently found out something by doing a bit of investigating and it gave me closure. He was planning on cutting me out the whole time. 

Moral of the story is that it’s the scariest when a man pretends to be a good guy but just strings you along for convenience. And when he’s done with you he’ll ghost you. The funny thing is it’s been months and I’m just slowly figuring it out. He was way too fake and always knew what to say. It’s so much scarier than the typical douchebag because at least they are easily identifiable. He was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx803d/the_scariest_men_are_the_ones_who_are_good_at/
