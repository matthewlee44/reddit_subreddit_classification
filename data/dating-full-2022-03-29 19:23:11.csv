(we live quite fare apart) and have had about 10 dates.

I feel like she might not be into me anymore but i dont know if im making this up. Last time we met was last monday(9 days ago) and we had a great time. She said during the night that she had the best sex in her whole life. I agreed since it was amazing for both and we had sex all night.

I went home the next day and she told me to text when im home so i did. I said i had an amazing time and she agreed and said she also did. But ever since i feel like shes been replying slower/ ignoring me.

So i decided to stop texting her (we usually text daily)It took her 3 days to text me asking how my weekend was. (at least she texted first) i replied but i felt like her responses was slower. She often logged into messenger without openeing my message. And sometimes opened it and left me on read only to respond like 3-4h later...

I asked her out for the week but she could not since she has to work alot (me to) and she said she would let me know if she got time over for it.If she really was into me after 3 months i feel like she would be into me more if she actually liked me.I was going to ask her to be exclusive last time i saw her but i didnt. I thought she would have said yes. But now im second guessing that.

I know shes been updating her dating profile about 2,5-3weeks ago so i started to use mine a little again because i feel like i should not get obsessed over her before we are exclusive. But i think about her all the time.

last time i was over she said she stopped herself from texting me to much because she didnt want to do it to much and wanted to live in the moment and that she felt bad she didnt respond once before. (i didnt ask she just said it tho)

 We also ended up in a conversatation about relationships and what we seek in them, but said shes kinda sacred of them. Then after a while she was like. Ah we are still learning to know each other so there is no rush for anything.

I took this as a hint to not ask and shes not ready yet. I dont want to mess it up because i really like this one... a lot

Ill try and make it concise. I started dating this guy from 2 hours away. First date went ok. (He says was his best date ever).
We see one another again 2 days later.
Then, two weekends later, I move to new apartment. He insist to come help me. Odd because we barely know each other but sweet. I let him. He doesn't get in town on move in day until 6-7 at night once all done. Said he was walking and washing his car. Excuses? Probably. I didn't expect anything but why offer?
He stays over the weekend and Monday as well.
Next I see him two weeks later, he's flying out of my town to visit family and asks me to take him to the airport.
He comes back two weeks later. 
Its been 1 mo and 1/2 for us.


My issue is:
This guy is from India and while he speaks english, I feel it's so difficult to communicate. He's offended me, I've offended him b/c of cultural differences, unintentionally. 
Besides this he doesn't talk much, or expand on himself. I feel asking about his life, family, friends, or just deeper things about himself is like trying to navigate a field of land mines. He also doesn't ask me about deeper things about myself. I feel our relationship has been all about sex and despite him saying he wanted long term with me. When I confronted the issue of regretting sex so soon because I questioned his intention he didn't like having to explain that sex only was never his intention. But I only questioned because he barely talks to me or asks me about myself but is all over me so much of the time. Didn't even ask why I felt compelled to question his intention, so that we could...idk..TALK about it.

I told him I had a rough day yesterday which was a huge understatement and he disregarded it completely not asking why or anything.

I was trying to be patient and sensitive because things CAN get lost in translation easily. But I feel unseen and used. 
AITA, could this be another culture thing or is he just an asshole in another language/culture?

I want a partner where we can talk freely with one another and go out and have fun, I think Im ready to give up on this.

This is very weird to me because when I dated other people, this all went a lot faster. Like we would kiss at the start of a date or hug or hold hands when walking, and now there is just nothing at all. Like never. Not when walking, sitting on a couch in his dorm room, nowhere.

I just wonder if he even likes me at this point. Like I get that it is his first time, but even I did a lot more when I dated for the first time.

Thank you for reading.

Hi. I’m at a bit of a crossroads at this stage of my life, and it’s got a lot to do with my personal relationships. Any advice would be much appreciated as for a person who’s always been pretty good at following their gut, I can’t seem to make the right decision.

I’ve always been a romantic, as I’m sure a lot of you are too. I’ve never believed in perfection but have always somehow known that when I meet the one, everything else will somehow fall into place. 

In 2019 I found out my partner at the time was cheating on me, and I broke things off. I was grieving my relationship and turned to a dating app soon after, hoping to distract myself by interacting with other people. I’m not the type to fall for people quickly and passionately, it takes me a while to develop feelings for someone, so my ex’s betrayal was particularly hard to handle as I kept thinking I would struggle to develop a meaningful bond with someone again. However, I met a girl and apart from the fact that she lived over 200 miles away, she seemed… well, she was perfect.

I couldn’t put my phone down. We’d talk for hours, and it was making me forget all the previous heartaches, it felt like nothing else mattered. We connected so much emotionally to the point where I started thinking I had met my soulmate, even though I didn’t want to rush anything because it felt a little too soon for me to become fully submerged in a new relationship. The girl (let’s call her… Sam) said she was working two jobs including running her own business which left her no time for socialising and adding covid into the mix, it resulted in us only seeing each other every couple of months. Neither of us was thinking about a commitment at the time, so it was not a huge issue, although I would miss her like crazy and would regularly encourage her to meet up more often. She would then say she had too much on her plate and would constantly remind me that we weren’t in a relationship.

Fast forward to 2020, we were still talking every day. I started developing really deep feelings for her and wanted to move things forward. But the best I would get would be a 3-hour train ride every 2 months followed by her being 2 hours late for all of our meetings, and then we’d have a few hours left to spend together, which were always amazing and full of laughter and affection. But it became stressful. I felt as though her heart wasn’t in it as much, even though I knew she had feelings for me. She would encourage me to see other people and said she wanted to do the same. She said I deserved someone who had more time for me. It was painful. We tried taking some time apart but we had become best friends by that time, and it was too painful to let go, especially considering I was living alone in a new city. I was lonely. And I did love her. Unconditionally.

After countless discussions, I suggested trying to be friends and felt as I should explore a new relationship with someone who would want more of what I was willing to give. She was okay with that and said she wanted the best for me. Soon after, I went on a date with someone new, and we began seeing each other regularly. This person, Taylor, turned out to be the kindest, most generous, supportive, and loving individual imaginable. I wasn’t feeling the same spark though, and let her know straight away, I also told her about my dating history and everything that happened with Sam. Taylor seemed disappointed at first but we continued talking and began to spend quite a bit of time with each other. For a while, things were good. I felt as if I had made the right choice, and things were moving forward at last. The only problem was… I couldn’t stop thinking about Sam.

I would go see Sam once in a while, and we maintained our friendship even after I had told her I started dating someone else. But it became a little too overwhelming for me – Taylor was beginning to talk about our future together, and I felt like it was unfair for her to be with someone who wasn’t sure what they wanted. So we took a break, which resulted in us breaking up a month later. I made that choice. But it hurt. A lot.

During my time alone, I kept thinking about how much I had hurt Taylor, and how amazing, and kind she was. And I knew I had feelings for her too. We had spent so much time together and made memories, but it wasn’t fair of me to be constantly thinking about someone else. To make things even more confusing, recently Sam has texted me to say she has never stopped thinking about me and asked me if I would be willing to consider being her girlfriend. She apologised and said she had never felt this way about anyone before. She sounded sincere, and ready. I initially felt overjoyed because it seemed as though it was finally happening – I would be with my soulmate and life would be amazing. We agreed to meet up and talk about it, yet she showed up 3 hours late and I had to catch my train back soon after. So we didn’t have a chance to speak much. Again. And it got me thinking – is this how the rest of my life will look like if I choose Sam? Can long distance really work? Will I constantly feel disappointed when she’s late? Is love worth it? Have I traded in someone so attentive, committed and caring for someone who doesn’t really see me as a priority? Or do they? Should I be single? And, is it possible to love two people at the same time?

We get on so well and go on fun dates. He's met my friends and I his and we stay over at each others every weekend and some week days too. I don't know whether to ask what we are because that conversation can go two ways. 

I really like him, we make eachother laugh and learn so much from one another. Sometimes I’ll say something dumb or laugh too hard at a really unfunny joke I make and he laughs, hugs me and kisses my head. He mentioned once that he likes me I’m not sure if it was accidental or meant platonically. We will spend what feels like ages just holding each other sometimes without saying a word. We will go dancing and it will feel like we are the only people in the room. At least to me. 

He has made me believe in love again after a series of horrific relationships and I find myself wanting to do cute things for him. Like baking? I have never baked anything specifically for a man in my life. It’s only recently been established that neither of us are seeing other people but the conversation was vague and ended there. I don’t think either of us know whether it’s a good idea to say much more. 

He is generally a lovely person however neither of us are from this country and may one day go back. We are both studying and working here and plan go for the next year or so. I don’t want to get invested in someone officially if our paths will end up separating. We are young and our careers are still uncertain. But honestly he is literally everything I’ve always wanted in a partner and I didn’t know I could find that in someone. I can’t tell if I am that for him and I, being bad at expressing my emotions, know I would push him away for a while if I ask and the answer is no.

I really like a girl and I don’t know what to do. Also I don’t want to make any stupid mistake, so I hope you can help me.

So we’re both students at the same university and we go to class together. This class takes place only once a week, so I currently have no other opportunity to see her or talk to her. It all started two weeks ago. It turned out that we take the same bus after class. We didn’t know each other at that time, but I knew her face and when I saw her sitting on the same bus, I decided I would introduce myself and ask what is her name. Though she usually seems quiet and shy, she was quite chatty and smiling when we were talking. I don’t know her too well, so it’s hard to say if my impression was accurate. But she definitely wasn’t feeling bad when talking to me. After we split up after getting off the bus I didn't see her or spoke to her for another 6 days.

Next week, so one week ago counting from today, when she came to class, I was already there, and she sat next to me (there was plenty of other free places where she could sit). I was glad because it meant that she remembered me, even though we only spoke once for like 10 or 15 minutes few days before. She said hi, we talked for a minute and then classes started so we couldn't talk much. After the class finished, I asked her if she was going to the same bus stop she went to the week before, and she said yes. I said that I can go with her. As we were going, the conversation went pretty smooth. I think we both enjoyed it. She smiled a lot (but maybe she is just a smiling person), asked me some questions and I did the same. We had much more time than the previous week, so we spoke a lot more, and I started to feel like I already know her a little bit. She was no longer a stranger girl to me, and I think that I was no longer a stranger guy to her. Again, not seen her or spoke to her for 6 days.

And after these 6 days we met again today. She didn't sit next to me, because she was late for the class and didn't want to interrupt other students (I am sitting at the back of the class, so she would have to go pretty far, thus making some noise). I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to talk to her, and honestly I was really looking forward to talking to her. But fortunately after the class she waited for me! She waited for me next to the classroom door and asked if I'm going to the same bus stop. I was really happy, because it seemed like she genuinely likes me and wants to spend some time with me. Just like last week, we talked a lot and a felt like we were even more comfortable than the last time. She smiled a lot again (now I think that she simply is a smiling person indeed) and talked quite much, maybe even more than I expected from her.

It was so good that I decided to ask her if she would like to spend some time with me outside of this class that we have. Before I did it, she said to me that she has quite a loose schedule for this semester, so it made me even more confident asking her. So I asked her: ""Since you have some free time, maybe you would like to meet someday?"". She replied that ""She has a lot to do lately"" but ""We can think about it after Easter"" (so in about 2-3 weeks). I said that ""sure, don't worry, you don't have to feel obligated to anything."" I also gently asked her if I could walk her home (we get off the same bus together at the same stop, but then I wait for the next bus and she goes home), but she said that she needs to go to the store for something, so I didn't insist. At that point I already felt like she isn't interested in me the same way that I am interested in her. She said she would wait with me for my bus. It was actually quite kind of her. We chatted for a while longer until my bus arrived. She didn't seem in any way offended or anything like that. We just talked the way we had talked before, it was really nice. When my bus arrived she suggested doing a ""goodbye fist bump"". I'm sorry if you don't understand what I mean by that, English is not my first language, so it's quite difficult for me to say things clearly sometimes.

Our relationship started off really well. She had a crush on me. Asked me out. And we eventually started dating. 

I've been in both casual and serious relationships whereas she's never been in a relationship. I was her first kiss. 

Initially, I took time to get emotionally connected though she started ""feeling love"" right after the first kiss which could have been the rush of hormones from the first kiss. But anyway, with time, we started talking and hanging out more and fell in love.

Things were great between us. We met once or twice a week. Spoke on calls regularly, and made a point to atleast text goodmorning/good night and communication was good.

We've had minor arguments in the past but recently they've escalated vastly.  Now I'm the kind of person who likes to talk and sort things out and she's the kind of person to shut off. It caused a lot of friction initially but we got over it and started understanding each other better.

However, in the last 2 weeks, it's like I'm seeing a different person than the one I fell in love with. Every major fight of ours is solved by me going to her house and eventually we hug and solve.

She was initially a very empathetic person. But now even if I explicitly tell her I'm hurt, she jokes around. She's not genuinely mean but she definitely doesn't actually try and listen. The more she acts aloof, the more it makes me act in a way which later comes off as desperate.

I pointed it out to her during her last meet and she said without a pause ""I'm toxic. You deserve someone better"". I told her actions of her will make me stop loving her to which she had a blank response.

She does have her good sides and sweetness which make me love her but I now consciously understand she's not good for my mental health. However it's so hard to just end it. I'm stuck. How to deal with this situation?

I am aware that I attract manipulative people so I am kind of paranoid now but I also don't want to let go of something that might and can be a good relationship in the future.

So I met this guy a week ago, of all places, here in Reddit! (Reason why I created a 2nd account before posting this) I'm 26 F, he's 29. We clicked right away!

I commented on his post that has lots of (not nice) comments about his appearance and I felt like I had to comment a nice thing to uplift him then he messaged after a day. We haven't stopped talking since.

He loves complimenting me like A LOT. I told him not to overdo it (jokingly), he said he's just stating facts. It comes naturally out of him but I feel overwhelmed.

He feels that I can be easily trusted and I'm so easy to talk to and would like to share his life stories with me. (A friend of mine who is a female that I also met here told me this as well. She's one of my closest friends now)

He told me that he'd visit me here this year and really wants to see me and already saving up, I am from a different side of the world. He also said that if I get to have a chance to go to his country, he'd really love to tour me around. I told him that I'm super uncomfortable with this kind of conversation as it sounds too early for me. He politely acknowledged and apologized that he didn't realize it.

Things that I like is that he doesn't text me a lot, we've moved to WhatsApp after 6 days of talking here, he hasn't said he loves me or would marry me someday (tho he said that he likes me already), he doesn't give me endearments (babe or honey, etc) and he has not told me any playing-the-victim-role stories -- these are very common to a lovebomber.

He's so sweet, kind, and I really feel that he's an amazing guy. He said that he can't believe that ""someone like me"" is interested in knowing him.

I told him that I like him 8 days into talking. He said that we'd take it slow as how I'd like it to be because he doesn't wanna overwhelm me. He also slowed down his compliments. But last night. He said that he misses my voice and can't wait to wake up on it. (We send voice notes a lot but rarely converse real time because of the timezones)

I feel like I am being put on a pedestal.

I’ve been seeing my girlfriend since October. She’s the first person I’ve seriously dated in 4 years. She’s a 23 year old that moved to my city and is in grad school and we met on hinge. I’m 27. We really hit it off after I was able to get past her walls and she makes me incredibly happy. She’s in grad school and I’m working as a server in a restaurant making decent money while I’m in school studying Homeland Security after dedicating most of my life’s dreams to making it in music so this is an adjustment for me, but i’m proud of myself and happy with the progress in my journey even though I hate my job. It pays me well enough to take care of myself and treat her really well on top of the ways I show up for her emotionally and by being reliable. Everything was going really well with the exception of both of us being stressed out/down about things. She’s homesick, I have some health issues and I don’t like my job very much but in general we’ve been really happy together. We had just taken a trip 2 weeks ago to the beach and had such amazing quality time together. On friday I spent a nice day with her and we worked on school stuff together and we booked a hotel for a weekend in NYC. I drop her off at her place and go to work. 
She texts me asking if we can change the non refundable reservation to just one night and we could save money by staying at her friends. I told her since it was her birthday coming up that I wanted to treat her to the hotel since we don’t get to do stuff like this often. She said I already spoil her plenty and that was it. She didn’t really seem too appreciative of the gesture. The next day I noticed she was off and she told me she didn’t feel like being around people. She was spending the day with one of her best friends to play with her dog. 

Next thing I know while at work she blindsided me with a long text that essentially insinuates i’m not good enough. That she’s afraid the divide will grow as she gets deeper into grad school and her career (she doesn’t have a career yet) even though I celebrate and listen to her every chance I get when she tells me about interviews or any progress she’s making in her field or in school. She met some people that I’m not close to at all that live in my neighborhood and I know from working in restaurants and basically said she’s worked so hard to not become that and that she wants more of the person she’s dating. She said she wants more for me too, but I’m confused because I’m pursuing avenues to get out of the restaurant industry and don’t want that to be my career. I really wanted to get the chance to talk to her in person so I gave her space and didn’t text her back the next day and a half to just chill out and let her chill out since I had no idea it was coming. She also said for her to be happy she would want the career aspect to speed up and the relationship stuff to slow down and was wondering if I felt the same. All through text and so I don’t even know if this is something we can work through or if she just changed her mind. She says she loves me. So I don’t know if her feelings have completely changed or if she’s dealing with some stuff and she’s freaking out about getting deeper into the relationship and i’m just really hurt by her insinuating I’m not ambitious or that I’m not good for her. I really encourage her and push her and have a genuine desire for her to be happy and successful but I never wanted to lose her this way especially without knowing anything was wrong and finding this out through text. 

I’m also just pretty mad and trying to value my self worth higher than what she has insinuated in her message.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164919,public,self,Blindsided,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/trsayh/blindsided/,no_ads,0,,dating,,,,,,

We talked a bit and then followed each other on instagram. We DMed each other quite frequently. He once asked to hang out with me, but that never happened lol (disclaimer: i never really go on dates because i’m too anxious lmao). We still talked quite frequently after that.

Then in December i posted a video of me playing bass guitar on my instagram story, because it was the first song i learned on the bass. This guy also plays bass, so he complimented me and asked me if i wanted to hang out sometime so he could ‘give me tips’ on playing bass.(Sounds like he was trying to make a move but idk). During this time I wasn’t sure if he was talking to me with romantic intentions anymore, or if it was platonic. He did give me many compliments when i put my drawings or me playing guitar on my story which made me believe that he was still kind of interested in me. Not just compliments like ‘you’re good’ or ‘well done’, but ones that were more like he was fascinated with how good i was lol.
However, i didn’t care about his intentions because i didn’t have any particular intentions with him myself anymore.
But i agreed to meet up, because i was curious and i saw an opportunity for a possible friendship/relationship. I did think that he had more romantic than platonic intentions though, because after all, we did meet through tinder.

Then we met up at my place two weeks ago, played bass and guitar and talked for a couple hours, and then he went home. We had a good time, but i didn’t necessarily feel like i would want to hang out with him anymore (idk just a gut feeling).

Today i found out he has girlfriend lmao. Probably since November because there’s a picture of the two with a heart as caption on the girlfriend’s instagram. However, he has no pictures of her on his instagram. I found out through his instagram story: he tagged her and some other people in a video of a concert he was at. I wasn’t sad to find out, as i didn’t have any feelings for him anyway, but isn’t this kind of weird?

He has a girlfriend, but asked another girl, that he knows from tinder, to meet up so that he could give her tips on how to play bass. If i had a boyfriend and he did that i would be mad lmao, and i also wouldn’t do something like that myself.
Also, he should know that if he asks a girl from tinder to meet up, that this girl probably thinks that he has some romantic intentions right? If he just wanted to give me tips, he could’ve just done that through DMs right? Should i tell his girlfriend, or am i overreacting?

A few months ago I made a career change that greatly improved my mental and emotional health. 

My last relationship ended two years ago and I’ve dabbled here and there with dating/getting to know guy as of lately. The thing is that some of the guys I meet are missing some of the things I look for in a potential long term partner or they want to play games. At some point I got jaded and discouraged in regards to my romantic life. Sometimes it translates into getting to know someone because I have many layers to what degree someone gets to know me. I believe that I am ready for a relationship but need a little more pointers but other times I’m not completely in it 100%.

She's always working and the cubicles are so close together that it would make it awkward to start a random conversation with her. I have 4 plans in which to ask her out.

1. Message her on social media. It's the easiest out of the four, however it could also easily backfire and make me look like a creep. 

2. I occasionally talk with a friend of hers. I was thinking about asking her friend about her. Throw the bait out there and ask her friend if she (the co worker that I find cute) is single. Chances are that word will travel back to her that I asked about her and maybe that will get the wheels in motion. She still may want for me to approach her still.

3. This one is probably the most sure thing but just very scary. As she is leaving work I will hold the door open for her and introduce myself. After that I'm not sure what to say. Maybe something along the lines of ""I've been meaning to introduce myself to you but we are both always working."" I would feel more in control of the outcome.

4. As we are walking by the copier (which we do almost daily) I will ask her how her day is going. It's innocent enough but it will also show that I notice her and want to talk to her.

I might do a combination of 2 and 3. Throw the bait out there so she knows that I'm interested and then as we are leaving work 
I will strike up a conversation.

I think social media is a waste of my time and noticed I spent a lot of time on it even when there was nothing to see or do so I made the decision to delete them all and spend my time outside, working out, picking up hobbies, etc and my quality of life has become so much better since leaving social media. 

Well, I’ve noticed that men don’t believe me when I tell them I don’t have social media and I’m wondering if they find me boring?? I really don’t want to make any social accounts just for the sake of sharing it whenever I’m talking to a guy. 

So for my men out there (and women 😊), would you be put off if someone you’re getting to know has no social media? (You can’t find anythinggg online about me).

I 25m dated this awesome girl 24f for a while some months back. We ended up not pursuing this at that time, it was mostly her that rejected me but it was also a bad time for me due to being away for work alot. She also said that she wants to be for herself at that time and doesn’t feel like pursuing anything, but she nor I did not want to close the opportunity of something happening between us in the future.

We started talking again about a week back, she was the one that initiated… Then I was out with my friends during the weekend, we were a little drunk etc. We got the great idea that I should ask her if she would like to meet. I knew it was a really bad idea but went through with it anyways…

She then said that she doesn’t see the point in meeting up as nothing has changed for her since we last discussed this…

Sent her a text the next morning that: Okey, I just wanted to take the chance and ask :)Been thinking about you for the past weeks.

To which she responded with: Okey I understand :) There is nothing wrong with asking

I feel like such a dumbass and now I once again rushed things… I got talked into it by my friends and know it was stupid and was a little tipsy and daring. But then again, I already know from before that I would be interested in her so don't really see the point of just talking to her alot again, as we have been through that pretty recently.

It’s something I’ve been working on for a while. It involves a ton of data points, but the end goal is to get things consolidated into an elegant format that’s agreeable to everyone from temps to executives. 

Given our combined tenure and recent conversations I could really use your help. 

We’ve had a hard time syncing our calendars here at the end of the quarter, and given the nature of this project, maybe it’s better we meet when we’re both free?

It’s been a month since we broke up and we have both put those hard feelings to rest. Our relationship was getting a bit toxic and we needed some time apart. We wanted to take a break and come back to it when we’ve bettered ourselves. 

We started hanging on Saturday and it has been AMAZING. Literally everything is going so well. We have been there for each other emotionally, we have seen each other every day, gone out on dates, hung out, shared laughs, we text all the time about what were up to, its pretty much just like when we were dating, and I can say, I am truly in love. I think it took us breaking up to realize our faults to make this right.

However, I am graduating from college in a month and a half. She still has two more years. So it’s kind of getting to the point where we need to make a decision. I am nervous to ask her about it as It has only been a few days of hanging out. I don’t want to force anything or push her away, but I do want to date her. And I just don’t know when the right time is. The thing is, we haven’t been hooking up or anything because she is sick with mono, and I can’t take those risks, but obviously I want to, but im not going to make a move when she’s sick.

I don’t want to lose this girl, and I have those feelings for her almost like when we first started dating. I just don’t know if she feels the same, but im scared if I ask her I will lose her..

TL;DR: my ex and I started talking again and we have been seeing each other every day. We do things like were dating, just not hooking up (she has mono so I really can’t kiss her or anything).

This is gonna be a long post so thanks for bearing with me.

I (23M) met ""Ella"" (17F) on an online dating app (she misrepresented her age as 18). \~1 week into our online convo, she spontaenously asked me to hang out and I agreed, we clicked so well that we slept together that night in a hotel room (I was a virgin, and I think she was too because there was some bleeding and neither of us knew what we were doing). We ended up spending the next weekend together as well (another 2 nights in a hotel).

I spent $1100 total during our time together which I'm just realizing now as I'm about to pay my bills :(. Most of this money didn't go directly into her (from most to least expensive: 3 nights hotel, meals/snacks/beverages, gas, entertainment, plan B, etc.). I did buy her $200 worth of clothing (many small items added up). She also spent some money while we were together (some items for herself, some for us, but none for me only) - I think around $150 but it could be more because I severely underestimated how much I spent too.

I don't mind contributing more because I have a bit more money from working (although I have no income currently bc im back in school) and she basically has no money as a high school senior (her card got declined at the end), but spending this much for 2 weekends is obviously not sustainable. I like her very much and I think she likes me as well, but my friends have warned me that she may be using me for money. I'd like to think she isn't because most of what I spent didn't directly go into her, it's hard to keep track when small things add up (I didn't keep track so she likely didn't either), and I willingly bought her those clothes (although she would pick out clothes she liked and I would then offer to pay).
