0,nz0m3y,1623603219,Hookup or not?,"I am out of a relationship since about three months, it lasted a little over seven months but the break up hit me hard and I really thought I it would be us (I am now sure that’s not the case). 
I am feeling a lot better now and about a month ago I reactivated my Tinder (for a bit of distraction, and yes I know it’s not a very nice thing to do) 
I matched with a man about two weeks ago (me F45, he M47) and we chatted and it was nice, nothing too personal but good. I then suggested we move to another platform for convenience. After that things got hot and we spoke on the phone for about two hours and after that we got into sending very sexy  messages. 
I’m not really that used to it but found out that I really enjoy it so it was a lot of fun and we are still doing it btw. 
We have talked about meeting up next week when he doesn’t have his daughter (and that meet would be very much related to him going down on me according to multiple similar messages). 
I don’t really know what it is I’m actually asking but in my previous relationships this hasn’t been a thing. In my previous one we were very compatible and open in the bedroom but nothing was like this was ever exchanged over text. 
What this whole exchange has made me realise it that my previous relationship wasn’t really that good and the communication between us basically sucked and that I am kind of over it and him. 

So I guess I’m just asking if I should go with this thing and see what happens? 
We would most likely meet for a walk or drinks or something like that first but what if there is no actual physical connection after all of this with the build up and the fact that I can’t think of anything else besides the hot messages? 
Also I am obviously aware that this is probably a rebound thing but still. 

I am a grown up woman and feeling like I am an insecure teenager and also like a bit of an asshole for doing this when I’m recently out of a relationship.

So as I’m getting older owning a home by myself is really annoying. Particularly the maintenance including yard work etc. A friend just moved into an apartment complex with a pool / gym / clubhouse with a very wide mix of neighbors but not many families (mostly young just out of college people, young couples without kids, middle age divorcees and newly retired singles/ couples). And no cutting grass or paying for AC breakdown, no dealing with contractors when something goes wrong, no worrying about neighbors not tending to their house/yard, etc. We’re in a great market to sell also. Anyone over 40 move to an apartment with amenities from a house and was it a good idea? It would definitely be more expensive monthly but I should be able to sell at a good profit and reducing maintenance &amp; the anxiety that comes with it is worth something in my book.

5,nz3cvc,1623611029,“Inviting” me too dinner again after splitting check?,"I know this is a controversial tale as old as (the 1990s?). To make it short and sweet:

Met a guy online.  Met for $3 espressos, (he paid at register).  He expressed that he *really really* was into me in chatting later.

He invited me to dinner, picked me up, dressed up.  He chose the restaurant, he chose cocktails and wine after.   He order appetizer while I was in the restroom.  He knew the owner of the place and we got a complementary round of drinks after.  

The check came, he puts he card down and I get mine and hold it out to him ( because I don’t even know what to do at this point any more, I get filled with so much dread at the check moment.  This NEVER happens with my female friends where one of us will just swiftly grab the check.).   He says: if you want to.   So I just drop my card also.

So I hate to admit it but at this point my attraction just dies.  When one person invites and plays the host (directs the ordering at dinner) I was raised that they pay.  I take guys out too.  Splitting check also reeks of platonic/not even good friends.  Usually in my dating and close friendships picking up check are alternated.

During the paying moment I actually get all scrambled and reevaluate the entire situation because deep down I feel if he was really into me he would have payed.

It isn’t that my offer is insincere, it’s not a test, but it just kills it for me.   

He is also foreign so I don’t know if that affects anything.

Anyway, we went for a walk after and he was talking about all the places he wanted to “take me”.    Now he has asked to “take me” to dinner again.  (Among many more expressions of how much he likes me).   

But what does “take me” even mean?  I feel once you go Dutch, from there on out it’s always Dutch (except for a birthday or something).

I like him, I just don’t know how it would go from here.  A relationship of never paying for one another seems cold.   I’m not going to stop offering to pay.  I don’t want to “accept” a date where he is “taking me” out when that isn’t the case.  I even flubbed at the end of the date and thanked him “for the ride.”

I also don’t want to keep going to elaborate expensive dinners as it’s not in my budget.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nz3cvc/inviting_me_too_dinner_again_after_splitting_check/

But what struck me was how he approached it.  First telling me he wanted to slow down (when it was seem he meant go almost completely silent), then finally that he needed to focus on his son.  I'm a parent too so of course I understand kids come first, but I also know that having my own life makes me a better mom.  Thinking back, I realize most of the time someone's broken off communication after a few dates, I get some variation of ""it's not you, it's me,"" even when it's pretty easy to see a different dealbreaker.  A few that came to mind: 

* ""My uncle is in the hospital, I need to focus on being there for my family right now"" (What I think ... I wouldn't have sex on the first date)
* ""I need to focus on my health and get my ED figured out"" (Later, admitted he just didn't think we had much in common) 
* ""I'm just not ready for something serious"" (I suspect it had more to do with, shall we say, significant political differences)
* ""I'm taking a job in Japan"" (when really I had called him out on lying about who he was, further confirmed when he showed up on Bumble again weeks later ""looking for a long term relationship"") 

Aren't we supposed to be adults?  Why is this so common?  Getting a fake reason why doesn't make me feel any better about being rejected, I'd say it makes it worse.

13,nz8uet,1623626505,How many of you are dating and have a teen? What’s reasonable with “blending”?,"You have to put this post slightly in the venting category due to my recent breakup which related to my ex bf’s wish to blend families, and my opinion, his bull in a China shop approach to it. 

I have a 13 year old son, on the spectrum. He is like a little adult, very smart, set in his ways, loving, prone to outbursts, very overweight (no sense of being full, and physical challenges like extreme clumsiness). 

I have no need to blend families in the future, but I’m not totally closed off to it. His father is emotionally distant, but has him 20-50% of the time. 

I am protective of him, for one thing I know how to keep him level with his behaviours. I also know if he gets attached to someone and we break up, he will take it personally and fear he’s why.

One of the big things that bothered me in my last relationship, was my bf’s desire to treat him and his 8 year old with the same expectations around things like being outdoorsy…. Chopping wood and the like. While I grew up that way and have no problem with exploring some of it, it’s not my son’s experience and I suggested a gentle approach. One of my major annoyances was the continual suggestion that we take the kids to the beach, which my son hates, as the texture of sand really bothers him, and my bf was told. 

The response was essentially that I coddle him to much, and I need to force him to do things for his own good. I see that a bit but I like to push things that are more attainable, like preparing food for himself, etc. Not things that I know will result in him being uncomfortable.

My bf did work with adults on the spectrum, so he’s not completely clueless. But he doesn’t like children dictating his life, which is what he felt this was like.

He was also concerned about the kids having “2 sets of rules” and felt that it would lead to his son not listening to him.

My thought was to periodically have the kids together for fun stuff, and we each parent our own kid. I also thought that at 8, his son could understand different abilities and that it wouldn’t be the problem he expected.

Beyond that, my son is university level smart… and not physical. While his son is physical, but struggles intellectually (for example he’s not really reading yet). 

In thinking about dating in the future, I’m basically thinking… I don’t want anyone near my son. Because I just don’t want to deal. In 5 years he’ll be 18 and likely in university and so anyone I date can see him from time to time but no one would try to be his father. 

Does anyone with kids never plan to introduce partners? How do you navigate that on dating sites?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nz8uet/how_many_of_you_are_dating_and_have_a_teen_whats/

18,nzcokt,1623638566,Basis of comparison?,"I’ve noticed something coming up the past few years: I keep running into women who have been married for 20 something years, and they are in their 40s and dating basically for the first time in their lives. Or certainly for the first time since their 20s.

The issue is, I find myself wondering if these women are actually interested in me, or if I’m just the first guy that’s been nice to them since their divorce, and they really haven’t been on dates with many guys so they don’t have much of a basis of comparison. I mean I’m talking single digits in terms of number of different dates, not relationships, for some of these women.

This is not a self-confidence thing for me. I know I have a ton to offer and I get positive feedback. It’s more of a concern (and maybe this is lingering from my divorce), that they will at some point begin to wonder what they missed out on by not dating around. And conversely that they would appreciate me more if they saw what else was out there. Like I know that I’m not the perfect guy for every woman, but women who are into me are really into me. And I want someone who is really into me.

Perspectives? Am I overthinking this? If a woman who was married for 27 years, who has only had one brief fling since her divorce, is really into me, is this something I just go with?

Edit: haha, as some have pointed out, if you choose to read what I wrote narrowly, it sounds like I’m asking for one individual to speak for all women. When I asked for perspectives, what I mean is, if you either are someone similar to this or have dated people in these positions, I would be interested to hear your story or point of view on this topic.

My father was and still is very emotionally distant - the John Wayne/Clint Eastwood type who never shows their feelings and will never say ""I love you"" even though he probably does. My late husband was loving and kind but also a bit shy and reserved. When he passed and I was ready to date again, I spent a year dating men who all seemed to be only interested in emotionally-distant hookups and casual sex, which was fun for a while but the lack of consistency and reliability became aggravating - last-minute cancellations or no-shows were a real bummer. I had a few casual relationships with guys who I truly liked and they seemed to like me also, but always kept me at arms length and would never commit to just one woman, so again, I kept looking.

About 10 months met a guy on OLD who really clicked with me on a personal level. We have so much in common it's incredible. Great sex and great friendship. After a few months we had the DTR talk and decided to be all-in as a couple. We are even talking about moving in together. He is very communicative. I get morning and evening texts from him, daily phone calls, and when we are together he is constantly adoring me, telling me how beautiful and perfect I am, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable! I have an average body of a 50 year old woman who doesn't work out and is slightly overweight, and yet he tells me how sexy and perfect I am. I worry that he's love-bombing me, or that he's blind or this is all too good to be true. He has never done anything dishonest or hurtful to me, and yet I feel like all this love and affection could some day turn out to be a trap. He has so many good qualities, and yet I'm very used to having my alone time and I worry what it would be like if we actually lived together. I also worry that after feeling so broken after becoming widowed that my heart may never fully open up again to fully love this man as much as he loves me.

35,nzt0io,1623694218,My 40+ boyfriend's sex drive is declining,"Hi, first thank you for taking your time reading this.

Though I am not a 40+, my boyfriend is. I (31F), with a (43M). He was very into me in the beginning, he said it himself that he was obsessed with me at one point. 

He is the oldest man I've ever dated, he's smart, got his sh*t together and he intellectually stimulates me - the most important part. 

Sex was so good and passionate in the beginning. He even asked his friend how to initiate sex with me because he is scared that his sex drive might be too high for me. Five months forward, sex has declined a lot. Even more so that now, as of 3 weeks ago, that we are long distance.

My sex drive is ridiculously high, more than he realizes. For three weeks now, he had not asked for a  picture of me, or initiated phone/video sex. I understand that he is busy with family and work, but this makes me feel unwanted. I send pictures of myself without him asking, and he responds to them, but that's about it.

I pointed it out to him why he said to me that he was 3-4 times a day kinda  guy in the beginning, to now being 'oh I'm not a 3-4 times a day kinda guy anymore. I'm getting older. Don't make me feel bad for not losing my sex drive etc."". I only pointed that out because that was only 5 months ago.

Without tooting my own horn, I'd like to think I am physically attractive, I'm an athlete and my career is in the fitness industry.

Are we not sexually compatible anymore? Is it really just his age? Am I doing something wrong? Are we not going to be sexual, even virtually? How do I get him in the mood for phone sex?

38,nzu3lx,1623697070,How do you cope with struggling to be vulnerable in relationships?,"Thanks for letting me vent and share my feelings... I can't wait to hear what advice and wisdom you have to share.

So my (45/M) 2 most recent situationships have left me a little confused on how much I should reveal about myself personally and emotionally, especially early in the dating process, without scaring anyone away.  

I've dated 2 women over the last 6 months. One told me that I went too deep (emotionally) too fast once I felt comfortable with her and the other who was/is a friend before we started dating for a brief period of time, said I didn't give her the emotional depth she needed from a potential partner by keeping her at arm's length. 

I've been fighting this feeling of being disconnected for most of my life (even during my marriage) and nothing I seem to do gets rid of this feeling and it's only gotten worse over time. To the point where I don't feel like I can't connect with anyone romantically (or even on a friendship level). I don't have a great relationship with my birth family and I just feel so disconnected most of the time. 

Connecting with others has been difficult and I tend to keep people at arm's length, never fully letting anyone in; Except for my therapist, who I only let peek behind the curtain recently. I have a hard time building deep and meaningful relationships and because of the nomadic life, I lived for many years while in the military, I lack a sense of belonging and community. 

I've tried really hard to break out of this shell I've surrounded myself with by going to meetup groups, planning social activities, joining fitness groups, volunteering, church, putting my kid in sports and I still don't feel like I can relate to anyone. 

I've stayed in bad relationships because I just want someone in my life, but also don't really let them in because if I shared the years of abuse and neglect I've suffered, it causes them to pull back or becomes some weird form of trauma bonding that I don't want in my relationships.

I’ve been conditioned to have my guard up, always ready for the next thing. I've taught myself how to be hard, how to be strong, how to protect my heart before anything bad can happen. So besides working on my issues with a professional (which I do) what can I do?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nzu3lx/how_do_you_cope_with_struggling_to_be_vulnerable/

The next day I start the messaging and he asks me out. There was a mix up with the time but we do meet up and he kisses me and talks about future plans. The next day I check in on how he’s feeling (he had a vaccine) and he’s pretty blah even though he says he feels fine so I said ok reach out when you want. I haven’t heard back in 2 days. 

How do you determine whether you text or not? I don’t like playing games but I also don’t want to put effort into someone who only texts when I remind him of me. How do you balance interest with making sure people match your interest?

Anyway, it sparked a lot of conversation about proposing, engagement, marriage, etc. I decided to be bold too. 

Although we've discussed future plans we've never actually talked about getting married. It's been implied but never stated outright that's the intention or even a desire. So, I asked him, ""you know I want to marry you someday"" He said he knew and if he didn't feel the same he wouldn't keep stringing me along because it wouldn't be fair. I told him I'd let him know when I'm ready for him to propose. He said, okay. 

It was a little scary being that vulnerable and I realize the conversation could've taken a turn. But, I'm glad it's out there and neither one of us are wondering.

However, there are lots of things coming up that I do not like. First, he is a Republican. No offense to republicans, but he is FAR right, lots of guns, conspiracy theorist, voted for Trump and likes him, etc. I am a Democrat and am fairly liberal in my beliefs. This has been fine until he starts to drink. Then he will go off on a tangent about liberals, taxes, gas prices…you name it. I have asked him repeatedly to not talk politics with me, but he continues to. He also will spout off the N word. I HATE this word. I will never speak it (he and I are both white). I have told him this many times. He still uses it. There’s more. The last four Fridays I have come over to his house for dinner, he is already drunk. Last week I showed up and he was passed out in his bed and said he was just taking a “nap” before I came over. He did get up and we went to dinner, but continued to drink until he passed out ON me in bed later that night. Lastly, and maybe this will sound horrible, but he has a really small penis.

For instance, I briefly dated a guy with a legal background who was slowly sinking himself into the local political scene. He was a strong advocate for greener initiatives. I think we went on 3 dates, 2 involved cycling, and one was swing dancing. 

The first was a great, get-to-know you, casual and low key late afternoon date, and he really did open up about himself and his background. The other two, eh - didn't really learn so much about him except how he liked to present himself in group situations. 

And it really took those other 2 dates of just kind of watching him interact with others to make me realize he was constantly doing little more than selling himself, in preparation. He had this deep, hardship story about growing up, but then once he got that out, there wasn't much substance underneath.

 A couple of years ago, I received an email campaign ad for the city candidates, and saw he was running in a local election. I almost spit out my coffee reading, word for word, all of those personal details he was sharing with me about himself in his short campaign blurb about himself. I mean, word for word, like he's been practicing these lines his entire life. Man, talk about a line!

Then he tells me, out of the blue, no conversation happening thst would make this a sensible thing to say: 
""I'm just going to put this out there, but your like a drug, my brain releases oxytocin when I'm with you, as well as all the other feel good signals
And I'm going through withdrawals from not being with you. ""
I told him he was acting like he's infatuated, and that I'm not responsible for those feelings and not to put them on me because I dobt feel the same way. He said he understood, that he could see he was being needy. 
Then later on he says, after begging me to let him come over and telling me how horny he is, ""Do your thing, we can talk later. But I want to be with you cuz on the inside I feel like I've been dumped. I just want you. Please don't push me out of your life"" 

Dude. It's been four days. We've been dating six weeks. We text all day long. 

Can anyone help me understand why this makes my skin crawl? I want to be able to articulate it to him in a constructive way, he does take feedback really well and I want to give him the chance to make changes before I give up/run away. 


*I'm pretty blunt, so I've told him I don't like it, that if I want visitors, I'll do the inviting, and asking if I want company implies that it might not have occurred to me that I did want company and would like the suggestion, as if the only reason wed be hanging out is becasue he suggested that I might want company, and not becasue I invited him over myself. It makes it seem like I've got nothing going on, thst I'm just sitting around bored waiting for ideas on what to do, and that since he's not there, I must not be doing anything I'd need to be alone for, so he should be involved.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o0sdic/he_told_me_hes_hurting_because_he_misses_me_so/

I was about to give up on him last night when I got a short text from him at bedtime after not hearing from him all day.

What am I supposed to think? At this point, with all the ghosting talk on this site and having it happened to me before, I don't even think about whether it's something I did. But why the sudden change? Am I supposed to keep waiting to see if he'll follow through and maybe even ask me out on a date?

Here is the only issue I have in the relationship, she doesn't have any money.  Both her and her daughter have old cars that are in really bad shape.  She is currently working 2 jobs to try and keep her kids fed with a roof over their heads and I respect that she is such an awesome mom.   But I know from our conversations that she is making around $35k per year and I'm making around $115k per year. I really, really, like this girl, but I'm afraid if we move on that I will be spending a lot of my money to cover her expenses and I'm not sure that I am ready for that.  She has never once asked me for money, but numerous times she has made it perfectly clear that she could use some help.

I don’t look my age (44F) and I’m always told I look like I’m in my 20s, even by people who meet me in person. It’s both a blessing and a curse. 80% of the men that match me are under the age of 30 (not going there) and 15% are over the age of 60 (not going there either) which leaves a small handful of decent men my age. I had my age preference set but had to change it to “not a deal breaker” because there weren’t enough men in my age preference. I don’t exactly live in the best city for dating: there are a lot of fake accounts and sex workers that make it difficult for us normies. I’ve even had several guys question whether or not I was real and I’m starting to think perhaps that’s why a lot of them don’t message me or respond to messages I’ve sent. I’ve tried including what I’m looking for in my bio and had a guy tell me I came off mean and another one tell me I sounded bitter (he also kept changing his profile in attempts to match me 4 separate times so maybe he was the bitter one). I eventually changed my bio tho. I’m obviously not the only one struggling or this sub wouldn’t be so big. I’m beginning to think online dating at our age is a lost cause.

Edit: Note to self *people don’t like it when you say you don’t look your age and will downvote you because they assume you’re trying to say you look good and better than all of them because they associate youth with beauty.* Never said I looked good, I just said I don’t look my age.

Also, the concept of dating; I'm so uncomfortable talking with and meeting multiple people.  I don't like it, but I know it's part of the process.  Then I get hung up on what is too little or too much communication?  As you may tell, I am a chronic overthinker.  Should I get a book?  I don't know.

80,o18oqf,1623860407,Appropriate photos?,"(49)M divorced 5 years after 21 yr. marriage. I’ve been in 2 relationships over the past 27 years (both of which I ended). I’m new to dating, specifically OLD, and I want to know what others think is appropriate. I’m 5’10” red haired, and keep it very short, as I’m bald on top, and not wealthy. My advantage is that I’m around 10% body fat, and look muscular without gym workouts. I’m an outdoor endurance athlete, and I’m proud of my physique. I’ve earned it for myself and feel like it is part of my personality. 

But, when I had women review a kayaking shirtless photo of myself on photofeeler.com the photo got trashed. I could’ve put up a picture of a dog turd and it would have done better. I believe that I get it though: the photo was from a bright and hot day where I was wearing a large hat and sunglasses. The comments for it were mostly about not being able to see my face well, and I understand that many women might feel catfished if they thought initially a guy was hot and it turns out that he had an ugly face, so they might need to see the whole package at once. In my OLD profile though, I lead with a photo of my whole face and head while smiling with my teeth showing and my other pictures show me doing various activities. 
In my profile, does the context matter? Or are women that opposed to guys showing skin? This wasn’t a shirtless gym selfie in the bathroom mirror. I just captured a moment of me being me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o18oqf/appropriate_photos/

Recently I had started talking to someone from a dating app; I felt like she was fairly easy to talk to, and we were conversing daily.  We met up twice this past weekend, and she said she really liked me and could see herself falling for me.  I was a little skeptical at first, but I started to really like her as well and could see falling for her as well.  I had told her everything about things that have happened to me recently (including my divorce last year and being heartbroken by another person I had seen earlier this year).  She was understanding, and she said I could tell her anything.

She was a Christian and I'm not, and at first, from what she said, it seemed like that wouldn't be a big issue.  Then just yesterday, [she said she decided it was a big issue and she called things off with me](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o0hyp1/we_started_to_like_each_other_but_she_called_it/).  I felt like I was getting my hopes up, and I feel disappointed and a bit down now.  We were texting every day and being very open with each other, which felt nice.  She was even being fairly flirty with me and was attracted to me, which is something I feel is unusual for me.  We had only been talking for about a week, so it doesn't feel like the end of the world, but I feel like I can easily get my hopes up and then be let down.

I know it's common for things to come up in the early stages of dating and it's natural to feel down when someone calls it off, but should it really feel so disappointing?

Before this, I had been seeing someone (who I also met from a dating app) for about 3 months earlier this year who had said she was looking for a friend that might lead to a long-term relationship.  She was giving some of what I felt like were mixed signals &amp; said she liked me, and I liked her too; I developed strong feelings, and then she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and later ghosted me.  That whole experience had me feeling really down and I think got me into a bit of a depression.

I've come to the realization that this especially applies to OLD, and the whole effort in finding someone, when you really couldn't give a rat's ass whether you meet someone or not on there. It's not that I'm down in the dumps and never get messages, I've had plenty of women want to meet, and I have met a few. At one time all I lived for was trying to find ""the one"". 
I feel now in my life at 48, I like my freedom and the ability to buy what I want, go where I want, I dont have to check in with anyone...etc. 

Maybe I've been single for so long, that now I'm used to just having myself and my family in my life. I'm stuck in my ways, and untrainable anymore..lol 
Perhaps meeting someone in person through events, clubs, etc would be different as you get to know the person as a friend first over time? Kind of like familiarity?

I'm 41 and last November last year my wife of 15years and I split. I've never been good with women, my ex-wife was my second girlfriend in my whole life. (yes at 26 I know...) I recently went to OLD mostly to get company, I really miss the cuddling (yes sex is nice, but not my primary reason).

So I meet someone, we have a lot in common, she has godly eyes that melts my knees, we have a good first date that I think will end with a small kiss goodbye... however it ended up in a 3h marathon of passionate kissing were I totally lost myself, it was good! However, something was bothering me.. but I didn't knew what it was.

So today we meet again (6 days later, we talked each day since then), again we had cool chat, but it quickly becomes physical, passionate and we get intimate. But this time I don't lose myself as much, in the heat of the moment I'm don't know what's happening... I had a hard time (pun intended) getting it 'on'... In retrospect, I found what has been bothering me: I don't find her attractive.

I really think she's into me and while I would really like to see her again for talking, sharing and cuddling I'm afraid that she'll expect this relation to keep being physical. I'm especially afraid of being seen as one of these losers who just want to ghost after getting intimate.

Anyone had similar situation and what have you done?

I really hope this doesn't makes me a bad person, I'm so bad at dating and relationship, understanding my feeling...

We kept chatting, but she was a bit evasive about setting up a second date, and eventually told me she had quite a bit of anxiety about committing, labels, and relationships. So I did something I'm usually really crap at, I was completely open and honest about my feelings, how I was also really nervous - we both had crappy past relationships, and we were both old enough to not use labels and decide what we wanted to do at our own pace.

My anxious attachment traits- I am needy emotionally, I do find myself engaging in 'protest' behaviours when I find that he is not meeting my need for connection. Working on myself but it will take time.

His secure traits- introduced me to friends and family v early on, not afraid to be close and intimate me. His avoidant traits - seems to pull back once we are about to move to the next stage in our relationship, not expressing his feelings but suppressing them and then pulling back unexpectedly. 

We otherwise both want marriage, kids, or so he says.
W do enjoy spending time w each other. Do all manner of things together from cooking to laundry to groceries and daily jogs to keep fit. I don't know what is keeping him from taking the next step except perhaps the fear that we are not completely compatible and he would feel the need to pull away again. 

I don't know if this was what happened w his ex wife. But it sounded like she was the one who pulled away first. Am not sure what I will get out of posting this. Maybe some advice from people who have been in similar relationships - the anxious avoidant trap. I want to make it work.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o1z3ii/advice_for_an_anxious_attachment_style/
