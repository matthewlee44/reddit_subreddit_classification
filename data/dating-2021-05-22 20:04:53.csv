0,niwpul,1621732158,When should I let him know?,"Hi! I recently started seeing my previous coworker outside of work. I actually have a really great time with him as he is a kind person. He got out of a 12 yr relationship last summer. I got out of a 2 yr relationship in December. He’s been asking me to hang out a looot. It’s things we both enjoy.. Nature, hiking, food, etc. I actually invited him to go camping with my friends and I since he said he’s been wanting to travel more. 

THOUGH I see him as only a friend and am not looking for anything further in general since I’m hyperfocusing on my goals at the moment. Should I say something like “hey just wanna let you know I’m not looking to date at the moment?” Etc or should I wait until it really feels like he’s trying to have something more serious with me? 

He even invited me to go to his cousin’s bday event in which all his family will be there too.

12,nixzfa,1621736678,I’m Completely Lost," 

I'll be turning 30 soon and I've never had a girlfriend before. Not a virgin and I have had a couple hookups here and there but more than anything I'd love to fall in love, have a beautiful wife and be a dad someday but it looks as if that's never going to happen. I'm fit and workout daily, attractive black guy, love to go hiking/camping, travel and do fun things; but alas that's never translated into meeting someone.

For the last 3 years I've tried dating apps and those never worked out for me. I used a date coach and had my profile checked out and they always said it was one of the best but I garnered little to no interest from attractive women. I know the pandemic made it hard to meet people in person too but even now when it's starting to go back to normal I can't meet someone.

When others give me advice they say join groups or meet through friends except I have no friends. Most of my days are spent alone and I do everything by myself whether it's go out for dinner or hiking or just cruising around at parks. I used to love being alone and I cherished those times but now it's tiresome, I want to know what it's like on the other side too. The side of having someone spontaneously call me up on a Friday night asking to come chill, the side of having a woman by my side to support one another and spend time with. 

I feel as if my luck has just been awful. Everywhere I go are couples having a good time, people out on dates and friends always having someone to hangout with on weekends etc. The last time I tried to ask someone to hangout with me I had to beg or they just cancel and I refuse to be that guy anymore. In all fairness though something I have struggled with for a long time is the feeling of being left out, that feeling of never being on anyone's mind or know what it's like to be wanted. Granted I started trying to date later in life but never in my wildest dreams did I ever assume it would be this hard.

I know I'm worthy of love, affection and friendships but I'm just lost and don't know where to start...I guess. How do I make friends this late in life where most have them carry over from school or work? How do I meet a woman who's interested in wanting to get to know me and possibly build towards something? Honestly it feels as though I'm starting life from scratch.

13,niy196,1621736862,Found out recently that looks aren’t everything,"So I’m 25, never properly dated or had a relationship before due to some personal issues I’ve worked through recently with my therapist. Lost a bunch of pandemic weight over the past few months, been putting myself out there on dating apps, and went on my first date in 6 years just a few weeks ago. 

So I’m actually pretty decent looking. I’d say I’m not a runway model by any stretch but I get attention sometimes when walking around or ordering food at a fast food place. 

Anyways, back to the date. It was at a sushi place with a 20 year old girl on Bumble. Gorgeous girl with a slim figure and cute face. At first the date was going really well. I’m a pretty oblivious dude, but I could tell she was into me. 

At the end of the night we hugged and planned the second date. A few hours later I get a text saying that she didn’t feel any chemistry. After a quick chat later, I figure out that part of it was me being an inexperienced dude who didn’t escalate properly and kept things too friendly. 

Sooo yeah, looks aren’t everything. You can mess it up after you’ve gotten someone on a date too, even if they’re into you at first. I guess there’s maybe a point where you’re good looking enough to someone that they’ll ignore everything to get inside your pants, but I guess I haven’t hit that threshold. 

There’s also the nature of chemistry. Looking back, I completely agree with what the girl said. She was absolutely hot but not my type, plus we just didn’t have a lot in common. I might have gotten her into a short term fling if I’d been more experienced/assertive but it would’ve still been a fling. I imagine it’s the same for girls. 

Anyways, back to the drawing board... hopefully I’ll find someone who likes me enough to be patient with me and my lack of experience...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/niy196/found_out_recently_that_looks_arent_everything/

19,niygzu,1621738494,My hilariously disastrous virtual date with a well regarded (irony!) successful relationship and communication author/speaker,"Tonight, I had a virtual date with a woman I had been speaking with off Hinge. She was a little further out than my usual matches, so we arranged to do a virtual call this evening. Because her full name was listed in her profile, I was able to get some idea of who she was. She actually had a Wikipedia bio since she's pretty well regarded and an intellectual in the world of human connection and relationship who has done some speaking on the subject at a more deeper level. For that reason, I was a little anxious as to what I should expect with someone who seemed like she might speak over my head.

When we started the call, I could immediately tell something was off about her. She seemed like she was neither here nor there, and as the conversation began to flow, it became clear that she -- to put it bluntly -- stoned out of her fucking mind. I kid you not -- If I did not lead the conversation, she would have literally just sat there blankly not saying anything, so for about 25 minutes, I did my best to have conversation, engage her in questions, and so on, until I got to a point where I said in my head, ""Ok, let's see what happens if I don't say anything at this point."" And. She. Just. Sat. There. With her eyes half open. Finally, she goes, ""I think I'm gonna get going. I'm feeling woozy..."" and I thought, ""Yeah, I bet you are..."" Bid her goodnight, and immediately hit unmatch.

It's hilarious at the same time, too, given the irony of a relationship expert going on a date where they're a mess. At least it made for a good story, and it wasn't a real in person date, right?

Right now, I'm on my last legs with Hinge as well, and I think this was the straw that broke the camel's back in making me quit the damn app all over again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/niygzu/my_hilariously_disastrous_virtual_date_with_a/
20,niykks,1621738855,Personal Fitness Standards,"Okay, so, I'm gonna get on my soap box for this one (please remove if not allowed). 

But in dating, I've realized the #1 thing the majority of people look for (at least to start) is good genetic looks. It sucks, but that's the reality of the situation.

Working out sucks, nobody likes dieting or exercising. But honestly, for a lot of people dating, you would have (I believe) a much easier time setting your expectations to a reasonable level. 

For the guys, that means if you're not working out regularly, you shouldn't be asking for a woman who regularly works out. And for a woman, if you are not hitting the gym regularly, you should not be asking for a man who works out every day.

And obviously I'm not looking for a model, but someone that takes care of their body, mental and financial health (doesn't have to be rich, but at least on a track of improving every day). 

A lot of people's dating issues would go away if they set their expectations accurately. On a piece of paper, write down the top few qualities you would like. For me, that's personal fitness/health, supportive, and fun to be around / nice / sanity (no silent treatment, abusive behavior , etc), find someone that matches most of what you're looking for and work from there. 

I see so many bio's dating wise that are asking for things that they themselves are not providing (both men and women).

We hit it off at a party at my university, and we ended going to get coffee a few days later. She’s unlike any girl I’ve met as we connected really well from my perspective. We hung out for around 4 hours and sadly the pandemic hit a few days later, leading us both to return to our homes. (Our university is in LA, but my home is in San Diego)

We continued to text each other for a few weeks on and off, yet she was still super responsive. Fast forward to about September, and she reached out to me to hangout as she returned back to our uni. Unfortunately, I chose to stay at home for the year but I drove up to see her for a day. Its almost like time flew by with her and I just loved being able to talk to her. I’ve honestly never felt this happy being around a girl, which sucked because I’ve gotten really attached.

For a while, I thought she lost interest in me and I left her alone. Then around two weeks ago she reached out again saying she’d “love to see me”. We had another amazing afternoon, in a park and we just talked for hours. I loved learning more about her and just listening to her. However, she sadly told me she is moving to New York City in august for grad school. I still have one year left in LA.

Now I really like her and I have struggled to find ways to let her know this as we don’t hangout that often, which is my fault as I don’t feel like I reached out enough due to self doubt. With her leaving, I don’t know what I should do. I don’t want to necessarily put the pressure of her being “my girlfriend” but I know I will forever regret it if I never let her know how special I think she is. I’m not looking so far ahead in terms of dating, because I don’t want to tie her down in any way. But I’ve been having such a hard time in knowing what I should do with time running out. I don’t know if I’m in love because I still feel like I don’t know her well enough. But I feel like there’s something special between us that I do not want to lose.

I’m sorry this was so long, I have no one to really talk about this with in my life and I really would appreciate any advice because it’s been bothering so much.

She’s literally everything that I could want in a woman. Her personality is so intriguing to me and personalities like hers have always served as a really great compliment to my own personality in my personal experience. We are close in age and have very similar interests but there’s one problem: I’ve never actually met her and it would be hard to actually meet her since she lives far away. 

So I wonder, do you guys think that it’s possible to have a connection with someone even without actually knowing or having met each other in person? I’m a very rational person, and this makes no logical sense to me and sounds absolutely ridiculous, but for some reason I can’t shake this feeling that there’s some spiritual connection (if that’s what you would call this) between us. Maybe it’s just my lack of emotional intelligence but I just don’t understand why I’m feeling so connected to this girl and whether or not I’m being crazy about the situation and hoping for an imaginary situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nizltz/can_you_have_a_connection_with_someone_youve_not/

38,nj0c30,1621745530,"Hookup turned friends, now I'm catching feelings and don't know how to tell him","Met this guy on Tinder. Our first two meetings, we hooked up. I'm pretty open to what I'm looking for, and assumed this was all he wanted. 

However, since then we've become pretty good friends, and nothing physical has happened since that 2nd meeting. I usually see him 1 or 2 times a week (it's been about 2 months).

42,nj0vx6,1621747673,Dating with a stutter - announce it or don't announce it?,"So I've stuttered my entire life, and to provide a bit of background, it is very much like how the bible describes Moses as ""slow of speech"". I am very good at verbalizing my thoughts and have a nice masculine voice but my brain and nervous system struggle to say the words. My body literally forgets how to make words each morning, and the more I speak, the better I get at speaking. Before COVID, when I worked in an office my speech had gotten very good. Since COVID, I don't speak much outside of weekly work meetings and with my personal trainer. Everything else is slack and online, and my speech has gotten awful. Despite being extroverted, I'm goal driven and don't speak for the hell of it so my speech now sucks. I also had something similar in college and law school because while I'd speak to friends, my day to day wasn't based around speaking. I was only close to resembling fluent when I worked in an office.

I'm not sure how to bring this up to women I meet on websites. When I've mentioned it before a date, a decent percentage of women have lost interest as I feel it comes with stereotypes that don't represent me. When I mention it on a date, it does seem to make things awkward and it can come across as apologizing for who I am rather than explaining it. In the past, the stutter was much more slight and more often than not wouldn't come out on a first date so it wasn't really a thing to bring up. I'm not insecure about the stutter or anything like that or reading too much into anything - it really is affecting how women perceive me on dates, and it's not that I'm not comfortable with it. I am. In fact, I prefer stuttering than going to great lengths to not stutter. 

I think it's amplified by the fact that I am a lawyer and also a lecturer at a number of universities, and there seems to be a question of how can someone be a successful lawyer if they stutter? In fairness, I went to one of the top law schools and had among the best grades in the class, but was rejected by almost every firm because of this presumption. Ultimately, the free market tends to be result oriented and I wound up becoming very successful simply because I contribute value, but without knowing me I think women are calling bullshit when I mention what exactly it is that I do and my role at the company I'm with. Even now, I could easily negotiate a raise almost any time I want where I'm at but despite the resume, I'd undoubtedly struggle to get a similar role somewhere else. I'm not crying boohoo, but the reality is there is a lot of discrimination, and I don't even really mind it that much because I know at the end of the day I'm going to succeed, and whoever looks past the stammer will benefit. 

However, I do think a lot of women are internally calling bullshit when I tell them what it is that I do unless they research me, and the only explanation for my success is that I'm quite frankly smarter than 99.99% of people, but I'm not going to say that because that's not my style at all. I also don't really take myself too seriously, and the situation is amplified by the fact I don't like dressing up, and am very down to earth. Don't get me wrong I have fashion but it's more form fitting v-necks and yeezy's than Brooks Brothers. If you didn't see me taking a test, analyzing a case, or discussing philosophy with me, you'd have no idea of my educational background or IQ. I hate pretentiousness and make a concerted effort to be down to earth despite my interests really lying in academia and finance.

I should also note that while I'm not a male model, I keep myself in very good shape and am muscularly chiseled so I do well with women who are just looking for a hot guy to fuck, but that isn't very interesting to me. I want a quality woman and am hoping to find my life partner and to create a home, and that's where the stutter is really seeming to hold me up. It's not insecurity about the stutter. I can address an audience of a 1,000 people, stutter my ass through a debate, and not give a shit. It really is just the stutter. You can say well those women aren't good people or it's a bad match, but I don't think that's true because I get a lot of dates and this is a recurring pattern. I also intentionally use pictures from when I didn't have six-pack abs and that weren't in good lighting so as to never present myself as hotter than I am, and have seduced enough women to know that I'm definitely not awkward on dates. It's really just the stutter.

My question is from the other person's perspective, knowing all this, and that you're dating a guy with a pronounced stutter - when and what is the ideal way for him to mention it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj0vx6/dating_with_a_stutter_announce_it_or_dont/

If you search up ""Why Do Women Have The Upper Hand On Tinder"". The article will go into the different experiences men and women have on these dating apps.

If the data they present is to believed, it shows that on average women will pass on 95% of the options presented to them vs the 47% for men. So out of 100 guys they will only like 5 and match with 1.

It just shows that women are just pickier with the people that they match with.

I said I respect his feelings, but I can’t do that. So I told him the door was open if he wanted to reconnect, but I wouldn’t be waiting.

Now it has been several months and I saw him on bumble. I miss him as a friend, but I also miss that connection. 

I sometimes regret stating my boundaries so harshly. I’m torn between believing he was telling the truth (and it was bad timing) or if he tried to let me down easy.

But then they also say these things should precisely dictate who you can date. 😫 Which one is it?,"I can never get over the degree to which people can directly contradict themselves while believing they are still making sense.

On one hand, if you complain about how your height or race seem to be the only things that matter to women, people tell you that's nonsense and these things should do not matter at all. In fact, you will typically be told the only thing that matters is that by complaining about it, you have a ""bad personality"" and deserve to die in a gutter or be shot in the streets for having such a ""bad personality.""

Then if you observe that all the women you find attractive are dating tall white guys, people say, ""Well that's only natural. If those women are attractive they will have lots of options and pick those guys first.""

Or they will ask you what heights and races of women you are talking about, as if again to imply your height and race DOES COMPLETELY determine who you can or can't date (if it didn't why would it be relevant?).

How can people even take themselves seriously when they give such nonsense and contradictory advice in the same breath?

I know tall white guys who date hot girls of any race. If height and race don't matter for men, where are all the short brown guys dating hot girls of any race?

She's 2 years younger than me and she's kinda immature from what I've heard (But I don't mind it she's still young and so am i)
But the thing is, I'm not even close to what she deserves in terms of looks, she's just too good looking for me.
Even if I don't necessarily care about her looks, she probably will.
Let's say I'm a 4 or 5/10 and she's a straight 8/10.
I can't stop thinking about her until I manage to do something with her.
Is it possible?

70,nj4lj8,1621763731,"Guy I am seeing won’t let me cook for him, this really hurts my feelings","I (27/f) have been seeing this guy (21/m) for about a month now. He only eats take out. I love cooking, it’s how I show people I love them. I cook for my friends/roommates every day and I always used to cook for my ex and his friends. Nothing makes me happier than people eating my food.


However, my guy doesn’t want me to cook for him. He says he won’t eat anything homemade. I asked him when he’d let me cook for him and he said, “when you’re my wife.” Then he said he meant “girlfriend.” But I wonder if he is just saying that so that I stop talking about it.


I don’t want to push but I’ve offered cooking his favorite food, learning to make whatever it is he likes, etc. He also doesn’t eat what his friends make btw so it’s not personal. 


Should I just surprise him with something? I don’t want to spend my whole life only cooking for myself but I also don’t want to force anyone to eat something they don’t want. Has anyone been in this situation before and does it get better? I know from my autism support group that some people dislike eating what others make and that it doesn’t go away... cause many people in the group still don’t eat what their partners/parents make.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj4lj8/guy_i_am_seeing_wont_let_me_cook_for_him_this/
71,nj4sxf,1621764572,A close friend,"26M here. I have this 24F friend who's really close. We hung out a lot in the first year of my MBA. Then the second year was all online, and we still had regular long calls 2-3 hrs at a go. We're both single people and definitely, though she's the prettiest in my college, I've always only seen her as a friend. Having been genuine with her, she really values me a lot, because she suffered from a toxic gossip culture back at the college. We've shared about every secret of each other's lives including relationships and preferences to great detail. 

This February, as our MBA was coming to a close, we all (most of my class) decided to shift together for a month. She came for a week. She said she'll rather share a room with me than with some girl. We had two beds in the room, but she asked me to join them both coz that will be more comfortable. But it was all friendly. 

But I did get attracted to her this time. She did give away a few hints: she has an affinity towards &lt;region&gt; guys (which I am), she's not into playboy type guys and looks for soft people. And she's open to both casual and long term.

When I sent her off for the last time after finishing college in March, I sent a long text in general appreciating our friendship, but also mentioned how she's cute and I like her. 

But she didn't address that point of me liking her at that point.

But it so happened that both our job postings are going to be in the same city. Once our companies call us back to the office (wfh for now), there is some scope. The last when I talked to her, again, after long talks, when we were sleepy, she said something like, ""let's see, if we get back to &lt;City&gt;, then.."" then she stopped and said that she's just sleepy.


What is your advice on this? I don't want to spoil the friendship, but I feel I should be more upfront in my intention of wanting to date her. 

She had a bad breakup from her last relationship and doesn't want to get hurt again. She says she learnt how not to be attached. She could have easily got into a relationship, but she turned down a lot of guys at my college. She didn't even do flings.

72,nj55wo,1621766130,I just told my crush that anyone who gets to be his friend is lucky and his reaction was beautiful,"I was at a party last night when a friend asked cm me to meet up and talk. We do like each other but we’re both recently single and it seems like we both think it would be too messy for us to get involved. We do have the best conversations though and we just get each other. We don’t hang out that often because we need to focus on ourselves and our breakup processes. Still, we talk for hours sometimes and the communication is very honest.

Last week I passed by a basketball court in the city and saw him with his friends smiling and having fun. I didn’t approach them but I just thought to myself “wow those are some lucky people”. I told him this last night and it almost made him cry. He said it was one of the sweetest things he’d heard.

What are some similar experiences you’ve had with sharing your purest, kindest thoughts to people? I think it’s such a beautiful thing. I think people are afraid to come off as creepy, but seriously, why don’t we share the nice stuff we think about other people?

75,nj5gf4,1621767434,"It's not that men only want sex, it's that no men finds you good enough to be his gf","Do you feel men only wants sex from you and its makes you feel men only wants sex and not relationship?

As a male I can say its not true. You have to understand how men think in order to understand this.

Let's first assume a scenario where a man meets his dream woman. Would he want only sex from her? No, of course not. He wants her to be his gf.

A dream woman does not exists but it's does not mean men does not have standards for a gf.
Now men have two standards:
1. For a gf.
2. for casual sex.

The standard of a gf is much higher than a casual sex. When you talk with some man and he thinks you don't fit to be his gf you may fit for casual sex. In that case he will try to sleep with you but not to have relationship with you. You basically got rejected for the gf position but not for the sex position. 

Women filter a lot for potential bf and it's acceptable, they just does not have or want to have a standard fit casual sex. 
Men filter a lot too for gf, they just can accept casual sex much easily. 

So if men only offer you sex it means none of them saw you as a gf option and try to think why.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj5gf4/its_not_that_men_only_want_sex_its_that_no_men/

79,nj5v44,1621769168,What I’ve learned e-dating,"1) If you’re not getting any dates, work on the bio and the pictures you’re presenting. If you’re average or below average in looks, that’s ok, but you need to put more effort in up front with the profile then. 

Don’t be basic. 

And if you’ve no looks and no personality thems the breaks and the brakes. Would you even date you if that’s the case? If no, go put some work in on the things you can do something about.

2) Once your profile is getting bites and you’re talking to someone you’re keen on, hell you’ve even met for coffee... understand that you’ve absolutely no power over their pacing or interest and so you have to relinquish the idea of control. 

Nothing you do is going to make someone who isn’t that into you more into you In fact the harder you try you’ll find the more they will resist as you come off as clingy and no one wants that.

You already showed them the best version of yourself more or less on that first date, so put in effort as needed for communication but make sure it matches theirs and just enjoy the process because the relationship goodies some of us enjoy with one partner, don’t happen overnight.

Never put in more effort than you’re getting back in return.

3) sometimes it doesn’t work out and that’s ok.

when e-dating always keep options open. If there’s been no exclusivity talk, talk to as many as you’re able so when one you were extra keen on is gone that’s ok you’ve other options built in their wake.

I saw this somewhere “Until someone tells you that they want to be with you and their actions match, don’t let them hold up the line”

4) have fun! This doesn’t have to be a miserable process. Leave expectations at the door and just have a good time meeting new people.

83,nj6aiy,1621771024,Is confidence attractive or are attractive people confident?,"I see the advice that people should “just be confident, confidence is sexy” or whatever here a lot and it has pushed me to ask this question. What came first? The attractiveness or the confidence. I’m not saying it’s bad to be confident; for average looking people, being confident to some extent it good. I say some extent there is a thing as overconfidence in your appearance or thinking your all that, but an appropriate level of confidence relative to your appearance is good.

Recently I was talking to my friend who’s very attractive and very successful with women. One of the things he told me I should try was being more confident. He said that he wasn’t good with girls until after he got confident. I asked him how he started feeling so confident, his answer was, “After girls started telling me they thought I was good looking I felt confident in myself”

So my immediate thought was, “well then confidence didn’t help, it was just a byproduct of being good looking. I started asking around, people I knew and some people on Reddit, and for nearly all of them, they have similar answers. What is really pushing me over this edge is another close friend’s story.

He is the most unconfident, socially awkward, anxious person I know. He’s TERRIFIED of women. But he’s a 6’1, blond haired, blue eyed guy with a decent face and a good body and he constantly gets attention from girls around us. What we hang out together, girls will come up to me and ask about him because they’re intimidated by how attractive he is despite his lack of confidence.

I’m just a little confused on how people see it. I’m a painfully average looking 5’10 guy who isn’t confident in his appearance at all, and I’m curious if it’d actually make a difference.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj6aiy/is_confidence_attractive_or_are_attractive_people/

90,nj6whs,1621773378,Worst date of my life,"Me and this guy matched on tinder a week ago and have been talking everyday about anything- and genuinely he was fun to talk to. From texting to FaceTiming. So we decided to see each other face to face over the weekend. 

While we were trying to come up with things to do, I did tell him I don’t like dancing or clubs and I don’t drink alcohol (for personal reasons). But when the day came, we both hadn’t come up with anything to do so instead he invited me to an area that’s just a strip of bars and clubs and full of tourists. Not my ideal first date (or any date for that matter) but I decided to go because I’ve been working for days straight plus it was my only day off before going into work tomorrow. So we agreed and he told me to bring a friend because his friend was coming. My response: Okay? So I brought a good friend of mine.

We both showed up to one of the bars that was also a club and I already wasn’t enjoying the atmosphere. So tinder guy and his friend briefly greet us then continue to drink and dance amongst themselves as if me and my friend weren’t present. Every woman that walked passed them they would make eye contact and would try to scope them out- really uncomfortable feeling. Yet somehow every guy that approached me and my friend tinder dude and HIS friend would notice we existed, get defensive and ask the guy to join us? 

Then it got to point where my date just plain out approached a group of girls and started flirting with them right in front of me and when I approached him about it he said “idk why you’re getting bent out of shape for we were just having a basic conversation and you and your friend bring negative energy.” 

As much as I wanted to punch him in the throat, I don’t like to resort to violence and just turned around and left. Mind you, this date lasted 45 minutes.

92,nj891q,1621778188,Nothing serious with feelings involved. What does that mean?,"Hi all! I (23f) been having a pretty intense 2 months with my fwb (28m). When we just started talking, he stated he just got out of a long relationship, so I assumed he was looking for some great sex and nothing more.

However, for the past two months we’ve been around eachother pretty much 24/7, and I progressively felt like it was ‘more’ than just fwb/hooking up. At this point it feels like a relationship. I was planning on having an honest conversation about it soon, but he actually took the lead and opened up to me two days ago, and now I’m not really sure how to progress.

He basically stated that he wasn’t looking for a serious relationship. On the other hand he admitted having feelings for me. He made sure to emphasize the fact that he likes me around as a person, values me in his life, is interested in my world views etc. All wonderful of course. My main concern was that he was just projecting his feelings for his ex/filling some kind of void on/with me, but he replied that this felt way different, that he found himself surprised by this feeling, as he initially just wanted to fuck around a little bit. 

Me on the other hand; I wasn’t looking for anything serious either. However, as time progressed, I have developed a deep liking for him and his way of thinking, his personality and his company outside of the bedroom. Am I in love? No. Are there more feelings involved other than friendship? Yes.

I’m not sure how to progress. We agreed to keep communicating open and honestly with each other, as we have been for the past months. We agreed on keeping the relationship we have as it is now. I’m just unsure of what he means by ‘nothing serious’, because right now it feels like a relationship but just without the label ‘relationship’ and meeting the parents etc. 

I’m also worried I will develop more feelings. I’m probably way overthinking this as I’m very much enjoying what we do now. I do not really care about labels as ‘relationship’ too much. I just hope I’m not setting myself up for disappointment or heartbreak.

94,nj8e5p,1621778625,Need some clarification/advice on this situation with my friend/crush please,"So I've [17M]  been talking to this friend. [17F] for a little while and we've both been going through some shit and have been like one of the only support systems for each other that we've been expressing ourselves to. I fuck around and catch some feelings for her. 

For context, a few years ago, we had mutual feelings for each other but none of us made a move on each other and we moved on. She ended up in a relationship a little while after that and I remained single. 

So we started talking again around a month ago and we finally addressed and admitted that we did have feelings for each other back then. We both implied that we regret not having made a move as to what could've been. 

I end up catching feels and I know that she broke up with her boyfriend a few months ago. I didn't want to make any moves too soon just because I knew that she was still processing the breakup. Anyways, she somehow finds out that im into a girl and she really wants to know who. I didn't tell her and she went around trying to ask my friends, who also didn't tell her. 

A couple of nights ago, we were talking and she said that she really wanted to know who I was into. I brushed it off and asked her how she was, and if she was ready to start dating again. She said that she was still processing but that she hasn't ruled out dating altogether. A couple of minutes later, she adds ""you're so easy to read, I know exactly who you like.""and ""I know that you know that I know who you like""

Then she said other things like:

""Haven't you learnt anything from a few years ago (when we were both into each other), why can't you just tell me""


I said that it's a complicated situation and it's too soon to really tell. And she said ""I assure you, I know exactly what your situation is and it's not too soon, so just tell me""

""Waiting has only proven to be detrimental to you in the past, so just shoot your shot""

At this point, it seemed like she knew that I was into her but she didn't want to make the assumption that I did. Seeing how badly she wanted me to tell her, also made me feel as if she shared feelings as well.

So anyways, I ended up telling her about my feelings for her. And she says that she didn't see it coming. She also added that it's not my fault, but it's just that she's not in a headspace to date or be romantic at the moment.

She asked me whether my friends knew and I said that they did. She added ""where was this support from them a few years ago"" (my friends didn't tell me that she was into me, at the time). That was an interesting statement, I don't know how to feel about it.

She also added that she's still open to being friends but it's really just my call. I mean, we're talking again but it doesn't feel the same. Still a slight aura of awkwardness. ,

A large part of me hopes that this is just a case of 'right person, wrong time' because I still like her and  would love to still be in a relationship with her. Idon't know how to feel.

It's just so tiring, I try breaking up multiple times but he keeps promising me that he wants to work things out for us. Then he said he loved me but he just does not need love anymore and he doesn’t need it. He blocked me on Whatsapp and he keeps saying that we are not working anymore. He didn’t say he wants to break up or anything. 

Do I still need to wait for him or just move on already? I don’t know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj8ggj/unstable_relationship/

99,nj93n3,1621780893,"Advice/Rant re Posts that Read ""Women Won't Date Me Because X""","Hey folks - so I keep seeing posts that generally read something to the effect that ""women won't date me because I'm not tall or I'm not white"". And look - dating is hard, and I'm all for venting, but this attitude is really problematic for a couple of reasons:

1. It's an insulting generalization. Essentially, it's saying all women are shallow to the point that they are fixated on one discrete trait (skin colour, height, etc) to the exclusion of all others. It's dehumanizing and othering by definition
2. It's hypocritical. On hand people who make this are saying: look at me, I'm a complex human being that's more than just my height/ethnicity, women should be more empathetic and see my charming personality before judging my immutable characteristics. While, simultaneously saying: oh but women, they are all shallow and only care about height/skin tone. The layers of self-involvement to be sad that no one see's one's own hidden depths but simultaneously think of an entire gender as a shallow caricature...
3. It's hurting your ability to get dates. If you think of women as less than men (ie shallow, obsessed with height, not a person who has depth), I promise you, you will not be as successful on a date as if you were excited and interested in getting to know them as a human being. And, I'm sure people will think ""I hide it"". Even assuming you're successful at doing so, if you don't have basic empathy for another person to expect they have more complex thought process than ""can't date certain height"" - you're not going to be able to relate with them on a human level.

To be clear - are there people out there who screen people based on height and race? Yes. Does that suck? Also emphatically yes. What's my point? Becoming jaded about dating because of bad experiences is a vicious cycle that not only will likely hurt your dating life but also turn you into a person that you don't want to be. 

TL;DR if you respect women, you will have a better chance dating them than if you think of all women as shallow and yourself as undatable.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj93n3/advicerant_re_posts_that_read_women_wont_date_me/
