1,opmm48,1626986498,I have to ask because I'm really dying to know....,"Is it just me or has anyone elses career been hugely influential on their love life? I remember an interesting post a few months ago where people stated which careers are red flags for them. Similarly, has your career changed how you relate to people? 

Case in point, I briefly dated a police officer and whenever his friends (he didn't have civilian friends, just fellow police officers) met me, they automatically assumed I was a police officer because they had an unspoken rule never to date civilians (they despised them). 

My career has given me front row seats to what happens when you marry for the wrong reasons or marry the wrong person. Nothing worse than being acutely unwell and your spouse doesn't care or takes that opportunity to leave you/your children hate you and are only interested in what is in your Will/no friends or family because your spouse isolated you etc",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/opmm48/i_have_to_ask_because_im_really_dying_to_know/

28,oq3mks,1627050796,What do you think of my method of gaging a woman's interest?,"I have noticed lately that there is a lot of anxiety out there for men in trying to ""break the touch barrier"" because they don't want to be put in the ""friend zone"". Well, in my experience, being so excessively touchy on the 1st date is a bit off putting and I feel unfair towards the girl. So, I came up with a new way that I have found to be quite successful: I ask her what her comfort zone is throughout the date

I have found my last 2 dates very successful. These are the key steps  
1. **I keep the first dates short:** 1 hour. We get coffee, and later go to a park before I walk her to the subway.   
\*Note: I act totally normal. I don't try ""kino"" unless it's natural. No stress on breaking any touch barrier. I just am respectfully getting to know her.

  
2. **I find a bench:** When sitting down, I will exaggerate sitting far away \[due to covid\], but I also ask to make sure if she would be comfortable sitting beside her. This is also a key gage of interest. If she says no, she saves face due to ""covid"" or simply being honest. If she says yes, this is an indication she may like me.  
3. **Before ending the date, I ask if it's ok to hold her hand while I walk her to the subway:** Maybe it's because we have been openly talking about comfort, but I usually go 1 step more and politely ask if I can grab her hand for a 2-3 minute walk. To my initial surprise, this has almost always been received very positively, and it has always gotten me a 2nd date as she now knows that I have interest in her.

37,oqfxlc,1627089181,WTF?," I (m52) met a woman(45)  3 years ago at a family party.   It was a little awkward because she’s the Mom of my nephews fiancé, and we had an instant attraction to each other.  

  We met that night, and ended up making out in the kitchen lol.  We got busted by her daughters, and have kept in touch ever since lol.  

  We have a good vibe together and always have.  She’s the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever hung out with. 
  We texted and Snapchatted almost every day for a couple years.  

  We’ve kissed probably 20 times, and had sex twice. 

  The problem is, Ive always had a bad crush on her, and I’ve never been quite convinced that it’s mutual.  

  I know she likes me, but she doesn’t make that extra effort to reserve time for me.  

  I told her that I think we’d be a great match in person, and told her that I’m crushing on her.  She’s told me that she likes me also.   She’s never said much more than that.  

  We’ve both dated other people while we’ve known each other, but it didn’t last.   I really don’t know how to proceed.   I’m more comfortable with this woman than any others I’ve met.   She’s beautiful so she constantly getting hit on.   

  I feel like she’s putting me in the friend zone.   I’m a single Dad, and I’m not in a huge hurry to get serious anyway, so I guess it’s fine.  I’d really rather just be somewhat casual, but not see anyone else though.   It would be cool if she would want the same. 

  Should I tell her this?   I feel like if I put too much pressure on her she might pull away.  I suck at being single.  I think she might also be scared of seriously dating the uncle of her daughters fiancé.

46,oqs1tc,1627140016,So is making a woman feel wanted out of style nowadays?,"Still figuring out dating post divorce. I’m 47F. Was married &gt; 20 years. Needless to say, I don’t have a lot of experience to begin with and it’s a whole new dating world. I don’t think I know how to navigate it at all. 
Context: I’ve been communicating quite a bit with a guy lately. We’ve only been on one casual date but have been talking or texting every day since which is very unusual for me. We finally landed on a second date where I would go to his place for dinner on Sunday (tomorrow) - he wants to cook. Yesterday was incredibly busy. I wasn’t responding to texts or calls  all day. When I called him at the end of the day there was definitely tension, despite the fact that I addressed my tardiness and he supposedly understood. Later I checked in by text before bed and he said he’s bothered but will get over it. I asked if we should check in before I come for dinner on Sunday just to make sure the air is clear so we can have a pleasant evening.  He responds that “it’s fine as of now but (he’ll) let me know if something changes.” Obviously that response doesn’t sit well with me. So I’m supposed to sit around and wait till he lets me know if he needs a raincheck? It’s extra awkward because he’s supposedly hosting me as a guest in his home. I said it’s totally okay if he needs that time but I kinda need to know what my schedule is. There’s no rush to date #2, so maybe we take a raincheck / reschedule for now?  He responds that if I don’t want to see him I can just say so. He said it’s fine already and isn’t going to beg. I don’t know about you but that’s not how I typically make someone feel welcome. I haven’t responded yet as I just saw the new response but obviously it’s too awkward for me to go over now. 

So I’m gathering the following trends and am just stumped. I’m not saying guys should have to do all the work by any means, but it feels like we have to shoulder all the burden of engagement and not even have the pleasure of feeling wanted?:

- Guys prefer the girl make the first move. Incredibly hard for many Gen X women, but fine.

- Guys prefer it if the girl ask him out. If not, the girl needs to make sure the guy KNOWS she’s interested in order for him to bother approaching. 

- Guys won’t make it obvious he really wants to spend time with a girl. If she wasn’t to hang out with him she needs to let him know. He’s not about to beg for her attention. 

- Guys shouldn’t compliment a women too much.  She’ll either get a big head or think you’re objectifying her. How sad. 

Well I’m not shamed to admit I miss the days when as a woman I would feel wanted, desired and sometimes courted a little. Sorry just had to vent before I move on from yet another disappointment.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oqs1tc/so_is_making_a_woman_feel_wanted_out_of_style/
47,oqsxwn,1627142963,So Grateful I Found Love At 52,"For my entire adult life, I (52HLM) always wanted love and romance above all else. Every decision I've made in my life, was either in pursuit of romance or out of love for my partner. 

For whatever reason I settled down with a LL and low-intimacy partner, and for whatever reason I allowed myself to be in a marriage for 25 years with very little romance, intimacy or sex.

By some miracle, my wife cast me out last year so that she could pursue a different life without me, and although I am resentful of the way she treated me at the end, and surprised I allowed myself to be with a intimacy-challenged person for so long, I was so relieved to be free to live my own life. 

I didn't think there was a romantic match for me, and wasn't sure I'd be ready to date again for a very very long time, but for a variety of reasons jumped on the dating trail sooner than expected. 

Eventually I met the most loving person (53HLF). Like me, she loves romance, touch, kissing and making love. Like me, she believes in being kind to your partner, of trying to do little things for them in the name of love and romance. And I am just so happy with her.

This morning I woke up early, and was working when she called me back to bed. We held each other and talked for awhile, then I started gently caressing her. She moaned, said that felt so very nice, and for the next 15 minutes I just caressed her until she fell back asleep. 

So much of me feels sad that I didn't meet my SO when I was in my 20s. Such a life of love and tenderness we would have had. But more than that, I'm just so grateful we found each other in our 50s, after we'd given up hope of finding a romantic partner who liked romance as much as each of us did. 

So many romance stories focus on young people falling in love. But what about people like us, who are older, on our second or third go-round, and have given up on finding true romantic love, and then like buying a winning million dollar lottery ticket suddenly the unbelievable happens -- we find someone like us, and fall head-over-heels in love, and discover that feeling is just as magical at age 52 as it is at age 25. Maybe more so, because we've had enough life experience to know there are very few fairy tales out there.

Anyway, I'm feeling so grateful this morning, that I found my romantic SO at age 52. Here is wish you find your match, too (note: not everyone wants the same thing -- e.g. my ex would do well to find someone who wants occasional/rare sex and is intellectual and makes a million dollars a year; that's not a personality flaw, it's just what she wants; her flaw was in how she pushed me and treated me those last years of our marriage).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oqsxwn/so_grateful_i_found_love_at_52/

I'm 41/m, and although I want to get back into the dating scene... that is, find someone willing to put up with me in my current state or vice versa. I am a disable introverted  
psych grad student, and feel that I have spent too much time inside and alone that I am uncertain on how to move forward in looking for someone to put up with me.  I don't know the protocols for re-entering the dating scene after 8 years of marriage... -shrugs- Anyways sorry for taking up time.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oqt23j/new_to_reddit/

I tried online dating, hit it off with the first man I dated in person however he is at a different stage in life. He is about to have an empty nest, meanwhile I am in the throes of parenting an eleven year old. I have very little free time, I have very little control over most of my time because I am essentially forced to yield to the schedule of my ex because he was the breadwinner and my job allows me the flexibility to work when he has our son. I have my son more than 50% of the time as well. It is hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm craving companionship with a man, alone time and just being 'off duty' as a mom. It is so frustrating. I am also struggling with black and white thinking. Part of me just wants to retreat and avoid dating until I am in a position to date without having to squeeze in a date in my very limited free time. I don't want to be filled with resentment but it is seeping up inside me. I do allow my child to be home alone at times, but I don't like to do it for extended periods of time. Also, we aren't in a situation where we have relatives/family who can offer childcare or outings.

58,or6ncf,1627195378,Venting and Need Advice 35F LDR online dating 45M,"I joined this group to get a better understanding of the age group that I am commonly dating lately.

So…. I 35F have been online dating someone (45M) in England since March 2021. I haven’t met them yet, but we have made plans to meet September. I live in the West Coast of the U.S. 

I thought it would be a good idea for me to focus my attention on 1 person 3 weeks after talking with him because…

1. I heard a rumor online that dating culture in the UK has people dating / talking to 1
 person at a time. I was getting a good vibe from him around March and April 2021, and it didn’t feel right to continue online/ in
Person date or talk to other guys when I’m mostly interested in the one (long distance UK guy).

2. I thought online dating someone monogamously would keep me from getting too latched on and prevent from being too codependent

Anyway, it will be 5 months of online dating in a few weeks.

He has been texting me every or every other day and I try to text everyday. The last time we spoke on the phone was about 3 weeks ago. We use something like line/kakao/Skype/WhatsApp. After the first 2 weeks, I tried calling about 1x a week. No
Pick up.

He said he usually looks away from his phone when he is off because it’s connected to work or family group chats thru whatsapp. He said he has also been feeling super tired from work, or work has been extra busy, or he’s over slept for work, also has mentioned health issues. Etc etc. 

I know we haven’t had an official title or anything, it has been a mutual assumption that we are just talking to each other only and no others.

I just feel like people would make time when they really want to.

Once in a while we joke/ talk about what it would be like to be married. 

I’m just needing more. I sent him a message Friday night trying to come off as light but also asked him finally.. why is he talking to me, are we in a relationship and knowing what it is would help make sense for me to catch feelings when we haven’t spoken on the phone for 3 weeks.

I’m just feeling really down and rejected…

Before this I was in a brief relationship that was a train wreck (other person was unstable). And a long relationship before that.

All I want to know is that this current guy I still
Interested. If he isn’t, I’m not sure what to do… I’m turned off by the idea Of starting over superficial small Talk with a slew of new faces on apps. I would rather wait it out painstakingly with this guy who seems like he is slowly ghosting me. 

I don’t know what to do and I just feel like shit. Moments like this also tear up some scars from the long relationship I had (ended over a year ago). 

I think I might also be sexually frustrated. I haven’t had sex since January. 

Words of advice/ encouragement are appreciated.

Tl;dr:
I am 35F (and have a lot going for me, could easily get dates but choose not to) I chose to be faithful and loyal to someone 45M I had never met in person but had made long standing plans to meet in person this Fall.

59,orbfl4,1627219204,SoMe and exes...,"I know there’s a lot of diff. Opinions on this.
The story behind my question at the bottom...
Dating a guy for 6 months. It’s great until he unexpectedly pulls and go silent and needs space. All of a sudden I am having to adjust with no warning from 🌶 to really distant. Not ghosting. He doesn’t give me heads up when he is dealing with his emotions (not about me but life circumstances) leaves me confused. I finally said to him I wanted to know so I knew it had nothing to do with me and then he can take the time he needs. That landed us in an argument and my flight or fight mode kicked in. I got annoyed he got annoyed and this has happened before. We are still trying to get to know each other at this point. I am traveling a lot so time spend is not a lot. He then went on to say he couldn’t sustain this As he couldn’t give me what I need when I won’t give him the space he was asking for. True I didn’t back off cause I wanted him to acknowledge to meet me half way. We had been through it one time before where I clearly stated my needs. 

I felt he broke it off and I said okay - if that’s what you want we shouldn’t waste each other’s time. But told him I was hurt by the decision. Then I deleted him from Instagram (I felt blind sided and did a drastic thing). Then he proceed to keep the convo and ended up saying we could talk about it when his daughter was back home with the mom. That’s before he realized I had removed him. The next day he had deleted me off Facebook which I rarely use. Three days later (no contact) he said it was infantile and extreme how I was acting and that he wasn’t doing this again and said good luck with everything. He had in the past warned me that that behavior for him is a red flag. I did it one time earlier in the beginning after a few dates because he flaked on me and I literally told him to shove it. We got passed it and 95% of the time he has been great and consistent and stepping up in tempo. And then this. 
Question:
Why is someone so triggered by that?? I am baffled. 
Besides the fact it was a little of an overreaction but he knew I was 
Hurt. I replied to that with a little explaining a little note to how he feels he can self protect his way but there’s no space for me to do it and wished him love and light in his life. 

Personally I would understand my reaction when you’re dealing with someone who’s hurt.

43F working on my social skills. My work requires me to be social, and I have no problems there, but in the personal sphere, I get self-conscious and nervous. My new goal is to talk to men in my day-to-day life so I may be friends and friendlier to men in general.

I am a small woman who has been physically attacked and assaulted twice in my life. Most men are larger than me. For much of my life, I looked much younger than my age and lived in areas where there was danger and poverty, so I put on a tough front so as not to be messed with.

About four years ago, I took up a hobby that happens to have a high male participation rate (70 - 80%), and that has helped me tremendously in my comfort with building friendly relationships and conversations with men, but I'd like to meet folks who I can date that might want to date me.

A friend of mine literally ""twinkles"" when we're out. She smiles, makes eye contact, whatever and within minutes anywhere, some guy will appear, chat her up and offer to buy us drinks. I'm always stranger-danger! Having lived in New York city most of my adult life, we don't make eye contact except to stare you down so you will get out of the way.

The other day at a brewery, I stood in line behind a gentleman within 5 yrs. radius of my age. YAY! Practice! I summon all of my courage and shout in an aggressive manner, ""So, what do you think you're getting?"" That New York tone doesn't translate to Texas very well. Anyhow, he answers me and asks me about my ordering and gives me a few suggestions. It's a start, but dear Lord, I do NOT want to shout at people. Also, smiling is not something you do in New York. It freaks people out - everyone thinks you're about to ask them FOR something. Ugh.

82,os40nx,1627321739,"Interesting social experiences over the weekend. Ex's, brides, wins, and new friends lol.","So it was a great weekend...just going to start this out by saying I'm not looking at this in a negative light.  But I did get confirmation on a few things that I've suspected for a long time.  I don't know how to overcome it yet, but I know that it's a deficiency I need to get past.  tl;dr at the bottom...

  
Started my weekend by going back to an event that I hadn't done for a while. I knew my ex would probably be there, and I was right. Was able to have a good conversation with her and it wasn't awkward or weird. That's good progress on my part. I've pushed people out and walled them off in the past, and it was nice to catch up and chat for a few minutes. Not in a 'want you back' way, but just a 'hey, we did share lives together for a while' type thing and catching up like you would with a friend. 

Got invited by a woman from a local group I hang out with to come up and hang out (with a large group-not a religious thing) while they did out of town things. I felt like there was something there, maybe some interest on her part based on prior conversations, so I headed up there for the night.  Once I got there, it was clearly obvious that she wasn't interested in me, and way more interested in the much taller and leaner guy, who has been a casual friend of mine for quite some years now. It was disappointing, but I didn't let it ruin my trip, esp. since there was about 20 other people to hang out with and I came to have a good time.  Ended up at a bar with dancing available and probably 4 bachelorette parties in process at this location.  My companions for the evening were a few guys over 6 feet tall with beards, and if they didn't have beards, they had tat sleeves.  I am deficient in all three categories. Didn't stop me from having fun, until my anxiety kicked in. And it kicked in hard.  I have a tough time being in groups where I feel 'less than' the rest of the group, and the attention that my buddies were getting was well over anything I've ever experienced.  I felt invisible, and it was obvious.    I had to take a minute and process it all, but instead of it grinding me to a stop, I got back into the game. I was still invisible, but I worked through it and still had a good time.  It was a really good experience to have, being able to shake off that heavy shadow of inadequacy and allow the feeling to be there, and then to pass. The meditation techniques definitely were helpful, even in a crazy loud club setting.  

I capped the weekend with catching up the next day with some really good old friends from the area, and it made the whole trip worth the effort. (4 hour return trip)  I really need to work on finding a way to fulfill rule #1 (be attractive) in a sea of people that I feel are more attractive, but getting through that scenario mentally unscathed was a huge win.   


tl:dr - conversing with your ex is ok... no desire to get back or seek out, just if there's a chance meeting,  it's alright to be alright.  And being the 7 in a group of 10's is hard...really hard...but you can get through that and have fun.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/os40nx/interesting_social_experiences_over_the_weekend/
83,os44hr,1627322065,Do you think it takes less time or more time to get to really know someone that you are dating now that you are older? How long before you are ready to even consider marriage?,"I’m watching “My ‘Unorthodox’ Life” which is a reality TV show on Netflix.  A father who looks to be in his late 50’s/early 60’s just introduced his adult children to his girlfriend (50’ish) with whom he’d been dating only 3 months.  Seems this us his first relationship after being divorced approx 6-7 yrs ago.   The couple is  already talking about marriage.  His  adult children are concerned that they are moving too fast, which is understandable.  

One thing that is important to know is that the family, including the new girlfriend, were all raised in the Jewish fundamentalism faith, although the adult children have dropped the various fundamentalist aspects and live in the modern world. The father and his girlfriend still live in Monsey, NY which is known for it Jewish community.  This is important because in their culture, women are often married young to a husband usually chosen by the family although both parties must consent.   The father and the adult kid’ mother only saw each other for about 8 or 9 hours total before getting married!   It obviously ended in divorce, but they had 4 children during their approx 20 years of marriage.  Both were miserable and the mother left not only the marriage, but the more orthodox views.   Think the father is still entrenched but not as much as before.   So basically, 3 months is a long time in that world for the father and his girlfriend to actually date.   The kids worry this is just infatuation not love.   The girlfriend made the statement “The moment I met him, I felt there was something special about him. I feel like I know him really well.  I don’t feel like we needed as much time as we did in our 20’s.” 

It made me think a bit and just curious as to what others think.   While I know myself much better than I did in my 20’s and even 30’s,  I’m still always evolving.  I would be wary of talking marriage to someone after 3 months.    Heck, I’d still be wary after a year of dating because I was love-bombed by a narcissist who changed as soon as a commitment was made.    While I hope to keep my baggage at bay, I realize that as we grow older, we have more baggage, and are set in our ways which often makes compromise a challenge, especially if you’ve been single for awhile after a divorce.    Maybe the older we are the more likely we are to be ourselves when dating verses trying to be what someone wants us to be.  I’m no  longer wearing  my rose colored glasses and I’d like to think I can see people for who they are more quickly.  I’m still married but am planning on leaving once I get things in order so I’m not single yet.  When I’m ready to date again, I’m not going to be looking for the passionate all-consuming love, I want a long lasting friendship and companionship with someone who shares my values.

I’ve had 2 dates and they both looked very much like girlfriends I’ve had in the past. I was on one today and from here photos on OLD she didn’t look at all like an ex but when I met her I thought my god she could be my ex’s double, it was scary. The 2 dates didn’t look similar to each other but a lot like past girlfriends.

88,osc7zk,1627346521,Trust when dating; not comfortable bringing someone home yet even when we have great chemistry and seem comfortable with each other,"I \[41M\] recently met a lady \[38F\] on a dating app, and we had been talking for a couple weeks before meeting in person this past Saturday at a coffee place.  We seem to have great chemistry, and our conversations flow smoothly.  We text well, and our chemistry was great in person too.  She said she wanted to meet up again.  Later she said she even thought of holding my hand on our first date but was worried about it (I had thought about that too).  She also said I made her feel comfortable and she said thanks for that.  I asked if she'd want to meet tomorrow evening, and she said yes.  I had mentioned it would be nice to meet up for dinner, and also mentioned seeing a movie with her at some point would be nice too.  She thought so as well.

She wanted to clear up whether I was thinking of going to her place for a movie.  I said I thought the weekend would be better for a movie (she lives about an hour drive from me), and I also wasn't sure if she'd be comfortable with me going to her place yet.  She said she didn't feel quite comfortable bringing someone to her place yet, and that it's not personal but women need to be safe.  Even though I wasn't sure if she'd be comfortable with that, I still felt a little surprised that she wouldn't feel comfortable yet if I came to her place, since we seem to be getting along great and feel comfortable with each other.  Earlier this year I had met a few women who had me over at their place and seemed comfortable with it (though things didn't work out with them).  Also years ago, when I started dating my ex wife, she had started to come over to my place on our 2nd or 3rd date.

I know everyone is different with their comfort level, and logically I feel like it's totally normal for someone to be nervous about having a new date over so soon, but I'm wondering if I should be worried she doesn't seem comfortable with me yet?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/osc7zk/trust_when_dating_not_comfortable_bringing/

Anyway we’ve had the exclusive talk and we’re in agreement about that but she has said she’s not ready to commit 100% to a relationship just yet.
Not sure what to think about this… we get along so great and really enjoy being around each other. I’m starting to feel like a placeholder but her actions contradict her words. Like I can tell she really likes me..

To sum up, after months of seemingly good rapport on Facebook messenger (but no intervening dates between the first and this one) she just stopped talking, with even a ""thank you for dinner and the movie"" message being left on read. Eventually she said she only sees me as a friend. Could be exactly that, but I sometimes feel like I messed something up, like not making a move. I didn't see much of an opportunity for that, so I didn't push and just enjoyed the proceedings.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/osd80c/what_would_screw_things_up_on_a_dinnermovie_date/

93,osepzx,1627355455,Accepting the future and 💯 okay with it,"Happy Monday. I am 48, almost 49, almost 3 years out of a second marriage. This isn’t not a post of “poor Me” but one of acceptance and peace. I am the product of an emotionally neglected childhood and a lifelong search for love and acceptance. This yielded an amazing track record of shitty relationships be it romantic, friendship or work. After all my years on this planet, and decades of therapy I have come to accept that I am thinking I’m meant to be alone. Don’t get me wrong! I’m successful, curves petite, attractive and have my own friends and life. But I have really struggled meeting men who cannot accept that they are older, don’t “deserve” a model-type woman; can accept being a partner not “leader” and are open to seeking help to grow. I just have no time for these shenanigans anymore. If I can manage weekly therapy, 3 preteens, a crazy busy job &amp; still text back and be available why can’t straight, white men? So, for other folks finding themselves in similar situations; come aboard. I am here for you with nursing advice, travel ready, the girlfriend ready to delve into the deep end with a basket of snacks on my hip. I’m ready femmes.

96,osjm71,1627378580,Feel lonelier than ever after being catfished.,"So I met someone on here, on Reddit a few weeks ago. He seemed so kind and looked attractive from his profile. Long story short, I was really beginning to like this man. We’d talked A LOT and I shared so much about my life with him in our conversations. He too shared about his family and his life. He didn’t live close enough to meet yet in person, but I was really enjoying our online connection. Well last night it all came crashing down around me. 

Things seemed off or not quite right, I had that all too familiar feeling of vague confusion (which is a big indication that you could be getting gas-lit by the person). After suggesting we add each other on Instagram, and a few weird reasons why he didn’t want to. I googled his name and at first I saw nothing, but then I saw a random post someone had made actually here on Reddit warning of a scam going around meant to trick women to invest in a bogus Bitcoin company. The guy I had been talking to had apparently become pretty successful trading crypto currency. The woman in this posting said that she finally found out that she had been scammed by contacting the real man on Instagram. 

So I immediately went to his Instagram and messaged him. I told him how we’d been talking for a few weeks and I just wanted confirmation that he was HIM. Well what followed was like a GUT PUNCH. I got a video back, with the man (who I thought) that I had been talking to, speaking in a thick Russian accent, telling me that no, he was not the man who had been talking to me. That he, Mark Bence Kocsis, is actually a pretty well known crypto currency trader in Russia. That a lot of scammers mainly out of Africa have been stealing his images etc to post on dating sites (and now apparently Reddit) to scam women out of their money. (Thankfully, no, I did not give this person any money). But I felt SICK. 

I am left sitting here one day later, still in shock. I see his picture and I have to remind myself that the friend I thought I had found, is in fact not that man in that picture. That he was a lie. I feel so foolish, humiliated, and honestly just crushed. I keep crying. And I just feel more alone than ever. Women (and men too!) please be CAREFUL. I never thought that I could get tricked like this, but let me tell you, the lie was ELABORATE. His backstory so well thought out and detailed, he sent me video of him apparently jet skiing with his friends etc. Anyway, just feeling incredibly sad.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/osjm71/feel_lonelier_than_ever_after_being_catfished/
