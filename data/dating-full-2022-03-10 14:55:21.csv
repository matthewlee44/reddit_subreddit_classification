Without giving away too much about my job, my organisation has an association with  another organisation which means I have access to their site which includes an office I can use.

There’s a very attractive woman who works as a manager there. We get on very well as she is my point of contact and she has my work number. 
I do subtly flirt with her sometimes, but professionally but this is because she is very supportive of my organisation and her predecessor, a guy, was not and put up barriers, so I do compliment her but I don’t over do it.

She has a big smile when we talk and I really enjoy her company.
Today I had a catch up with her and she also had to pass on a small package, I began to open it and she started to open it too. Our fingers nearly touched.
She smelt really strongly of perfume, like it was freshly applied, a really nice scent, and I can still smell it in the office still now. My hands smell of it too as it’s all over the package.

During our meeting she was leaning forward in her chair and she was really and I mean really twirling her hair and she opened her eyes really widely and smiled a lot. She makes me very at ease and confident and I find her very easy to talk to.

She is always very smartly dressed but her skirt was quite short today but was still very classy (she knew I’d be on site today)
 
I’m 44 she’s about 32 to 34 so younger than me. But I’m rough with receding cropped hair a beard and bags under my eyes. But I find her great to work with and very attractive. 

Is she into me? The twist is she is actually married, I’m separated but it’s complicated (see previous posts) I’m not in the business of home wrecking. Maybe I’m over thinking it and acting like a silly school boy lol!

We did make it to a second date after a month. Since then we haven't made it to a 3rd though he said he wanted to. He eventually ghosted me after 2-3 more months of texting and not being able to meet. 

Another guy before that wanted to ""see each other"" but not ""date"" because he's a single parent who works more than 16 hours a day seasonally as well as being on call 24/7 for his job and volunteer emergency services. Even with his schedule I saw him once a week for more than 6 months. After that I wanted to take it to the next step and we eventually broke up because somehow, in his mind, the next step was moving in together which wasn't what I meant. I meant spending more time together, possibly making time for a day trip or something so we could get to know each other better than once a week coffee dates.

So, if you're always ""too busy"", do you mean it? Are you really that busy or just an excuse? If you're not interested in seeing someone again why say you are and then ghost them after several months of saying you want to see them but never making the time to?

I love him so much and he also loves me deeply but I don’t think our friendship will ever be the same again after I came out. 

I am 27, I am attracted to women and have only ever had sex with them however I found myself falling in love with my male best friend. Weirdly enough, I don’t want to have sex with him.

Now to Ulises, he is 26, and straight. 

I met him 2 years ago, we met through a mutual friend. Over the last few years we have become really close. The last 6 months have been intense, he moved in to stay with me and I feel like we grew a usual 10 year relationship into that short period of time. I have never spoken to someone in my life as much as I have with him. He knows all my deepest darkest secrets. We have been vulnerable with each other, shed tears infront of each other. We feel comfortable telling each other we love each other. 

At some point in our friendship, we hugged every night before we went to bed and we will tell each other how much we loved each other. Every single night!

At this point I was still navigating how I truly feel and enjoyed it, so I asked that we did more stuff like that. He was pretty much against it at first but slowly we started holding hands, we cuddled a couple of times, when he was on shrooms, he kissed me on the cheek and I believe one time I got drunk and I did the same to him. These two months were good and I pretty much felt he loved me as much as I loved him. 


Then last week, he came out and told me he didn’t really enjoy any of the intimate stuff we did. He wanted us just to be “normal best friends” and he wasn’t fully comfortable doing all that stuff. He said at times, around 20-30% of the time, he might have enjoyed it but in truth he only did that stuff to make me happy. He wasn’t fully comfortable. Yes, the hugs, holding hands, cuddling and all that stuff was done to make me happy.

Obviously, these were intimate moments we shared, so to be told that hurt me. Anyway, I decided I needed to go away from him for a bit. I told him I need to work on myself and let the feelings die out. I plan to take a few months (3-6months) away from him. And I said when I come back, we will still be best friends but I wouldn’t really do a lot of 1-1 stuff with him. As in, I would always want one of our mutual friends around cos I fear those feelings will come back if I spend too much 1-1 time with him. 

This is where it gets confusing, he doesn’t want this to happen, he says he loves me deeply, thinks about me everyday, said I changed his life and his life is orders of magnitudes better ever since he met me. He said I’m the best person he has ever met. He said outside of his family, he doesn’t think he has ever loved someone this way. This was a quote from him “I love you, I truly do, just not in the way you want”. Anyway I have understood all of this and I want to spend time away but he said he wants our friendship to remain the exact same way when I come back. I told him I would still love him but not as much so naturally we wouldn’t be as strong as we were.

He is now begging me to stay and has said he will do all the intimate stuff again. That he wants to “try” to become comfortable doing it and that me leaving and not speaking to him regularly for that time will have a toll on him.

Should I take this offer or just leave? Yes I enjoy the physical intimacy stuff but it only means something if it’s actually real not if he’s doing it just to protect our relationship. 

I am confused on what to do and he’s actually confusing me too. I am just getting mixed signals. Any advice would be appreciated.

Now, for context, I'm 5'6/167 cm, and I know that objectively, height is something that many women look for in men. Not all, obviously, but many. Tall men make a lot of women feel feminine, protected, cute, and small. While I'm not exactly insecure, knowing this kind of does make me feel nervous. Especially because I have a height preference myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I prefer tallness over shortness. It's not really a big thing that I'm looking for in a woman; I care more about personality and physical prowess (strength and fighting skill), but the truth is, I find tallness more attractive. I had an ex who was only 5 feet tall, but her being short/petite wasn't a factor in her attractiveness at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm definitely open to dating a short woman, it's just the taller she is, the better. And as petty and goofy as this is, her being at least 5'6--as tall as me--is ideal. To reiterate, I care more about how athletic and/or masculine and tomboyish she is. So while I do want to get stronger and healthier, I don't really care about being a strong, masculine figure.

Here was the details around the last break up;
My last boyfriend essentially ghosted me. About two weeks before he was going to move we got into an argument and I ended things. After sitting with my feelings, I regretted the way I approached him about the issue, reached out and apologized for how I handled things and said I didn’t want us ending on that note. Well we reconciled, he told me how sorry he was and how much he regret throwing what we had “into the shit” and we spent the whole last week together before he moved with each other every nigh. After he left we continued to speak every day, texting constantly and tagging each other in memes. We even Facetimed a few times the first week after he had left. We began making plans for me to visit once he got settled into his new place, and he had said he just needed about a month then I’d be able to come down. We talked about restaurants to try and bars he wanted to introduce me to, even sent me links. Well one night, he responded to a snapstory of mine that featured two wine glasses and made a comment along the lines of “ooo date night” to which I responded later and said I was just at a girl friends house for a bit. After that night, I noticed he began to pull away from me and then very abruptly stopped speaking to me. I called him out on it and he tried to pull the whole “sorry im distant but you know that things are really busy for me right now” to which I didn’t respond (i was going to be gaslit) then he continued basically not speaking to me. I didn’t push, or annoy afterwards and just let it be wondering if maybe we’d at least go back to being friends once he settled. I noticed him still watching all my stories on snap and IG until about a week later when I noticed his profile in my messages went blank. He deleted/blocked me on everything, with no explanation, not a single word and to this day I don’t quite understand what went through his mind and if I meant that little to him. I assumed he stopped talking to me because he started talking to someone new but I never got any sort of answer. 
 
With him having blocked/deleted me on everything, I moved on and it was always out of sight and (most of the time) out of mind. I’ve started seeing someone new, and I’ve enjoyed my time with him. He’s reassured me in ways I didn’t have to ask for and I’m so appreciative of that.

Yesterday I went to pay a friend of mine on venmo for something, when my ex’s name came up because a woman had made a payment to him “for beers” and that insecure feeling crept in. I found myself immediately looking her up and comparing. Since then, I haven’t been able to get it off my mind and I had the strangest dream about him last night. Ever since he basically ghosted I’ve yearned for an answer and find myself wondering what I did to warrant this behavior from him. Seeing that Venmo yesterday just triggered something in me and I feel so down.

We will call him James. I felt an incredibly strong connection with him, and he appeared to feel one for me.

We went on about five dates, which were a lot of fun. They lasted about 6 to 8 hours each. We didn’t have sex, we just spent time together.

He told me on our second date he has to move out of the country for his job, and that he didn’t want to mislead me, as he’s not looking for anything serious. I know his company and where they are opening an office, and I fully believe him.

I just made a joke about me being promised to marry a wealthy king in a few months, and that I couldn’t be in a relationship either. I just enjoyed spending time with him.

He told me that if he were staying here, he’d want to be in a serious relationship with me. And that I was really beautiful and mother material. I told him on the second date I wouldn’t sleep with him because he’s leaving, and he agreed that that was the best idea. This didn’t change the quality of dates or how much time we spent together.

As a note, he has to work all the time. On non-date times, I was there when he was working, and I don’t think he was lying to me about that. He is super busy. (It’s refreshing, as I’m pretty career-driven too, and so it was nice to not be text blasted by him constantly.) 

On Sunday, I invited him to go to this fun event with me and some friends, and he totally ignored me. I haven’t heard from him in days.

This is the first time I have ever been ghosted by someone I’ve gone on more than one date with. I don’t understand why he couldn’t just say no, or at least tell me he doesn’t want to see me anymore.

One of my friends said it could be because he was worried about getting his feelings hurt when he is moving so soon, given the way he seemed to feel about me. But if someone likes you that much, wouldn’t they at least have the decency to tell you? 

I want to ask him why, but I think his lack of response already sends a strong message. Why would he do this? I feel like I must have done or said something wrong.

He already has some tattoos on his arms, but wants to get more obvious ones on his neck and stuff. Honestly, I find this attractive but some people see this as a red flag. 

He's an adrenaline junkie, he enjoys risky situations. He wants to purchase a motorcycle soon.

He's in the military. He chose to be an infantryman because of his adrenaline junkie nature.

Got in trouble in highschool in the past, says he's not like that now but.....this is the one that sticks out to me.

To put it simply, my best friend is straight. I love him so much and he also loves me deeply but I don’t think our friendship will ever be the same again after I came out. 

I am 27, I am attracted to women and have only ever had sex with them however I found myself falling in love with my male best friend. Weirdly enough, I don’t want to have sex with him.

Now to Ulises, he is 26, and straight. 

I met him 2 years ago, we met through a mutual friend. Over the last few years we have become really close. The last 6 months have been intense, he moved in to stay with me and I feel like we grew a usual 10 year relationship into that short period of time. I have never spoken to someone in my life as much as I have with him. He knows all my deepest darkest secrets. We have been vulnerable with each other, shed tears infront of each other. We feel comfortable telling each other we love each other. 

At some point in our friendship, we hugged every night before we went to bed and we will tell each other how much we loved each other. Every single night!

At this point I was still navigating how I truly feel and enjoyed it, so I asked that we did more stuff like that. He was pretty much against it at first but slowly we started holding hands, we cuddled a couple of times, when he was on shrooms, he kissed me on the cheek and I believe one time I got drunk and I did the same to him. These two months were good and I pretty much felt he loved me as much as I loved him. 


Then last week, he came out and told me he didn’t really enjoy any of the intimate stuff we did. He wanted us just to be “normal best friends” and he wasn’t fully comfortable doing all that stuff. He said at times, around 20-30% of the time, he might have enjoyed it but in truth he only did that stuff to make me happy. He wasn’t fully comfortable. Yes, the hugs, holding hands, cuddling and all that stuff was done to make me happy.

Obviously, these were intimate moments we shared, so to be told that hurt me. Anyway, I decided I needed to go away from him for a bit. I told him I need to work on myself and let the feelings die out. I plan to take a few months (3-6months) away from him. And I said when I come back, we will still be best friends but I wouldn’t really do a lot of 1-1 stuff with him. As in, I would always want one of our mutual friends around cos I fear those feelings will come back if I spend too much 1-1 time with him. 

This is where it gets confusing, he doesn’t want this to happen, he says he loves me deeply, thinks about me everyday, said I changed his life and his life is orders of magnitudes better ever since he met me. He said I’m the best person he has ever met. He said outside of his family, he doesn’t think he has ever loved someone this way. This was a quote from him “I love you, I truly do, just not in the way you want”. Anyway I have understood all of this and I want to spend time away but he said he wants our friendship to remain the exact same way when I come back. I told him I would still love him but not as much so naturally we wouldn’t be as strong as we were.

He is now begging me to stay and has said he will do all the intimate stuff again. That he wants to “try” to become comfortable doing it and that me leaving and not speaking to him regularly for that time will have a toll on him.

Should I take this offer or just leave? Yes I enjoy the physical intimacy stuff but it only means something if it’s actually real not if he’s doing it just to protect our relationship. 

I am confused on what to do and he’s actually confusing me too. I am just getting mixed signals. Any advice would be appreciated.

Even writing this out I kind of answered my own question. But the one I gained interest in was talking to me about his interest toward me, and I told him that those jokes make me feel uncomfortable (having been in an abusive relationship before) and it’s not something I would want in a partner. I want someone who doesn’t even think that stuff is funny and treats me the best! He said that he can understand but also doesn’t mean anything by it.

I (23 F) am in college but I have never had a boyfriend before. I have dated in the past but it always turned out to not be a serious thing or just didn’t turn into anything. Many guys just wanted to hook up. I went through some shit during childhood and so I did have low self esteem for a long time and treated myself bad and let those guys I hooked up with treat me bad. It was awful for my mental health. Flash forward, I’ve learned so many lessons throughout dating, cut toxic guys I kept around for validation out of my life, and focused on myself and treating myself better. I did a lot of introspection and life is too short to waste it on things and people that bring you down. I’ve learned to live life in a much more meaningful way and learned a lot from these hard experiences. 
I met this guy (27 M) a year ish ago (during this terrible dating period of mine). But his roommate was this guy I met through summer school a year before. The roommate was into me but he had a girlfriend so nothing ever happened (the max was flirting). I wasn’t into him (but he was attractive) bc he asked for pics while he was drunk and had a gf (didn’t give them to him). We started talking (not a lot and never saw each other) a while after him and his gf broke up but again nothing happened. The thing was that I didn’t know those two were roommates so it became a whole weird thing. Anyways, when I met the (new) guy, I was blown away and there was a lot of chemistry and it was actually an amazing time. (Yeah I caught feelings pretty soon after). But him and his roommate would obviously talk and so it was very on and off because we both didn’t know each others’ motives. But because I was not in a good place at that time and was feeling really bad about myself and was going through some mental health stuff, it was complicated. I kept going back and forth between him (bc he would sometimes stop talking to me) and his roommate (I know it’s fucked up) because I needed the validation. I never hooked up with either of them, nothing happened. I know this is fucked up, I realized that. I cut off the roommate and a whole bunch of other guys months ago. I decided I wanted to change because I wasn’t happy with myself and the way I was treating myself. I told the guy I liked how I truly felt about him and I apologized for everything. This was also during the time i cut those guys out. I didn’t expect anything from anyone anymore. I haven’t dated in a very long time because I’ve been focusing on myself but also because I couldn’t move on from the guy I liked. 
Flash forward to now, the guy I like and I are talking again. I told him I meant what I said (he is a little skeptical which I get) but the chemistry was so good and we are going out this weekend. We talked and realized that time is short and we only live this life once- and we like each other. So why not?
I’ve made so many mistakes in the past and I’m just not sure how to go about this. I’ve never had someone like me back in this way. I don’t know if I should sleep with him or not on the first date. And I’m not sure how to take things slow.

long story short I'm an asshole and I'm narcissistic (prof dx npd) and insecure and childish and naive and grew up sheltered etc. horrible opening I know. My boyfriend \[m18\] and i got into a fight where he found out about all these things ive told to other people (a close mutual friend and my mother) about him that are private. I did this in order to make myself seem the good guy and feel justified in my own selfish insecure feelings of egotistical fear. I havent done these things in a long LONG time, not for months and months when i realized that was surprise a HORRIBLE fucking thing to do. i hate myself every day for it. another thing is i'm draining. severely so. Not as much as i was in the past, i've gotten better, but slow progress feels like no progress right now. I swear to lord above I've gotten so much better at self-love and confidence and kindness for the sake of it and not for selfgain.

The past few months I've been hardcore grinding through life lessons, staying on top of my meds, looking for a therapist, consulting trusted online sources, etc. (also consulting previously mentioned friend, which is another reason i shared the private stuff to gain help working through my problems etc I just needed an outside view to confirm I'm not crazy after all etc.) I've started surrounding myself with good things and good thoughts, practicing breathing technuiqes and just so many coping things. I really feel as though I've improved SO SO SO much.

the fight details: he found out about the horrible things ive done. we're actually going to talk about it tonight as in he is giving me one chance to help him understand my side and prove to him i've changed. he thinks i don't love and respect him but swear to god this man is my everything and you just don't understand how in love with him i am. he practically hates my fucking guts now. he tells me to stop pitying myself too just now.

TLDR; huge fight, i fucking suck, how do i save this and help show him i love and respect him not only as my bf but as a wonderful human being without coming off as insincere (because i am NOT) and without coming off as pathetic? please please help. i love him. he loves me still i think.

However, on our latest outing, she told me that she isn’t ready for a serious relationship or to progress things further. 

To give some backstory, I play drums in a local top 40’s cover band. My band mates are much older than I am (my dad plays lead guitar in the band lol). Our lead singer has a daughter (girl I’ve been seeing) and she’s been coming to see our shows for the past few years. Only other times I’ve seen her is if we all get together for parties or gatherings as a band. 

Apparently she’s told her mom in the past that she had a crush on me, and her mom (our singer) has been bugging me to go out with her. I’m more of a shy person and even though I thought she was very attractive and that I started liking her too, I would always be too scared to ask her out. She’s also quite shy, and so we’d never really talk that much. 

Fast forward to this past Summer, we were playing a show at a bar and she came with some friends to see us play. On one of our breaks between sets, one of her friends (who I later found out was her cousin) waves me over to their table and invites me to sit with them. I mostly talked with her cousin and their friends, but near the end of the night, she finally confesses to me that’s she’s had a huge crush on me for the past couple years and was too nervous to admit. I told her that I basically already knew and told her I like her as well. 

After that, we didn’t have many shows coming up (of course with Covid and all) so we texted a little bit but honestly nothing ever went anywhere. I was still on the fence if I was serious about this just due to the age difference between us and the fact that I’d be dating my singer’s daughter. But just after Christmas and New Years, I really wanted to put more effort in and start dating her for seriously and see where it would go. 

Over the past couple months we’ve been talking lots and have been going on dates. Things have been going very well! This past weekend we both went to a wedding social and had a really fun time. At the end of the night however, she said she had something really important to talk about and didn’t want to wait to tell me. She told me that she’s not ready for a serious relationship and wants to stop seeing me because of her past relationship trauma. She confessed that she was cheated on by her ex boyfriend several years ago and also ended up cheating on him with someone else. She also said that one of her close friends’ boyfriends hooked up with her while they in a committed relationship. She didn’t go into too much detail, and kind you, we were both intoxicated when she was telling me all this. 

For the most part I am a pretty understanding and reasonable person, so I of course wanted to listen and support her. I told her I was glad she was honest and confessed everything to me. At this point obviously I got super choked up and sad because things were progressing really well between us, but I reassured her I understand and will give her time and space for now. 

We’re currently trying to plan a time to talk about this in person while we’re both sober and can explain our feelings to each other, but I’m just so unsure of what to do. I mean she says she doesn’t want to pursue anything further because of what happened to her in the past, which I totally understand. But it’s a little confusing because she was the one that was chasing after me in the beginning. I’m just trying to figure out how to process this and what to do. As much as I don’t want to, should I put the brakes on my feelings for her and just give her time to think about what she wants? Should I keep talking to her casually and just act like friends at this point? I just don’t want to lose her because I’ve started to grow real feelings for her and don’t want to become too distant. Of course if that’s what she really wants then that is what I will do. 

Basically mostly venting here and would appreciate any advice at all. I haven’t posted anything here before so my apologies for a super long and rough post.

Still, I think about him to this day and I haven’t seen him for a year. I have heard he still thinks about me too. I wish I could pick up the phone and call him. We could talk for hours and I miss our conversations so much. But if I called him, it would open a can of worms because he never wanted me to end us seeing each other in the first place.

Is it normal to feel this way? To miss this guy who wanted a relationship with me, but I couldn’t give him what he wanted. I have never felt so loved or cared about by another human being. I miss him. It makes me sad sometimes, even though I know it was for the best. :( I kind of needed to get this off my chest. I think about him so, so often. More than I would like to admit.

(F/30). So I need some advice. I matched with a guy on Bumble about a month ago.

So I asked him point blank if he was still interested in me, etc. which he danced around the question and never really gave me a straight answer.

I dated my last girlfriend for about 2 years, and then after we split I took 2 years off to focus on school and to clean my slate for someone new. The most recent girl I was going out with gave me this new feeling for the first time ever in my life (I've been dating for 12 years) that she would be my wife, and then she surprised me last weekend with a text saying she didn't find us compatible. And I don't even know how. I'm destroyed. I can't focus on work. I feel so deceived both by her and myself. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. This isn't the first time in my current dating era when I felt like things were going well and then suddenly told they aren't (I never had this issue before, usually when things were going downhill it was a mutual feeling).

In this dating era, I dated for 4 months. 17 dates, 9 girls, spent $927.34, 0 sex. I was rejected by all but one. This doesn't include those I was messaging but never met in person.

I just think it's sad that I'm somehow not worth fighting for in the slightest. People on r/dating and r/sex have all these major issues and it's amazing how they're willing to work through them, and in my situation I just say one wrong thing and I don't even get to know what it is, I just get an excuse like ""not compatible"" or ""no spark/click/romantic connection"" and I'm thrown away in the trash and the girl moves on to another guy of many in her DMs. I feel like I was born with great genes and I've always worked very hard in my life to achieve great things. I'm 6'1, care a lot about my appearance (clean), work out almost everyday, I play guitar and sing, have a master's degree, have a solid job with flexibility and plenty of income, live independently, have a great family, I'm passionate, I'm fun while comfortable with being chill, I'm selfless (volunteer occasionally), and more.

My cons? I'm a runner who can run 7-minute mile half marathon splits, so I'm on the skinnier side. My personality isn't extremely masculine as I'm bi (no, that doesn't mean I can't commit). My attachment style is anxious and I admit that I'm a little needy (I want a fiercely passionate relationship, especially in the honeymoon phase), but most of these girls reject me after the first date so I don't think they would even see that side of me. I've been told I'm intense but I don't know what that means. I know I have male RBF but I try to smile constantly to avoid it. I suffer from depression/anxiety but I go to therapy, I take medication, and I feel I generally manage it well.

I identify as being hypersexual but I've been without straight sex for over 2.5 years. It is driving me insane. It seems like I turn every girl off once we meet in person and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. My number is 13, I'm well experienced in that arena. Guys find me attractive and are always forward, so I can't possibly be the ugliest guy in the world. Have I really got uglier physically or personality-wise in the last 4 years? It doesn't seem like it but I don't know for sure.

At this point I've given up. All the apps deleted.

So here's the situation. There's this girl that I REALLY like who I met in university. The thing is, I didn't ask her out at the time because she was seeing someone and at that point we were friends and I didn't want to be an ass by asking her out. 

Anyway so a few years passed and we drifted apart (we weren't on bad terms it's just that she went on to further her education elsewhere). So during the pandemic I was texting her and we were vibing when she did respond.

BUT! 

She has this really bad habit where many times, I would text her and sometimes months would go by with no response until I started a new convo. I attributed this to the fact that she's in a really intense program at her school but at the same time I was scratching my head thinking we have our phones around us all the time how long does it take to acknowledge that you got my text.

So recently, I started flirting with her and she was receptive to it so I asked her out. She said she is not looking for a relationship right now but is down for a date. A day later when I let her know what I had planned, she didn't respond for five days.

So when she said she couldn't make it for the day I had planned and asked to reschedule, I was a tad bit annoyed since I felt that she's doing that bad habit again and in turn, doesn't me. So I told her to just text me when she's free so we could plan the date then 

My question is am I overreacting or being dramatic for no reason or is she really not worth pursuing.

She agreed but let me know she recently moved (an hour away), but would like to go on a date when she visits my city and will let me know. At first I thought I was softly rejected, so I didn't really think about any of this or care.

A couple of weeks pass by, and she sent me a DM and replied to my story. We talked about our music tastes and what we've been up to, and we realized we had a lot in common. She then texts me:
""Would you still want to go on that date sometime ?""

I said of course, and we scheduled the date a week from that conversation. Well a week goes by, I DM her and she tells me that she got her work schedule changed and cannot make it. But then she texts me:
""I’d still love to meet up w you at some point though !""
And so she asked me if I can do next Friday. I agreed.

Well it's Friday tomorrow, so I send her a DM and I can't tell if she cancelled on me or what but this is basically how the convo went.

Her: hey! I've been busy and just stressed over finals

I told him that would be hard for me because I was really attracted to him, and he said he felt the same.

So we agreed we'd reach out if something changed for either of us, and now I am thinking. A fwb situation would absolutely just leave me feeling really negative overall — that sort of thing has never worked out for me in the past.

But could we be actual, platonic friends? Has anyone ever tried to be friends with someone who they have obvious physical chemistry with? I really like him as a person, we got along really well, we have a ton in common, and I just felt really good while we were spending time together.

Me and my boyfriend of over 4 years have just broken up. We met when we were both students in the UK. I am from Latvia and he is from Peru. We clicked immediately. He was the one who approached me and really wanted to make it work. We had an instant connection, had amazing conversations and the best time together. He said he loved me after a couple of weeks. It was by the end of the year so after dating for a couple of months we decided to live together the next academic year. 

When we lived together it was amazing. We had no problems living together and were thriving. We had a few big fights which mostly came from my jealousy about his past. He never gave me reasons to doubt him but it was my first serious relationship so I was feeling jealous. Other than that we connected on everything. Personalities, hobbies, past time, living situation. The year we lived together was his last year at uni in the UK. He applied for a scholarship to continue his studies but didn’t get it. Hence since his visa was ending he was forced to go back to Peru. We decided we would make it work long distance. He never wanted to come back or live there and always imagined himself living in Europe. So we decided to make it work. 

Long distance was tough at first, especially since I was alone in the city we lived together in and had so many memories. But we made it work great. There was a few down points but we never put our relationship and wanting to be together in question. We developed fun activities and rituals that kept us close throughout. Also, whenever I was feeling scared or doubtful he gave me all the reassurance in the world. Long story short there was never any doubt from his side. Throughout the long distance I spent 3 months in Peru (visited him twice) and then he came to Europe in February 2020. We were lucky that he could come just before the pandemic struck. When the pandemic happened it was tough not seeing each other and him being stuck in a low-key toxic family situation. He’s the kind of person who always tries to do things for other people, even if it doesn’t benefit himself. He also dramy with depression and was seeing a therapist. Despite all this we still managed to stay close and be sure of our futures together. 

I decided to do my masters in Spain and he decided to follow when it was possible. Although he had had a few other options in mind, which I was 100% supportive of, they didn’t end up working. So we would both study in Spain. Although in different cities we would be like an hour away. However, cause of the pandemic I never made it there for the first year and had to do it all online. 

By the end of our long distance I can admit I got a bit more reserved. I was still affectionate and I knew I wanted to be together with him but I got scared and tired of the distance (which was over 2 years at this point). However, our love and hopes stayed as strong as ever. 

It was finally time for him to come in October 2021. Until the last minute we didn’t know the exact date cause the restrictions kept changing. That’s why we didn’t find a permanent housing by that point. He rented an Airbnb for a month and we decided I would come after his quarantine and we would look for a place together for the both of us. I believed it would be easier once we were both there. But a couple of days before he came he got reserved. After he was finally here he told me that his feelings changed and maybe we shouldn’t be together. He also told me it wasn’t the best idea for me to come for my birthday as I was supposed to. After talking more he said that he really needs time alone and he wants to live alone and figure out stuff for himself. I was completely blindsided and heartbroken as nothing prepared me for it. When we talked he was always as affectionate, warm and sure of his feelings as ever. We stopped talking for a while but then we decided after all this time we should see each other. And things were honestly back to normal when I was there. He said he felt a bit detached but we managed to bring everything back to normal.

Then I had to come back for Christmas and things got rocky again but we were still making it work. Then I came for about a month in January. Things on that trip were honestly magical. I wasn’t pushing for any answers or declarations but he was saying again he wanted me forever, I was the one for him and that we were renewed in his eyes. Our dynamic was as great as ever. Then I had to go back again and the first week apart was great. Then he became more and more quiet and cold. He said nothing was wrong but when I confronted him he said that he’s not managing well with the long distance anymore. Even though we’re closer than ever physically he can’t take it anymore. He also said that at the same time he feels he wants to live alone, so we shouldn’t be together. 

He had sent me a Valentine’s Day letter in which he said we were meant to be together forever and that he loves me and misses me everyday. When I asked him about that and our time during my Last trip he said he wasn’t lying, it truly felt that way. But now it feels different. He said we should separate and that me trying to convince him otherwise only makes him feel like I don’t listen and ignore what he has to say. 

We agreed to break up a few days ago. Now he is back in Peru to see his family and his flight back in 3 weeks is to my city cause we planned flying quarantine together. 

I want to respect his decision but I also want him back. Honestly he was always more vocal about us being perfect and I know he’s not the type of person to lie or just gaslight me. He did everything to be where I am so I know his words weren’t in vain. We knew we were each other’s lives of our lives. I feel the long distance and him personally being lost in life contributed to this all. I also wish I had been a bit more attentive right before he came. Although I never stopped saying I want him forever and I’m excited to finally be together I was a bit colder on the daily. He put more effort to text me all day despite his busy schedule and trying to figure out all the paperwork. Despite all the mistakes he says none of it is my fault and sometimes feelings just change. He’s not very self-aware emotionally but he knows he doesn’t want the long distance anymore and also wants to live alone and figure things out day by day. 

I know all the things that made us have this passion and compatibility are still there. Honestly, he’s a great guy and has always treated me like a queen. He says he feels I treated him just as well and that I didn’t disregard the relationship. It’s hard for me to believe feelings can just change, especially that when we saw each other the spark and connection was there. I am afraid to lose him forever but I don’t know what to do. I know if I push he’ll just get further away. Especially that he can be quite stubborn. I really want us to rebuild what we lost and I hope there is still a chance.

Maybe I was too needy, maybe i was too available, maybe she has avoidant attachment issues, i'm really not sure.   I thought that I'd give her some space and some time, and try to rekindle things. She wouldn't give me a yes or a no to a date proposition recently. 

It's been 3-4 months since we broke up, and I still think about her every day. I actually feel a great sense of loss, because I thought and felt that she was the one. I didn't play games and was open and transparent with her. I wasn't perfect, but I was myself. 

I'm generally an attractive guy. I'm in good shape, decent looking, great job, i own a nice place, lots of friends and hobbies. Everytime i go out, I find other women are attracted to me.   I've gone on dates with other women, but I feel like it's not same. I have not had sex with anyone since her.

To have my very first kiss with him and finally know what love feels like.

To be able to take him to meet my family and show them what a great guy he is

To have my nieces and nephews excited to see him especially since he would be their uncle technically.
