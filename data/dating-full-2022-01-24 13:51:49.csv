          He offered meeting to study in group of friends. I thought that it was supposed to be a date because our mutual friends have been declining to come. The day before he approached me a bit aggresively and told me compliments about how my glassess match my face and i asked him stupid question if he wants to switch them. So he was dressed up nicely and I also did but I didn't give him a compliment, just flirted. After 30 minutes of spending time together, he suddenly went to the toilet. I waited for him for like ten minutes and almost in the same moment as he came back, our friend attended us. They were behaving very weirdly and they were saying that she was the person who accompanied him at a wedding and that they go on walks each week. I must add that she has friendzoned him before. What the hell. I am almost sure he knew that I liked him, because I was giving him some signals before. At the end he told me that I look nice and I told him the same and he was happy. But I was really angry that he called for friend.
         We have had weird relationship, where I invited him for group things but he wouldnt come. I always attended group things when he was there. He was clearly jealous about me and I was about him, but didnt reply to his advances because he was always talking about  other girls at the same time. Two days after that ""date"", we went to hang out together with our friends and he was talking how he has better relations with his ex best friend and about where he went with other girl and was talking about how men dont receive compliments. After that I was confused, I typed him how it was nice to meet him and he replied the same. Four days after that I met him at school and again he was dressed nicely and looked stressed. I asked him if he still wants me to come to a group meeting two days after that and he told me that yes and why am i asking? I didnt give him a reason and only said that i am happy, but got nervous and went away. Next meeting i told him that he looked good and she was again there. She asked me if i know why she arrived one hour early but didnt explain further. Then I guess he friendzoned me because he didnt do any move and went to talk to another people when we were alone at the end of the table.

Managed to get her hooked and went on a few dates(3 to be precise) and she was texting me ok until I told her in chat that I really like her so she replied that she is confused and doesn't know what she wants(This on the 1st of Jan). Anyway, after that the next week she'd text me good morning and go for long convos all day until her mood changed suddenly. She's been distant and barely asks anything and it's only me initiating convos. For the past 3 weeks we barely talked and on the weekend she's always busy with either her friends or family stuff(basically i'm not on the list of priorities). Yesterday I replied to her story, all went nice, she replied fast, even gave me vocal messages as usual but when I said ""maybe we can find a window to grab something to eat"", she said ""Yes, we need to find a way to see each other even in 2022 but the stars need to align"" and she even told me what she's doing today and why she can't go out. She's quick to view my stories on Ig and quick to reply but I basically feel like she either needs time to get her feeling together or she doesn't want anything to do with me at the moment. Last week I talked with her on whatsapp via vocals a bit, we laughed and said we'll talk later. On Thursday she reacted to a story of mine and then the thing with "" planets need to align this weekend"".

In conclusion, she's pulling away and being distant and I picked that up, didn't panic on chat but off chat (althought I kinda slipped a bit one day but it was cool).I really like her and how it all started but I fear I got in too deep and usually I don't do this...


I need to know if focusing myself and giving the silent treatment works or what the actual heck should I do to get her interest back.

we had a “discussion” last night I am going to visit him (we are long distance) and he said he wouldn’t do anything sexual with me.

Second, I am feeling more and he is not ready/ feel the same way yet. I felt rejected.  
I had my last words and have blocked him. IT HURTS. It hurts so much more than my other breakups as I had such an amazing time with him. I just want that again.

I know this isn’t going to end well, I know I am making the right choice.

We messaged all day and the conversation was very engaged with interest on her end -- admittedly, I saw it as a little suspicous because usually when someone comes on too strong with compliments and interest (in this case, telling me how funny I was, how handsome and fit I was, glad that she matched with me and couldn't believe how I was single,) it ends up becoming a situation where they build up my hope and quickly disappoint. Last Sunday, conversation continued to build, carrying over into an hour long video call. We began texting regularly that day at the early start of the week, but she was in quarantine because her child had COVID, and a few days later, so did she.

Still, she engaged in conversation regularly, and even sent me flirty pictures in the morning of her in a tank top and her underwear, and talking about how she couldn't wait to meet and how we'd probably have a lot of, uh, fun. She was very clear that she while she was not expecting to jump into anything serious, she was not interested in anything that was purely casual and just having sex. She wanted a relationship eventually, because in her words, she catches feels.

She was not feeling well from COVID toward the end of the week, so obviously plans to meet this weekend were not on the table. However, she began to message me less on Friday/Saturday despite me checking in to see how she was. Yesterday, I bumped the conversation because it felt like she was leaving me on read, and she responded but in a very short, impersonal tone: ""Hey, I've been preoccupied. I don't think I'm what you're looking for. Best of luck to you.""

Uhhhhhhh, swerve? She was never really ""preoccupied"" when her own kid was sick, so that seemed a bit like a copout. I replied back trying to make sense of it, saying that just the other day we were planning a date after this weekend and were aligned with what was expected, and then she replied back with the full truth, saying, ""Sorry, I actually just met someone else, and things just progressed differently quickly. It's nothing personal. I didn't ghost you. I followed up.""

I'd probably say if it hadn't been for my two messages on Saturday and Sunday asking how she was, she'd have ghosted me (which was the one thing she requested I not do to do her...), and what more is that all week, she knew it was my birthday. In retrospect, I feel like she lovebombed me all week for her own immediate attention, led me on, and then abruptly ditched me for what seemed like a hookup situation (while she was COVID+ albeit) that contradicted everything else she said she was looking for prior.

It put a damper into my birthday. I'm a combo of not surprised but still disappointed. I also need to do a better job of being able to discern lovebombing and a match that is just naturally going well, and recognizing the red flags, because admittedly, there were things she said about herself (messy childhood, bad post partem depression, still suffering from depression and being medicated, freshly divorced) that probably made her a big flake risk.

We were away for work for 10 weeks and we had become really close friends. We formed a close nit group with three other people in it. We would go out every weekend together (along with other co-workers) and we would always act flirtatious towards each other. One night we were both really drunk and he kissed me. It was a shock and I did not expect it to happen but when it did, I liked it. We snuck off together and he came back to my house. He slept in my bed, we made out a little bit and cuddle each other to sleep. The next morning we had talked about what happened, we both agreed that we did not regret what happened. I asked him if he meant it when he kissed me, he said yes so I asked if he would do it while sober, once again he said yes. And so he did, he kissed me sober. After that we had agreed that we should probably not do this again, that it should be a one time thing. It didn’t affect our friendship at all, we didn’t continue on as if nothing had happened but we were both comfortable with it. The next weekend comes and we go out drinking again. We get drunk and once again, we kiss. I go back to his this time and things get a little more heated, we make out but don’t even get to the point of touching each other. We wake up the next morning and cuddle for a few hours, and make out some more until he drops me home. We agree once again over text that we should stop the kissing. The next weekend comes and the same things happens. It turns into a routine. We get drunk, kiss, I go back to his, we kiss some more, cuddle each other to sleep, wake up and kiss some more, he drops me off and we agree to not do it again. All while this is happening our platonic friendship grows further and further, until we become each others best friends at work. The first person to get to lunch makes sure to save the other person a seat at the table, we message during work and after work, and hangout on the weekends when sober (and we dont kiss, its a platonic relationship until we get drunk).**

Every time I’d go back to his we would go a little further, but never get to the point of oral or penetrative sex. It evolved into us even getting physical the next morning when we were both sober. We would spend hours cuddling and making out until he dropped me home and we would agree not to do it again, until the next weekend came. I eventually started to question what was going on between us and asked questions. He had opened up to me and explain that he was in a 6 year relationship and then a 2 year one that he had recently just gotten out of 6 months earlier. He said it was the first time he had been single and wasn’t looking for a relationship (he had been very honest about not looking for a relationship from the start). But he would also say that he never does stuff like that, that I was the first person he had kissed since his ex, that he doesn’t just casually kiss people, that he doesn’t regret what happened and he is comfortable with it. I started to get confused, confused to whether or not he had feelings for me. I had started to gain feelings for him. On the very last weekend we were away we went further than we ever had before (still not having penetrative or oral sex), it was the morning after and I had slept as his. We were both completely sober and things started to get very heated. We undressed and touched each other and I made him finish. He told me I was the first person to make him finish outside of a relationship, he had had sex with other people but had never finished other than with his two exes. We hung out all that day until his flight that night. We he acted very flirty the whole day, he joked about teaching me to play pool, cuddled up to me in the car while we waited for food, he stuck his hand out for me to hold. But then at lunch said once again he did not want a relationship and asked if I had romantic feelings. I lied and said no, and asked if he did and he also said no. We agreed to just be friends. He sent me a very long message telling me he did not want to not have me in his life, that he felt we shared similar values, that he thought I was a genuinely beautiful person but wanted to just be friends. I agreed.

When we got back to our home town we hung out for the first time completely sober, we went and saw a movie. He picked me up and then dropped me home, no kissing or anything romantic happened other than a friendly hug. We talked all the time over text, he asked me how my Christmas was. One night out of nowhere he messaged me asking if I wanted to go to his friends gig with him. I agreed and went. We both got very drunk and surprise surprise, we kissed. I went back to his and we got back into the old routine. We made out, it got very heated, we cuddled to sleep. This time he too into it and he slaps me without asking. I don’t say anything until he asks if he can slap me and I say no. We continue on without the slapping until we both go to sleep. We did not kiss the next morning while sober. He mentions the slap and that he feels really bad about it and apologises to me. He dropped me off and we messaged making sure we were both comfortable with what happened. The next weekend came and it was my birthday, I went out to get drinks with a few friends and he came along. We get drunk, we do not kiss. I tell him I want to and that we should but he tells me he doesn’t think its a good idea. I beg him to come to another club with me after the one we are at closes and he says maybe. I go with another friend while he eats his food and around 30 minutes later get a text from him saying he had hopped in a taxi and gone home. He said he really wanted to come in and drink more but had to make a tough decision after he had got too drunk last weekend and acted stupid. He tells me to get home safe and that he is worried. The next morning we talk about what happened, I apologise for pressuring him to do something he does not want to do and for making him feel uncomfortable. He brings up the slap and says that it was not cool of him to do it without permission and that he is sorry and hopes we are okay. I tell him we are okay, he tells me we are okay and end of conversation. We haven’t seen each other since and he has started messaging less and less. To the point we didn’t talk for a full week until I texted him, his reply was dry and not like himself.

I’m still confused about the whole situation. At some point within the last few months I’ve caught feelings for him but I don’t think he feels the same. I’ve talked to friends about it, some say he doesn’t like me others say he does but its not a good time for him due to his situation with his ex. My two questions for whoever is reading this is what do you think about the situation? Does he have feelings for me or am I just someone he feels comfortable around therefore someone he can open up to physically. And should I be honest with him and say that I have feelings for him. I do not want to ruin out friendship and he is the single greatest person I know and life would suck without him in it as my best friend.

TLDR; my guy best friend and I make out while we are drunk and the morning after while I am in his bed and we are both sober but then tells me he does not want a relationship, but doesn’t regret what happened and that he doesn’t causally kiss people. We agree when sober we should not kiss again but without fail every time we get drunk together things get heated and I sleep at his. I have caught feelings for him but dont think he feels the same.

So, (M25-30)I've mostly been a lurker on reddit but here we go.

Here's some background, I moved to the Netherlands a few years ago and for many years I've had mental health struggles due to a bad experience that destroyed my social skills so for a few years I've put my dating life on pause since I wanted to properly deal with those issues first(and I'm still doing so with therapy).

A few months after settling here i started with downloading Tinder and with the first match i dated  i immediately got into a short term relationship with someone where I mostly knew it wasn't going to last but I wanted to make some experience and enjoy it while I could. After that I realized i could definitely get matches but the flakiness of Tinder made me move onto Bumble and Hinge where I definitely enjoyed more the chance of getting to know someone a bit better first thanks to the prompts.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I've been on and off on the dating apps for months at a time(so far I might have been active on them for close to 1.5 to 2 years at most) and I've come to realize something. I can definitely get matches and dates but so far I never experienced chemistry or the spark on the 60+ dates I've been to, worse than that getting second dates has proved difficult for me. Now I believe that I will just never experience the spark and that might reflect also on my dates since for me these kind of feelings only happen when I'm bonding with someone(still I can find women attractive and good looking to have short flings with but I never get that feeling of instant attraction that makes people go for it and just click, usually it's build up over time maybe due to my cautiousness)

Parallel to this I developed hobbies and interests, I have a promising career, I do sports quite regularly so I'm kind of fit, am definitely a sociable person, generally i can get a laugh or two out of people, I try to be helpful and respectful and i constantly try to work on myself to be understanding, friendly and  learn from my experiences to grow as a person. (I know it sounds like I'm bragging and I'm the best guy ever but these are mostly things that I've been described as that barely counterbalance the negative thoughts I've had about myself for the past years)

So on paper i should be someone that shouldn't have all this trouble finding someone to be with or being someone other people would want to be around but for some reasons people just keep to drift away from me or just tell me that even though I'm handsome/fun/gezellig/smart/nice they didn't feel a spark or they just can't see me under a romantic light. Recently I've even caught myself resenting being described with those qualities because I feel like they're just a way of sugarcoating the rejection but friends and some old dates told me that that isn't true and many times when talking about my dating life people have been surprised that I can't seem to find someone to like me,

One thing I should mention is that I struggle to keep friends(the pandemic has been very hard in that sense and I generally go for quality over quantity) and the place where I live is renowned to be a difficult city for more introvert expats like me.

At this point I'm mostly resigned to be alone because probably my past experience just ruined me and I'm incapable of being someone people want to be with and I feel like at this point is too late to learn it anyway.  Dating this much kinda makes me doubt my self worth which reflects on my confidence since things I should be confident in hardly get an external validation when it comes to it.

My gf is super high maintenance despite being from a poor background. She always expects lavish dates and does not just want to casually meet up for fast food. Everything has to be fancy / high tier. Expects me to buy her fancy jewelry and designer brands and subtly hints at gifts she wants. She also always expects me to pay for everything in terms of dates claiming that she’s “traditional” and believes that the man should pay. She doesn’t come from wealth, she’s a student whereas I’m fairly well off with a high paying job, so I feel bad if she pays anyways. Despite being well off I’m pretty frugal and low maintenance, much rather save money. 

However she is very caring and tolerant with my busy work schedule. She also puts a lot of effort into the relationship, we live an hour away from each other and makes an effort to see me. I am just turned off by discussing money aspect of things or if she suggests buying her something. I just feel as though our financial goals don’t align.

The next time I saw her she said we should wait a month before discussing any more dating. We should just get to know each other at work. 

Currently there's just enough employees to keep the doors open, and if I quit she would struggle finding anyone new. So does she want to wait because that's legit the smart and mature thing to do?

I (32F) match this guy (30M) on Bumble, we talk and joke for a while. He asked me straight to meet on the weekend and I accept.
We meet, he’s absolutely handsome and fun and he looked attracted by me as well. We talk a lot, joke, flirt a little bit. He tells me he’s serious and not the kind of guy who goes “from one flower to another one”. At some point the tension is unbearable: we can’t help looking at each other and smile, it all looks very genuine and nothing like that ever happened in my life.
He tells me he wants to kiss me but he prefers to wait to get to know me and I agree. After a while we kiss. One of the best kisses of my life, really. He tells me he finds me amazing and he’s absolutely attracted. We can’t stop kissing, hugging a smiling at each other straight in the pub, like two teens.
Our kisses are not even sexual, just very sweet.
Another couple on a date notices us and talks us to ask about our date, as we looks totally cute and in tune.
And that’s another thing never happened to me.

We decided to go to my place. I had sex at first date other times and I didn’t even decided to invite him over for sex, I just wanted to kiss him in a more private place.
Of course we have sex, that was pretty good. He tells me more than once how satisfied he is. 
The cuddles after are absolutely magic, he keeps telling me how fantastic this is for him.

He doesn’t sleep at mine as he has to wake up early the day after. He tells me that next time we’ll go out for dinner or to a small cliff walk.

I ask him to text me once he gets home and he doesn’t. He texts me the day after but he’s so cold, I didn’t even get why he texted me if he didn’t want to talk.
The texting was literally 3 sentences. And now he’s disappeared.

I am so sad and pissed and I can’t get why a gorgeous and smart guy has to do all this just for sex. I am not even the kind girl you need to lie to in order to fuck her.

We've been friends for a quite a number of years. For the the majority of our friendship she was in a long-term relationship and I respected this. At the time things were platonic between us and no boundaries were ever stepped over. After some time she eventually broke up with him. We started seeing each other more often from then on.

She's been in a relationship for the 2 years I've known her, so naturally I didn't give much thought to getting to know her better or trying to make a move. 

Somewhere during last week we had an office party, and we were just joking around like usual. Later that night I found out that she broke up with the partner the week before, and it sort of felt like we were hitting it off after that (We did have a lot to drink too). 

We were walking back from the bar a few feet behind the rest of the group, she held my arm, and we had some deep conversations. 

Since then I've started liking her way more, and I can't really stop thinking about her.

So the thing is, I don't really believe in jumping into a relationship this quickly after being in a long term relationship, but it's really driving me crazy at this point.

Hi  guys, I know my question sounds stupid, but do you have any idea for a  topic to start a conversation with a girl? Let me explain: this year  there is a girl in my class who interests me (I'm 16), she seems quite  nice and easy to approach, but we hardly ever spoke to each other. I  thought about talking to her at school, but the opportunity hasn't come  up yet (either she's with friends or I'm with my friends), so I thought  it was it a good idea to send her a message on Instagram? I'm not really  used to talk to girls and I'm quite shy, so do you have any ideas of  messages to send her to start a discussion, or any tips to start a  conversation irl if I have the opportunity?

1. She would say my name frequently while talking with me or others.
2. She asked me how come she didn't have my Instagram and followed me.
3. She straight up told me that she noticed me looking at her a lot (true, and I didn't know what to say, my friend told her: but you are doing the same!)

Since then I've been commenting on almost all her Instagram stories, she usually likes the comment or responds with something that I can't really use to keep the conversation going.

Although I have a lot of dating experience and have faced rejection/heartbreak many times, this is my first serious (and healthy) relationship. 
He, on the other hand, has a lot of relationship experience, and has had a few long term partners.  

The development of our relationship has been wonderful. We are both a bit guarded, and it’s taken us both time to warm up and open up to each other. In fact, we still have a long way to go in that area. 

That being said, I knew I loved him about two months in. I decided to hold off on saying it cause I knew it was a bit early for us. Lately though, I’ve been really feeling it, and so I decided to bite the bullet and tell him last night. 

(Keep in mind I’ve never told anyone this before, not in the romantic sense). 

He responded with, “I really, really like you, but I’m just not there yet. It takes me awhile to get there with someone”. I responded with, “that’s okay, I’ve just been feeling it so I felt the need to share it”. And that was basically the end of the convo. 

I guess I’m just feeling a bit hurt. I feel very loved by him, so I was caught off guard when he didn’t reciprocate - I honestly thought he would. He’s not an expressive communicator though, and very much shows his affection through actions and quality time. 

I know it’s common that one partner gets there before the other. I’m just wondering if you have any experience with this and if you can give me some words of wisdom/encouragement. I’m just feeling very vulnerable at the moment and don’t really know how to move forward without feeling down about it.

The United States and Japan are both labeled as some of the most lonely countries in the world. For a while now, I've been trying to figure out why is this the case. Why isn't working enough? Why is finding social activities that benefit our interests so hard? Why are we scared of talking to someone we don't know very well while in high school we could've known over 50 people and not scared to talk to any of them? I believe the solution to this situation can be found within the public school system. 

School is a lot like work in a way. Kids are expected to go from one class to the next to learn things that should be beneficial to their lives...But there's just one thing sticking out. Children are given double the opportunities to socialize than adults in the workplace. Due to the many clubs, they could join down to the most important thing in my opinion...The lunch break.

Working is like school with the expectation to be in class and follow rules all day. Sometimes without a break. This causes people to become distant from others because imagine how hard it was trying to socialize with your fellow students while class started. That is working for more than 8 hours a day. 

Now how do we fix this? We must understand that this situation cannot be systemically fixed through people's advice online on ""how to be confident enough to make friends with your coworkers."" It sure wasn't like that in high school. And you know it. It was a lot easier to talk to someone because what else were you going to do when you weren't pressured into listening to what a teacher said or doing a pop quiz. At work, they expect you to do outside of what you're supposed to do just to keep you from ""wasting your boss' clock."" That's why your relationships with your coworkers are so much more divided than it was with your classmates. And to fix this, it won't take the kindness of your manager or the hope that the CEO of the company you're working for will give in to the loneliness epidemic in your country...But a simple law was passed by the government to make things better.

It starts with something simple. I dub it, the ""lunch break act."" This act will require companies making a certain amount of money to shut down for a certain time for their workers to eat in peace without their breaks being cut short because they're needed in a certain area. Food would be provided for free or very inexpensive. Now you may be asking, what is the point of this? When you were on break at school you were kind of forced to talk to people to break whatever awkward silence there was when eating. This caused people to find their social groups where they fit in and grow closer with their classmates. And the same effect should happen in the workplace. I believe work tricks people into thinking that they don't want friends by making it so hard to make friends. But when allowed to do so, I believe these ""work-focused"" types will break down and socialize in the same way as the ""academically focused student"" does.

This act is only an idea for now but I believe this would be a strong way of fighting back the loneliness problem we currently have in the world.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154587,public,self,"Fixing loneliness through the implantation of a ""lunch break act""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbt5ra/fixing_loneliness_through_the_implantation_of_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

However, there is one aspect about her that I'm having a very hard time reconciling with. In fact, it's honestly getting to be a dealbreaker for me.

I am very safe and aware driver. I used to ride motorcycles and I'm aware of how incredibly dangerous distracted driving can be. I drive defensively and have a very strict policy of never doing anything involving my phone when I'm in a car, unless I'm using the handsfree device and it's an important call. The girl I'm seeing does not have a handsfree device in her car. Worse still, I started noticing that she was sending me Snapchats while driving. I was quite alarmed by this and told her that she needs to stop before she gets in an accident. Her response was, ""don't worry, I'm very careful and don't look at the screen while texting."" I waited an hour before I was sure she was off the road, and then messaged her again saying that it only takes a half second of reading something to become distracted and get into an accident. I further elaborated that when I was 12 years old, I lost one of my very good friends in middle school to a driver who was texting. She did not seem to care and just repeated that she is careful about her texting. 

Frankly, I'm extremely alarmed by this kind of recklessness. She could be doing even more than texting and could be scrolling Facebook or Instagram for all I know. I've tried to tell her that she can call me and talk on speaker in lieu of snapchatting me, but she didn't seem to listen. I'm very, very frustrated by this behavior, and even though I love everything else about her, this might be a dealbreaker for me. 

I want to give this relationship a chance, but I'm not sure how to approach the subject with her anymore.

Maybe abit of a background on me, I'm a 28 year guy who has been single for going on 5 years now.  


Started a new job nearly a year and a half and met a woman there whom I fell hard for and we got close.   
We had feelings for each other but couldn't be together, it was hard but managed to move on. We decided, or rather, she decided we should just be friends.  


Crushed, took me awhile but decided to work up the courage to create a tinder / bumble account.  
I eventually found someone, it was around the start of November.  


My general rule is 2 weeks of texting before I ask the match out on a date.  
Date 1 went really well, so well that we planned to see each other in another 2 weeks.  
This became a pattern, Good morning messages, 12minute long voice notes - basically texting every day since then.  


So fast forward to today, My best friend's wedding is this weekend.  
So i thought , maybe it would be nice to actually show up with a date, not the only one alone.  


She thanked me for the invite and has really enjoyed our friendship but that's as far as she wants it to go.  


Gods, i feel so crushed again.  
Really thought it was going to be different this time. Sitting here tossing the idea around of going back to online dating, I really feel like it isn't for me.  


I'm sorry for ranting - I realize you all have your own problems. I just... really don't know what i'm doing wrong and it hurts.

For back story, I'm a down to earth guy who has great relationships with his friends and family. I'm a business owner and highly ""left-brained"" as in majority of my thought process is logic / rational.

I try to be open-minded and do believe in the saying ""to each their own"", however when it comes to my dating life, I am significantly irrational. Since my first ""serious"" relationship at the age of 17, I have had some weird obsessive thought pattern that focuses on my partner's ""past"". 

When I say I obsess over it, it is nothing short of that. I will think of it nearly 24/7... Nearly every waking hour. To the point that I ultimately get so down and depressed about it that I pull out emotionally and end the relationship. 

The types of thoughts consist of essentially playing a real-life porno through my head of my partner and her past partners. I do not ever have this feeling toward long term relationships they've had (which is strange considering those were the ones they formed the strongest bonds). 

This has happened in every relationship of mine for the past 13 years and I have tried SO hard to overcome it. I have attended therapy, counseling, spent $300 per session on A.R.T. (Accelerated Resolution Therapy), completed online courses, personal development, etc... It does not get better in the slightest. I don't ever deal with current-day jealousy, it's always past related. Like ""she did this act? Gross I can't be with her"". I know how immature it sounds but I'm at the point that I do not know what else to do. 

Over the last year of attending therapy, the therapist said he believes that I have a form of OCD and that it grabs onto this type of thing. I can't explain how frustrating it is. No matter what I do... the thoughts are just there all day every day. I have considered medication but have read horror stories about long-term side effects. I've also tried using logic that ""you're 30 years old and everyone has a past, (including yourself)"" but the shock factor doesn't change.

I’m writing this when I’m honestly utterly mortified and just looking for a possible explanation. I (33F) am relatively new to the online dating community- despite my age- so totally lacking experience in how to manage this, I was basically just rolling with it. Long story short I matched with this guy and we have been chatting everyday and already saw eachother twice (briefly- just coffee). We were planning to meet for a decent sit down and meal tonight. He lives in a different city (90 min drive) and I was off and he was working so it made sense I’d drive down to where he is. We didn’t agree on a meeting point so he called me on the way to clarify and I was literally 3 mins away and he was 5 mins (according to him). Arrived and waited for a couple of mins for him to text this “I can’t do this I’m sorry”. And he blocked me . The end . 
I don’t get it. Is this sort of a high school boys type of bet ? May be he didn’t like me after seeing me twice ? He didn’t want to pay for dinner ? He paid once for coffee and I paid once so i don’t think I gave the impression that I want someone to pay for my dinner . I honestly don’t get it! Any online dating veterans can shed a light ?

I spent my whole life on a small town. On September 2021, I moved to a really big city for college, and after my 18th birthday, my friends thought it would be a good time for me to explore the dating world. 

I kinda reached a point where I was interested in it because I'm not in a small town anymore and I need to put myself out there. 

 So I started focusing on that, and with the help of a friend who knows a lot of people in my university, I got the numbers of 2 guys who I had a crush on. Both of them were really interested in it when my friend asked their number, but as soon as I sent them a message, both ignored me, one of them even blocked me.

I got kinda sad and 2 other friends told me to install Tinder, and I did. After a few weeks I talked with them cause I had like 3 matches and 10 likes on my profile, and they were both surprised and told me to put a lot of pics in my profile to get more likes and all that. I did it and yet nothing changed.

 I got like only 1 match in 2 weeks and a few likes. 
Again, I talked with them and some other people I know with tinder, cause all my matches didn't answer and apparently everyone has 99+ likes and A LOT of matches while I barely get them.

Some days ago I matched with a guy who actually texted me after we matched, and we talked for a bit, then he suddenly started saying that it would be a loss of both our times to keep talking cause he thought I wasn't interesting. 

After that situation I just got sad and decided to uninstall tinder and stop this search for potential dates. Then suddenly all my friends started dating and I'm the only single one in my group.

The thing is, all of them keep saying that the other guys don't deserve me and whatever, and I know they would never be too honest with me about that to not make me sad, but I kinda feel like I'm just not attractive and that's why I keep getting ignored.

I really don't know what to do about this :/

She wrote in her profile that she valued honesty and communication and so do I. We exchanged a few messages and set up a coffee date the next day. She was prompt with exchanging messages and seemed genuine at first. Fast forward the next day we have coffee for an hour or so and really meshed. She seemed to have everything in order and a good head on her shoulders. I suggested that we grab some food and eat it together with a movie at my place. We proceeded to eat, watch a show, then one thing led to another and we made out and had sex. 

Overall we spent about 6 hours together that night and I texted her good night when she made it home safely. I valued the physical intimacy and personal connection we made that day and it seemed like we could only grow from that night. The next day she continued to show interest and shared the same view on how the previous night was (we both stated how we had a wonderful time). Then she ghosted me out of the blue for no reason. I have been ghosted before but never after a one night stand especially when we both shared similar values and intent so I was left bamboozled.

She told me how she disliked poor communication and dishonesty yet I find it so obvious how much of a hypocrite this woman was. I was genuinely interested in seeing her again and judging by the fact that we both pay for Match it's even more outrageous to see how someone would still only seek a one night stand and proceed to ghost someone. Here I am thinking Match is about people seeking serious relationships. I understand if it was Tinder of all places but Match, that is where the disconnect is and why modern dating is truly broken. 

I can't even blame it on the sex because objectively speaking I last a lot longer in bed than the average statistic. So I guess it's just the way I smell? Haha sorry TMI.

I just went through a divorce and have my finalization up soon. My best guy friend has been my biggest supporter through it all. Always looking out for me. Calling me everyday several times a day. Helping me however he can. Taking me out weekly for lunch or breakfast and treating me to gifts when he has the money. I am grateful for him but I wonder why he is so worried about looking out for me. He always tells me he wants to know I’m not alone and he always makes sure he considers my feelings and emotions everyday. If he has a day where he doesn’t talk much as normal he always reassured me that it’s not that he doesn’t want to talk he just isn’t chatty. He always wishes me good morning and good night and has me check in at the end of the night once I feel get home. It’s nice to have someone looking out for me but I can’t help but wonder why he worries for me so. Any thoughts?

However, I'm not sure if that's just me being unreasonable or not, so I need some unbiased opinions. I'm going to list (in no specific order) some of the stuff that has been bothering me about the relationship, since I'm not really good with paragraphs:

1. **Very high maintenance.**   
Very dependent and jealous, to sum it up. Refuses to sit anywhere but by my side (won't even sit across the table) anywhere, family events, date night, etc. Will argue with me because she thinks I look at other girls; has gotten upset because I was looking at the dancers in a concert, as well as once going onstage (I'm a DJ) and arguing with me because ""I was flirting with a girl"" (later that night, the girl and her bf hired me).
2. **Stubborn and self centered.**   
It has gotten to the point I got a ticket because she threw tantrums and refused to wear a helmet on my motorcycle; she even got mad when I got upset with her, replaying that, as payback, I wouldn't need to give her a gift (I had promised a few days earlier that she could pick something as a treat). I've fully paid a NYE trip for the both of us, during which she acted like her being there was a favor and that I should be thankful it. She didn't help with a single chore during the trip (I don't mean money, although she could offer a lunch or something for once) and I even had to carry her bags around the airport. Also, did not thank me for the trip.
3. **Treats me like she's my boss.**   
Bosses me around and cries/gets moody around my friends/becomes cold when I refuse. When she sleeps over, wakes me up 2 hours before MY work so I can drive her across town to hers, will play the ""you're my boyfriend and makes more money then me so cut me some slack because ubering everyday is too much"" and cry whenever I refuse. Also does this for me to drive her around and even got to the point of comparing my actions to her dad's, with whom she has a terrible relationship.
4. **A) Acesses my phone without my consent.**   
I've caught her doing this twice, it has surely happen more than that. Since I have nothing to hide, she'll check my Recently Liked on Instagram and get pissed whenever I liked other girls pictures, even if they're my friends. I get pissed at this because it strikes like she is digging to find a reason to start something.  
**B)** Continuing A, she might even have cloned/installed spyware ob my phone, since a lot of her behaviors changed overnight, without me addressing them, after I discussed them with my therapist via Whatsapp.
5. **I feel like she is too attracted to money.**   
I do think she likes me, but I feel like money plays too much of a part in this relationship since I make way more than she does. She is planning a 3-month trip later this year and wants me to drop everything and tag along; however, she has no means to do so since she has barely saved enough for a two way ticket, which makes me think she wants me there partly to financially support her when she inevitably runs out of money.
6. **Emotionally manipulates me.**   
As mentioned, she will cry, victimize herself, anything, whenever we get into fights or things don't go her way so she gets the ""upper hand"". She'll almost always use money and/or her upbringing/relationship with parents as excuses for her behavior.
7. **I don't feel like getting intimate anymore.**   
The ""hormones"" are still there, but whenever we get intimate, it's her starting it. We've recently had a 12 day vacation overseas (the one I mentioned on item 2) and had sex only 3 times. She has also forced sex with me once when I was drunk and was explicitly denying it because I was feeling sick after drinking a bit.
8. **I feel more anxious.**   
I was diagnosed a few years ago with anxiety and depression, I've made some progress the last couple of years and finally got off the drugs last year. Now, however, I'm always anxious about going out (may that be for DJing or anything else), about my work and even about bringing her along for family and friends events. I get anxious from looking at the crowd from the stage since I fear her going nuts in the middle of my performance.
9. **I am afraid to break up.**   
Is All of her actions have pushed me away from a lot of my friends and family, which makes me afraid of breaking up and being alone. I also pity (not sure if this is the right word fot it) her a little since I provided her with some nice trips and gifts which, in my country, is very unlikely for her to find with anyone else or even afford herself. So I feel a bit responsible for her because I showed her to a lifestyle that I can take away at any point. Not sure if this makes sense, but it's what's mostly of me breaking up.

Also, not a native English speaker, so sorry for any mistakes or things left unclear.

We instantly clicked and our first date was easily the best first date I’ve been on. It seemed like we both felt the connection and continued to see each other once every weekend. We couldn’t meet more often due to work/ school commitments during the week but when we did, we would spend most of the day together. Ha was always extremely affectionate (holding my hand all the time, kissing me, embracing me). 

We had both discussed wanting a long term relationship so I felt like we were on the same page. I had also told him that I had never had sex before and I would want to wait until entering a relationship because I need an emotional connection/ not wanting to get hurt. As time progressed, I felt ready to have sex with him despite not being exclusive since I felt that emotional connection. After sleeping with him on two separate dates, he had to leave town for about a month. When he came back, he came over to my place for another date and everything seemed fine. He was still really affectionate as usual and we had sex again. We left the date on a really good note but a few days later, we’re having a normal conversation on the phone and out of nowhere, he tells me that he doesn’t want to date me anymore. I felt completely blindsided because his words and actions in person said differently even just a few days before. 

I met up with him to discuss our situation further and he said that he was interested and attracted to me, but felt as if he should have experienced the “falling in love” feeling at the point we were at (2.5 months). I also knew that he was in a long term relationship before meeting me, but I had no idea that it had ended only a few months before he met me. He brought up his ex many times in our convo and how devastated he was when it ended. A part of me feels like he’s comparing me to his relationship with his ex. I’m not proud of this but I tried reasoning with him to stay and give it another chance. He said that he can’t give me the emotional commitment I need and doesn’t want to hurt me any further. 

I feel so distraught because I really like spending time with him and I have an emotional attachment with him because he’s my first sexual experience. I don’t know how to get over him and it feels like I’m experiencing a breakup without even having officially dated him. It also hurts to go from being so affectionate one day to not having that anymore. I miss him and it’s taking everything in me to not reach out to him. He said that he would still be open to hanging out with me soon  (but wait at least two weeks to have some space). I don’t know if I’d be okay with just being friends, but I don’t want to lose him from my life either. A part of me is also holding onto hope that he’ll change his mind and come back.

Only thing is she is going to be moving away in a few months, which sucks but I have accepted it and come to terms with it and will just enjoy the rest of our time together. 

However, since she treats me so well and is so nice to be around that I think it’ll ruin my standards for dating girls in the future.

First off, I’m pretty masculine and she is very feminine and I think that’s part of why we get along so well. She always lets me make decisions, helps clean and fold clothes for me, and overall just enjoys helping me with little things and making my life easier without asking for anything in return. She says she is happy to do this since I am so good to her (her words). She always praises me and even calls me a superstar since I had some success in my career.

And no she is not a doormat/docile, she’s 
just very easy-going and non-argumentative. She isn’t a “pick me” girl or conservative Christian, she’s a liberal ethnic minority about to start her first year residency. 

However, in my experience girls like this are very rare. A lot of the girls i meet act really masculine and can’t let a man be masculine (even if that’s what they claim to want). I am all for progressivism but I do not get along well with these types of girls. I can be progressive while still being attracted to feminine women.

I just feel like there is absolutely no point in me trying to date right now, and it comes down to the fact that dating is just to competitive. Why would I do this (advertising myself) if I want to find someone to love and have a deep emotional connection with, because frankly I would just be advertising my attributes (like social status) and ""wealth"" that I simply do not have. A 19 year old female by comparison has all the opportunities in the world for dating, every single guy from ages 18 to hell probably even 40 or 50 wants to date a 19yo. An attractive 19yo could date me a 19M who has never dated, never worked a day in his life, is very lazy, not very inspired to go out and meet people or make money, poor social skills and basically no friends, or they could date a 30 year old who has way better social skills, a job with a lot of growth in the future, has their own housing, probably has more than zero sexual experience, basically anything a woman would want. Like I don't have the same opportunity to similarly go out and try to date a 30yo woman because they are probably getting around the age where they want to start considering having kids and settling down. 

I just feel like this is a compounding thing in my opportunities to date, because it's not like I'm ugly or fat or something like that. I'm quite athletic and have a lean body, but I know that is not what women care about. I understand that I'm supposed to date to improve my skills at doing just that but man I don't even want to date people per-say I have just always wanted a close emotional bond with someone I could be open with. I haven't pursued dating anyone in the past due to a lack of interest of dealing with all of the baggage that would come with it. I often feel like I am meant to be alone, because really I have been alone for what feels like as long as I can remember. I love the idea of being intimate and vulnerable with someone who is very close to me and I feel like I can trust.. I just for one refuse to put myself in a situation where I can be taken advantage of (coming from past experiences) and it just seems like a situation where that isn't the case is so rare. Point being, I don't really have that much of a desire to put myself out there because doing that and advertising myself goes against my idealism of wanting someone who would be a long term partner for me. Which is what I would be interested in, if I was so interested in having sex or honeymoon phase duration relationships I would have probably been pursuing people. But I don't pursue woman and I think part of that is that I am not trying to perpetuate this stupid myth that all guys want sex with anyone all the time. (And yet somehow that seems to hold up for most guys who aren't me.. shrug) I think I may have just dismissed dating altogether at this point, but if something had ever come naturally to me I probably would've considered going with it. But it never has and I think being demisexual has something to do with it, but also being a dude, you don't have people showing interest in you pretty much ever. 

I guess that ultimately leads back to the title, should I even bother dating? I don't think I have the attributes that would be considered attractive in a guy, so I really don't bother with trying to pursue people. With the addition that I don't really want to use dating apps or websites to meet people and I'm not that interested in putting myself out there, I just wonder about the risk/reward assessment of dating. I really have nothing to offer and I'm not going to hide that from people. I'm just a dude who  started his second semester studying computer science at a local college and has zero dating experience.

I was talking to someone else, who we will call B, who I got along with incredibly well however something long term would not be realistic as he is temporarily living in the United States for another 5-6 months. 

B had let me know in the beginning that he was here temporarily. I was okay with that because at the time, I wasn't dead set on finding something long term. The fact that he was here temporarily made it seem like it could work out for something casual &amp; fun. We hung out a couple times (bookstore, dinner, hiking, listening to music, no hook up) &amp; a couple virtual dates. I enjoy him as a person, we get along well, &amp; under different circumstances, maybe something could have worked out long term. 

Anyways, I met A. I'm willing to have a serious relationship with him. With that said, it no longer feels right to keep seeing &amp; talking to B. B was trying to arrange another date for us &amp; I responded to that by letting him know I'd like to be honest &amp; inform him that I found something I'm going to start investing in, that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to keep in touch anymore. 

B asked if he could call me. I agreed. Long story short, he admitted that his feelings for me have grown, that he wasn't sure if he was just ""too slow"" on making a move &amp; making me think that he only wanted friendship, that he indeed wants to try a relationship with me. I admitted that it was a hard conversation to have with him because I genuinely enjoyed getting to know him/spend time with him but the circumstances are not realistic for something long term, that if it was hard for me to call things off now, I could not imagine how devastating it would be for us when it's time for him to leave the country. He thanked me for being honest, stated that being friends would be difficult, &amp; we agreed to part ways. 

I was a little bummed &amp; called a girlfriend to vent for a bit. She said that she was very impressed for being honest &amp; that it was a brave thing to do. I told another girlfriend about the conversation &amp; she also praised it, said it was very mature. 

This got me thinking...what is the alternative to this? Ghosting? No way. It's kind of sad that some people would resort to behavior like that.

I'll just share my experiance.

About a month ago I've met a girl through tinder. First date bowling, we clicked, kissed. Drove her back home, kissed her in the car, she went home.

From this time we're msging back and forth all the time flirting, sexting etc.

New years - our second meeting. I got her to my place. I give her three orgasms with my fingers. She's in awe. She gives me a bj. We do not have sex cause she stops my advances for like 5 hours of foreplay fun.

She later said that I was the first man to bring her this much sexual pleasure, was able to dominate her etc. Basically my stock is running very high.

We continue dating. We have sex, its hot af, she is in total awe. I give her great orgasms.

We continue to flirt, send each other pictures, plan dates etc.

Fast forward to yesterday. Her initiative mind you (she still invests 60% to my 40% i'd say). She is like ""are we seeing eachother tonight?"" ... ""Its gonna be hot I promise, ill give u a bj of your life"" and talk like this.

Then 5 hours later (when we're supposed to meet) - sorry, not gonna come. Something happened.

Then fast forward to today - we schedule ""a call"" for later tonight. I feel whats coming - she's coming back to her ex or something...

She tells me bad news ""I've met a guy this week, and felt something"".

I confront her about being all nice and wanting to meet yesterday - ""Yeah I thought I'd come but I really don't want to play on 2 fronts"".

So I guess that's that.

Also I guess worth noting, this lady was in a 5y+ relationship, so I wouldn't assume that she just bangs guys for a while and moves on.

To sum it up - It all went great from the start. We clicked instantly. I was in her house twice, met her mom. Gave her amazing orgasms, we've had hot sex. And I'm just cut off like that in a matter of 2 days, just cause she met someone, whom she haven't even been on a date with. She just ditches me for a chance of dating another guy...

So yeah, I'm crushed. She was invested, took me for a romantic walk, in a month I felt like we've built connection worth a year of knowing eachother. I know that she felt it too. She verbally said it that she feels chemistry between us. Then It all got cut off seemingly in two days. Out of nowhere.

I am not a fan of how he treats me as his girlfriend either, I sometimes feel like a trophy or an object that he won and I miss the feeling of just being buddies.

I'm stuck with what to do at the moment about this so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

For context ive been talking to a women since the end of December. We met on Hinge and everything has been going great up until yesterday. Long conversations on the app and quickly turned into texting after a few days. Had our first video call a few weeks ago and it went great! Talked for over 4 hours and have since had 4 more that all lasted around the same duration. Talked about everything from family to future plans, even sharing old photos.

We both have only been talking to each other since we matched and in the weeks leading up to yesterdays date kept discussing what we would be planning for future dates (ie she suggested cooking for the 2nd in person date, tennis when the weather is warmer).

I thought things were going great until after our first in person meeting yesterday. It was the first time since Christmas that either of us would have seen somebody in person (whether family or friends) so she was understandably a bit nervous to meet as she was trying to ease back in to things. We decided on a social distanced walk which seemed to go great. Ended up being pretty cold so we only walked for abit 1.5hrs and both texted when we got home that we enjoyed it. The date ended with her saying she will keep me posted about availability next week.

Later that night she asked if i had time to talk and agreed to connect at 9pm. Lasted till midnight. The call started off in the usual way but about 30min in she started mentioning that she didn't want to do any more in person walks during the winter (understandable as its not ideal) but then throughout the evening kept mentioning at not wanting to string me along as she was unsure of dating during covid. I told her I understand what she is feeling as the past few years have been hard and if she wanted to take a break while we still kept in contact till timing is better. The night ended with her wanting to talk again when she was less tired so im confused on how to proceed. As of today she is also still replying after i asked how her morning was going.

Last night she also mentioned that her not being ready to meet me more in person during covid is unfair to me and she feels like I would have to give up too much to accommodate her going forward. I just don't know the right way to tell her that she is worth it and I would wait for her until she is ready. Would staying as friends for now be the best approach to remove the pressure of her feeling like she is letting me down? She was blaming herself alot last night and I know I need to give her space but I want to make sure she knows I'm here for her.

She mentioned covid is adding alot of stress/anxiety to her life. I believe our first in person date made her doubt herself and im trying to reassure her things will be ok, that we can work through this. Id hate for things to end the way they are right now with her thinking she is the problem.

**TLDR: Been talking to someone since December. Things were going great till our first in person date after many virtual ones. Dating during covid was the main topic during our call last night and she mentioned that her not being ready to meet myself more in person right now is unfair to me and she feels like I would have to give up too much to accommodate her during covid.
