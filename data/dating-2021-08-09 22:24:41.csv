0,p1h4m0,1628566037,This girl has a bf but acts like she has a crush on me," 

I find this girl attractive but she has a BF (unfortunately). We vibe very well and have similar personalities. I never have the intention to break her up or have her cheat with me but lately she has been weird with me. Her and I do flirt with eachother very often and I also notice her checking me out a lot. The flirting ranges from playful touches to teasing to banter and so on. A lot of the flirting is actually started by her. For example, I was in a room once and she walks in and takes my hand and holds it and sneaks a little gift into it and keeps holding it and leaves. Or once I had the company car keys in my hand she told me to give it to her and i said no. She started grabbing my arm and taking them away from me and in the process she was like half hugging me and holding my fingers and hand. Sometimes I catch her staring at me across the room and when I notice, she quickly looks down and away. We have other girls working in the place (about 4 more during the shift) and when i chat with the ones in relationships she is fine but when i chat with the single girls she instantly swoops into the conversation and interrupts us. Or like when im chatting with a girl alone she comes in and is like ""what are you guys talking about"" and starts talking to the girl. I feel like she is territorial and jealous. I once brought breakfast for another girl and she saw this and started being rude to me and seemed really mad. She responds to my Insta statuses more and most girls and likes to chat.

And here was the final straw, I'm a heterosexual male, not at all interested in the same sex, yet after being called ugly by one woman, I was called handsome by someone who is transgender, and they wanted to give me their snapchat and go out on a date, I was not interested at all, but for a heterosexual guy to know the only person that was interested was trans, after constantly being left on read",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1hj5w/im_heavily_considering_not_dating_anymore/

10,p1hqvz,1628568471,Am I wrong if I'd rather end up alone than settle?,"I'm in my 20s, so it's not like I don't have a lot of time still. Yet, people bug me so much to find someone if I don't want to end up alone. That's kinda the thing though, I'm not sure if I don't actually want to end up alone. 

I've never had a huge friend circle, cause I'm pretty quiet, lately my circle is basically non-existent, but I believe that could change down the road at some point. Even if it won't, I still feel like I'd choose being completely alone than settling. 

Against my better judgment I did enter a relationship I didn't truly want once. It was short, barely 5 months, but I feel like it taught me a lot in some ways. He was okay, both looks and personality-wise, but that's all.

Like it's a terrible feeling when I'd rather stay at home than meet my SO and it feels like an obligation, when I'm thankful if he doesn't want to have sex, cause I have zero desire for him, when I try to convince not only him, but myself too, how this is what I want, I want to be with him and I love him, while deep down I know how it feels to be head over heels with someone and this isn't even close. 

Though no one understands that, not even my mother, all she asks is that what was wrong with him and says I seemed happy. Which is true, I wasn't unhappy overall, it was just that my relationship was very lackluster.

I don't know, maybe even these kinds of relationships are right for someone, well, more power to them, but I would need that special feeling and I think I always will. I have bad luck though, cause I kinda rarely meet someone who I actively want to be with and they don't want to be with me usually.

17,p1iafw,1628570722,Don’t want to have date every week means no strong interest?,"I (30F) have been struggling on dating for a while. Recently, a single male (30M) friend starts dating as well, so we start sharing our dating experience and trying to learn from each other. One of his dating stories makes me start thinking about the frequency of dates and the true interest.

He has been on three dates with a girl near his age. First and second dates were just coffee/ drink. On third date, my friend was in a good mood, he brought flowers, picked up the girl and went to a fancy brunch place, paid for the date. Everything was great and nothing sexual happened. 

Then he said he felt they moved too fast. After 3rd date, he knows he likes the girl, but he didn’t want to see her every week, because he needs personal space. The girl texted him and hinted to have another date the following weekend. He turned it down. 

Then I suddenly related this to my own experience. I felt I had good time with my dates, but some of them didn’t ask for another date for the following week. I have to ask them out and plan the date if I really want to see them.

For guys, if you are really into a girl, will you for sure to set up dates every week? If you are not sure, you just do nothing and wait for the girl to talk to you?

In this case, the girl does nothing wrong, and I feel my friend just wasn’t into her. While my friend keeps saying he likes the girl, but he is not ready to see her every week.

He's fun to talk to, we have a similar sense of humor, and there is a physical attraction. We've been talking a lot since then. However, I'm a bit concerned about our compatibility. I guess I'm more of a ""normie"" than he is (although I do have my quirks). I like traveling, going out for drinks, music events, dancing, fashion, trying new restaurants - you get the picture... 

He's really into video games, which is one of the first things he asked me about (""do you game?""). In fact, his degree was in CS with an emphasis on video game development. He worked in game development for years after. In short, it seems like a huge part of his life. He also has quite a bit of interest in anime. I pretty much detest anime. I've tried watching a lot of them that were recommended to me by my cousins and to me, it's juvenile, boring, and *some* of them are blatantly ""appealing to the male fantasy"" (no offense to people who like it). Anime fanbase is annoying to me. 

I'm a very status-conscious person, unfortunately. It's something I hate about myself but status matters to me, esp since I was a nerd in high school and fought so hard to change myself to better fit in. If he comes into my friend group and talks about anime and video games, that's going to be a problem and I'm going to be embarrassed. I like him until he starts talking about games/anime... then he reminds me of the ostracized guys in high school. 

Tbh, I want him to find his cute gamer gf. I feel like he'd be happier with someone like that, rather than someone as judgmental and status-conscious as me :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1ii5i/is_it_crazy_to_end_things_with_a_guy_solely/

I said I was near the middle of that class and she said that's probably why she didn't remember me. I was going to continue to talk to her but she seemed to start walking away.

I have been working on improving my dating/flirting/mingling. And I think I have taken good steps. I have a work crush and I think they may like me too. I find them staring at me etc, and even after I say something stupid they still seem interested. 

But sometimes when we are alone together or even if they enter a conversation with someone else I am talking to I freeze up and get stuck. Sometimes I say something too quietly and get scared to say it again. 

I think I could be more friendly or start saying Hi consistently. I could send them some few medium positive signals and if they don’t seem to take the bait pull back a little. 

Anyways tips if you know any!!! Building up slowly sounds nice too when I write, but maybe I would go too slow.

I do get easily used to people's presence in my life and would not be happy if I was ghosted/the relationship was suddenly cut short before my move (in 2 months). They are friendly and reach out often, our hangouts haven't been purely sexual and there was a lot of affection involved up to this point, but it was all under the premise of explicitly stated casual intention so I am not hoping for something more.

Its kinda LDR so i've only been able to see her twice. She puts effort into the convo as much as I do, we talk almost everyday and it never felt like a chore. But up until like 3 days ago I've noticed this shift in her behavior. She almost completely disregards my attempts at flirting and even though she'll hmu first sometimes but I just sense that somethings off, maybe she's just looking for a way to stop but suddenly not exchanging good morning/night texts after doing it for so long would feel wrong. We talk through the day but the convos die down sooner than they did so I just pretend like I have smthn to do and avoid texting her for hours. 

Perhaps she finally got bored, its been an issue in the past but I figured if I could make it last this long maybe things were good. Her replies have gotten slower but not by hours more like 15-20 min but I also don't wanna let something like that get to me. I'm pretty sure asking her about it is not the move. There have been times where things would dull down for a couple days simply because we text so much but they would always get back to right where they were. This just feels off tho, or perhaps I'm just overthinking.  
So my question for you guys how do I handle a situation like this? Do I keep going with the flow and see how it pans out as her indifference towards me slowly builds up? Texting her like I always have despite noticing that something's off or do i cut things off after investing so much time and effort and save myself from some hurt?

It was everything you could look for (or it seemed so) - perfect communication, efforts, etc. Until I randomly told him that I have chosen not to have sex before marriage. And all came down crashing. Tried giving it a second chance, told him that I might change my mind (stupid move) and maybe in 3-4 years? Lol this didn't work out because apparently although we had everything, he wanted to have sex at most within 2 years. Upon asking what if we never had this conversation and you get to know it later, the answer was that then it would have been difficult to give up comparatively.

Anyway, I was having a bad day yesterday, it got to 8pm and I text her... then between that and her next reply at 9:20pm I could see she was online on whatsapp. So she was purposley choosing not to read my text. At that point I thought f\*\*\* this, turned my 'last seen' to nobody and just went to bed.

39,p1k5x8,1628579340,How to get over a guy I can’t meet due to living in different continents?,"
I met this guy on social media - he messaged me. He was very sexual from the beginning so I assumed - no surprise, so far away, ofc he’s just looking for nudes. 

We’re both in our early 20s.

However, fast forward us talking, we’ve had quite nice, normal (😂) conversations and have both confessed we like each other. We send pictures to each other and chat a lot and share same hobbies. 

He’s been especially very clear that he’d love to take me out. He also acts much sweeter than in the beginning, as we’ve connected on some level.

**However**, we’re on different continents and the chance of us meeting is close to zero. 

**I am planning on doing a work related exchange in his country** in the upcoming years, and he got really excited about that, but COVID and my plans overall make it difficult.

_So, how do I deal with the fact that the conversations we’re having now are basically pointless?_ I’d like to enjoy the moment, but unfortunately start to imagine all the things we could do. He also hinted jokingly that he’s getting tickets to visit me.

**Or am I biased?** Maybe he just seems better than he is just cause we’re so far apart and only show our best sides to each other?

This is the reason I’m not sure whether I want to even video call him, as it seems pointless and just makes me attached even more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1k5x8/how_to_get_over_a_guy_i_cant_meet_due_to_living/

47,p1kqro,1628582326,"Women I date all seem to fall quickly in love with me. My female friends (32F, 34F &amp; 33F) have told me it's because I'm one of the few naturally good guys out there. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but I just want some casual relationships and I'm breaking these women's hearts too often now.","While this sounds like a humble brag, and I guess it is, but it's also becoming a real problem.

Women fall in love with me easily. Ever since I've been 11, I've often dated the prettiest girls in HS, College etc.

My natural 'goto' game from since then is befriend them, get to know and understand them emotionally. Other than that I show no overt signs of interest, but I do subtly flirt and tease them a lot. I grew up with several girl cousins so conversing and understanding women was easy. I was the youngest boy with 7 similar or slightly older female cousins and I learned quickly how to get them on my side as well as how to really know them.

Whatever I'm doing has worked brilliantly throughout my dating life.

However, I maried my college sweet heart (34F) and at 35m I'm now divorced (2.5 years now). It's no fault of her or me, we just sort of grew apart. My ex-wife is one of my best friends now and she always tells me I'm easy to fall in love with.

I've got 2 other close female friends who I've dated in the past and one I'm FWB. I've known them for over 10 years so we have a very open relationship and understanding.

So back to the topic, for the last 2 years I've been dating and maybe 7 out of 10 women I date, no matter their age, quickly fall in love with me. I so often hear them say they're coming off tinder or bumble because they wanan settle down with me. I don't mind, but unles I'm really inlove with them I feel guilty.

I feel as if they're far more invested emotionally than I am. I end up feeling quite bad like I'm using them and then inevitably I had to break up with them after the first 3-7 dates.

I spent sometime chilling with my guy friends who I haven't seen in months due to the covid (also I moved). And I quickly realize my probelm was quite unique.

All of them had trouble getting 2nd dates, all of them would kill for some of the women I broke up with (they were all very attractive) and they all thought I was some player or stud.

Truthfully, there's not much separating me from them.

I'm well off yes, I make well over $100k, got a nice apartment and car. But many times women don't know that untill long after they're 'inlove'.

I am fairly goodlooking and I have been told i look like Chris Evans a lot. I'm fit, dress well. But there's tonnes of other goodlooking me out there.

So last night I asked my two female best friends what is it that I'm doing 'right'.

They both gave their perpsectives.

Alice said - You're kinda the whole package, and if you slept with them they'd also know you're good in bed. But it's not that, there's something about your tone or your eyes that makes me feel like i trust you. Most guys give off creeper vibes or seem like they're secretly not telling you what they mean because they just wanna sleep with you. What I love about you is that if you don't agree with me, you tell me and do it in the nicest way. You're also funny AF as well because you find humour in most situations. Also, it's cute becauase you're supposed to be the super smart succcessful guy, yet you say the dumbest things sometimes.

Chrissy said - I don't know I can't explain why I like you, I just connect with you more than other men. But it's also because I feel safe with you. I feel like I know what you're thinking. Like you're my safe escape from reality, someone I can be me with.

All good so far doesn't it seem so?

I'd never change this quality about myself, but I kinda want to stop breaking hearts and just keep things casual without having them fall in love with me.

I have this with Chrissy, we are FWB and it's what I need but she lives almost 2 hours away so I don't see her more than once or twice a month.

Any advice on what I should be doing? If I tell women on our first dates that I want to keep it casual does that signal a red flag? I don't want to turn them off obviously, but I don't want to get committed too quickly and then hurt them.

It does feel bad, especially when I don't feel the same.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1kqro/women_i_date_all_seem_to_fall_quickly_in_love/
48,p1l1o5,1628583856,My girlfriend feels guilty after being intimate.,"I am a 20 year old male who has been in a relationship with my gf for about a year. shes 19.   
in short, she said she wanted to stop doing anything intimate (except for kiss) because of personal reasons. This really startled me as I have seen previous friends who have dealt with the same issue because their partner would get satisfied somewhere else. We argue because this was never a problem and cutting it off seemed so weird for me; of course I respected the decision however i just wanted a real truthful reason as she wanted to stop, not because im some overdriven sexual monster.   


She eventually tells me its because she feels guilt. This broke me. She said it wasnt my fault however I felt like it was, I never ever forced her to do anything she never wanted and she most of the time made the first move into doing something sexual. Now the thought of my girlfriend whom I love very very much felt guilty after EVERYTIME we have been intimate is very damaging to my mental. I really dont know what to do and I havent been able to talk to her because of it. I feel very bad and I really dont know how to help her get back to where we were. I tried to reassure her multiple times that I wanted to marry her and whenever she was ready for me to come ask for her hand in marriage (Yes I am serious about her) and yet, despite all that, she still felt guilt.  


I read up on multiple articles of people telling me this is a severe red flag and that I should talk to her about it. People said that this sort of stuff can develop into marriage. I dont want our relationship to be ruined because of this. If she felt guilt after every interaction, why would she persist in doing stuff with me? 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that she would not feel guilty if we were married and that she cannot wait to be married. But were both still in college and I still  have yet to graduate and get an internship that will land me a financially stable job. I predict it will take me 2-3 years before I am financially stable. I dont want to sound needy or demanding, but as a 20 year old athlete, I literally would not be able to handle that break of nonsexual interactions ESPECIALLY after we used to do it.  


P.S. I have been sexually frustrated for months and months on end. I never wanted to force her to satisfy me because Im not an asshole. We have NOT had sex yet as she said she wants to save it till marriage.

He also seems to be under the impression that I will be ugly/sick/physically broken by the time I turn 40. He keeps asking me to start doing some kind of sport and it really bothers me. I have told him multiple times that it bothers me when he asks me this and I have even tried cycling and running. I feel like he doesn't accept me for who I am.

68,p1ojd3,1628599857,Dating a trans woman?,"So I'm a transgender woman and one of the reasons why I'm so hesitant to date anyone is because of how they would react to that. 

There are 2 things I'm nervous about

1. I haven't started transitioning yet so I feel like if I end up in a long term relationship, they'll leave me if I transition.

2. If I start dating after I start transitioning, how would people react when finding out I'm transgender, so many people say that it's my job to tell the other person but they don't realise how dangerous that could be, so many transwomen are assaulted or killed when telling the person they're on a date with that they're transgender. Personally I feel that if the other person doesn't want to date a transgender person then it's their job to explain that to whoever they date, this would make it a lot safer.

How do you feel about all this? How would you feel if the person you're dating tells you they want to transition and how would you feel if the person you're dating has already transitioned?

I'm really curious about how people feel about this because Its been something that's kept me from dating anyone for years.

Also, I'm bisexual",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1ojd3/dating_a_trans_woman/
69,p1oqpj,1628600598,Hurt and confused.,"I was married for 12 years to a woman that I loved. We had two beautiful children together 8 and 9 years ago. Almost from a month after we moved in together I started noticing that she was very secretive about her phone and the computer. Through the years I would catch her on dating sites and apps, or sending nude pics to men and women... I would confront her and we somehow always got past it. I left her twice, only to come back because my heart told me not to give up.

Eventually I even tried to cheat on her. But in the end I never could go through with it. We stayed together because of the kids, but we ultimately realized that we were creating a toxic environment for them. Then I found out that she was seeing a married coworker that had children. I ran him off and their relationship ended. In 2015 we started sleeping in separate rooms. In 2019 she started seeing another man and she would lie to our kids saying she was going on business trips on the weekends when she was really going to him. I covered it up because kids need a loving parent and shouldn't know things like that.

Now its 2021 and we just divorced. She has brought this guy into the children's lives on an almost daily basis.

I found out last week that he and she has an only fans page where she participates in gangbangs, orgies, full swap swinging, girl on girl, bondage, and more. She doesn't need money. She has a six figure income. I dont understand why she has the OF page.

Every since I saw this stuff with my own eyes I have been sad, hurt and depressed. Wtf is wrong with me? How can I get past this feeling of hurt and the desire that I was the one, and that I wish we were still a family, but with our shit together.

Currently I am 18 years old and getting back in the dating scene. I just got out a pretty serious relationship in April and I thought it was finally time to go back. Usually I meet up with a lot of guys that I find online. They are usually nice and show me a good time. I also love having people to hangout with and talk to. Not only that but I have become noticeably happier and healthier. There is just one problem, my parents have no clue.

At this point I’ve been lying for about 5 months. Instead of meeting with a guy I’m “hanging out with my friends”. That kinda stuff. But the reality of my situation is really setting in for me. I can feel that my sins are slowly catching up to me. I can’t keep living in a constant fear of discovery but I also refuse to let my parents into my personal world I’ve made for myself. 

So that is the question, to be or not to be.

I've been talking to a guy on tinder for about a week or so. This guy is a former model, he sings and plays instruments, and is very attractive.

 He's told me that the reason the dates I went on in the past didn't work out is because they weren't as smart as me, and that he is and he might be my perfect match. He told me that I was very attractive and that he wanted to do a lot of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't have sex with people that I'm not in a relationship with, and he said that it sounded like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that he should, because ""you know that I like you"".

 I said that I did want to have sex with him, but it was too soon for me to, not knowing him that well. We went on a date and it went well. We had lunch and then we went for a walk on a nature trail. He sat me down on a log and we made out for a bit, and he put my hands down his pants on his ass. He asked if I wanted to go further and I said I didn't. He dropped me off at home and we kept texting each other afterwards. 


He told me that he was obsessed with me and falling for me, and that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that I drove him wild. He said that he wanted to have sex with me and cum in me on the second date, and that if it was good that we'd be boyfriends. I told him that I didn't feel comfortable having sex with someone that I didn't know that well. He said it was fine and that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that it would delay us being in a relationship.

I also didn't like the fact that we would have to have sex in his car because of neither of us have our own place. He told me before that we could have sex at his house because he's had his ex stay at his house with his family before and it was fine, but his family unexpectedly had to move while we were talking. We eventually came to the decision that we were too different of people, and we stopped talking. I've been really upset that I blew my chance with this guy who could've been my perfect match.

We have a real connection and the reason things ended with us years ago was because of distance. No bad blood.

Just a bit worried I am being used as a rebound and it's making me apprehensive of going on dates with him.

We even started dating after a while and had plans go meet up in the summer. We were in an online relationship for about 5 months. I'm head over heels for this guy. 
During those months he confessed to me that he also had a crush on a close female friend that I made in that sever. He said that it was an innocent crush that he didn't want to pursue. It made me a bit jealous so I was struggling with that and eventually asked for him to consider an open relationship seeing that it was really difficult for me to process him having a crush on another girl. 
He didn't want that and after trying to work through it, we broke it off. 
I talked to the girl about it and she promised me that girl code came first and that she would never date him..

I didn't block him and I only told him that we shouldn't speak for at least 30 days so that we could heal and clear our minds. He seems to be having a difficult time letting go of me, saying he'll wait for me, and using our photos as his profile photo and banner on Discord.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1s12z/can_i_save_this/
