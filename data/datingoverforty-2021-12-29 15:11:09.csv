0,rrjnq4,1640814305,Did I do something wrong?,"I (50f) met a great guy (42m) on bumble and we chatted for a week. He was working nights (temporarily) so very sporadic but great communication. On Sunday, he called for the first time and we talked for 2.5 hours. It was awesome. Shortly after, he texted to see if I could meet for a drink since he would be working nights starting Monday but also watching his little daughter during the day since her babysitter was on vacation. 

The date was fantastic. Great conversation. We both agreed we were attracted to one another. Had some PG rated making out and he asked me to text when I got home which I did. We texted for another half hour or so. We both said I can‚Äôt wait to see you again, etc. Monday morning I sent text. He responded excitedly and was with his daughter. Around 6 he texted and was preparing to go to work. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused. I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to text me your last name because I have you as Joe New York Bumble in my phone.‚Äù  He HAD told me his last name on the date but it was long and I couldn‚Äôt remember it. His reply was, ‚Äúyou just want to Google me lol‚Äù. I said, ‚Äúhonestly no‚Äù. No response. So later I knew he was probably at work so I said, ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt seriously think that! Anyway. Have a great night at work !üòä‚Äù. I have not heard from him since (I know it‚Äôs only Wednesday). Was it rude of me to asking his last name? Or am I just overthinking? Please don‚Äôt bash me-this is my first ever post. Also last year, after a two year relationship, I was ghosted by my bf when he moved. So you can see why this could be a sore spot for me. Should I wait a couple more days if I don‚Äôt hear from him and ask how his week is going?

6,rrm837,1640820890,Dating nowadays,"This year I found myself back in the dating scene after 18 years of marriage.  It didn't help that I decided to be back on the scene during the pandemic but... we don't choose when we are ready, right?

What I found out so far:
Increased my vocabulary with new words I wasn't even aware existed: ghosting, love bombing, catfish, bread crumbing...

Tried FWB but most men (over 40) are either married looking for an escape, emotionally unavailable or will love bomb you in less than a week.  

Nailing an easy going, light and fun relationship is like winning the lottery.  I would think most people our age would run from drama.  

Ghosting is such a coward practice but it seems to have become a very one common specially with OLD.  Respect for people's feelings is just not important as long as one is not bothered.  

Catfishing comes in second... do people assume that we are over 40 and not tech savy enough to use google images and find out the person they are impersonating?

And OLD just opened the door for all types of people and practiced so if you want to put yourself out there be prepared to see and hear things you didn't even know existed.  

I look at my 3 year old daughter and worry what it will be like another 18 years from now... because honestly... this is definitely not for rookies ü§£ü§£",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rrm837/dating_nowadays/

9,rrnvp4,1640825350,How to date when you are difficult to orgasm?,"Mother Nature has given me this hard to orgasm anatomy, so much that I never knew I could cum from penetration, and my long marriage was mostly sexless, my ex was only skilled in quickies, convinced me I was frigid, and I lost interest in sex altogether around 10 years ago. Fast forward several ONS this year and I met a guy I was so compatible with, I would orgasm and squirt every two minutes during sex with him. I learned I was not only a size queen but also a shape queen. It seems I don't have a G-spot and I lost my external clitoral sensitivity due to perimenopause (don't know if could orgasm in the past from oral as my ex never went down on me, but it's not possible anymore anyway), but I have a very orgasmic A-spot.   
I called it off with that guy as he had a shitty personality, was abusive, and broke boundaries multiple times on all levels.  
Well, now I am a bit at a loss as I don't know how to date to get another guy with as much compatibility as I had before. It seems I am only compatible with less than 10% of guys. I feel like an outlier as I notice all men expect me to 1) cum, 2) cum fast, 3) cum several times. I am desperate it's usually impossible for me.  
I have a couple of thousand likes in my tinder gold, and that freaks me out even more. How will I sift through them without hurting anybody's feelings? I cannot ask for a d-pick right away, cannot objectify men that much. So, I have to have a first date and see if the guy brings about something sexual after it and there is an opportunity to exchange pics. And then I have to somehow judge it from the picture or maybe even be brave enough to ask about the size. OMG it seems so wrong, I have never done that. On the other hand, I don't want to go from one unnecessary and forgettable ONS to another only to increase my body count for nothing and get more and more frustrated and desperate. And even a perfect photo does not guarantee success, there are so many nuances to sex and sexual compatibility, at least for me. I feel I might spend years ahead, searching and never finding great sex again.

Like a lot of us I guess, I have a few girls in my life who I like and they like me, nothing romantic but we get on very well, perhaps could be if I was more available, or maybe not. Never really know what the other side thinks until you make a move.

But what I don't get is when I see that one has a new partner, I don't feel good about it. They're my friends, I should be happy for them, right? And yet if anything there is a pang of jealousy coupled with a splash of bruised ego. But...

I went on a few dates over the summer, and it wasn‚Äôt a great experience, from the catfish, to the anti-vaxer, to the angry lady, it mostly kid of sucked, or was boring. My last date made up for it, as I had a great date with this lady, who reversed catfished, but she noped for the second. Who knows why, but regardless, it kind of killed my desire, and I just wasn‚Äôt enthused to match with anyone. So I took a break, figured I get a few new photos, tweak my bio, and I did, but my desire to start again just isn‚Äôt there.

&amp;#x200B;

I said I‚Äôd wait till November and then start again, but that day came and went.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I figured I‚Äôd try in the new year, and here it is days away, and I‚Äôm still not feeling it. Locally omicron and the weather (it‚Äôs colder than normal in Canada), have made convenient reasons/excuses, yet if they were not around I‚Äôm doubtful that I‚Äôd still feel like trying. When I think about dating, it seems to me that staying home or going out with friends would be more fun/productive.

&amp;#x200B;

Being late 40s my kids are teens, they do their own things, my routines as a single person are well established, I have 5 different friend groups, join social groups, time-consuming hobbies and interests, as well as far too many books to be read. Some dates are tedious, and some aren‚Äôt, but the payout has never been there, which makes the whole process seem like a poor investment.  I‚Äôm my normal upbeat, happy, entertaining, social self on the dates, FWIW. I don‚Äôt get very many matches, or likes, but I do get some, so there seems no reason to complain on this front.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve been divorced eight years, during which time, I‚Äôve certainly bettered myself significantly from when I was married. And I love my life a lot (Family, friends, hobbies, interests, etc.), but I still think having the right person in it would make it so much better. It did occur to me that success probably means trying more until I‚Äôm lucky, but getting that foot out of the door, is like nah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too cold out.

We text each other daily but never discuss being together or whether we see other people even though we both have during this time.

42,rtdzee,1641020939,He's so erratic that I can't see straight. How do I get out?,"F43, divorced and dating for about a year. I have been happily seeing all different kinds of men for various lengths and types of relationships. About 8 weeks ago I met a man who completely floored me emotionally out of the blue. I have no idea what it is about him but the second he walked in to our first date I felt sparks and they just get more intense every time we're together. 

But naturally there's a catch. We live about an hour apart and both have 50% time with our kids so we see each other relatively infrequently. This means that a lot of our relationship has to be over the phone and he he is the weirdest, erratic communicator. He either texts really intimate things about his kids/life or very sweet love songs. Sometimes sexy, sometimes really affectionate... and then sometimes not at all. He doesn't call unless I ask him to but won't call when he has his kids. There's no rhythm to it at all. I've talked to him about it and he half laughs it off b/c of ADHD and half looks super sad b/c I'm pretty sure that was a key marital issue for him. I know he's a good guy &amp; that he feels the same real intensity when we're together that I do... but I don't see his communication style changing any time soon and in that I'm coming out of a bad communication divorce myself, I dont think it's a good idea to go any further with a guy who leaves me feeling so unstable and vulnerable when we're apart. 

My problem is... I'm so hooked. I'm deliberately dating a handful of really wonderful men right now to learn more about who I am and what I want after my 12 year marriage. I can get 4 texts that are supportive, curious, kind, and funny from other guys and they feel like nothing compared to the one word I get from this crazy-magnet-man I'm messed up on. I know I have Anxious Attachment issues... I know I'm activated... I just don't know how to pull back and stop wanting, needing, waiting... please help me. What do I do? I feel like a teenager in a really bad way.

tldr; too old to be hooked on a guy that's this bad for me but I don't know how to stop. how do I stop?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rtdzee/hes_so_erratic_that_i_cant_see_straight_how_do_i/

45,rti3bz,1641038425,Sad,"I was wondering if you could give light to this situation. I too, was in and out of a ""situationship"" I guess you call it, with a DA who I came to really really like. He has a good heart but would ghost me for months at a time and then get in touch by text. He finally took me to a dinner or two and we always had fun together. We've also k own each other for years prior to being together. Well, he got a new house and boat and would promise me that he was going to have me on it all summer, let me go with him on trips to the islands, etc. not once contacted me all summer. Not even to wish me a happy birthday that he repeatedly reminded me in the months before, was coming up. I last saw him in May (he did take me abs a friend on the boat"" and never spoke to me again after. I happened to run into him in July and told him how he hurt me. He had all kinds of excuses on why he had t been in touch as he always does. I told him I should block him only b/c this cycle needs to stop and that it's painful for me. He told me to do what I needed to do. We ended with a few more hugs and parted kind of laughing and kind. He never contacted me in the weeks to come so I blocked him. That was in September. It was just easier to heal b/c I didn't have to see that he just didn't care and wasn't contacting me...ever. Fast forward now to December, I came home from my parents house to see a gift on my front porch. It was from him. It was a picture that he had blown up to an 8x10 of me and my friend on his boat and framed it. I decided to be myself and unblock him to thank him and took a pic of the gift saying ""Thank you. I hope you had a good holiday with your kids and family"". He never responded back to me. I'm so confused. Any help as to why he dropped off the gift but no response to my text? I know it doesn't necessarily need a response but if it's to open the communication lines, I would think a ""You're welcome"" would be next. It's been 4 days. I truly do miss him and was happy when I got the gift he left. Now I'm sad b/c I don't know what to make of it.

This relationship didn't last long as a few weeks later she changed her status back to single. I've not contacted her for months but thought as it was Christmas I'd send her seasons greetings. She replied back in a very flirty way calling me darling and sending 3 kisses. I sent her a happy new year last night and this morning again she replied sending three kisses and calling me darling and saying we should definitely meet up this year. I replied back with soon, I hope and again her reply was three kisses. So my question is how do I play this? Do I offer to exchange phone numbers? Do I leave a few days before I message her again?

I‚Äôm just not willing to continue to date someone when half the time I‚Äôm left feeling hurt over some thoughtless thing he did.  It‚Äôs a mental mind fuck that I just don‚Äôt need. 

What‚Äôs the best way to break up with someone?  I know the general consensus is that it‚Äôs cowardly to do it over text. We live an hour apart though and wouldn‚Äôt it be worse to ask him to drive to see me only to break up with him? I guess I could meet him somewhere for dinner‚Ä¶but then when do I do it?  If I do it before the food arrives, that‚Äôs gonna be a pretty awkward meal. If I wait until after we get the food, I‚Äôll have to make conversation during the meal knowing that he will want to talk about future plans and whatnot. 

Seems this shouldn‚Äôt be difficult but I haven‚Äôt had to break up with someone in years and years, and I‚Äôm just at a loss.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rutzzv/best_way_to_break_up/
93,ruu0bx,1641187568,Chemistry vs compatibility,"There might be better words to choose but I‚Äôm curious how many people choose chemistry (ie love at first sight, x-factor, a ‚Äúfeeling,‚Äù etc.) OR choose compatibility (ie shared interests, ‚Äúbf/gf material,‚Äù etc.)?

I‚Äôm specifically talking about within the first couple dates and/or talks. 

Obviously, the hope is to have both chemistry or compatibility but I‚Äôm curious if people really lean on one over the other. 

The quick backstory of this I went on a few dates with a lady and we had great compatibility(voiced from both sides) but she broke it off because I lacked that ‚Äúx-factor.‚Äù",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ruu0bx/chemistry_vs_compatibility/
94,ruuk1k,1641189442,When to have sex with someone you‚Äôre dating,"I know this one has been discussed but I always like new opinions.  Let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôve started dating someone‚Ä¶ how soon are you comfortable having sex with them? What do you like to discuss first (re: the sex) Do you require (or assume) exclusivity before doing the deed?  Have you come up with a set of standards for yourself to stay on track?

96,ruvv6c,1641194248,How to flirt?,"I am a nerdy divorcee who never had any game to begin with. Years of hanging out with mainly other nerdy parents has not helped that at all. To wit - tonight I was chatting with a lady on OLD, we were talking books, and I mentioned that in one of her pics looked like how I pictured a character, and she looked lovely. There was a long pause in the conversation followed by a casual deflection. Still worried I killed my chances by being too forward. Anxiety replay mode in my brain. But then the rational part of my brain reports that it was just a nice thing to say and, if anything, I probably should have flirted more directly since I was into her. 

Problem is, I have no idea how to do that. So not specifically about my anecdote, Ladies, please advise on excellent flirting techniques and acceptable thresholds.
