4,n4fisn,1620100944,I (21M) think I‚Äôm falling for my friend (21M) and thought about him during sex with my girlfriend (21F),"Slight nsfw warning‚Äîmentions of sex. 

To start off, my girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) have been dating for almost two years now. Things have been relatively good between us. We‚Äôve always been a good fit for each other and I really do care about her. She‚Äôs sweet and she really cares about me as well. 

We met at a party and it was pretty much your regular boy meets girl sorta thing‚Äîand by the next week or two we were dating. 

But lately I haven‚Äôt been up to doing things with her alone or been wanting to have sex either. I know she‚Äôs been feeling a little weird about me lately since I‚Äôve been sorta distant, and I have been feeling guilty about that. 

I met someone recently, and he (21M) and I hit it off pretty quickly as friends. I talk to him pretty regularly now, and we hang out. He is openly gay and up until now I‚Äôve always thought of myself as straight and strictly into girls. 

It‚Äôs just been an entirely confusing thing to me since I‚Äôve never felt this way for another guy before, but every time I see him it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt want the feeling to go away. I want to be around him and I like it when he hang out together. I really look forward to when I get to talk to him and see him. 

He invited me to his place along with one of his friends to watch a movie, and the three of us got pretty drunk. The friend (20F) lives in the same apartment complex as him, so she‚Äôd gone back home, but I was in no state to drive back home. He let me stay over and I slept in his bed with him. 

We didn‚Äôt do anything wrong per se, but sleeping in the same bed as him was probably a bad call on my end. I still had fun that evening and I *liked* waking up next to him the next morning (he‚Äôs honestly really cute). 

Still, I wanted to get my mind off everything and reaffirm my relationship with my gf, so we had sex a few nights ago after a while, and everything seemed fine up until the end when I finished and came at the thought of him. 

I‚Äôve been in a sort of panic mode ever since because I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm bi or if I just like him only, but what I do know is that I want to spend time with him and I think he makes me happy. I also don‚Äôt want to hurt my girlfriend anymore than I already have (even though she isn‚Äôt aware of the situation).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4fisn/i_21m_think_im_falling_for_my_friend_21m_and/

10,n4frf5,1620101848,I have no idea how to date outside of apps. How do I change?,"I've been dealing with the fact that I have no idea how to get involved in dating, without apps. For almost all of my adult life I've had them and they've worked wonders for me (until recently, not sure what I've changed?) I mainly used them for flings, hook ups etc. I wasn't really looking for anything serious, mainly because I wasn't ready and the apps worked like magic. Now I'm 25 and kind of in a social purgatory. The apps stopped working, my career involves me working with 1 other person and everyone I've worked with is at least 8-10 years older than me, which makes it hard to meet anyone.

I should add that my college job was much different, and I was able to date and hook up with quite a few co-workers over the years. Obviously not the smartest thing, but I was young and dumb. So It's not that I have a hard time talking to women, or not being able to have a conversation, in fact I always get told the opposite, I'm always told how fun I am to talk to and that it never gets boring, or how funny I am, which always felt weird to me, because I never really thought too much about my interactions or how I behaved on a date. 

It's the meeting that's hard now. I'm not in school, I don't really believe in flirting at the gym or with cashiers/ waiters etc. Always just seemed a bit too desperate for me, and it's kind of a taboo these days. I have a good group of close friends, but they live kind of far and it can make trying to go to bars and clubs kind of difficult. They're really not too much into it anyways.

16,n4ga26,1620103873,"If height matters to you, please put that information in your profile to make things easier on everyone.","People should put their height requirements on their dating profiles, if they have one. Everybody's got preferences and types. Most people don't care that much, in my experience, just like how a person might prefer blondes, but date a brunette. If height is truly a deal breaker for you, let the world know ahead of time. 

What you shouldn't do is feel out a person, click with them, flirt, start making plans, then ask for the height, and tell the person to fuck off cuz they're short. Which has happened four times this year. It's such a weird and offensive question, because the implication is ""I'm into you if you are tall, this will not work if you are short."" The other implication is there is something fundamentally physically wrong with me which nothing can make up for - and if you think it's appropriate to drop that kind of toxicity on a stranger you have been flirting with, there is something deeply fundamentally wrong with you. Just say ""5'10""+"" or whatever, which is pretty common, so we can swipe left.

Today, i was chatting with someone where I checked all of the boxes for what she was looking for. However, by omitting her height requirements, she was being fundamentally dishonest with what she wanted - she actually didnt want someone with similar values she liked being around, she wanted someone tall - everything else was secondary. That omission just makes everyone unhappy. We've heard it before, we won't get offended unless you're an asshole about it.

I‚Äôm going to sound like an asshole but it seems impossible to find a decent woman these days with my standards. I respect all women from all backgrounds but, I have a particular set of standards that I just can‚Äôt seem to let go of. 
For one I don‚Äôt want to date anyone who does drugs (including weed) it‚Äôs just a nasty habit and it‚Äôs super gross. 
Tattoos are a major turn off for me as well, I have no problem with anyone choosing to get them but if I‚Äôm dating you it would be nice to not see a doodle pad on your body. 
Cringey political correctness and activism. I respect anyone who wants to stand up for a cause they believe in but I can‚Äôt stand hearing about any political issues. I have a twisted and stupid since of humor that I don‚Äôt want to give up. 
I‚Äôm also super busy with my job and school which might makes it difficult to find time to devote to someone. I just really hate being alone. 
Someone who can fend for themself financially.
Women who aren‚Äôt too promiscuous. I don‚Äôt want something everyone else has already had. I might be the only one here but women who do oral also turns me off. That‚Äôs your mouth.
Not to mention that I only would want to date someone who is way out of my league in terms of looks. I would prefer a thin woman with a pretty face.

28,n4hcg8,1620108306,I've [35M] decided to remove almost all of my standards and give up on having a Jewish family,"I've been on *so* many first dates. Of all of them surely some would have blossomed into a relationship. I really think my issue is for some reason these women just aren't willing to give things a chance. My mentality is if there are no red flags and there's any attraction, second date. If we're getting along well, third date. Then after a third date decide to move forward or not. It seems like the women I'm going out with are looking for reasons to get to no whereas I'm looking damn hard to find the good in them. 

So I give up. The first thing I'm doing is no more stipulations that someone be educated and professionally successful. You have to be a good person and that's it. I'm also recognizing it's not likely I'll find a woman who wants to have a Jewish family. I need to be going on a date per week at least and there's just not enough women that fit the bill. Finally, the real way I'm giving up is I'm straight up looking for women interested in my money. This is crass and hard to say, but I think there are plenty of women out there who prioritize financial security or single moms just getting by who wish they could take their kids to Disney. Someone who cares that I have a seven figure net worth is more likely to say yes to a second date and we're more likely to actually get to know each other.

I liked this guy a lot and we have been on about 10 dates (he also slept over twice but we didn‚Äôt do anything). We just got close and I genuinely thought we both liked each other and felt the same, like he remembered little details about me and went out of his way to make me happy and was there for me, even when I would be stressed after work and wouldn‚Äôt talk to him as much. 

After about 10 dates, he stopped responding almost or just giving somewhat short replies but still kept talking to me for two weeks after. He was sick for a bit, and I asked to come over, mostly so I can be there for him and he said he didn‚Äôt want to get me sick. When he got better, I asked again and he said he‚Äôll be busy over the weekend. After that, I kind of deleted social media for two weeks because I had a lot going on and finals so I told him and deleted everything and didn‚Äôt talk to him. I recently downloaded everything again and started talking to him, and he asked me if all was good now and I said yes, and I kept trying to make conversations, but it still seemed like he was giving shortish replies. 

He doesn‚Äôt exactly give one word replies but he used to send me paragraphs before, ask about my day, make jokes, and do lots of other things, but he doesn‚Äôt do any of those things anymore, and I‚Äôm confused because I like him so much and I want to be there for him in case something is wrong and he isn‚Äôt okay. He sometimes takes things I say the wrong way and has self esteem issues and I want to let him know I‚Äôm genuinely there for him, and he also once told me that no one ever stays. 

Keep in mind that COVID-19 cases are very high at the moment here, so hanging out would not be good and he is strict about these things. I‚Äôm so confused though, if he is going through something or if he genuinely just isn‚Äôt interested in me anymore and wants me to take the hint. I don‚Äôt want to be selfish and make things about me and make assumptions, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep annoying him. He told me his mom might have COVID-19, so I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs pretty worried about that and I just want to be there for him, and I feel that if I make this about me and think ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs not into me‚Äù and just stop replying, I‚Äôll seem like a really bad and selfish person, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep talking to him until he is forced to say ‚Äúleave me alone, I‚Äôm simply not interested‚Äù.

I know ‚Äúlove you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù can be two very different things, but I felt as if this was a Freudian slip. 
There didn‚Äôt seem to be much tension, however he is now distant.
We barely even have a label to what we are, although we have connected as much as a couple can over a month. This also includes long calls and talks at night on the phone, etc (5+ hours). 
Is there a reason he could be acting distant and how do I approach this situation? Or maybe I should wait until he stops cringing to himself that he accidentally said it? Lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4hsem/guy_ive_been_seeing_accidentally_says_love_you/

I would get it, if it happened occasionally but it happens everyday- multiple times a day!  

I‚Äôve asked him why he talks about it so much and he says that that‚Äôs where his mind is mainly focused at this stage in his life. I told him I wanna get to know him not his account details and he agreed to stop the money talk but he hasn‚Äôt followed through.

Ok met this girl a month ago on tinder, we saw each other 5 times had sex on the 3rd date at her house by the 5 time we saw each other she answer a question I ask her just to know out of curiosity I ask her so what do you even want or are  looking for with me and she said she got out of a relationship months ago and was super busy that she wanted to be ready but she just was not at the moment but that wanted to keep seeing me then I said good Im down with that and I also said laughing everytime a girl tells me that I know is a lie and she is just saying she is ready but not for me she said trust me is not like that I really like you but Im just not ready at the moment but since that last time we saw each other a week after that she been acting super distant no longer texting 1st, sometimes leaves on read, sometimes she is online and doesnt even open my messages then replies hours later.Everytime I tell her to hangout always says she is busy that she lets me know.

I confronted her through text and told her if she was not interested anymore she could simply just say it and nobody waste anyones time and she said she is interested is just that she just super busy cause she got promoted in her job and doesnt have much time.I kept texting her but she kept doing the same things leaving on read  and being online but not even opening my messages etc and honestly I said enough is enough and  I unfollow her from all social media just to move on from her easier not that I'm in love with her or anything is just thats my way of moving on from someone easier cause she is obiously not interested anymore. But the weird part comes now last time we saw each other she suggest that I should take an hiv text so we could have sex without a condom and more often and without any worries cause the 1st time we had sex it was not that good cause we were both nervous and also the condom made me lose my erection a few times but she understood and suggest to take an hiv test so we can have sex without a condom.And also she suggest to go with her to Chicago on june and was also making lots of plans with me in the future but now is she acting super distant.


Last time we text she left me on seen she reply with Im not talking with anybodyelse besides you I reply yeah right well is obvious you are not interested anymore then left me on seen and thats when I decided to unfollow her and never text her again but the other weird part is she has not unfollowed me since then sees all my stories litteraly the 1st person to see it is her and also reacts to them whenever I post a pic of me she reacts with hearts so what is this nonsense behavior she is doing about? If you dont like me  why you just dont say why keep reacting to my stuff and seeing all my stories and liking my pictures why do you keep following me even after I unfollow her. I dont even care if she text me again or if she want to hangout again I honeslty dont even want to hangout anymore with her cause this kind of behavior turns me off but Im just asking this to know why do women do this and what does it mean?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4id55/what_is_the_deal_with_this_girl/

Struggling a hell of a lot.

On and Off relationship for a very long time. It's been toxic. I have tried to extract myself from it for years. 

For some strange reason we circle each other and come back to each other.

Whenever we do it triggers massive changes in our lives. Goes well for a while, we can get progress in it and as much as I put up walls to not catch feelings and intentions as well as put healthy barriers up both of us seem to trample them down.

The emotional connection as well as physical/spiritual is beyond belief. 

But it's not healthy as they pull back often from their own mental health issues and then they trigger severity of my own emotional responses to that with some unbelievable emotional abuse.

It always is the same issues and problem. It always is the fact that they self sabotage after gaining my trust back.

I have blocked them on everything because it's really necessary and I can not be dragged back into this arena constant.

They have not healed from their own trauma. They keep bringing another person into the arena and they never accept the position of responsibility for it.

I really don't like that they have such a hold on myself. I have been wondering how and why for years they can get pass my defence because as a rational person I am in full knowledge how incredibly volatile this is. If I explained to anyone they would just look at myself and wonder what the hell I am doing.

I'm struggling at present with the fact that I have put extreme blocks on them. I don't want them walking back. But....kinda do as well because I see their good. It's just not.... permanent.

Hi I‚Äôm 22F and I can say that I‚Äôm finally recovering from being sexually abused around six months ago. 

The experience opened my eyes. I have just come out of a long rabbit hole of feeling unworthy unless lots of guys were drooling over me. Ew it‚Äôs even gross to talk about it now. Even worse, I‚Äôve felt this way since I started highschool. No young person should ever feel that way! 

But I did. It has been a long nine years of seeing friends get into relationships and situations hips and wishing I could as well, guys in highschool only talking to pretty girls, and me attempting to turn into one of those pretty girls and trying to feel relevant OMG. 

On top of that, taking sexual harassment as validation, giving in to hook ups ever since I was 16 with the mindset that since I have an unlikable personality, at least he likes my body. Like wow. That was all so messed up!

And when I was doing all of these things I would kind of go numb- I would pretend I‚Äôm not a human being with feelings but just a body for them to use because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs meant to be. I would convince myself that it was what I wanted as well- just for the sake of keeping the guy around. 

It took for that abusive situation where I was putting all my worth into pleasing him to jolt me awake into reality. I DO NOT live to please men. My body is beautiful and no one has a right to touch it unless I want them to. My worth does not lie in my sexual performance or ability to keep a man happy. 

Also- who made having a man some sort of trophy? Who cares whether you have a partner or not? I get it, it‚Äôs amazing to be in love and have it reciprocated, but who taught girls like me to put all of our worth into it?! To feel like if we don‚Äôt have that life is meaningless??? There‚Äôs so much more to life than the company and attention of a man. SO. MUCH. MORE. 

Watch me get my Master‚Äôs degree, love myself unconditionally and enjoy my life until someone who‚Äôs WORTH IT comes along and changes my mind. I am over this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4l7t4/who_on_earth_taught_girls_that_male_validation_is/
62,n4lf1l,1620125636,Will he (35M) come back or have I (26F) ruined things permanently. Advice?,"Had been talking to this guy for a few months prior to the meeting. He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6 pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. The date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.He reached out asking how I am, days went by and I started to think that I didn't like it how I wouldn't know when I was going to see this guy again and that if it's not meant to be, it's all good. Immature but I sent him a text saying that I didn't like it how our two dates consisted at just his house and that I'm often left not knowing when I would see him again, I said I don't have expectations around texting.

He said he would talk to me the next day as he had a lot on his plate and he is sorry for not mentioning when he would like to see me again in the manner it deserves. I knew the answer wouldn't be good so I deleted him off my social media. He sent me a very rude message the next day saying I was immature, we ended up calling and he said that he thought he would be open to a relationship but he thinks he cannot provide what I would like. I then said to him that I've only met him twice and I'm unsure myself but I do like to know when I'm with someone if they would like to see me again such as 'this was great, when are you free next?' and weirdly he said he felt the same with me. He also said something along the lines of that he doesn't hear from me for days and is unsure of how I feel. He said forget the relationship talk, that he likes me and thinks I'm cool but he asked what my expectations were regarding texting and said he would like to see me again. He said we don't also have to be sexual when we catch up, we can be friends or anything. He told me that he's meanest to the ones he likes the most. He jokingly said that I'm so annoying when we were bantering over something.

The next day I said I would like to see him again but I would not pressure him but I understand if he doesn't as I don't want to waste my time. I apologised for blocking him. He rudely responded and said ""I don't want to deal with this f\*\*king bull\*\*\*\* right now,¬†name. I said I've been accommodating enough and to not contact me again.

1) What if she is not in my year?
2) What if she has a boyfriend?
3) What if she is way older than me?
4) What if she finds it creepy?

Back few years ago when I was abit immature, I went upto girls and started a convo, no problem, didn‚Äôt give a fuck, now 2-3 years later, I‚Äôm more serious, how do I get that confidence back I had few years ago?

So tell me, what is the absolute best way to approach a girl in the library. Is there a signal before doing so?

""Oh, this is another joke post.""

It's not. I'm serious.



My skills and abilities:

- l can hold a conversation. Not saying I'm the best, or we're guaranteed to have a life-changing talk, but I'm very well-capable of doing so.

- I don't watch porn and rarely masturbate. I'm also pretty fit, so I can last a decent amount of time with maximum hardness.

- I'm very understanding. Despite the shallow-nature of the the heading; I'm open to listening to any concerns you might have.

- I can offer emotional support as well. I understand we all get lonely. I understand sometimes you just need to be hugged/held. I'm also good at picking up hints, and I'm aware of when space is needed.

- I can make you laugh. 



What I'm looking for in a partner:

- Someone who can pay my rent (it's pretty low honestly)

- That's all. See? I'm not too picky.



Pros of dating me:

- You won't have to worry about me being unfaithful because I hate people.

- I'm a private low-key kinda person, and I'm not pushy at all.

Cons:

- I sometimes like being alone, and will want time to myself. (Not a lot, just a little)

- If ever irritated with you, I will distance myself; however, I'm mature enough to talk it over after a bit of time to think.

My phone isn't even a year old, Galaxy N20U. And in this last month I've noticed it glitches hard core especially if I write out a text paragraph (yes, I'm one of those) and then go to delete it. 

It doesn't delete it on the screen, but it shows it deleting at the suggested words line. It's really weird. Also, it keeps doing a symbol that is a mix of a ? with ! on top after certain sentences (but I don't know what/if there's a keyword triggering it) and I cannot find that symbol on my keyboard anywhere and I've also never seen prior to this last month.

This is concerning because I am 35(F) with no kids and ultimately single. I am dating, but not exclusive and am 100% honest about not being attached to just one of the people I'm dating. While I thought it was a mutual agreement, this has me wondering if something was downloaded by one of my guys while I was sleeping or away from my phone. I'm that honest that I have no problem with anyone going through my phone in a relationship or not. So this is entirely plausible and feels gross AF.

The conversation was nice. No awkward silences. He seemed to rub his finances in my face and show off his vehicle. I didnt feel any sort of physical chemistry. He ghosted me after I told him I was busy the following week with family plans. 

Date 2: may 2. This date was a 3/ 10. He picked me up and took me hiking. Great conversation, hr had two kids but that's not a deal breaker. He is 7 years older than me. No awkward silences but since things were closing early we had food to go and ate at his apartment and thats when it kinda went weird. His apartment was very dirty and dark. He didn't keep it clean. He also smoked 5 cigarettes through out the day. I would go out with him again but he did say he only dated older women, many times. He also said a racial slur while watching TV and that showed me he is probably a dick and racist. 

Date 3: may 3. This date was 8/10. Picked me up and took me for mexican. We work in the same place but different location. He is very career driven, and has a very impressive resume. We have alot in common and share some of the same things. He did say a couple of things that were weird. He kept mentioning going on trips to key west, Disney epcot, wanting to go to sephora, wanting to buy me a fancy purse for my bday, wanting to plan dates and saying he would marry me and give me a promise ring. The conversation wasn't awkward or anything just had to remind him that I'm not just going to go and travel when I have work and my life. And I'm not going to put out just because you tske me on a trip. 

All these guys have had great conversations but are not physically what I would go for. Sometimes I feel at a crossroads because I imagine myself having sex with them and I don't see it.

I was touched by the time he took to reply to me,give me advice etc. Despite the fact that we never spoke in elementary school,he was happy to reply back.

I cannot lie,my interest has peaked and I was interested in inviting him for a coffee.For context, we both went to a bougie private school.I am always true to myself but there is a certain climate of elitism and arrogance that stems for those environments.I want to ask him for coffee but how would a man feel about a woman initiating? My friends saw him on the tinder website meaning he is looking,but what proof do I have that he could be interested in me?

Why does no one use their camera properly? Like no seriously today alone iv'e left swiped several girls because their photo's were either so blurry that I couldn't tell what I was looking at or were intentionally taken at an obtuse angle where you can only see ten percent of their face. 


And don't think i'm just picking on girls here, i'm bisexual so iv'e seen plenty of photos of guys too. Granted guys photo's seem to be more to the point. A clean picture of their face with no stupid instagram hearts or obtuse angles. Though I have noticed a higher propensity of men hiding in group shots.


For the record i'm not picking on anyone for not having a good camera. I have a cheap lg phone. Yet my photo looks clean, because i'm actually in it and can hold my phone straight.

But it‚Äôs gotten to the point that I‚Äôm so depressed, tired, and on edge and I need to talk to someone other than the people I know because they‚Äôll just tell me things I don‚Äôt want to hear. 
Please just know that I need to vent. No advice needed. 


I like this guy a lot. And he likes me. But he said he can‚Äôt love anyone (even though he said he was able to love people when we met and even told me he loved me repeatedly for a period of time). I‚Äôm sure it has to do with his psychological disorders.

He loves sex, and only really likes being touched if we‚Äôre going to fuck. And when we do fuck he goes ham, which scares me. But I like it at the same time because I crave danger due to being so understimulated my whole life. I‚Äôd rather he push me past my limits than not talk to me at all. 

 This last time when I went to go visit him in Dallas, choked me to the point I hallucinated and entered a state of severe distress. I thought I was drowning because one of the times I was in the shower and the other time he wrapped a pillowcase soaked in water around my head and gagged me with it. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of breathing water up my nose but I went along with it to satisfy him. 


I keep coming back even though he has no respect for boundaries, and I‚Äôve lost so much respect for myself because of it. I‚Äôm so captivated by him. The way his mind works fascinates me and how he isn‚Äôt afraid to strangle and hit me in the bedroom. Ive passed out from his choking before and while it was scary and uncomfortable I want more of it. It‚Äôs a thrill that I never got before. I cried after he pushed me too far one time and he consoled me, but he said he wasn‚Äôt gonna stop after that ‚Äúbreather‚Äù, and told me to stop crying because it would turn him on. 

He‚Äôs a sexual abuse victim and suffers with psychotic schizophrenia and ASPD tendencies. I feel awful for him and I want to do what I can to help him. But it won‚Äôt be enough. Sometimes I feel inferior to him in general because he‚Äôs so independent for someone his age and I‚Äôm still living with my parents rent free working at a grocery store.

He‚Äôs found ways to put me down verbally. He says he‚Äôs just being honest and at least I know he‚Äôs being genuine when he actually does compliment me.  

I cried last night because of how hopeless I felt. I‚Äôm head over heels for this guy and care about him.

He took my claddagh ring and flipped it around after I explained that flipping it around meant I wasn't single (a romantic fantasy I have).

He kept making all kinds of blatant comments to indicate future hang-outs. 

Even though I think he's really hot, I can't fully enjoy what he's saying because it doesn't feel true or real. I understand flirtation and I understand getting carried away with it. But this was different. It was like this guy had a secret checklist of ""how to get a girl into bed"" and was checking things off down the list to get to the ultimate goal of sex. 

It was pretty clear that he wanted sex from the fact that he kept trying to convince me to sleep over. I've never met a guy who asked me to sleep over and then didn't try to hookup. So I knew what was going on. I didn't stay and I'm glad I didn't, because I didn't hear a word from him the next day, and I'm sure I won't hear from him again any other day. 

Why do some guys think this is ok to do? Do they not realize the type of damage this can cause to a young woman's heart? Pretending you want a legit relationship with them, just to get sex for one night? That's absolutely horrible. If I were the younger version of me I would have spent all day yesterday crying when he didn't message me. But I'm wiser now after having had this happen to me twice or thrice already. 

What pisses me off even more is that this guy is supposedly going through a really hard time in his life, battling demons and thinking he might need to get help. I love how he didn't even consider how what he was doing to me (fooling me, pretending to like me) might put me in a bad place and worsen my depression. That's why I don't always feel bad for people who claim to be in such a bad place. My bad places don't cause me to believe my emotions are the only ones that matter so then I can go use some other person's body to make me feel better about my life. I understand the concept of ""hurt people hurt"" but I find it hard to believe this guy had no idea what he was doing. It seemed pre-meditated from the jump. 

I guess it turned into a rant. But I needed to say it. It's got me pretty gloomy today. Mostly because he just reinforced some beliefs of mine that nobody actually truly wants to be around me in life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4r8gf/guys_who_lovebomb_for_sex/
95,n4rcbd,1620142646,Felt like I had a really a great time with someone on a nightout. But ghosted the next day. Why does this seem to happen so regularly at bars and clubs?,"Last weekend I went out to a club,  
I met a girl who I felt I really hit it off with. We were together for about 3 hours. We had a great conversation, she introduced me to her friends, there was heaps of playful flirting and towards the end of the night we began to kiss. I felt that the kiss was a lot more romantic than  just the standard sloppy nightclub kiss, I don't want to go into to much details but it did feel really intimate and we were cuddling a lot. Throughout the night I felt like we really got to know one another, and at the very end we went outside for a bit of a walk where It was more quiet and where we could have more of a deep conversation with one another. I did learn throughout the night that she had just gotten out of a 4 year long term relationship, and this was really one of the first few times she had gone out being single since her break up. She seemed like a really sweet and caring girl from what I could tell, and I knew that I liked her beyond a mere hookup. I told her I was really glad to have met her.  At the end of the night we exchanged details, before heading our separate ways.  


The next morning I messaged her , she gave a vague one worded response that didn't really make sense; before flat out ghosting me. I did feel hurt by this because I felt like I made a connection with an amazing girl the night before and it seemed like we did really have a lot of fun with one another. I also began to blame myself, because I felt like I had done something that could have put her off. Looking back at the end and speaking to others about it, it did seem like she was inevitably hurt through her breakup and  just went out to really forget about her previous relationship and have some fun.  She did ask me questions like whether I had been in a relationship before and I did tell her that I was after something meaningful - in which she responded she didn't know if she was neccessary after something like that. I did wish that I showed her more empathy to her break up and asked her more about it; but I just wanted her to have fun and didnt want to bring it up to make her feel upset.   


This girl does not owe me anything, and getting out of a LTR is a lot more hurtful than being ghosted by someone who you've known for a couple of hours. So i completely understand how she feels. But it does still sting, because  she was so nice and I do feel like I have done something wrong if she hasnt responded to me. I obviously am going to leave it and not continue to text her.   


I've noticed that these type of situation do happen a lot when I meet someone at a club or a bar. We will have a great time on the night. But in the next few days, when I try to take things further the other will either act disinterested and not respond tom my text, or they will be honest with me and tell me that they are not looking for anything serious.   


 For the record, I'm not desperate for a relationship either. I do love the process of just going out, meeting new people and having fun and seeing where things go. But I definitely do enjoy talking to people and getting to know them more through going on dates, rather than going out for the sake of merely finding a random hookup.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4rcbd/felt_like_i_had_a_really_a_great_time_with/

99,n4s0f0,1620144263,I think I was raped?,"This happened over a year ago and to this day it still hasn‚Äôt sit right with me. I was dating a particularly manipulative and controlling girlfriend. Due to her manipulations I was upset one day when she showed up I wanted to talk with her about it. She instead ignored me and began taking my clothes off and initiating sex. The entire time she was undressing me I was verbally saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äústop‚Äù out loud. She ignored me the entire time. 

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs thrown me off: she was my girlfriend. Of course I wanted to have sex. Of course I enjoyed it while it was happening. But the pretext was wrong and my emotions were totally ignored. 

While I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily consider this rape, it was certainly not consensual at the time and made me feel very wrong. None of this really registered with me until months later when I was with someone new and I had a panic attack of sorts and it eventually ruined things with her. I‚Äôve refrained from dating for a while now cuz I don‚Äôt think I have the mental headspace to. 

Can anyone help me with this situation? Has anyone had this situation happen? How do you address it? Is it worth addressing?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4s0f0/i_think_i_was_raped/
