96,p82bu3,1629454338,"Please Advise. 32M, 25F","I've had a crush on this girl for 3 years-and probably the only reason we never dated (other than going out) was because I was in the military, and every time I was home she had a bf, and vice verse. We're both single at present

My most recent ex was an amazing single mother of two, whom I dated knowing it wouldn't work out. She's amazing, likes me, but I 100% want more kids and she doesn't so we 
called it quits after I transferred.

Anyway I've been seeing the girl I crush on out dancing, and I feel conflicted. On the one hand I have liked her for a long time, we have friends in common and a great deal of mutual respect built up over the years. And-even though she in a way is just average looking, and me too-like I think she is smoking hot and I think she feels that way about me too. On both a physical and personality level.

Some other hotter girls have been hitting on me and I'm just not feeling it. I'm old. I don't even hook up any more. No joke-closest recently other than my ex gf were a few drunken nights of cuddling. So little different from fucking, just as good and far less bullshit. I just like this girl.

Problem is she's young and probably assumed after two consecutive nights  of me not trying to take her to bed, I'm not interested. I'm extremely interested, just very raw. I want to ask if she'd like to work out, cook with me, and take a walk. I don't want to fuck, yet. Maybe for weeks. I'm very happy with where I am in life, but it's been a long tour and I'm tired and raw. If it's not a hooker (and even that has been years) I just don't want to fuck.

I want to ask her exactly that-want to go lift, eat, and walk?

Advice. I didn't ask her tonight although we hugged maybe 6 times and I turned down a lot of women who probably were drunk or thought I was younger. I better ask her soon, or I'll regret it, she'll have yet another bf or some shit will happen.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p82bu3/please_advise_32m_25f/
97,p82l4y,1629455614,Dating a military guy experience?,We actually got on well enough that we’re  probably meeting next week (my work permitting/current vibe going on continuing as is ). But he (35/m) specifically asked me if dated a military guy before. Is it that different/drastic of an experience? I’ve dated a shady fed before so I’m not new to the “don’t ask me about work” but don’t know much else of what I potentially may be signing up for.,datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p82l4y/dating_a_military_guy_experience/
