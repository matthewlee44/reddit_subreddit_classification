I’m a virgin. I kissed one girl at a party a while back and I “sexted” with one other girl over the summer. That’s all. At university I’ve had a couple of opportunities to do casual things with girls but I haven’t gone through with it because I don’t find casual relationships appealing. 

In essence, I’d really like to find a girlfriend. It’s something I’m desperate to experience and it really gets me down that I can’t find a girl that I’m genuinely interested in. In addition, the idea of my first girlfriend having experience makes me uncomfortable. I feel very guilty about my experience with sexting as I wish I’d waited till I found a girl I really cared for.

What really bothers me is how everyone at uni seems to be really promiscuous. Two of my friends engage in casual sexual relations with other people and I often hear stories of similar things going on at parties. I really don’t want to have to be with a girl who engages in that stuff.

In addition, all the girls seem to just be interested in partying/drinking/taking drugs which is a major turn off for me. I have had substance abuse issues in the past so that is an absolute no-go area for me. Yet, it seems as though that’s all people are into. I really like nature, hiking, working out, art, writing and anime/manga. Everyone else just seems to enjoy partying. 

I’m starting to get really disillusioned with everything and it’s causing some serious depression at times. It’s so frustrating because with COVID the only activity there is to meet people is illegal parties which tend not to attract the kind of people I’m interested in.

Am I crazy? Has anyone else experienced similar issues? Also, is it fair for me to hold a potential partner to these standards?

We're not official yet but I can see it going that way and I feel good  about it overall. We see each other once or twice a week at the moment.

But  I do have one issue, she takes a fair while to reply back to my texts.  Recently, there's been instances where she won't reply until the next day. I find this confusing and hurtful. It makes me overthink and question the relationship like ""is she not that interested?"" I realize it's still early on, but surely you'd priortize someone you're exclusively dating to reply to their message?

I'd like to bring this up with her, but I'm wary on come off heavy-handed or scaring her off being too full on too soon. She has a high pressure busy job and so she can't always get back to me immediately, but it's the not replying until the next day that's really bothered me.

Based on texting there's some red flags, but in person we're going great, sleeping over at each other's places, going on dates, having great chats in person etc. So it's weird. Maybe she doesn't see the big deal in taking so long to reply? If I'm trying to be understanding, maybe she wants time to herself and doesn't see it as a problem to reply later when she feels like it?

How do I bring this up? Or do I bring it up at all at this stage?

I was thinking of approaching it by asking her what her thoughts are on texting and communication and let her know I don't want to make her feel pressured to respond to my texts but say that I'm a sharer so I like to keep in touch and I hope she doesn't mind. That way, I'm letting her know and giving her the chance to tell me how she communicates, without  lecturing or being too serious about it? What do you think?

Freshly single(ish) - it *has* been about 6 months, to be fair. Heart still aches, but I'm a lot clearer-headed, happier and excited about the future (whilst still missing 'my person' who isn't 'my person' anymore).

Had the courage to download Tinder again recently. I want to meet women naturally irl, but it's quite difficult because most of our country is locked down and I'm working remotely - the environment's not really conducive to meeting new people right now.

I'm finding I'm matching with some really attractive women, but just the other day someone gave me their number quite quickly from the app and then had a few back + forth's on Whatsapp, she ghosted. I left it a few days, sent a voice-note and got blocked LOL

\*\*\*

The main thing I wanted to talk about was this date that I went on once. Met this girl in a bar, she was with her 2 sisters and some friends. We hit it off, we were kissing all night, having a great time, buying drinks, dancing, etc. Her sisters approved of me and it was just general good vibes. We took each other's numbers down.

She ended up messaging me the next day (late afternoon) and we organised a date. Date was great, lots of flirting, touching, etc. but also was quite heavy. She was telling me about the fact that she'd miscarried a year or so ago. I felt touched, in all honesty, that she was sharing this with me. I took this to mean that I made her feel comfortable enough to share and I felt honoured by that. It got me quite emotional and I felt connected to her? I shared some stories of my own.

The date ended and she literally grabbed my neck pulled me in and we had a full-on french kiss for ages. One of the most passionate kisses I've ever had from someone that's not been my s/o. We had a few bitty texts back and forth on our respective routes home.

Never heard from her again.

Tried a couple times texting her with a bit of a window between messages and just...nothing. No, 'I'm working through some shit, sorry' or 'I'm not interested' 'no spark' - nothing.

So what could this be do you reckon? I find this behaviour really strange. I'm not a needy guy, I *literally* just want to get to know a girl, see if we vibe and then... date. It's starting to get really tiresome. Do you think it's because they have options and I'm low on the pecking order or.... what? I don't get it!

&amp;#x200B;

I find that any time I make friends with a woman the base reason I go up to talk to her in the first place is out of sexual attraction. I get to know her and she's a really fun person to talk to, and she's an interesting person. So after a while we become really good friends but my sexual attraction for her just does not go away. Most of my friends who are women are really REALLY attractive, and they see me as a good friend of theirs who they always invite to go out, always messaging me, just because they think that I'm not interested in them sexually. They always tell me how I'm one of the only guys in their lives who doesnt view them as someone just for sex and how they really appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But at the same time, I REALLY WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM, I always hold back my sexual desire so that they dont feel like I'm only friends with them just because they're hot. I become friends with them in the first place because of sexual desire but after getting to know them, I really do like them as friends but the sexual desire JUST DOES NOT GO AWAY.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I am a single mom and only had 3 partners in my life (3-5 years long relationships). I had my kid with the second one, and I left because of abuse. Growing up I was the ""golden child"" and in my teenage years I was the ""scapegoat"". I got physically punished as a child by my biological dad and my step-mother because other people around me did bad things, and I didn't stop them nor tell on them. On top of that, I often got blamed and punished for things I didn't do. **Because of this, I grew a huge fear of any type of aggression including hitting, screaming, throwing things, insulting, or just general loud arguing.** Even today, when I see any of those things (even if done to someone else) I get so scared, and I have to find a place to hide where I break down crying. Then I get nightmares for about a week. **When I have an issue with someone I get so scared to talk to them that I start shaking intensely.** These are horrible feelings, and I can't accept any of this in my life anymore. Most importantly, I can't risk my children being around that or even feeling like a fraction of how it makes me feel.

&amp;#x200B;

So now with dating, my problem is that I have a very strict boundary that I set for future partners. **I can't bring myself to date another person that is considering physical force as a punishment for my current and future kids.** I've tried it twice now. I had a child with one of them after they told me they would never do it because of my beliefs, and I walked in on him twice raising his fist at our child when she was 2 years old. Then the last one said he wouldn't hit our kids because we are in Canada and he thinks it's illegal, but in casual conversations, when talking about it, his opinion seemed that he would do it if we lived in a society where it's commonly accepted, and the thought of him eventually finding justification for it was terrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my policy is ""*tell me the truth and I won't punish you*"", and it works amazingly. My child only lies to me when she gets this fear that I would hit her (*I don't know where it comes from*), and we have a chat every 3-4 months about it to remind her she doesn't need to fear me. The goal is to build a strong bond of trust so that she feels she can tell me everything, and she has a safe environment in which she can make her own mistakes and has support if she does mess up. **My child values my opinion highly and she rarely ever does anything bad and never does anything dangerous.**

&amp;#x200B;

I really want another partner, I want a stable life for me and my kid, I want to get married, and I want to have more children. I don't understand why, but it seems like everyone around me is very vocal about how children need to be physically punished to be ""raised properly"", and they judge me for being completely against it. When I explain to them why I am against it, they say ""*you were an exception*"" and ""*normal kids aren't like that*"". They say that they did bad things as kids and they feel they deserved it, so they are going to do with to their children too. **I don't know anyone who is against physical punishments like me.**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been talking to this super kind and understanding man for the past month. I really felt a connection. He is funny, professional, hardworking, honest, and respectful. I was really attracted to him, and I am certain that he is attracted to me. But, last night my kid lied to me about something so I was going to have to punish her for the first time in a year (*didn't do it in the end because she was lying because she was scared I would physically punish her*). When I talked to him about punishments and if he would ever use physical force as a punishment, he was avoiding giving me a straight answer, but eventually, he did. **He said that he would only do it if he ""had to""** (*no other context than that which is really hard to judge because there is no strict set of rules, and I can't raise my children to specifically avoid doing that specific thing he would hit them for*). He also said that he would never do it to his wife?!? (*that in itself is confusing to me because he wouldn't hit a full-grown adult, but would hit a defenceless child who is in the process of learning what is good and bad*). I can't really go anywhere from here. **I can't gamble with my kids' sense of safety**, and **I can't risk ruining trust between me and my kids because I allow their dad to hit them**. I mean.. **I feel unsafe at the thought of being around him now**.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can I even find a partner that shares my views on this?** How would I be able to tell if they are lying just to be with me? I can't even bring myself to be in a relationship with someone that is unsure about this because if something happens to me then there would be nothing stopping them from doing it. There is also the whole thing where *if my partner uses physical punishment in front of me, then I couldn't even do anything to protect my kids because the law allows parents to hit kids to punish them.* I can't even protect my current child from her father and grandmother. **If you hold similar views, how would you handle this situation? Would you ever settle for someone that didn't share your beliefs? How did it affect your children if you did settle for less?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR --** I have a huge fear of any type of aggression including hitting, screaming, throwing things, insulting, or just general loud arguing. I shake intensely with fear at the thought of confronting someone about any issues I might have with them. I can't bring myself to date another person that is considering physical force as a punishment for my current and future kids. Because of the way I raised my child (without physical punishments) she values my opinion highly and she rarely ever does anything bad and never does anything dangerous, and I don't want to jeopardize this just because I want a partner. I don't know anyone who is against physical punishments like me. I can't gamble with my kids' sense of safety, and I can't risk ruining trust between me and my kids because I would allow their dad to hit them. *How can I even find a partner that shares my views on this when I can't even find a single person that agrees with me IRL?

She was popular and I just kind of flew under the radar, i guess you could say she was out of my league. It started off as me just occasionally looking at her in science class and at lunch time, she would notice sometimes but nothing would really come out of it other than a few conversations.

Eventually my old middle school added a new block where we would go into a classroom for 30 minutes after lunch to do homework or catch up on missing classwork, now in each of these classes there would only be around 5 - 8 people, and it just so happened that one of the few people to be put into my block was my crush. I was really excited and whenever the teacher would go to the office I would try to get her attention by telling a joke or saying something to start a conversation with the while class.

I remember one time she and I were partnered up together in this class, and I was so nervous the entire time, she gave me her pencil to use, I took it and my hand was shaking a bit the entire time that I was using the pencil. When we were finished she wrote her name right next to mine, which kind of made me smile inside. Now that I look back on it, I could have used that as an opportunity to get to know her better.

Eventually the pandemic hit and we all had to stay home, for the first few weeks there were no school meets, during this time I spent time pursuing some of my hobbies, but whenever i thought of her, i would go on Instagram and look at some of the posts she made. Experimental Remote Learning began soon after and I was totally taken by surprise and confused by that, so i had to spend most of my time focusing on that.

A few weeks later, all the girls are doing this body positivity thing on social media where they nominate 10 of their friends for being beautiful on their stories and those 10 friends have to nominate another 10 people on their stories with a picture of themselves posing, well she was one of the people to be nominated. When I saw her picture on her story i have to admit i liked what i saw, it was just a normal mirror pic but with her wearing a dress instead of something a little more skimpy, I thought she looked amazing in the dress and responded to her story with a fire emoji (the implication was that she looked hot). But I guess she either got creeped out, or mistook the meaning because the next morning I found that I was no longer following her and when I looked up her username, I could not find her account anywhere, implying that she had blocked me. I was devastated at first but then slowly got over it.

A few months later my old Instagram account had been hacked and so I was forced to make a new one. While I was following all the people I had been following on my old acc, I noticed that her account was in my recommended, so I decided to request to follow her again. She accepted and I liked all the posts that she had posted before i followed her again. She would eventually accept it.

Fast forward another few weeks and its June 2020, George Floyd protests and all that lovely stuff going on, and I see that she posted something on her story, i gathered up the courage and decided to respond to it. I did not really expect anything, not even a response, but an hour later i got a response from her, she typed “ahaha” and a laughing emoji, i responded with “I don’t get the joke” (the implication was that I did not know what she found funny) then she said wdym? along with something else that I can’t remember. I responded with asking her why she had found what i types in funny, and she just said that she does that a lot. I could have ended it there but decided to keep on chatting with her. for the next week i kept on chatting with her normally.

1 week later, a tragedy hits my family, one of my favorite aunts died. I was so devastated and my entire month was ruined from it, the last time i had seen her was so long ago. I only told two of my best friends and her, she was the one who texted me the most about it, i had many typos because my fingers were shaking and when i told her that, she felt so bad for me and tried to calm me down, she succeeded in doing that, something about the girl I like caring about my problems in life just healed me a little inside. This made me like her on a whole new level, it almost felt like love, i just wanted to embrace her and be with her forever. That night I thanked her for what she did and  she told me no problem and she was glad she could make me feel better, but she was going to bed, then I did something i did not think i would ever do, I texted her “ok, goodnight, angel”, from that day onwards me and her would text everyday for the next few months.

During the span of those months a few special moments between us would occur over text, we started telling each other good morning every morning and goodnight every night (but it was almost always me that said it first). I remember this one time, i sent her a picture of myself at age 4, and she was like, “awww, you were so littleeee” and after that I told her that she looked cute when she was little too, but i was afraid she would take that as me saying she was not cute anymore, so i told her “but don’t worry, you are still very pretty”, she said thanks but I apologized the next day out of fear that she would think i was needy. 

At one point she began to follow me back for a few days on Instagram and looked at all my stories, but then one day when i saw her at the park across the street from my house (she was at her best friends house, her best friend lives very close to me) i went up to her and said “hey, i know you” and she kind of looked embarrassed because her friends were right there next to her and she said “yeah, i know you too” really quietly. That same day she and her best friend unfollowed me in IG, i must have creeped them out somehow now that I look back.

Another time, she and i were texting about how she was going to california for vacation, and since i am a plane spotter, I asked her what kind of plane and which airline it was, she told me that it was United but she did not know what kind of plane it was, on the day she was leaving I told her that since she was flying on United from East Coast to West Coast, she was probably on a Boeing 737-800. She was so impressed by this and asked me how i could be so sure, I just told her that when you’ve liked planes for as long as i have, you start to know what planes operate on which airlines routes without even having to look.

When she was in California, I remember i asked her to send me pictures (not of herself, but of the places she was going to) but the only time she did send me pictures was when she had to evacuate her area because of the wildfires, when that happened i felt horrible for her and asked her if she was ok, to which she responded that she was.

When she had come back to from her vacation something seemed to change, she was texting me a lot less than before, i think i scared her off after I told her that she looked good in her new profile picture. eventually she even removed me from her follow list and whenever i would try to follow her, she would reject my follow request and whenever i asked her why, she would say that she didn’t do it.

But i guess one September day she had enough because when i texted her about a picture i saw of her holding a baby before i went to bed and how I thought it was adorable. The next morning i got a text from the star freshman basketball player in all our city where he said that she liked me, while at the same time getting a text from her saying it was not true and that they were hanging out together when i texted her. I texted the basketball guy that i was surprised that he had texted me and he said that he dated her, when i asked how long they had been dating (i never heard from anyone else that they started dating) he told me to stop texting him and to stop texting her too, when i asked why and told him that we were just friends, he texted me “I said stop talking to her and stop talking to me”. I was about to tell him to kiss my ass when i suddenly came to a realization, she told him to tell me that in an attempt to scare me off, so she could finally get away from me texting her all the time. I immediately deleted the chat i had from her and from the basketball guy and stopped trying to follow her. I was so mad, if she wanted me to stop texting her, she could have just asked, or just blocked me again, but no she decided to literally get a 6’2 guy to try and scare me off. Over the next few months i started to forget about it

Fast forward to just a few days ago. I for some began to wonder what she was up to now and requested to request to follow her. Basketball douche, had already been through two or three other girls since he got in between me and my crush, i think he is just dating girls to fuck them and then leaves them afterwards. Surprisingly she accepted my friend request and even looked at my story when she did. I still have no plans on ever texting her again and have been trying to get over her ever since the September incident.

So yeah that is my vent of almost everything that happened to me with my crush from my days of eighth grade to the middle of ninth grade.

I’m very attracted to him. He’s seems like a kindhearted person and is respectful and polite to me.

But he gets so nervous when we talk generally/ when we went on the date it is hard to get to know him. 

It was a later date, so most of the places we tried to go to were closed. He got frazzled. It was cute at first, but then he started to despair and be like “Ahhh I’m ruining this aren’t I? Sorry!!” And I would say “No, no it’s ok! I’m enjoying getting to know you!” No biggie, but he said that a few times and nervously talked a good portion of the date. He apologized again at the end and asked for a second “proper” date where he could take me somewhere nicer and do it better. I wanted to give him a hug, but it’s too soon haha.

He seems like a guy’s guy and that he doesn’t really know girls. He seems... kind of pure I guess. It’s endearing, but at the same time I feel like it’s harder to see if we have verbal chemistry because of it. It’s important to me that we’re able to banter and joke around.

My BFF for 13 years have as of November 2020, been with this i guy i cannot stand (for other reasons not worth disscusing here)
Ever since they started dating i noticed small things changing in my BFF’s atitude, and i thought to myself that something is not right. She begun to stop hanging out with me and was with him all the time. I know i sound jeluos but here me out.
Me and my BFF have been the closest of friends, always been through thick and thin, nothing could get in our way of being together, other than Him.

Around desember of 2020, my BFF and I got in a pretty nasty fight over a gamenight at her family’s house. LSS; I fucked pretty up, being a little more extra than i should have, and she wasn’t very happy with me. After the fight was over, we ghosted eachother for 2 weeks straight, and only at 2 am after 2 weeks of silence, she sends me a text, saying that she’s just really messed up, she misses hanging out but don’t know what to do anymore. I offerd to meet up the day after to talk about what happend and try to resolve it, but the next day when i sent her a text that asked if she would still meet me, but she declined, cus her BF was there with her. She was acting all «don’t text me»-vibes and i thought nothing really of it until a few days ago.

After all of that was over, i got more and more sus about the whole relationship thing. It wasn’t ass bad, but one day last mounth i got a phonecall from the BF’s phone, it was like 11:45pm so i wasn’t sure what this could be (keep in mind the BF and i aren’t good friends at all). When i picked up, it was my BFF calling from his phone, i noticed from her voice that she had been drinking, hard. We’re still pretty young both of us, so naturally i got scared for her safety and got down to where they were. There i met her, her BF and one other ass-hat i have history with. They were all shitfaced, pretty uncomfirtble situation for me (i don’t like alcohol i general). 

2 days after this took place i asked for her to meet me, since we haven’t been hanging out so much as we used to. She accepted and we met at our local supermarked (we live in Norway if anyone was wondering). She then told me she have been drinking a little before she got out. It wasn’t much, but enough for me to notice. We decided to head down to the soccer field and meet up with the boyfriend and some other people. But when we got there, the only person there were the BF, and when he saw that there was just my BFF and me, he faked a phone call and said he needed to go home, but went to the fucking gym. When he left, she broke down, telling me that this is just really fucked up. She hates that he gets mad at her, but her BF doesn’t like me, thinking i’m an bad influence on her or something like that. 
At that time she masseged him telling her that this was upsetting her that he lied to her face and how fucked up it is that she doesn’t get to hangout with the people she wants to but he gets to do just that. He told her that he left because of me, saying he wont be 1 meter near me, and tells her that she has to choose him, or me. She tells him that’s unfair, but he doesn’t listen. I straight up asked her why she was dating him if this is the way he treats her. She says she feels bad for him (he had pretty fucked up childhood and might be suffering from trauma) and that he is her BF and she doesn’t want him to feel bad. I told her they should talk anout this, comunicate that there is something there and that they need to resolve it. She says okay and heads home.

FF a few weeks and i haven’t heard from her and she then askes if i want to meet up and i ofc says yes. We meet up and she begins to break down and tells me that the fighting and arguments doesn’t get any better and (TW, SH) she was so stressed that she had cut herself on her thigh. I got so scared for her and fucking pissed at him. I tell her that this isn’t good, and that they probly should either talk about it more, or take a break. Worst case senario they end their relationship. She went home and i begin to wonder if this guy is gaslighting her..

Now.. the finaly. Around 3 days ago, i got a text from the BF asking in a rage why i have been sayingy to my BFF that he’s been toxic and manipulative. That i need help, the fuck’s my problem?!

I tried to explain to him that i was trying to look out for her, saying that i just got scared for her safety and all that. He berades me with thing like:

«You ain’t anything better! You drink all the time»
-which i don’t
«You smoke»
-it was a lit match for fuck’s sake
«that i gave her alcohol»
-funny to me that he don’t recall him and his friend got her fucking shitfaced drunk themselves and that the only alcohol i gave her was a tiny shot Vahalla.

I tell him this, and tells him that my intensions was to make sure she didn’t get hurt in anyway, and i said that i only looked out for her. He wasn’t happy with my responce and blocked my number. But 3 minutes later, i get a text from my BFF, saying something like;

«I’m sorry ____, but i think we cannot see eachother anymore»
«The fighting never stops»
«I’m so fucking tired»
«Why i’m i like this, this isn’t like me»
«I’m sorry, i’m sorry, bye»

And she blocked me on everything.. she chose him over me.

Do you even think about it? I’ve been on a “journey” with growing out my bush and last night was the first rendezvous I’ve had since I stopped shaving a few months ago. 

I went out with a guy (34) who not only was super quiet (I thought maybe he was shy/nervous), but barely asked me any in depth questions about myself. He kept saying how delirious he was from the day and how badly he felt, while continuing to yawn lol. I told him he could have rescheduled if it meant having more energy, but whatever. 

We did continue to hang out, next thing you know it’s 2 am and we’re back at his place. 

I have been spending the last several months avoiding having sex for multiple reasons. Getting over someone I was seeing on/off for a year, trying to stay focused on other aspects of my life, and mostly importantly, avoiding the stress that comes with hook up culture. 

We ended up having sex, he has the audacity to ask ME for head, but tells me he doesn’t like going down on “random girls”. Totally get that; oral sex can be intimate and freely giving it out isn’t always the move. But the double standard to expect me to give you a blowjob, while hardly even having foreplay with me, is just ridiculous.

We move onto the sex. We go through at least 3 condoms as each time he can’t maintain his erection. Instead of blaming the alcohol, he blamed the condom. Of course. Maybe DON’T use magnum (terrible brand every time I’ve come across it), and maybe DON’T tell me your dick is too big for them. 

He begs me to have sex with him with no condom. So, let me get this straight: you’ll refuse to give a “random girl” oral sex, but expect unprotected sex with the same “random girl”... Where’s the logic, y’all? That was my cue and I left. 

It was discouraging that after choosing to wait several months for my own peace of mind, I fall trap to another guy pulling the most juvenile behavior. Hookup culture is detrimental and with age I’ve started to realize how terrible it can be on the psyche and one’s emotional capacity.

I was  ghosted without even sending a message on Tinder or completely ignored  on Bumble. I had been using Tinder for a few years and didn't even get  any dates. Bumble has been awful for me every time, never had any kind  of success off of that app. I dislike the disingenuous nature of  the  bio and how fiercely competitive it is for men on these apps. I never  had the best appearance even when I practice hygiene and good dress. for  women that is a disqualifier. Often I have had to cater a lot to the  girl I was talking to since she had no interest in who I was. Every  match was a job interview.

I  figure my best shot at starting over with Tinder and Bumble would be to  get a new phone number without any metadata attached to it so I am not  fucked by the algorithm. I plan to get professional photos taken too.  The only problem is that I am an obese person who looks disgusting to  women and I will not be considered for that reason. It will take me many  months perhaps years to have the shredded physique I want given a  lifetime of being fat and I am already 24. Before you suggest I date a  girl my own size; I would for sure but even chubby girls consistently  overlooked me.

my  last problem is that I am just not a very interesting person. I have no  real fantastic stories. I traveled abroad once 5 years ago. I grew up a  sheltered dumb ass only child who never went to summer camp. I have a  lot of hobbies in front of a screen. I like mainly 90s music so that  guaranties no music connections with women. I never gave a shit about  trendy things like the office, and don't even use Tik Tok. I have no  social status with practically zero friends.

Met 8 weeks ago.

I progressed things, kissed her, and slept with her, only slept by her side.

She mentions her ex while laid next to her, the nasty comments he used too make to her, about her body.

Give her some reassurance and hinted it would be nice to wake up next to her, again, someday.

She took me to my exs a few weeks ago to collect my stuff, she mentioned in passing if I were to get rid of my 'bits of fluff' and fancied commitment, to let her know..

Last weekend, she came out with a story that she invited a guy round, she passed out on the floor, and werent fully confident she wasnt drugged. She ended up in bed with him, however, they still talk. I lightly touched on if it were for attention.. due to them still talking. However, on visiting an extra toothbrush has appeared at hers..

I left it there, no questions about the toothbrush. Out of the blue she accused me of jealously, which I denied, and replied with, I just thought you had more self respect, shes adamant, they're staying friends and have ""aired it out""

My mindset is now to avoid, but I want to let her down gently even as friends, feel like I'm picking up the pieces after her, she's becoming too overbearing not letting me input into conversation, the text monologue is a running commentary rather than a conversation, my last visit to hers, I clocked over an hour without inputting more than 3 sentences, of her endlessly telling me stories.

Just a reminder I’m 20M, in college, 6’2 and athletic. Although I’m in the process of getting rid of the quarantine belly lol. Anyways, I was having trouble talking to girls, like in general. Especially when it came to attractive girls. I’d awkward and quiet. Ugh, so much awkward silence. I just said a few days ago, “You know what, I’m gonna try to enjoy myself in conversations”. I was working about a 12 hour shift at the rec center at my school and was working with mostly female coworkers, who I personally think are pretty attractive. (I wasn’t planning on flirting with any of them. I shitted where I ate once, never again, nope!) 

I decided to use that day as practice. The first two were successful, I was just being myself more. Cracking jokes, more relaxed and I didn’t try to “win” them or anything. (I didn’t giggle and laugh at everything even when it wasn’t funny) One girl told me she was having a bad day (like close to a mental breakdown). I gave her a small bit of reassurance and she may not have said it, but I could tell I made her day a little bit better. (Note: This girl is definitely a girl that would make me fluster and overthink my words) Besides those two, the last shift was probably the BEST out experience I had this year at this school. It was the highlight of my loooong ass day. I worked with (let’s call her Emily) before and we had a fun time working. It was really laid back, I even told her that I could tell that she was cool. After we both figured out that we both are sorta quiet and rarely click with people immediately, we are in rare form. We’re laughing hard, telling scandalous stories, talking about hobbies/careers and now we got inside jokes. It was like I was talking a best friend. We even exchanged snapchats and instagrams. I feel almost free. Like I don’t need to posture and overthink anymore. I really like me and I can see that others like me too.

They're still technically together as partners in an open relationship, except she's seeing more people now, too. 

As she defines ""solo polyamory"", it is: ""a person who is romantically involved with many people but is not seeking a committed relationship with anyone. What makes this different from casual dating is that they’re not looking for a partner, and the relationship isn’t expected to escalate to long-term commitments, like marriage or children. More important, the relationship isn’t seen as wasted time or lacking significance because it doesn’t lead to those things.""

Hi,

I think I just need a virtual hug or reassurance/advice.

I (30F) was seeing this guy(29M) for 5 months. We agreed to keep things casual, and didn't date other people, I was happy with this. We liked each other more and more as time went by. In the beginning, I told him that I was happy to let things progress naturally. I think if you're talking to someone 3/4 times a week and seeing each other 2/3 times a month, you will undoubtedly get closer. We get along really well, and I genuinely enjoy his company. He is smart, intellectual, kind and funny. I sometimes felt like he kept me at arm's length, and whenever I brought this up, he would immediately adjust his attitude. So it was never a huge issue for me, I just didn't want to feel like I was chasing him. - talk to me if you want to talk, reach out if you miss me - that's how things work for me, though I understand that not everyone is like this. He's the type of person to regularly lose his phone/walk around with one shoe, whereas I'm very organised, so Ive never tried to make him into something else. I've only ever asked him to communicate.

For me, I cant get into relationships casual/otherwise without feelings, I need that intimacy.

Anyway - cue February, we met up in an apartment. I knew he was tired, and he seemed distant and like he didn't want to be there. It was a really sudden change, as things had been going really well. In fact, before we met up, it seemed like he wanted to get a little more serious, so I went along with it. for example, he was flying back in after a month away, and offered to come to my house straight from the airport, instead of going home. He knew my grandad had a stroke, and constantly checked to see how he was faring. He offered to bring my brother and I groceries when we were quarantined with covid. The journey back and forth would have taken him 3 hours. To me, those are things you do for someone you are serious about. He could just have easily stayed in his house and ordered us a pizza.

So, I was a little worried, about the change, in his attitude but didn't dwell on it. He said work had gotten extremely busy and he was trying to catch up. Fair enough. Over the next week and a half, I gave him some space, though when I did message him, including sending surprise nudes, he just seemed off and distant.

I will admit here that after 2 weeks of uninterested/distant messages I panicked. Everything outside my relationship with him was going to shit - family was getting sick, job is shit, my health was awful and I was having insane anxiety attacks, home life is really tough too. I was in a really bad place, and at the time, nothing was going well, apart from my relationship with him, so I held on extra tight, and I guess I got a little clingy, in wanting him to take breaks from his work and spend time with me. I panicked, because I was losing everything else around me, and I really couldn't bear losing him too.

After another dull/distant conversation, I asked him if we were okay. He said he would make time to come and see me, and I agreed. He came over, we spoke, he said he didnt think we were on the same page. He said he felt guilty for not being able to talk to me as much, he said he didnt want to end things about 4 times. Admitted there was really no difference between what we had and a relationship. I cried. I explained to him what was going through my head, and that I was just panicky. He was good, and things with him were good, so I focused my attention on that, because I was so miserable. I told him I would give him a few days to decide what he wanted.

A week later, he messaged me saying he had to ""loosen things up"", it was easier this way, he needed to focus on work and start making money properly (things have been difficult for musicians in the pandemic), and couldn't have any distractions. He didnt want to hurt me, apparently. He asked me if I wanted to meet up and have coffee the following weekend. I told him this break-up wasn't what I wanted, and I would rather have pressed pause on us. I wished him all the best.

The next day, I posted an abusive racist message that I received on social media- he immediately messaged me to ask wtf and share his concerns. I was quite cold because I was hurt. Two days later, he messaged me again and asked for help with his CV, for a bartending job. Again, I was confused, I had initially offered to help him with the CV 2 months prior, and he brushed it off, saying it felt patronising. Now, after dumped me, he needed my help less than a week later? In my head, this was just an excuse to keep talking. He has loads of friends. Why me?

Two days before we were due to meet for coffee, (5 days after break up), i was admitted into hospital for emergency surgery. I only told him about this when he asked if we were still due to meet, and I confirmed I was in hospital. He offered to travel 1hr30 mins to bring me supplies. I declined. I messaged saying I didnt understand this, he left me because he was so busy, and didnt want any distractions, and now offering to go out of his way for me. He brushed this off, saying we would speak when I was better. Why?

I was in hospital for 12 days, and he messaged me every other day, and called me once. On the call, he told me how worried he had been that I would hate being in hospital. For me, these actions meant he was going out of his way - we were speaking with the same frequency we would have if we didnt break up. I wasnt sure if he was checking on me because of guilt, or because he genuinely cared.

I kept thinking, how am I supposed to stop liking you and stop being hurt, if you're still here? You left me, so why stick around?

The day before my birthday (2 days after I left hospital) he asked how I was. I said I was fine, but frustrated because I didn't have full mobility/freedom. He empathised, said, ""take care and be patient"". I hated the finality of the statement, it felt like he was leaving again, and it made me cry. I was losing a lover and a friend, and it was so incredibly difficult. I didn't say this to him, I said ""lets have that talk you suggested soon"" and that ended the conversation. The next day, he realised it was my birthday, messaged me and we had a short conversation.

5 days later, possibly the longest I had gone without speaking to him, I wrote him a thank you text for taking the time to check on me. I was sending out thank you cards anyway, and i really just wanted to hear from him- if I'm being honest. He brushed it off, saying he was just being civil and there was no need to thank him. He had to stop texting abruptly because all his work deadlines were due the next day. At the weekend, I noticed on his social media, he had completed his deadlines and was hanging out with friends - great, I was happy for him. He deserved a break. But he seemed to chill with friends for about 3 days straight, and I was hurt that I hadn't heard from him.

So, 4 days after he met his deadlines I contacted him, asking if he still wanted to meet up, like he suggested - no worries if not. I assumed there was something he wanted to say or explain, as he had brought it up twice. He agreed, after telling me that he couldn't meet up on one of the days because he had planned another meet-up with friends. I don't know why I felt so angry/hurt, but I did. It wasnt so much that he was meeting with friends again, but it felt like I had fallen between the cracks. Where am I on the totem pole of his friendships? It not like I was expecting to be invited to his easter shindig, but why did I have to be the one to message and ask if he still wanted to meet up? it felt a bit like once he knew I was better, I was booted off to the far recesses of his mind, and he could carry on with his life. Once again, I wondered if I was chasing someone who wanted nothing to do with me. After being so caring, it was like a sudden change again, and I hated that. Its likely irrational, but that's what it felt like.

We met up last weekend, and spoke casually and playfully like we usually do. I explained again, that February had been horrific for me, but things were looking up. It was the first time in 8 months that I had been able to leave home without a bagful of medication!

I asked what he wanted to talk about - nothing. I decided to be assertive. I asked, when I was in hospital, did you message so much because you care, or because you felt guilty. He said he didnt feel guilty, but of course he would check on anyone who was in hospital. He downplayed it completely. I pushed back saying it wasnt just one phone call/text, and even when I was being cold, he ignored that, and kept checking. It meant a lot to me, and apparently it was the barest minimum to him. I personally would have messaged an ex, maybe 2/3 times max if i heard they were ill, and given them space, especially so soon after ending things.

I eventually told him I was hurt, and still had feelings for him. He told me he didn't want to leave and then he did. He decided I would be unhappy with his inability to communicate as frequently, and made his decision on our relationship based on that. I didn't even get to be unhappy because I was still confused by his change in behaviour. I said I hadn't even had time to process the break up because he left me, and then kept coming back to talk to me like everything was normal again, and then told me to take care when I was discharged from hospital. It was like he was yanking himself away again.

I said I wanted a set place in his life, I would happily come over to his house, and play video games or compete over who makes the best pasta or whatever, but how can I do that with someone who likes me but keeps me at arms length? I didnt think we needed to end things, I would gladly have found a middle ground/reeled my anxiety in, but I didnt have the chance to because he didnt even give me the benefit of the doubt. My feelings for him were never an inconvenience to me, but it felt like his feelings for me were an inconvenience.

He said things started to feel like we were in a relationship, and he couldn't see himself in that position. Fine - we agreed to keep things casual, but we both admitted that feelings have grown on each side, and we are increasingly attached to each other, so for me, the logic is why pull away? Its like he would do relationship-ey things of his own accord realise he was doing them and enjoying himself, and then pull back suddenly.

I told him I didn't yet know what kind of friend I could be to him, because I still have feelings for him but I wanted him to make an effort in being my friend. It would hurt me to see him move on, not strictly in a relationship, but just carry on with his life like i never existed. We love the same books/memes/music etc, so don't leave starting conversations up to me! We get on so well, we like each other more and more, the sex is great, we had a really great thing, so why pull away? I've been through some truly awful traumas, and great people are so hard to find. I think if you find someone who matches you so well, then hold on to them. Life is too short. I already find it difficult to make friends anyway, so I hold on to the few I have, and make an effort for them. I think that casual dating sometimes makes things more complicated than actual relationships.

He looked hurt but understood my need for space. I told him that he was easy to like, and would be easy to love- I already love him platonically. I reiterated that I was serious about having him as a friend, but I couldn't do that yet. I didn't say this, but I would genuinely go back to what we had at the drop of a hat. He is just the loveliest person and a true companion.

I kept apologising about not being able to be friends, and made my way home- I deleted him from bumble, blocked him from seeing my Instagram stories, in an effort to limit his access to me, and maybe make him feel my absence and set my own boundaries. Its been a week now. I cant stop crying. I think of him in the mornings, and I dream of him during the day. I'm working very hard to distract myself, but all I am thinking is that I hope he misses me too.

I'm finding this so difficult, and I just needed to get these thoughts out. I really do want him back, but I cannot beg him to be with me. I keep blaming myself and trying to figure out where things went wrong. If anyone has some kind words or advice or anything, please help, because I am just so lost at the moment. What do I do?

To be blunt, you’re boring. 

If you want to be successful on dating apps there are three ways. You’re very physically attractive, you have wicked social media content, the way you describe yourself makes you stand out. If you successfully combine the three then you’re op. 

What’s your angle 📐 ? What makes you stand out? How are you different from other men and why should women choose you? 

Your favorite food is pizza 🍕? Oh wow how original. Instead let’s say, “If you’re not trying to go into a cheese coma eating a pie with [insert fav toppings here] are you really the one?” 

What you’re doing here is showing not only what you like but also your personality! Which is soooo important. 

Stop uploading pictures of you holding a fish. If you’ve done this, we gotta talk. Instead have a clear photo of you cooking it in a clean kitchen or roasting it over a fire at a flattering angle. You know what they say, a picture says a thousand words, and babes that picture is saying a lot. 

If your social media 5 photos and most of them are from years ago, blurry and really bad filter, then do. Not. Bother. Linking. Your. Instagram. It reflects poorly on you. 

Whether you’re hot or not, upload your best clear photos of you, and just you, and if you have ONE of you with a group or friends put that up to. It makes you less creepy. 

Link your Instagram if it has good, clear, and interesting content about YOU. It’s all about the quality. 

Finally talk about yourself on your dating profile like your Apple trying to sell the next iPhone that pretty much has the same features. We know it isn’t different but it still seems cool from how they describe it.

I know dating and sex isn’t for me so I just decided that I’d rather not have to have my heart shattered any more.

About a year and half ago was seeing this girl. It lasted about 3 and a half months and then all of a sudden she went ghost for a couple of weeks acting weird and then ended it because “it wasn’t a good time for her”. We didn’t see each other for about a year and a half and barely spoke.

The end of February I texted to see if she wanted to get lunch and we ended up meeting up for lunch. It went great but she was asking a lot questions about who I had dated since we ended it, did I want kids - even saying she felt like she was running out of time to have kids (turns 29 in a couple of weeks). That weekend she hit me up to hang out and we grabbed dinner.

A couple of weeks later we got dinner and we’re hanging out at my place and she starts saying how she ended something in like October and didn’t want to rush into anything. I said ok no problem let’s just hang out and see what happens. Then two days later hits me up to hang out again at her place and things escalated from there. Right before she went starts acting weird right before she went on vacation and we didn’t see each other for almost three weeks. 

Fast forward to the other day we were hanging out and something was clearly wrong so I asked what’s up. She said she tried and doesn’t know if she sees it going anywhere romantically and that if we kept going and it didn’t work we’d never able to be friends. I called her out and said “you didn’t really try you did the same thing as last time. The second it started to get serious you disappeared.” She said her ex is trying to get back in the picture and she doesn’t know what to do with this and that situation. At that point I started to just lay out how I felt about her that I had been holding in for awhile. She said “why does it feel like we’re breaking up” which I said “if it feels like that than maybe there’s not nothing here” which she agreed with. It ended with her saying “where do we go from here” which I responded with “I really don’t know”

I am a male in my late 20's and this is simply my perspective.

The confusion is that men take things quite literally. When a woman says they hate today's hookup culture, a lot of men confuse this to mean women don't want sex. They believe that instead of making a move and gently leading the interaction towards sex, they should instead talk to them and get to know them as friends and maybe later on in the future sex can happen. They think the women will give them the thumbs up like, ""Okay buddy, you've done enough to earn my attraction. Time for sex."" Women don't think like this at all. They expect you to be the man and make the move. When you do not make a move after several dates, they'll think you're either not into her or too weak to make a move.

Women *do* want sex. Probably more than men do. What they're really complaining about is how juvenile today's men could be when it comes to sex. Today's men go on dates and *expect* sex but don't do enough to make her feel heard, understood and most importantly safe. Sex is something that naturally happens when two people who are attracted to eachother are having fun and feel safe and comfortable enough to share their bodies with the other. Sex is not bad.

Just a reminder I’m 20M, in college, 6’2 and athletic. Although I’m in the process of getting rid of the quarantine belly lol. Anyways, I was having trouble talking to girls, like in general. Especially when it came to attractive girls. I’d awkward and quiet. Ugh, so much awkward silence. I just said a few days ago, “You know what, I’m gonna try to enjoy myself in conversations”. I was working about a 12 hour shift at the rec center at my school and was working with mostly female coworkers, who I personally think are pretty attractive. (I wasn’t planning on flirting with any of them. I shitted where I ate once, never again, nope!) 

I decided to use that day as practice. The first two were successful, I was just being myself more. Cracking jokes, more relaxed and I didn’t try to “win” them or anything. (I didn’t giggle and laugh at everything even when it wasn’t funny) One girl told me she was having a bad day (like close to a mental breakdown). I gave her a small bit of reassurance and she may not have said it, but I could tell I made her day a little bit better. (Note: This girl is definitely a girl that would make me fluster and overthink my words) Besides those two, the last shift was probably the BEST out experience I had this year at this school. It was the highlight of my loooong ass day. I worked with (let’s call her Emily) before and we had a fun time working. It was really laid back, I even told her that I could tell that she was cool. After we both figured out that we both are sorta quiet and rarely click with people immediately, we are in rare form. We’re laughing hard, telling scandalous stories, talking about hobbies/careers and now we got inside jokes. It was like I was talking a best friend. We even exchanged snapchats and instagrams.

LONG STORY! I highly appreciate those who will take the time to read my ridiculous story and give me some advice. 

I'm 24f and he's 26m. Back in Jan, he super liked me and we matched. He asked if I was free to hang out and grab food. We did. Went to his house after and made out. After that, he texted me and asked if I was home and asked to hang out again when I'm free.

Been seeing him for 4 months now. 

I work full-time during weekdays whilst he does freelancing and works from home. We used to meet twice every week, I ask to meet him and have dinner out on a Wednesday whereas he would to be the one to ask to hangout on a Saturday (usually we grab food, make out and spend the night walking around and visiting shops).

We flirt here and there, he always asks in person whether I enjoy hanging out with him and such. He trolls a lot though. Sometimes when I ask simple questions such as ""what gym do you go to?"", he would just be ""playful"" and give me a fake name. It also seems that he's not comfortable with silence and always wants to keep the conversation going to make sure he doesn't ""bore"" me.

Like I said, usually I ask to meet him on a Wednesday. But just last week, I didn't ask him as I was quite busy. We text everyday but I didn't brought that up or tell him that I wasn't free. I just left it and assumed that he'll ""get it"". And weirdly, after that, he didn't ask me to meet that Saturday either but didn't give me an explanation. 

This week, we did go out for dinner on Wednesday as I initiated it. He agreed but was 10 mins late (for the first time! He would always be earlier than me). We would always have a long walk right after dinner but suddenly he told me that he had to go home to get some work done (bitcoins lol) and said he felt bad but hoped that I'd understand. He told me ""it's not because I don't like hanging out with you, I just get anxious over this"". I told him ok I understand. I mean I wouldn't want him to shit his pants and panic over it while hanging out lol.

But that's not the problem. The thing is, because I asked to meet him on that day already, it was ""supposed"" to be his turn to ask me out this Saturday! But he hasn't. I tried to give him a hint and asked him what he was doing tomorrow and he said he's going to ""workout"". I stared giving half-asses texts after but he still tried to keep the convo going with ""jokes"" and random comments. 

What is his deal? Is he just trying to string him along? It would be helpful to get a guy's perspective. Recently, I joked and said I met another guy and he was quite upset about it and said he doesn't like when I make those jokes. I'm so tired of mixed signals.

If I stopped dating now, maybe I will feel less hurt in the future. I don't know.

I just don't know what to do. I'm 22 and I don't want to waste my life in a country without long-term opportunities and a low standard of living.

Just want a second opinion on this from someone that is not my friend so i can see my situation from a different POV

I met this girl on Tinder back in July last year and we hit it off the park that she gave me her number after a few hours of talking, we realized we had a lot in common like music, hobbies, likes and dislikes the whole thing, i noticed she even deleted her Tinder account, we would facetime and give phone calls to one another for quite the time, she told me she really liked me and that other people are pretty dry when talking to her and I was different from the others and she genuinely liked me, we even planned on going on a date as to which we both agreed, but our schedules really didn't add up, we are both 20 year old's and are pretty occupied with school and work but we still kept in touch and talked every now and then that we had the chance, then we both got really busy, myself with school and work and same with her and i know because i saw her IG stories and they all lived up to the truth plus she is very serious about her studies she is going to UCR next year, after that the trail kind of went cold for about a few weeks...

Then i got into a car accident back in September, got T-boned by a drunk driver, nearly died and the whole thing was crazy overall but she did reach out again while i was in the hospital recovering checking up on me and so for the two months i was in the hospital, yes it was that bad, something i don't wanna relive again :(

After i got discharged there really was no form of texting or calling just us watching one another's IG stories, she still watches them till this Day 

2 weeks ago i had this Dream and she was in it and left me with the ""What If.."" thing in my head and i really wanna reach out again but something inside tells me its too late or she probably doesn't remember me that well idk just negative thoughts basically lol 

I know her Birthday  is next month, keen detail i still remember till this day about her and wanted to use that to reach out but it just doesn't seem right at all so I'm not sure what to do here, Maybe i should just move on? idk any advice here would be gladly appreciated",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,713455,public,self,Should i reach out again???,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mqj4ub/should_i_reach_out_again/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I have full custody of my children and they would come along with us. 

Recently she has been expressing how she came to some realizations and it seems the relationship is on the fence (again). 

I'm under the impression that whenever it comes to big changes, she chooses to bring up some negative things that have happened in the past to the present then reverse it on me when I give valid points on the pros. 

She basically said I do not fulfill her emotionally but I compare it to filling a well with a cereal bowl. Its hard to fill in a short period of time.

Should I end it because she made it clear her feelings are wavering?

It’s not like I ever even looked for him I would just be like wait where’s he at if I didn’t see him. since i’m about to graduate i’m in a fuck ton of highly concentrated classes meaning they’re small and the people repeat. well this semester we have 3 classes together. he’s always been the one to answer the teachers questions and be attentive and have intelligent answers so when it came time to pick a partner for a project, I chose him. also partly bc I wanted to get to know him bc he’d always drawn my eye. then today the day we present 50% of our grade he shows up to our meeting a few hours before with his excel stuff (which was kinda complicated and I’d already done 90% of the other shit that’s extremely complicated) and has no idea how to do it and didn’t seem like he was going to find it. let me note that I didn’t sleep last night, and I’ve pulled an all nighter every other night since Thursday. I’ve maybe gotten a total of 15 hrs if sleep since Thursday and,,, he knew that. kid was fully aware how badly it was affecting my emotions too. I couldn’t stop crying for 4 hours straight yesterday I was so exhausted and still had endless amounts of work to do and I was honest and told him that and said it would be a little till I could start today and if he could he some progress on the comments. bc in addition to the 10pg excel sheet with at least 100+ lines and 20+ columns of calculations we had to explain every. single. line. some of them were based off ur own personal judgement but I clearly laid out ones he could easily do. and he didn’t do them until after the presentation which they’re late. I still haven’t even started my comments because I planned to do them on zoom in the meeting we had but I had to spend the whole time holding his hand and walking him through it for him to end up 30 mins before we have to present saying he can’t get it and he might take the L. I’m very serious about my studies and could afford to miss 10% of it but he knew that as well. so thankfully my best friend is in the class and her partner has had major health issues for the past couple months so we both basically did it on our own but together and I immediately had to end the zoom call with the guy when he said that and called my friend to ask her to send it and all that comes out are endless uncontrollable tears. 20 mins before the class I give the presentation. thank god she is the literal best friend ive ever had and I’m so lucky to have her she sent me her template for that multiple so i just had to plug my shit in. he was also supposed to do the slides (all not just his bc u ended up doing more work in excel and that was the deal) and I’m glancing over the slide deck right when the class begins and thankfully there were a couple people scheduled in front of us, but wait it gets better. We are almost done with the second group presentation and all the sudden the person going on between them and us had technical difficulties. I was literally adding the final thing as they were waiting for me to share my screen.
