Me and this girl, who for privacy’s sake we will just call tori, have been friends since 2019 when we were both seniors in highschool. We met at a school dance and kissed but nothing ever happened and we stayed friends.  Both of us had a series of crazy events happened in our lives that we helped each other get t through. 

She had not one but TWO horribly abusive relationships, as well as numerous other things that I would sort of be there and help take care of all the fallout of. 

When I was addicted to drugs she was one of the only people to help me sober up. When I broke both of my arms she would always be there to kind of help “be my arms”. Up until this last may, I was splitting time between Pennsylvania and Florida. And since the breakup of her second ex (which ended in her ex threatening to kill both of us  even tho we hadn’t ever had sex) we both have started to grow closer. We hang out all the time now and we talk to each other about our childhoods and fav memories and the vibe hasstarted to change between us I feel. I can’t really tell if she’s into me, but we are always “accidentally touching” and she always has this beautiful big dumb smile whenever she looks at me but she also is constantly (indirectly) saying things like (it wouldn’t be fair if I started dating someone right now because I don’t know that I’ve dealt with everything yet) 
 
We’ve been friends since 2019 but only now is she sitting in my bed on a nightly basis and I feel like she wouldn’t be bringing up the concept of dating with me if the thought hadn’t at least crossed her mind. 

She told me last night tho that when she feels herself or other people start to get attached she panics and self sabotages.

She replied back that she’s not sure bc she’s busy with finals 

Is she turning me down? Was it wrong of me to assume that she wanted a second date? Did I scare her off when I asked her for a second date? 

I can’t help but feel that she was nicely rejecting me. This is my first date since June this situation has got me very anxious.

He had messaged me first quite a few times before I had responded. I then realised it was a few months and I hadn't responded so I messaged him. We spoke for probably a whole month before the meeting. He has offered breakfast/study dates before too. We ended up going out for dinner. Had very good chats, seems like a really lovely guy and nothing sexual. The odd compliment, but in good taste. Some cute messages to each other, like him sending me photos of what he does for work and him telling me that he often thinks about me. He told me he was a bit nervous before picking me up. He picked me up from my house and before he got to mine, he texted me saying would I like him to meet my parents or just pick me up. He paid for dinner and it went really well in terms of chats, felt like a really caring and respectful guy, talked about family and all those nice things. One thing is that he takes great interest in my life and wants to make things easier for me (or so it feels at times), for example wanting to help me out with studying etc.

He dropped me home and did not indicate anything about going back to his which was good. He asked if I would like to do this again and I said yes. When we got back to my house to drop me home, my mother was just coming home and he waited and said hello to her. He then said she was lovely. I could tell he wanted to kiss as he sort of just kept looking at me, I said something and then we kissed. He messaged me a few hours later thanking me, kept in on and off-contact for the week, he told me he was tired but good. He asked about my plans for the weekend and I did the same, he is very busy and works in the medical field. He hasn't mentioned anything about catching up again. He asked about a job interview over the weekend and I didn't respond till about 5 days later.

In one of our messages, I sort of implied that I wasn’t sure when I would be seeing him next and he sent a sweet message saying he hopes to get to know me better and see where things go. That he was busy but should have more time once exams are finished and that he does want to see me again. I told him I supported him and that I don’t expect him to keep in contact.

Then almost 4 days later, I sent a message saying that it appears this is all too difficult and that I’m sure he can find other willing participants but it’s not going to be me. Exam is in 2 weeks and I would have loved to have hung out with you after. I realise I have been hot and cold. In about 2 weeks I’ll have a lot more time but I’m going to ask you to wait” and then asked me if I want to study with him (this was September I believe) we wanted to study this weekend. I said after his exams is fine and he said that’s very gracious of me. I didn’t respond. I left it and gave him the space to Then about 2/3 weeks later; he asked how I am, I didn’t respond and he sent a follow up message. Anyway I don’t have much to complain about and things feel good but we’ve been extremely busy with exams and he told me he has to resit; he initiates a lot and has initiated predominately. He'll message, we'll talk for a bit and then maybe I won't respond if it doesn't require a response and then he'll send a follow up message asking about something. He asked about studying together and some other question. I responded saying after my exams which were end of last week. He didn’t respond till about 2 weeks later asking how my exam study was going. Unsure if he did this because I had done this to him when he had exams. We chatted about a week ago now about something, few laughs but nothing concrete. He hasn’t asked to see me since exams. Growing frustrated because yes I could ask him to catch up but I already indicated after my exams and they finished not this Friday but the Friday before. Find it strange too how he’ll leave the conversation for a week or so but if he messages me and I don’t respond, he would send another message. We laughed about something and that was last on the 10th, I was the last one to respond and hadn’t heard anything until he responded to some story of mine about purchasing an apartment which was almost 2 weeks later. I liked the message and he messaged again asking if I bought it and told me he passed exams. I suggested we should go to the beach/study together and he said his body isn’t beach ready yet and asked me a few other questions, asking where the apartment is etc.

He travelled over 2 hours to come and take me on a date which was really good and we did end up getting close but didn’t sleep together, before the day he had been calling me everyday and texting me everyday too. The day after our date he said how he had such a good time and was already looking forward to seeing me again.
This was on Thursday but we haven’t spoken as much as we usually do, I dropped him a text yesterday to see how he was and he said sorry he hadn’t messaged me earlier he had been working as he was hungover Thursday from our date so didn’t get a lot done and he was just chilling at home with family.

I don't know if I'm just looking for support or for advice so both are welcome. I dated this girl for a few months, she told me about some sexual experiences she had and I kind of felt insecure about it and at some point she asked me if I was looking for a relationship or not. I was, always have been, but I guess my feelings started to be stronger and didn't want to get heartbroken again so I told her I didn't know, maybe I wanted the same experiences she had before committing to one person because I figured, at least if we actually start something I'll feel we're at the same ""level"" (stupid I know but bear with me).

Anyway we kept seeing each other but after a while she started distancing herself. I asked her why, she told me because she didn't want to do ""halfway"" so I asked her if she didn't want to see me again but she said nope, I still want to see you but I also need some space so I don't get hurt and that we would discuss a potential relationship only once I got this stuff out of my system. I did **not** date anyone else throughout this, let me be very clear. A week later she went back to her family. Fast forward to yesterday (so \~10 days after she left) I sent her a video (felt it was the best way to convey what I wanted and let her watch on her own time instead of having a call) explaining how I felt, why I wasn't able to fully commit in the beginning because of this stupid insecurity but that I realized how silly it was and that nothing would make me happier to start dating each other exclusively because we have amazing chemistry (to which she agrees).

This morning I find a long ass text with the usual ""it's not you, it's me"" BS where she clearly states she's not sure anymore she wants a relationship and that I'm great, bla bla, I'll find someone. Needless to say I'm in shock. I immediately thought she probably fell for someone else so I didn't insist, just asked her if she means she doesn't want to see me again, even as friends and she said ""no of course, we can hang out as friends but only after a while because we need to forget"". Alright, I understand, first thing I did was to unfollow her on Insta cause that's one of the first steps I take when I want to get over someone. After an hour she asks me ""did you really unfollow me on Insta??"" and now I have no idea what to say.

I guess I just need someone else's perspective on this because I'm fucking clueless and I'm totally unsure what I should/can do or if I should just ignore her and move on. I understand she might be taken aback by this sudden 180 deg flip so I want to be careful about conveying that I really want this and it's not out of loneliness or whatever other fleeting emotion that will lead to me changing my mind a couple of weeks later.

He picked me up from my house and before he got to mine, he texted me saying would I like him to meet my parents or just pick me up.

I know that doesn’t seem that long but she’s my first girlfriend so kinda a big deal for me. 

Our relationship was going so well at the start it seemed like she genuinely liked me and she initiated lots of steps in our relationship. 

Then one day I hung out with her and she seemed so uninterested in me. She’d still tell me she had fun and would try and stay with me as long as possible but I could just tell she was uninterested in me. She didn’t ask to hold my hand like she used to or kiss me for nearly as long. And she didn’t want to do anything we just drove around.

So at this point I feared for our relationship but hoped it was just a one time thing then the next time she hung out with me it was the same. Then a week later she broke up with me.

I feel so hopeless and worthless as a person. She’s been in a past relationship for much longer and the guy broke up with her. I wonder what I did wrong and what’s wrong with me as a person. And I don’t understand why she started acting so different, before she seemed to really like me and we had a great connection and chemistry. 

And I feel bad about this but I also wonder how someone could be so cold and distant. She left me open on Snapchat so it’s clear she doesn’t want to keep snapping me like we used to. I’ll probably never talk to her or see her again and it’s by her choice. How could she go from liking me a lot to being content with never hearing from me again? I could never do that to myself or the other person.

Based on this why do you think she broke up with me?

However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I’m finding it really hard to move on.

I’ve been taking to this girl for a month I really like her.It went great we went on dates she came to my place many times so did I.It’s great so far.Recently she’s been slowly canceling plans and all she wants to do is stay in bed and watch movies with me.She also told me she’s not in the best mental health state and I can tell she’s depressed generally.I don’t mind staying at home all day but when we do she’s so low on energy and in a bad mood and it fucks me.After 3 years of high functioning depression I finally decided to make a change in my life but now being with her is pulling me back and making me worse and it feels like a lot of weight.

However, I really like her and no girl has ever showed this much interest in me for a while so I’m lost. Also I feel like o won’t get any other chance in relationships or love after this because of how low I am generally and unmotivated for things.I really understand what she’s going through like I felt the same at points in my life.So her wanting to be alone sometimes is understandable.It’s just I overthink too much and I have anxiety.So when she says she doesn’t want to go out and she’s sad I feel like it’s my fault and that she hates me or I’m pressuring her too much.It sucks really but I can’t stop my brain from going to these places.

So should I text her and ask her if she sees this going anywhere because I’m starting to feel like she’s losing interest.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130203,public,self,Maybe I should leave,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3faf2/maybe_i_should_leave/,no_ads,0.0,,,

He uses his own photos, definitely uses his real name and lives where he says he does. 
But, His photos never truly show me what he looks like though. They're always filtered and taken in such a way. But I like him enough to overlook the fact he may not be as good looking as he appears in photos. I've sent him 100s of photos that show him exactly what I look like. 

We both live in London , I am in central west and he is in the south east. So only around a hour from eachother at best, so we aren't what I'd call long distance.  
I'm 21 and he is 25.  
We both work and I also go to uni so we are both quite busy. We've been talking online since September 20th and recently moved to phone calls which last up to 4 hours. So anyway 10 days ago,  We organised to meet on the 12th December at winter wonderland in hyde park.  It was my idea, so I paid for the tickets and extras coming in at about £50. He said hed pay for drinks snd food, I thought that seemed fair especially given he has to travel an hour to hyde park and its basically across the road for me. he agreed to meet me and seemed very excited. The day after organising everything he started saying his sister had covid and he felt like he was getting it. He took some tests and he was fine. Then 2 days ago he messages me saying he has covid and has to isolate for 10 days.  Which yes leaves enough time before meeting but he is making a big song and dance about my rather weak immune system a gift from being a premature baby. So we basically agree not to meet. He never offers to pay for the tickets, nothing. Which I thought was pretty shit given he earns 3 times what I do and is very successful in his career (yes he really does what he says, found him I'm on LinkedIn and has over 100 connections) everything adds up as far as I can tell but I feel like he is avoiding meeting me. He spoke to me for 4 hours on the phone last night, granted he sounded a little sniffly,  but didn't cough or sneeze or blow his nose once the entire time and seemed completely fine. We stayed up till 4am.

We hit things off immediately at a party, talking all night until both of us blacked out from alcohol. Nothing romantic happened that night but it set the path for what came next. We started texting all day every day and after a few days started hanging out after work, all day and all night. We took things slow, first kiss on the second date. Make out on third and fourth. Nothing ever passed laying on the couch together though.

After the fourth date I went on a work trip (7 days) and things started to change. Before I had left we would talk nonstop throughout the day, usually talking until 2-3 in the morning. With the time change and distance so early into the relationship though things were different. We still texted all day but our convos were a lot less involved and FaceTime never really passed the 2-3 hour mark. She was going to parties while I was gone and after getting drunk she told my friends that she was concerned that being in a relationship with me would hurt her friendship with her other male friends. (She told me originally she wanted the relationship, not me asking her.) She also believed that our relationship could hurt our work performance. We don’t work in the same office but we do work somewhat close for the same company. For some reason my friends actually agreed with her (maybe they are right, idc) one of them even drunkenly told her I was a virgin for some fucking reason.

A few days after the whole party stuff she told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship right now. I handled things well, we had only been talking for a monthish so it wasn’t the end of the world. Although I was hurt I just told her I wouldn’t be mad at honesty and that I’m glad we tried. That night my friends told me about the party and what was said, all the good and bad about me. The next night I flew home from the work trip and tried to be positive. I knew either one of two things were true. She truly didn’t want a relationship right now or she didn’t want one with me. I chose to believe the first one.

I called her later that night and told her how confused I was. She said she was being honest and she just couldn’t do it right now, wouldn’t tell me why though. After that things were okay, we spoke for 2 hours on FaceTime before she left for a party. I asked if she would mind if I showed up (my friends were there.) She said she would get drunk and kiss me and she didn’t want that, so I stayed home. Around 10 she called me and asked for a ride because she didn’t feel comfortable staying at the party house and her dd fell through. I picked her up and took her back home, and this is where things get juicy.

Being drunk, she finally started opening up. I’m not sure if I’m a dick for not telling her to shut up but whatever. She told me she just got out of a relationship with someone who was cheating on his girlfriend. She was super ashamed that after she found out she was the ‘side-chick’ she didn’t end the relationship right away. She told me how she doesn’t deserve someone who treats her right and she said she needs time. She was extremely hard on herself and told me about how much damage relationships had done to her recently. Around 2 in the morning I decided it’s probably best to not let her tell me everything about her life while drunk so I walked her up to her front door and gave her a fist bump. (I tried for something that she would remember specifically as not intimate because of the whole kiss comment earlier.)

Next day I called her and told her how I care and that I’m always here to talk to her and she didn’t even remember what she told me that night. Now I really don’t even know what to do. I’ve been talking to her daily, (Im gone again btw, at home for thanksgiving week) FaceTime and texting but it seems like we are going down the friend route hard. I invited a couple of my close friends over to watch a movie tomorrow and only after they said yes did I invite her. I made sure to tell her my other friends would be there and I just wanted a friendly movie night. She told me she would give me an answer later.

Now I guess the question part of my post. What the fuck do I do next? I really care about her, I’ve never spoken of anyone for 8 hours straight days in a row. I’ve never felt this much about anyone my whole life. I want to tell her these things but it seems so selfish to do so after she said she isn’t ready for another relationship. I haven’t moved on yet and I just NEED to know if I should. If I tell her these things and she says it’s never going to happen I won’t even be upset, I’d be relieved. Should I wait a week, a month?

We hung out one time last winter so I could help him go Christmas shopping. Fast-foward a year, he's grown to become a close friend and is in a groupchat with myself and my old college roommate. I have never flirted with A nor show any interest towards being with him. We always joked that one day we'd get married, mainly because neither of us could keep the relationships we were in for that past year. We'd gotten into arguments before but always made up. Long story short, it always felt like a completely platonic relationship and I viewed him as a brother.

A couple weeks ago, he invited me to his sisters birthday party. People asked if we were dating but we both made it sure that we were just good friends. There, I met his stepbrother who I connected with instantly. We ended up talking until the sun rose. That was when A began to act weird and left me at the house (he was my ride) and didn't reach out until late afternoon the following day. 

A's stepbrother and I continued to see each other after the party, and A went back to where he had been currently stationed (he was in the army). Once A found out that we had been continuing to see each other, he blocked me on all forms of social media, even spotify, and expressed distress to his siblings after finding out what happened. It turns out he had feelings for me the entire time and ""saw a future with me.""

I was surprised hearing this and thought that maybe I was just being naive and never picked up the clues. I reached out to my old roommate and she agreed that A being in love with me was the last thing she would expect, since our relationship had always been platonic and never in any way serious.

I continue to see his stepbrother and we just recently agreed to become serious together.

We had sexted about him cumming inside but I didn’t want to do that right away, not until I knew his STD status and I hardly know him at this point. He seemed fine with it and said next time then, and we proceeded to spend 7 hours watching tv/making out/cuddling.

In asking people about this I’ve been told by a couple of friends they automatically assume that a gay-sounding voice = gay man so I’m on to reddit. 

I started talking with a guy on a dating app and he seemed to really like me. He’s a a whole 7 hours away (matched because was browsing while in my city but I didn’t pay attention to that before answering) so we didn’t want to jump to meeting and we moved to phone calls…and his voice sounds— to put it bluntly— like he’s gay. I thought at first maybe he was just nervous because he is inexperienced with women (both in early 30s so I figure that takes a toll eventually). I was willing to give it a chance despite all of this as we got along talking. 

I thought if it was just nerves it would fade away with time but no, now we’ve been talking regularly on the phone and it’s still there and even worse sometimes. My best childhood friend is gay with an unmistakably flamboyant voice and yet he has less of a pitch raise at the end of sentences. He wants to meet now (would fly) and I feel like I should given all the time we’ve spoken and the anticipation but I’m honestly so turned off by this. Again, not because of any personal thing against him— I think he’s great and would be happy to meet him if it were easier and lower stakes— but because I started thinking back and I don’t think I’ve ever known a guy to have that tone and manner of speech and not strike me as gay.

We met at the gym. At first I noticed she seemed to be attracted to me, I was attracted to her as well. We played staring games for a few months. We both have a mutual friend. A few months went by and I  kept noticing her staring at me a lot. One day I was talking to our mutual friend and he mention that she told him that she was very attracted to me and she was crushing. He told me a lot about her and pretty  much described the type of women I’m into, smart, mature, reserve, fit, plenty of goals, etc, not to mention that physically she was my type. This motivated me to start talking to her and breaking the ice. 

I had no idea how old she was, I thought she was at least 23. An issue I have is that I mainly attract 18-22 year olds. I’m pretty sure it has to do with me looking like I’m 21 at 29. I’ve always looked 5-8 years younger than I am. When I was 18 I looked 13, when I was 23 I looked 18 etc.

We’ve been talking these past few days a lot, I can tells she really likes me and makes thing really easy as in I don’t have to try hard and qualify myself to her. She hasn’t asked about my age, and I haven’t due to fear of her being turned off. I’m really really starting to like this girl and I’m actually scared of her stopping all contact if she finds out I’m over 8 years older than her. I believe she has half of year of college left while I’m working in the industry I want to work in part time waiting to be promoted to my goal job possibly next spring if it all goes right.

The most recent person I was intimate with basically ghosted me (maybe?)... this feels like the straw that broke the camel's back.

Just gonna give some quick history on my dating life and where things have gone wrong:

lost virginity @ 18 ... I was very clear that I would only have sex w. a condom, VERY clear... the guy said 'we don't have to have sex we can just mess around', then proceeded to have sex with me anyway. I really just felt defeated at the time so I just lied there. I still feel guilty - like i disrespected myself. 

First serious bf 18-23 (\~5 years). He ended up leaving me for his lab assistant. At the time, I tried to be super reasonable and just said ""make a decision"". He ended up taking 2 weeks of space and in this time, asked her out on a date which she rejected. Then, he wanted to get back together with me and even mentioned marriage. I said no, too late.

Next guy I dated after this ended (25-27) up being extremely emotionally abusive. He came on really strong at first (first red flag)... and then everything slowly started getting corrupt. He told me I was like a vampire and that people can tell there's something wrong with me within seconds of meeting me/I was a joke/people don't like me... etc. He really made it seem like I was the problem and that I needed to go to therapy etc. It was on/off again and he later told me he'd sleep with married men every time we broke up and that I should get tested. He also would sometimes do just strange/unnerving things like one time he randomly bit my face... it didn't cause pain but it definitely made me feel scared and anxious.

Then dated (briefly) a player. Then dated this guy who refused to commit, was hot-cold, and ended up leaving for someone else he met on an app (who he got engaged to) and 'breaking up' with me via text. He still reaches out to me on messenger to send me funny things, etc. I recently decided to ignore his messages so I don't see them and respond anymore.

Most recently, I was intimate with this guy I met a few weeks ago at a bar. He seemed really caring, and like a good guy. We were intimate last weekend (after the 2nd date - I feel like things definitely moved too fast and I made a mistake here), and this week he's been distant. He very genuinely and enthusiastically said he had a great time. I was a bit quiet @ first when he was going down on me... in fact, he said ""maybe we aren't compatible"" and I just felt very exposed because it was bright, so I suggested we move to another room, and things went a lot better after that and he said that actually he did think we were compatible. We didn't have sex because we didn't have a condom. 

Overall, I thought he was respectful and communicative (even if I wasn't too open @ one point) - I also told him that I don't usually do hookups and it takes me a while to warm up to a new partner, which he seemed grateful to know. The next day I texted saying I had a great time and was up for hanging out again. No response... then a few days later, I texted to ask how his day was going. No response again. Eventually, I got fed up and said no response is the most hurtful response and if he wasn't interested, he could just let me know. He texted me back saying ""Morning, I'm really sorry I've been bad at responding. I've been in that position before and it's no fun"". So I said, it's fine if he wasn't feeling a connection, it would just be good for me to know because I appreciate honesty and that I wasn't trying to apply pressure or anything, just didn't want to be ghosted. Again, no response (it's been \~2 days). Not sure what to do at this point, I really liked him and his text didn't clarify things. If anyone has advice, I'd love to hear it. 

It's kind of messes with my mind, because I worry that maybe I'm a bad judge of character or something. This is something I'm working on with a therapist, who's male, and who I am strongly attached to (and this actually makes me sad because I just want to be with him). But, I think it's also good to have a man who's really supportive in my life and it's definitely a protective factor for me... I don't want to like hate men or anything. Tbh, this relationship feels weird in a good way. He's really protective of me, always answers my texts, sends me books to read, and we are so complimentary to each other. It really saddens me that we can't actually date. 

Also... more to my history... my stepdad was very emotionally abusive to me growing up, and my bio dad was an alcoholic when I was younger... my mom eventually left him for it. One of my earliest memories is my dad being physically aggressive to my mom (choking her) and me yelling ""STOP"". This happened like once that I saw, but the relationship between them was terrible and my dad was very emotionally abusive towards my mom. 

Yeah... I guess that's my story sorry it's a bit dark. Also sorry for the length and thanks for taking the time to read it. 

I don't really understand why I have such bad luck with relationships.

Oh, also I'm 32... great with young kids (teacher), doing a master's in psychology, lived abroad for a few years and I'm successful, I'm super compassionate and empathetic, guys tells me I'm attractive.

For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I’m finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130256,public,self,Is she attracted to me?

My best female friend (20/F) is in a weird situation right now. She's in a relationship for 3 years now - they had few breakups - last one was a big deal. Won't go into much details.

Well she also has that REALLY close guy friend who's also an old ex from 2015 - they look super cute together, they never argued for anything, she even shares with him more than with me and she always smiles while outside with him.

Here is the thing - I feel that my friend is way too attached already to her boyfriend that she doesn't see how bad he acts with her - and at the same time can't see how much this old ex loves her. I feel that she is afraid to let him go and try again things with the old ex.

I've talked with her about that old ex and she shared that the only reason they broke up was because they didn't have much time for themselves while in school. During the last break up , she even had thoughts of talking with that old ex and try things again but that didn't happen since she went back to her boyfriend - even after countless texting about how bad he acts towards her.

The last week or so he’s been different. He said he would text for plans before the holiday but didn’t, and has been texting me every other day or so and asking how I am but then not responding or taking a day to answer. 

I had been seeing a few people before I met him but haven’t actively been on the apps to meet new people or making new plans with the people I was seeing casually. But I did look at his profile to see if I was right in feeling like he was not as into me and, not surprisingly, his profile is all updated. 

I sort of feel like I was his entry back into dating in this area and now he’s stringing me along. I tend to use a week without plans as a clear signal of waning interest. What do people think?

It was going slow but well, although he is very into constant texting and I am learning not to run when guys do that. On week four I told him the public library where I go to do freelance work (we both do the same). He started coming with me. After three days working by his side, I freaked out and texted him that while I enjoy being with him, I cant be work buddies and date him in the weekends, its too much too early for me. Having him all day by my side is making me see him as a friend or a coleague. I need a lot of concentration for work, and Im not into flirting in that setting. I told him I need some mistery and distance and he was a bit hurt.

I think one of the problems is that Im not very physically attracted to him and was hoping with time it would develop (sometimes I do feel a spark). But I need proper, relaxed, intimate, fun dates for the spark, not ugly fluorescent lights, excel talk and bad cafeteria food. Plus the thing I really like about him is his smile (and values,goals, personality), but we are wearing masks when we are at the library so I dont see the only part of him that physically turns me on.
He told me he doesnt get why we cant be work friends and date, that he is turned on by me anywhere.

I didn't have my first girlfriend until a few years ago and we broke up earlier this year. We met through mutual friends. Now that I'm single again, I'd like to go out and meet girls.

Here are the problems: I always either miss signals from girls or I'm too scared to approach them. When I was originally in college (graduated a few years ago, back in school for a career change), there were a few opportunities I missed from classmates, at parties, clubs, etc. I'd be glad to expand on some of these events in the comments. Some missed opportunities were in part due to me not being sure if the girl was being friendly or flirty.

I'm also too scared to approach girls because a million thoughts go through my mind such as ""will she think I'm creepy?"" or ""what if she has a boyfriend then he tries to act tough and causes a scene?"" or ""what if she makes a scene instead of politely saying she's not interested?"". To be fair though, sometimes there just aren't good opportunities to talk to girls.

Things holding me back:
* I'm not actually sure how attractive I am. I see myself as an average looking guy but people tell me I'm a good looking guy. For example, there are people in our ethnic community who have basically said to me ""you trying to get married? I know a girl"" (and one time they showed me a picture of this girl that was an absolute smokeshow, which left me too stunned to speak lol). I dress decently, get regular haircuts, facial hair trimmed, eyebrows cleaned up, nails are clean, sometimes wear cologne, etc. so hygiene is not an issue.

* I legit have no idea on the difference between a girl being friendly or flirty. For example, one time we were leaving a concert and I felt a hand on my arm. I turn and see it's this cute, short, blonde girl and when she noticed me looking she apologized, stating she thought it was the rail and then said ""you have nice arms"" and I just said ""thank you haha"". another time in class we were signing in for something and a cute girl was like ""oh you're a leftie too!"" and I was shocked she talked to me so I just said ""yeah there's a handful in here"" and then went to the room. I feel like the girls were just being friendly in these scenarios.

I came here knowing no one and became pretty damn lonely despite having 2 flatmates. I only have class 3 times a month so I don't really socialize with my peers much.

I matched with a guy (21M) on bumble who I really clicked with. We talked casually for like 3 weeks until he became flirtatious and the conversations became sexually suggestive. Then, very sexually suggestive. Over snapchat we would sext (I never showed my face or took off my bra/underwear) and we would talk about what we would do to each other in great detail and made plans to hang out. The first time we had to cancel because he was on vacation and his plane got severely delayed, which is fine. He seemed genuinely remorseful and asked to reschedule for next week.

Next week rolls around and the day comes, I ask him if we're still good for tonight. He replies a big lengthy message saying how he doesn't know if he can handle anything casual right now and is so swamped with school stuff, then said he wouldn't mind casually hanging out and offered to show me around London if I wanted.

I was so, so confused. How do you go from sexting every day for a week and hyping up the day you hook up, to saying you ""can't handle anything casual.""

We've gone from talking all day to maybe exchanging one text daily. I'm so confused. Did I do something? Am I not desirable enough? I feel played. I let myself be so vulnerable to a man who I never even met and then he gets cold feet out of nowhere.

Do I keep speaking to him and hope maybe a friendship is at least salvageable? It's so strange, like sir you just showed me your dick less than 24 hours ago, what changed?

TLDR potential hook up is super suggestive and is all about me until the day we were supposed to meet.

I was super excited about this, I purchased lingerie for the night and was buzzing about the night we were going to have, because so far things were going great. I liked this man loads. 

Anywho, yesterday comes, and having spent the day working from home, I didn’t realise there was a train strike. Meaning it was only upon getting to the train station that I realised the only way I could get to his was by bus (taxis during strikes are ridiculous and the traffic more so). We had plans to meet at 8 at his home, I messaged him mentioning the strike and said I was running late and would keep him updated. I hadn’t showered or shaved, and wasn’t wearing makeup because I had plans to get ready at my Health club / spa, where I would wear the lingerie. I have a super heavy bag full of clothes and makeup, but I still run around London to try and get to him. 

It takes me almost 90 mins of running and catching buses to get to my club and begin getting ready. And in doing so, I forgot to reach out to him. 8 comes and we are texting, I called him  and updated him and apologised. He seemed annoyed so I rushed out of there asap, without finishing my look, grabbed a black cab and headed over to his place.  

I kept giving him ETAs and eventually there was a miscommunication in what he said his address was and where I ended up. He was standing outside and I had been taken to the wrong place. Because of this, we finally agreed to meet at the restaurant. 

I get there with my super heavy bag and he’s annoyed, angry. It’s 8:45 and he’s angry and I explain how I’ve been running around for an 2 hours and a half to get here. He mentioned he was upset because he thought I wasn’t taking it seriously, and thought I was in the gym because I didn’t respect his time. I explained what I was trying to do, but I’m almost in tears and after five mins of bickering, where he tells me he was tempted to cancel and was thinking of me pay for the whole dinner, we continue to restaurant . He’s still super annoyed, and conversation is awkward. He makes a couple of weird comments about how he doesn’t like his Indian boss (I’m Bengali) because he’s rude and doesn’t respect time. He said Asians clearly have this problem, making a dig at me. He calls me bipolar and autistic. He mentions he’s tired from work and he only slept 3 hours the night before. 

After awkward dinner, we head back to his place. I kind of wanted to go home but this train strike and it was late, and I was kind of stuck. I mention I didn’t have time to put of his present (the lingerie) so he closes his eyes for 10 mins in his room so I can put it on. He goes gaga for it. Eventually we start having sex and he comes after 2 mins (which he says hasn’t happened in years). And then starts to fall asleep. It’s barely 11. 

I’m so annoyed, frustrated and let him know, and we are still bickering. Eventually I find a way for us to have sex again and it’s ok, I spend 30 mins massaging his back, arms and hands. He mentions that i did really well to turn the situation around as he thought he was out for the night. He wakes up at 6 briefly, we have sex again, and then I massage him before he goes back to sleep in my arms. 

We wake up and it’s awkward af. He needs to leave, but as we discussed over dinner I wanted to leave after him. But he starts pushing me to get dressed and leave with him, I’m expressing my shock at this initially and then he backs down and says I can leave after him.  He tells me not to bicker with him in the morning, he calls me weird for struggling to look at him when he’s talking to me. Whatever, I tell him we will remain friends, and he says something about seeing each other again. 

He leaves. I leave 15 mins later, and text him to tell him so as he asked me to. He texts straight back saying he had a nice time, and thanks for the massages. 

Grossed out and disappointed that it went this way. I was so excited, purchased lingerie and made so much effort and this guy just didn’t give a fuck.
