I am going on a second date ( first date was coffee date) our to dinner next weekend. ( a BYO restaurant, no bar or anything). Totally looking forward to it. 

Given our coffee date which was over an hour, I think we might want this date to go on longer than dinner. Usually when that happens we switch to the bar and continue talking or go to an actually bar, have some drinks, extend the night . The option is back to my place ( he’s coming down by me ) and I really like this dude and I am not ready for that.

Where does one go? Coffee places aren’t open all that late here anymore. The only thing open is bars. 

He doesn’t drink, but used to and stopped by choice. He recently went to his high school reunion at a bar. He enjoys 420, so he is not “clean” 

I’m a drinker ( not an alcoholic, but a drinker ) and I have always dated drinkers . This is new for me. Is a bar OK to suggest as just a venue that is still open so we can hang out an talk?

It went kinda good and we had a good time. 

I actually grew to like her (the more we spend time talking and running into each other) and made a bad judgment call. I asked her out and suggested I’ll take her to a nice restaurant I know or alternatively since she lives so close I could cook a dinner for her since I love cooking.

Apparently, it wasn’t a good call. She rejected both of my suggestions, and to make matters worse, she became slightly hostile.

She seem to avoid bumping into me in the office hallways, I suddenly don’t see her in the bus which we used to go back home together (we’re neighbourhoods), usually her texts with me are quite colourful, but when I suggested to grab food for lunch as always she replies with a single “no thanks”. She would come to me daily before that and ask “when do we grab some lunch??”.

It was such great conversation and I really enjoyed chatting with him. He asked for my number about a week into talking and since then we’ve been texting each other. 

After about a week of exchanging text messages I said that we should meet in person. I am a single mom, so I told him that it’ll have to be a little later like around 9-10pm because I get off work at 6pm and I have to make sure my son is settle before I go out. He said that’s fine and we had agreed to set up a date around that time frame. The day comes around and I haven’t heard from him all day, so I text him if we’re still on. Crickets. Then I receive a message from him I think around 1am the next morning and he says that he had a family emergency — a death in the family. So, I’m like, of course take care of it. 

I give him some space about a week or so and I message to see if he’s alright and to also let him know that whenever he’s ready I would still be interested in furthering things. And he responds back and says that he’s still interested also. So, we try to set up something else again. Something simple this time like video chatting. The time comes around again and I ask him if he’s up. No response again until the morning. He said he had family issues. 

This has happened multiple times. We were supposed to meet up in person and he said that he spent too much money on fixing his truck. I told him I didn’t expect it him to pay for anything for me. Then we were supposed to video chat again and this time he responded back but said that he had a migraine and the bright lights are bothering him. I told him it’s fine, next time. 

I tried again to set up a time for video chatting. This time I told him the time when I got off work (I got off around 7pm because we were slammed and I didn’t have a chance to tell him sooner). So I told him around 9pm or 10pm would a good time to video chat. I hear nothing from him again. I stay up until around 11 and texted him that I can’t stay up any longer. Then I told him this: 

“So, I'm not trying to discredit you nor do I want for you to take this the wrong way but every time we try to set something there is something that comes up. I know I'm nothing more than a stranger right now, but I would like to see more effort. 

I'm not sure if you have too much going in your life right now and you're not ready? But I am ready and I want to be pursued. So just let me know.”

So, he says: 

“You know I'll take the blame for every other time that we set something up It was my fault I can handle that. I don't feel like that was the case last night. I am not blaming you I just think there was a breakdown in communication. I was just expecting us to chat a little sooner but I know things come up and life happens.

I show effort and a desire to want this to develop into a serious relationship. May not be how you like it but I won't be able to find out the way you want to be courted until we get to know each other better.”

So after that exchange I told him that I didn’t know that he wanted to video chat earlier and I was very busy at work that night. Since then I’ve got one text message from him hoping that my move went well. I told him how my move went and I haven’t heard back. He texted Tuesday night. 

Is he already married? 🙃 I feel like I’ve already put in so much effort. If it’s been a few days I text first to see how he is.

Our first date was amazing and we had immediate chemistry… our senses of humor were similar, he was smart, mysterious, and attractive but in an unconventional way. We kissed on the first night and talked every second of every day afterwards. We couldn’t see each other much because he couldn’t drive, I lived almost an hour away, and we were both busy a lot. We went on about ten dates, but whenever we were together it felt natural and we got along really well and had a lot of fun together (we also had really good sexual chemistry). About a month in we both started being inconsistent with communication with each other, and since both of us are over thinkers, I think it definitely got into both of our heads. He also expressed to me that he was nervous about getting too deep into anything because I was leaving in less than a year. I felt myself becoming too reliant on having his attention even though he wasn’t willing to commit to a relationship, so I decided to cut things off. A couple days later I take a pregnancy test and it comes back positive, so we set up an abortion appointment, went together, and found out it was actually negative. This was after I had cut things off romantically so it was really uncomfortable between us the entire time and neither one of us knew how to act. Also not to mention the entire time he was carelessly snap chatting other girls in front of me, even though a week prior before I broke up with him he was still calling me his “baby” and all of that bullshit. Finally I told him that I was going home to the US early, and he said “well if you’re really leaving I’d like to see you at least one more time before you leave.” I took this whole situation to heart and I was really hurt with how he could be so insensitive so quickly after everything we had done together the past months. I assumed maybe it was just a coping mechanism because it was a pretty big blow to his ego. We planned to stay friends after that situation but the next day I was still so angry and hurt that I finally decided to text him and tell him how much that had hurt me and how insensitive that was. He tried calling the next couple of days but I never picked up or responded to any of his texts. This happened a month ago and I still want him to be in my life, even if we’re just friends.

When we first matched, he continued to try organise to meet me but i just came to the conclusion I wasn’t ready to meet anyone due to just getting out of a relationship. Regrettably, I barely gave him the time of day and I feel terrible how I handled it. 

He actually messaged me one last time, that he met someone (the girl that ended up being his GF) and was going to pursue things with her but wanted to see if I was wanting to meet before he focused on getting to know her.
Keep in mind I did/do genuinely like this guy when we talked, I just didn’t want to get involved with someone so soon when I still hadn’t processed my relationship ending. 

A year went by, they broke up, it’s been about 7 months I think since they broke up. Now he’s been quite persistent on finally meeting. Even after I stated that I didn’t want to be a second option or rebound. He’s reassured me that’s definitely not the case. I do feel I need to give him a chance. So now we are finally planning on meeting, he took charge which is what I like, organised the place we will go for drinks and I’m going to meet him this weekend. 


Mix of emotions due to it being a slow burn but now I’m concerned that it will be the opposite situation?

My boyfriend and I are both in our 30s, both previously married with children. We've been together for a little over a month, and within that month, we've spent every single day/night together except for when he went on a weekend getaway with his boys. 

My boyfriend has naked or otherwise inappropriate pictures of an ex on his phone from there years ago. 

The first week we were dating, he got a text message from a friend and he stated it was just a female friend from years ago telling him her husband died. We were out to eat and it was obvious he was texting a female, to which he told me the story and I offered up my condolences. He acts kind of strangely, he talked about her all throughout our date that specific night but I let it go. 

Several weeks goes by and he randomly admits to me on his own that the texter was an ex girlfriend and she's the naked girl on his phone - but swears it's platonic and her husband really did pass. 

Then randomly admits that she asked him if he was seeing someone to which he replied that he was dating someone (but that was before we become an official couple) a little later on after we decided to be together, according to him she started bringing up their past and how much she loves him and asked if she could come see him for Christmas. He told me he told her that while he's available to talk about her husband and kids and offer resources like links and try to get people to help her, it was inappropriate conversation to have since he's with someone. He also told me he told her he was happy and  blocked her. I asked if I could see the message by chance and he said ""I deleted it.""

So this is a few weeks after and I ask if he would delete the naked pictures of her on her phone since she's trying to cause trouble. I recognize and admit we've only been together almost month but that this is concerning for me and it hurts my feelings. He refuses. 

Fast foward to a month and we both have said we love each other. I'm good to his kids. We cook for each other. We've gotten each other Christmas gifts. 

But I did something stupid - I went through his phone 🙄 and I didn't see any messages from her but not only was she not blocked, her and her mom's phone numbers were listed as his emergency contacts. 

He caught me red handed and all I could do was apologize for invading his privacy but that I was looking for just some small proof that she was blocked and I found that she wasn't. He told me he had blocked her for ""three"" days but decided to unblock her. I asked him why would he block her for only 3 days, etc. 

I'm not normally a jealous person and I don't think he is actively cheating on me, but the fact that he's still wanting to talk to an ex he had three years ago knowing she came to him romantically and knowing he won't delete pornographic pictures of her off her phone really hurts me and it makes me feel like she's saving space for her. He is deadset against removing her. I'm hurt and confused.

If I were to describe my dream man before meeting him, he would fit the description. He is so kind, caring, and openly shows how much he loves me. Quite frankly, I don’t understand how he fell for me so fast. We’ve been dating for a few weeks but we’ve only known each other for a little over 2 months. Maybe I’m just someone who doesn’t fall in love that fast.

Yesterday he told me that he loved me for the first time and I said I loved him too. I knew if I didn’t it would break his heart, and I don’t think it’s completely a lie. I don’t love him *yet*, but I feel like I will. There’s no reason not to; I see a future with him, he’s incredible, and more than I could have ever asked for. 

I definitely have feelings for him, I get butterflies sometimes when I’m around him. But it pales in comparison to my “first love,” aka my ex who openly told me that he didn’t love me. I’m only saying this for context; I don’t care about my ex in the slightest and I think the reason I’m comparing the feelings is because the first one was so incredibly strong. I do think a huge part of it was me being delusional. My boyfriend is so romantic and kind and my ex was absolutely none of that. One of these men is clearly significantly better than the other.

The thing is, I don’t know how to feel. Is it normal not to be “in love” 2 months into knowing someone that you really like? Am I just overthinking what the feeling is like?

As men, we are visually driven. If a woman is extremely attractive, we will sometimes assume automatically that she is someone we should want to be with, especially if it appears other men desire her. This is an ego-based behavior that will have consequences later. If a woman exhibits one or more of these qualities, it’s important to step back, be analytical, and determine if she is a quality person:

She is negative. This is the biggest indicator of someone will make you miserable. If she is constantly complaining, talks shit about people she knows, or has a generally dark outlook on life, she will ultimately drag you down. You only want to surround yourself with people who are uplifting, and will

She places a heavy emphasis on social media. If a woman is constantly checking her social media, or is more concerned about projecting her image, rather than cultivating her development as a person, it is a giant red flag. What is concerning for many of these type of women is that they conflate personal development and developing their image. There are extremely attractive women who are heavily involved in Instagram, and are attempting to build a brand around their image, so this can be an alluring trap. An obsession with social media indicates an underlying insecurity and need of validation and attention from others.

She doesn’t communicate in a healthy manner. Instead of being upfront with her emotions in a respectful manner, she holds things in, or voices displeasure through fighting or displays of drama. Despite what movies and other forms of media portray, frantic fighting and making up is not a sign of passion, it is a breakdown in communication, and will wear thin after a while.

She treats others around her disrespectfully. She is rude to servers, retail workers, her family, or anyone else in her personal orbit. Those who mistreat others directly are the most insecure type of people out there. They recognize that they could easily be in the same position, and it makes them uncomfortable. They show false displays of superiority to compensate, but it is a false front.

They are materialistic. They expect dates to be held at expensive restaurants, they place emphasis on what possessions someone might have instead of their personality, or their values. Status is an attraction point for women, but there are different forms of status, not solely materialistic.

Hello. I come to you asking for some advice. I spoke with my mother, and got her opinion on the subject, but she said I should seek out input from people closer to my own age.  


Last Monday, I went into the office of a particular woman. We'd met briefly 3 years prior, as I used to work alongside her brother, but neither one of us knew the other much at all. I asked her if she would like to go out with me, and she agreed to meet me for coffee on Wednesday, two days later. We met and had coffee for about half an hour. She was delightful. She arrived on time, had great communication skills, was an absolute pleasure to converse with, asked a lot of good questions, all up until she realized she would be late getting back to work, at which point she quickly excused herself and departed.  


Before she left, I made it a point to get her phone number, as I hadn't earlier. I texted her and said thank you for meeting with me, and that I had a really nice time. She did not respond.  


I'd like to go out with her again. There is a musical production in a town south of here next week. I thought it would be fun to have dinner, and attend the musical, and wished to invite her to accompany me. Where I'm stuck is trying to figure out a tactful way in which to do it. What makes it tricky is that while I like her very much, I have really no idea whether she is interested in seeing me again or not, as she really made no indication one way or the other. Add to that there seems to be a lot of underlying rules and guidelines nowadays as to the right time or the right way to ask someone out, and I'm really just not familiar with any of them, and there also seems to be so many conflicting opinions.  


Initially, I thought I'd wait until tomorrow and just text her and say something to the effect of ""Hey, there is x musical at x theater in x town next Thursday, thought it would be fun to get dinner and go see it. Would you like to go with me?"" My concern with this method is that on one hand, I've heard it is better to ask for those things in person or at least over a phone call, as it is more personal and direct. On the other, I've also heard that being too direct, especially early on, can be too pushy, which I'd like to avoid. Another concern is that she simply won't respond, and then I won't know if she simply never received the message, or just isn't interested. I suppose that when I am in her office again next week, which I will be because I have business there, I could say something coy, to the effect of ""I've been having trouble with my phone lately. It doesn't seem I am able to receive texts, because.... I never got one from you. (knowing wink)"" Again though, I'd be concerned that would cross some sort of boundary.  


So yes, I'm a bit lost. If any of you have any advice or experience or wisdom that you would care to share with me, I'd be most grateful.

She took a little bit of time to pause (as convo was free flowing until then). Do you think she was weighing up the invite? 

I said I’d be in touch in a couple of weeks to confirm once I’d settled in my new job.

I pinged her on LinkedIn and asked for her number and then texted her to confirm, it was originally going to be midday but she asked if I want to see her later in the day instead so I’ve pushed it to 5pm.

So now we've been chatting on Facebook for about 3 days now. She's responsive and answers questions/responds to what I say within 30 mins.

Once I tested to see if she wasn't interested by not asking a follow up question after she commented about something and she ended up reaching out again with another topic within 24 hours, so I guess she is somewhat interested and wants to keep talking.

My question is, how can I ask if she's comfortable with meeting irl without potentially coming off as over eager and desperate? When would be an appropriate time considering she declined my first date invite about 3 days ago?

We were togather for 2.5 years and had plans to marry etc but since I wasn't ready yet, she decided to not wait around. Since then I have begrudgingly started seeing other people since people say thats how you get over someone. 

I have been on a couple of dates since the last 15 days or so with 3 women. We ended up sleeping togather after a couple of dates. None of the women expressed any desire to be in a relationship beforehand. Neither did we discuss about exclusivity. I have been on max 3 dates with all of them. Now I am sensing that their behaviour has changed and there are more expectations then before. I am a lawyer so I am usually very busy with work and after that my interests and hobbies. 

One of the women I am seeing got a bit miffed that I don't text her a lot and she feels neglected. But my frequency hasn't changed at all. There are several other complaints regarding my behavior by the others which to be honest is exactly the same as before we slept togather. 

I was looking to know how should I approach this subject so that they don't feel I am some how ignoring them or being a jackass after they have slept with me. I am currently in no position to get into a relationship as even when I am with them I somehow compare them to my girlfriend. Even after we have sex, I miss my gf sleeping next to me. These are great ladies but I the ghost of my girlfriend doesn't leave my side even though I haven't answered her phone calls and generally avoided her since the last month just so that we both can get over each other. Should I be honest and spill my guts to my dates? That doesn't sound appropriate to me.

I was scheduled to leave the same evening so I dropped her off to her dorm. When I was leaving she hugged me and couldn't let go. I told her we would meet again...hopefully. I left nd the same evening she texted me she loved me nd wanted us to be in a relationship. This was the best day of my life. I wanted nothing more. I told her that I was in love with her since high school but feared risking our friendship so I never told her how I felt. She felt guilty of not telling this to me when she was hugging me.

As men, we are visually driven. If a woman is extremely attractive, we will sometimes assume automatically that she is someone we should want to be with, especially if it appears other men desire her. This is an ego-based behavior that will have consequences later. If a woman exhibits one or more of these qualities, it’s important to step back, be analytical, and determine if she is a quality person:

She is negative. This is the biggest indicator of someone will make you miserable. If she is constantly complaining, talks shit about people she knows, or has a generally dark outlook on life, she will ultimately drag you down. You only want to surround yourself with people who are uplifting, and will

She places a heavy emphasis on social media. If a woman is constantly checking her social media, or is more concerned about projecting her image, rather than cultivating her development as a person, it is a giant red flag. What is concerning for many of these type of women is that they conflate personal development and developing their image. There are extremely attractive women who are heavily involved in Instagram, and are attempting to build a brand around their image, so this can be an alluring trap. An obsession with social media indicates an underlying insecurity and need of validation and attention from others.

She doesn’t communicate in a healthy manner. Instead of being upfront with her emotions in a respectful manner, she holds things in, or voices displeasure through fighting or displays of drama. Despite what movies and other forms of media portray, frantic fighting and making up is not a sign of passion, it is a breakdown in communication, and will wear thin after a while.

She treats others around her disrespectfully. She is rude to servers, retail workers, her family, or anyone else in her personal orbit. Those who mistreat others directly are the most insecure type of people out there. They recognize that they could easily be in the same position, and it makes them uncomfortable. They show false displays of superiority to compensate, but it is a false front.

They are materialistic. They expect dates to be held at expensive restaurants, they place emphasis on what possessions someone might have instead of their personality, or their values. Status is an attraction point for women, but there are different forms of status, not solely materialistic. It’s fine for someone to enjoy finer things in life, but be observant of how much importance they place on material items.

Had other people in the group tell me they thought we would be cute   together. I was afraid of asking her out directly so we eventually just   went on a hike/walk with just the two of us, but I never actually  called  it a date. It was really awkward and there was no physical touch  or  anything. At the end of the hike I asked what we were doing (I  phrased  it nicely) in terms of dating and she said she thinks we would  be better  off as friends. All good and there were no hard feelings  honestly.

Fast  forward a month  later or something and I haven't seen her since but she  randomly texts  me asking me about car insurance stuff we talked about  before. Was a  little confused she reached out, but didn't blow her off  and we went  back and forth for a little bit over text. A few weeks later  I was  going to a free concert with my one friend and we had an extra  ticket,  so on a whim I invited her just as friends. She came out and was   definitely playful that night (teasing, hand on the shoulder, I always   found her sitting or standing next to me - which shes done this during   later hangouts too). I had another friend privately tell me later they   thought me and her were dating, which confused me again. We hung out   some more in the fall, another comment came from someone else (this time   in front of her and the group), saying we bicker like a couple, and  she  got mad about that. Idk if she was embarrassed or what but I never   commented on it.

So then she went   back to the other side of the country for a month to visit her family  as  she works remotely. I thought no biggie I'll just talk to her when  she  gets back. Nope she hits me up a few days after she left, looking  for  small talk. We went back and forth. Then again a few days later she  saw I  went out to a certain bar. She asked how it was, etc.

It's   pretty obvious what she's doing. And I don't want to be a sucker about   it. I think she's pretty, I like her personality and how we get along,   but I don't want to be strung along like this. I might be seeing her   this weekend at a bar as she's now back in town, and if so I was going   to be straight up with her - basically that I would like to take her out   on a real date and see where it goes. But I don't really want her to   keep hitting me up like this. I don't care if she comes and hangs out   with the group, however I don't want to be her texting buddy.

We decided to meet on Friday, we went out to get some drinks and we have talked before that afterwards we would go back to his place to watch a movie we both liked. When I met him in person I felt a connection, he was funny, caring, and everything was good, when we went to his place we had a lot of fun drinking, singing, dancing and playing games. We ended up making out and I had told him before that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to have sex and he said it was fine, but my drunk self got really horny and said fuck it, so we did. It was ok nothing great, I don’t remember a lot tbh, but afterwards we kept drinking and having fun, then we slept cuddling together. The next day when we woke up I felt like he was indifferent towards me, he didn’t really care to cuddle and didn’t care to have long conversations, we had breakfast and it was just silent. Then he took me home and I told him that I had fun and thanks for everything, he just looked at me and said take care. I was like fuck it and kissed him, it was just a peck. I honestly wasn’t that affectionate or insistent either. But now he hasn’t talked to me, neither have I, i don’t want to come off clingy, but it’s my first one night stand so idk what to expect.

So talking with this gal for over a month, had a 1st date last weekend and another this weekend. Things appear great, but she is (self admittedly) terrible at picking up hints and stuff. Or maybe i’m bad at putting hints out there. Either way, subtlety is not our strong point. I tried a couple separate times before she finally picked up the hint to hold hands (we talked and she told me she didn’t know.) I also may have felt out a possible goodbye kiss, but she certainly didn’t pick up on that either (didn’t tell her anything about that other than she missed something else). 

Anyhow, if the setting is right, perhaps I just ask her if she wants to kiss next time?

She said she doesn’t drink on the first date so we planned for coffee, but everything would be closed after work so she suggested dinner and drinks. 

I told her during the date that we didn’t need to drink if she wasn’t comfortable but she said it was a long day so she didn’t mind. 

Date went well and there was some light touchy flirting from her and myself. I asked to walk her to her car which she agreed to. 

I touched her hand and we both pulled closer to each other and we kissed. I was only expecting a short kiss but she was pretty open so we made out for like a minute. I bit her lip and she stopped for a moment. Concerned I asked her if I did something wrong and she said “no, it was just really good” We continued to kiss and she pulled me closer.

At this point I started to move my hands around, with no resistance and continued kissing I did lightly pull her hair and squeezed her butt. We continued kissing for another minute then we stopped. I invited her back to my place and she politely declined saying she hasn’t been intimate in months. 

I said that was fine and no big deal, but I did enjoy kissing which we continued. Finally we parted ways and we both texted to make sure we got home safely. We also both wanted another date. We texted on and off, and then today she said she felt we were on different pages regarding physicality and that she was uncomfortable with being asked to go back to my place and me pulling her hair and squeezing her butt.

She said she doesn’t think it was my intention to make her uncomfortable but I feel terrible. I apologized for crossing the line and I felt like I really misread her body language. There was never a moment as far as I could tell where she pulled away and when she said she doesn’t sleep with people on the first date I respected that and didn’t push.

And the past two days (including the day she asked that question) she has been dry on msgs but phone calls shes normal ig. I cant stop thinking about her. Its killing me. I like her for who she is/was/or my mind made her to be. Its not the looks, its the personality and ""cute"" habits.

I was talking to this boy for almost 2 months and everything was fine. We finally met up and I thought it went well considering he text me later that night and called me the next day. A couple of days after our date, he started acting weird. He would still text me and send stuff on social media but didn’t call me again. I thought maybe these days are hitting harder than usual Bc of all he’s been through this year. He once told me he’s depressed and confided in me about what’s going on in his life and how he’s feeling (some deep stuff). So I didn’t wanna make him being a little distant about me. It seemed like he was gonna ghost me but still talked to me but I sensed a change. I decided to just rip the band aid off and ask him what we’re doing. First he said idk and then said he was trying to be friends until he figures out his life. I thought that meant he just sees me as a friend. I just agreed with what he said bc I didn’t wanna fight for someone that said that. We still sent stuff on social media here and there and he texted me 2 days after that convo. But he would next text back after talking for a bit. Now it’s a month later, He stopped sending stuff on social media and so did I. I checked up on him to see how he was doing. We had a tiny convo of how are
You and after him not responding back till the next day, I just didn’t text him bc I was annoyed. The next week he post this meme basically saying “to my girl who’s not my girl hmu when you’re ready”. First I was like wtf he’s talking to another girl and then I was like maybe it’s about me but then 3 hours later he post his food and there’s a girl in the back. I was so hurt by this and confused bc why would you post that meme. He made it seem like “the girl” and him weren’t talking. I wanted to say something so bad but I didn’t. He since hasn’t posted anything about a girl. I know he has a lot of girl friends from when he was younger but it was staged so weird, where it looked like he was on a date and then it didn’t. On thanksgiving he messed me saying happy thanksgiving and the next day I posted skydiving and he swiped up on it saying look at you (this is something we talked about before). I’m just confused on what’s happening bc most guys when they say they wanna be friends, don’t wanna be friends. I was getting over all of this before he “reentered” my life. He watches all my stories and hasn’t posted anything relating to a girl so I’m just like what are you doing. Others say he misses me and others say he was just being nice and others say he’s just keeping me there, which doesn’t make sense bc we didn’t hook up and he doesn’t text me or anything so he’s gaining nothing.

Well the things were simple - she initiated most of our texting, she would ask me to go out just the two of us and go somewhere, she made comments like "" ask your mom if she would like me as a girlfriend to her son"", she always mentions that I'm the only person with who she can say and do whatever she wants without caring and send me pics of herself in her daily routine. When we were out/with friends she always walked next to me, laughed at my bad jokes and she would always hug me for a goodbye.

Well, we argued that these things **ATLEAST for me** were pure hints that she still have feelings for me and want to spend time with me but she refused since when I've asked her she got back into her toxic relationship with her still boyfriend.

Well, lets put that outside of my main question - was she really just being good friend or she just didn't want to confirm that she still had feelings since she got back to her ex? She even said to a close female friend that she have thoughts of talking with me about a second try but that never happend since her boyfriend wanted to talk with her and they got back together.

I met Jim about a month ago after talking on a dating site.  I met him after a really, really bad weekend, which involved me being stood up a total of 3 times by 3 different guys from dating sites (none of these guys I knew IRL, only OLD).  This was unfair because none of those 3 guys ever even gave me a chance.  I became convinced (and still am) that they found the trash talk, obscene pictures, and insults that had been posted about me incessantly on multiple gossip websites by some asshole I had dated last year, a guy who had viciously turned on me, and seemed to be on a mission to ruin my life.  I have already been confronted by multiple different guys about stuff they found online about me, including my next door neighbor (who I had told in confidence about the stuff online, but never actually showed him or told him where he could find that stuff, yet the neighbor still apparently managed to easily find all that dirt on me anyway) and various guys I never met IRL but only talked to through OLD.  I worried that no guy wanted me, and that I was just some huge joke or seemed psycho because of the stuff that asshole wrote about me last winter.  But it seemed that this guy was insistent on meeting me, even insisted I give him a chance and that we hang out later that day (a Sunday).  At the time I wasn't sure if he was my type, honestly.  He is rather good looking but not the usual type I go for, but I gave it a shot.  He came to my apartment to hang out and he seems okay.  So far he's visited my apartment a total of three times.  My roommate Abbie and her boyfriend, who stays with us more often than not, met him briefly once.  She said he seems nice.


So far we haven't gone on any dates out to places yet, just hanging out and watching TV.  Is this okay?  Is this too forward?  In the beginning he said he likes to get out a lot, and he loves to go dancing at clubs (dancing is totally not my thing), but we've only hung out at my apartment.  I haven't slept with him yet, or anything close to that, which has me a bit anxious to be honest, because I question how serious it can be if I haven't even had sex yet, despite him putting ""good sex"" as one of his ""things I like"" on his OLD profile.  Also, he's obviously seen my OLD profile and on my profile, I put among other stuff that I want a guy who is attracted to me and actually wants to have sex with me.  But so far we've only kissed.  To be honest, I wasn't concerned at first about the lack of sex or foreplay, because I was always told to wait until at least 3 dates before having sex with a guy anyway, but now that I've seen him 3 times and have talked to him throughout the month, I am starting to wonder when sex will come up.  Is this a normal timeline for something that might lead to a relationship?  What is the average amount of time that a guy will wait before trying to have sex (or even anything beyond 1st base kissing) with a girl he's seeing/hanging out with?  Do you think it's possible he's ""friendzoning"" me or not into me?  I don't really think he's ""friendzoning"" me, because if he did, he wouldn't keep kissing me, right?  He seems to like to kiss, more than I do, to be honest.  Kissing has me feeling kind of self conscious, mostly because a few guys told me in the past that I was a bad kisser, and because the guy from last year who posted all that trash talk online about me said that one of the turnoffs about me is that my breath stinks.  So as a result, I'm constantly chewing gum around any dates/male friends and highly insecure.  I kiss this guy but I don't like to prolong it, but when I kiss for a full minute and then gently pull back, he'll put his hands on my shoulders, look me straight in the eye, and say to me ""I'm not done yet.""  Does this mean I'm being rude by pulling away?  What is an acceptable normal amount of time to kiss?  If I'm feeling self conscious, should I limit my kisses or will doing so show that I'm insecure?  Please help me with advice on this kissing issue.


I guess that's another reason I hope to progress this past just kissing soon, because not only do I have sex needs and am currently in a sex drought spanning almost half a year now, but I think maybe if we move past kissing, there'll be less emphasis on kissing, which is the part of hooking up I'm most self conscious of (I have other insecurities but action wise, kissing is a huge one for me, because of what 2 different guys told me before about me apparently not being a good kisser).


How do I explain to him that I am hoping to have sex?  How do I even bring this up?  I feel so stupid for being a girl but not having had sex in nearly half a year.  I mean, every guy goes around saying ""it's so much easier for a girl to get laid,"" ""a girl can get laid anytime she wants,"" etc but here I am, sexless.  Even the last several guys I had sex with were guys who worked in the sex industry.  Yes, I realize that's wrong, and the stigma behind it is why I stopped doing that, and also because I had recently reconciled with my family and didn't want it somehow getting back to them.  So here I am, trying to have sex the ""organic, nontransactional way"", and it's just not working for me.  Do you think this guy wants me sexually?  Do I stand a chance?  How should I approach this with him?  Is it weird for us to be seeing each other for a month but still not advancing past kissing?  He is not strongly religious or has any morals against premarital sex, from everything he's told me.


TL/DR: I've been seeing a guy from an OLD site for about a month, after striking out on dating sites.  So far I haven't had sex with him or anything close, and am starting to get anxiety about the fact that he hasn't tried anything sexually with me yet, and that the lack of sex means a prolongation of my existing sex drought.  Is it normal to go a month seeing someone but not trying to do anything beyond kissing?  Or does this mean I'm ""friendzoned""?  How do I approach the sex thing without looking like a sl-t?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131909,public,self,"Is this situationship worth pursuing, and how do I bring up my need to have sex?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7dw36/is_this_situationship_worth_pursuing_and_how_do_i/,no_ads,0,,,,,

It was fun and he was clearly interested in me, like we laughed etc., but honestly I wasn't actually attracted to him.

And at the risk of being immodest, I'm an outgoing person who is pretty good at first dates and generally getting conversation flowing with strangers, like a friend once said she knew a party we were at was a dud because even I couldn't salvage it. I've always gotten the impression that my personality is better than my actual physical attractiveness lol, so usually my dates go well unless the other person is just truly terrible and I stop trying.

So sometimes I have these dates where like it's fun and we laugh and it's probably a good date from their perspective and they're probably more interested in me than they were when they walked into the restaurant to meet that girl they met on Bumble, but I'm honestly not interested in them because there was no attraction there and/or they don't meet enough of my soft internal criteria (not explicit dealbreakers like wanting kids but those little cumulative stuff like amount of shared interests and complimentary skillsets). 

But from their perspective it went really well and flowed very smoothly, and objectively it was a good non-awkward first date. Sometimes the attraction isn't there on their side either but more often than not, they seem kind of blindsided when I don't pursue. Because surely if I didn't reciprocate I would have been signaling awkwardness/weirdness/discomfort/unhappiness/desire to end the date.

It happens all the time. A stranger is easier because I don’t have to see them again. But my neighbors or people I work with sort of bully me into giving them my number.  This is generally after weeks of evading them, after I feel I’ve made it clear I’m not interested in anything beyond friendship. They get my number and immediately try texting me back very 5 minutes or looking for a booty call. I asked some friends about it and they said I need to stop hinting. My “hints” they aren’t picking up on:

1. “I will absolutely never date a coworker again. Not after my last dumpster fire”

2. “I’m not interested”

3. “I guess you can have my number if you’re only interested in friendship”

I don’t like lying. And I don’t like ghosting. (Not that I can). The only excuse that ever gets people to leave me alone is, “I have a boyfriend”. Which is just beyond disrespectful that my clear boundaries, my assertions mean nothing, but fabricated boyfriends shouldn’t be messed with. I don’t know guys.

I feel like done in an appropriate setting it should be fine. There’s a time and place for everything. 

But what about the other way around? Would men feel better if women approached them? 

What are conversation starters? How does one break the ice?
