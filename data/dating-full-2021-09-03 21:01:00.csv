I don’t believe in god. Grew up devote catholic. Psychology graduate.

So I need advise.

I’m 30 years old, and finally find a decent guy. Someone that has qualities I admire and want to be around.

We’ve hung out a couple times and had wonderful conversation, sex and I felt a connection. 

He mentioned he only wanted a FWB because it’s “complicated,” and the complication is his relationship with god and the Bible.

He stated after having sex he would want to discontinue the sexual side of it because his “temptation” is not the way god intended him to be. 

It’s very frustrating growing up catholic and albeit I have to separate myself from
My experience and I don’t get it. He wants to have a normal life with a girl but then I propositioned him the question wouldn’t that be a sin too living a lie too? 

I’m more frustrated the fact that the perceivable agony he is going through between meeting someone he enjoys too and having to assume he’s going to hell for it.

He basically told me he doesn’t want to see me anymore because he knows he will be tempted and it’s nothing with me. I get it but I’m devastated because I truly liked him and I know I’d be good for him although god ultimately will win.

Yesterday 9/2 we spent the majority of the day consoling him that he’s not going to help. I tried to state to him the numerous ways the because he can’t change his brain size or chemistry I don’t think an all loving god would send him to hell say over someone who murder  people. He mentioned he would abusing gods system by dating me or having a husband with me. 

I got him to understand the lilkihood of his dichotomies of who goes to hell for what insighting problematic ideations in Leviticus.

I genuinely like him ad he likes me … or is trying to.

I shared with him other responses from asking other subreddits and he said people need to understand his perspective too…

I always thought he was cute, so I used this as an opportunity to ask him out. I offered to take him out for lunch as a token of my apology, and he accepted.

Sunday comes along, and he and I have a great time at lunch. I pay, as it was my treat. Since the lunch date, he calls me every day to talk to me. We weren't able to see each other during the week, but the following Sunday, we chilled by the pool together. This past week, I ended up getting sick and missing work, and he is out of town for the labor day holiday, so I won't be able to see him.

He used to come to my place the evenings and we would sit on my bed and play guitar or video games (even though he's not into video games at all). 
There were moments where I thought something might be going on due to how we were around each other and the closeness we had.


I was, and still am insanely attracted to him.


After few months he got a girlfriend. He announced it to me one night in a party while we were in bed together and getting physically very close. He held me in his arms the entire night, told me how attracted he is to me, but nothing happened between us.
When I brought it up, he denied everything and acted like he never made a move on me.
I had a hard time processing this. And before I knew it, our relationship completely changed.
He stopped coming to my place, we stopped talking, we stopped seeing each other ... And that hurt me. I missed him, and I knew I shouldn't initiate anything because he had a girlfriend.
We saw each other 5 times at most during 7 months, when we were with other friends.


About 2,5 months ago, they broke up. No one told me, but I could sense it by the way he was acting (flirting?) with me. I was acting cold, and started feeling like I was being rude. So I decided to just give it a try and hang out with him again.


He came to my place one night, we had fun. Then when he said ""we should do this again"" and started planning, I just couldn't.... And I started telling him that what he did before hurt me. I explained how it bothered me.
We had a long talk, we talked for 3 hours. He realized what he did and explained to me. And I do believe and forgive him. He was sincerely sorry.


He told me that there was something between us, that he couldn't define. But those evening were definitely not just as friends. And that he couldn't keep seeing me while he was in a relationship. But he did admit that he should have told me straight up instead of denying it.


I told him that I don't want us to get close again, and then have the same thing happen when he gets another girlfriend. He agreed, because he knows that things might go out of hand if we keep hanging out.
We decided we wouldn't see each other just the two of us anymore.


It made us sad, we hugged for a really long time, and things got heated up again. We are definitely not just friends, we are both attracted to each other. But he said he's afraid to get into a relationship with me, because he doesn't know how long it's gonna last, that he likes me a lot as a friend and doesn't want me to get hurt.


He ended up leaving my place at 3 am. That was the last time we do something together just the two of us. It was heartbreaking seeing that the feelings were mutual but that we couldn't be together.


I still feel sad about it. I want to call him, talk to him, hang out with him. But I don't want to suffer again. This is for the best.

And when I say ""dating"", I don't mean hanging out or Netflix n' Chill... I'm referring to  taking a woman out to engage in a well-planned, elaborate activity that took a fair amount of planning and also includes dinner and drinks.

And in the case that men have a rotation going, I'm almost certain that there are only 1 or 2 girls they are truly putting effort into courting and everyone else is gleefully settling for scraps.

So sometimes, like once a couple of months, I happen to meet people that interest me thought friends or event. I'm only physically interested, I rarely meet people that share my interests.

I use dating app and my experience is different depending on the app. But I started using okcupid 1 year ago and it's the only app where I can have match with girls and meet people that share my interests. I use pictures where I have really nice postures (that doesnt make my belly too big), with nice clothes and taken by someone else.
Although I have only meet 3 peoples. So like once every month I matched with someone where there was reciprocal interests. 

I also use social media mainly twitter to slide in some DMs but it never worked(except to make friends)

Usually when i match with someone I try to know them, talk about myself, talk about stuffs in commons. Usually if the other person doesn't invest themselves in the discussion or that we share nothing in common I let the conversation die.

Usually date go well but I always wonder if weight will be a problem cause sometimes I met girl online, they seems interested in me until they see how I look like. 

Now I date a lot less cause I have a FWB with whom I spent a lot of time, we have lot in common and they doesnt care about how I look like .... I guess I was lucky to meet someone that give little importance to physical appearance. I still met people that interest me (but rarely)

The other people I met or chatted just needed sex or where not interested in me(including people bigger than me)

Usually I just attract old gay persons or horny dude that want sex.

This summer I have met a lot of new people and spend significant amount of time in bars (with friend).
Usually in bar and party i don't go toward stranger I find attractive cause I dont know what to say. I already fought my lack of confidence a long time ago... now I don't know what to do or say when I have nothing in common with the other person in those situations 


So I'm overweight I started working out again since june, I try to eat healthy as much as possible, my social skills are good only when I have stuffs in common with the persons in front of me. I have like 2 outfits that make me more attractive, but I'm still searching for a way to make me more attractive with clothes

Just warning you. But if you think you’re up for the challenge, read away and give me some advice! Thanks ❤️

I am in one of the most healthy relationships I have ever been in, but I can’t shake these thoughts and feelings. 

Let’s start from the beginning. I spent most of my teenage years and some of my young adult like in a three year relationship. Him and I had so much chemistry, and we have so much in common. We broke up August of 2020 after some cheating on his end, and some emotional/manipulation problems on mine. We had been together for so long and it really started to get unhealthy towards the end and I can now see that. We have two dogs together, who I have 100% of the time. He didn’t like to work or do anything other than play video games and sleep. I had spent a lot of my time “mothering” him. I would pay his rent, teach him how to do taxes and basically do everything a mother would. My love language really is caring for people and doing acts of service but I started to get burnout with every task I felt like I needed to do. 

I started this new relationship I am in now in January of 2021, after hanging out for a few months. I would also like to add that he is a friend of me ex’s. It wasn’t done intentionally to upset anyone, but it did cause some hard feelings. At this time in my life, I was drinking very heavily and not in a good mental place. I stopped drinking a few months ago, and I feel so much better mentally. In the beginning of this relationship he was gone very often for work trips, usually lasting between 2-5 weeks long. We moved in together really quickly since he wasn’t really living at his apartment since he’d only get to be back for a week or two. I think it was a month or two in. Just in the past couple months he’s started working at a construction job where we live and is home 100% of the time now. He’s an adult! He pays his own bills and saves his money (with a little guidance from me). But I don’t have to mother him. He’s motivated, loves working and doing tasks even on his days off. He does do acts of service for me too and he knows I love when he does those sort of things for me. 

Now here’s the thing. It’s been slowly chipping away at me. We are polar opposites. We have nothing in common. We often time get in really heated arguments about politics and he ends up really upset. We’re both stubborn as hell and that doesn’t help either. I do love and care about him but I can’t see myself in a relationship with someone who doesn’t share the same morals and ethics with me. I couldn’t imagine raising my children or staring a home with the views he wants to instill in his children. And the WORST of all, he doesn’t like my dogs. I have two dogs, and they’re not perfect but they’re good and they listen to me. They act weird around him, and he has stated many times that he just doesn’t like them. Specifically because he “doesn’t like little dogs”, they’re medium sized dogs. I told him if he ever laid a hand on my dog, I would lose my shit and become unglued. 

I also had a run in with my ex at a music festival and we hung out. Nothing inappropriate or crossing boundaries (I actually told my current boyfriend all about it) but it just made me realize how emotionally unhappy I am in the relationship I am in now. I don’t think I’d ever go back to my ex, but it just showed me how much I don’t have in common with my current boyfriend. 

It’s really hard to think about right now and my mind is trying to convince me one way or another everyday. It could just be relationship anxiety (which I do get) but this feels different. I really do love and care about him, but I’m just future tripping. My family and friends like him!

I feel like literally any man i have ever talked to or dated expects me to put out practically ASAP. Whenever I tell friends that I’m talking to a guy or if I’m out at night with a guy, even my friends ask if we are going to hook up. Basically, I often times feel so uncomfortable in a sex charged society because I feel like I am the outlier. I especially worry that people may see me differently or as the girl who “doesn’t put out.” I know everyone says that people like that shouldn’t be worth my time, but I feel like it is so ever-present. It honestly feels like I’m so alone in all of this, and I don’t even know how to go about explaining it to others, especially guys that I’m interested in. It’s not like talking about my trauma is a great conversation topic as to why I need more time — so I wonder, what should I do? How can I navigate this?

I wasn’t planning on telling him because sometimes it definitely felt like the feelings were reciprocated, and other times I’ll think not because he’s so private with his emotions. He’s a very flirty person and being friends with him I do notice that a lot of girls around him think he’s into them more than he really is. So basically a bit of a player whether he means to be or not. He’s dated a few times before, and at the start of our friendship had an LDR, I’ve never had a bf. 

(I’ve also NEVER caught feelings for a guy friend and I have a predominately guy friend group. It’s him, my guy best friend that has only ever been platonic, and my brother, with an extended group of a few more girls and guys.) I do feel that my feelings for him were real because I haven’t gone that place with a friend.

In July, long after he and his LDR broke up from the winter, we were skirting on a situation-ship, our hangouts are always like 5 hours minimum, we’re so comfortable around each other and make each other laugh. It just made sense. I went on my first hangout with him 1-1 where we had a dinner and a movie, and I at first thought “oh I don’t have butterflies, maybe I don’t like him as much as I thought!” but then I thought that was a good thing because I wasn’t nervous around him. We would hang out three more times, we went to a museum and our friends kept leaving us alone because it looked like we had a moment. At the bat with some friends we were snuggling under my sweater, he danced with me on the dance floor after taking a shot and loosening up and HE reached out to hold my hands and twirled me around etc. I usually always hug him but he started to initiate goodbye hugs and hold me tight and the hugs will linger. 

My other girl friends that know I like him kept encouraging me and saying “he totally likes you it’s so OBVIOUS” and basically pushing me to say something all summer. My platonic bff (M22) didn’t know anything about his feelings but said that relationships that start off as friends tend to be more successful. 

So over the weekend my friend (M22) told me he (M24) was going on a date and thought I should know. It was just some classmate that we talk to sometimes, and he wasn’t really interested but said yes because he admired her confidence in asking him out. Naturally this made me upset because it felt like everything that was building up just got knocked down in minutes. I visit them on campus the next day, not realizing his date was THAT day in one of the cafes on campus. It was so heartbreaking seeing him on a date right in front of my eyes. 

He said it was just fine, nothing crazy. I hang out with him separately for an hour before his next class and this is where I tell him I started catching feelings for him. He seemed pleasantly surprised by this news, and was smiling but then he cuts me off and says “I’m sorry I just see you as a friend”. He said it so casually and I was taken aback, so I played it off like no big deal, but I was crushed and confused and EMBARRASSED. 

He said it won’t be awkward for him that I just have “a little crush” and when I drove him back he hugged me and waved before leaving. The second I got on the highway I broke down. Told my other friend what went down etc. The next day I sent him a text saying I thought he felt the same way and didn’t want to hold it in anymore. Then I said I would need some space from him before I can be comfortable around him again. He was nice about it and said take all the time I need and that he'll always be around. and since then I haven't spoken to him all week and he keeps watching every IG story I post.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,987002,public,self,"I told my friend I had feelings for him, and he just sees me as a friend.

BUT, Some night she invited me to a gathering of her friends and we had a good night out, and on the way back she told me she has a FWB relationship and the reason is she is in her mid/early 20s and don't want anything serious now and she also told me she has never been in a serious relationship before, only this FWB and a previous FWB relationship.  


Right now I am pretty confused, she told more than one time she really likes hanging out with me and she shows interest in my personal life and also I like hanging out with her and she literally told me very personal stuff.  


Am I a good friend to her, if so, What's the flirting is all about? , or Is she interested in me (relationship wise)?

It’s both of our first relationship and we’re new to everything that goes with relationships too. I asked him out like 2.5 months ago and we became official a few weeks ago. However, we have known each other for like 3 years from being on the same sports team and school.

About two weeks ago I hugged him before I left his house which was a big step for him (he is quite shy and inexperienced). Then about week ago, we were sitting together on my couch and I put my head on his shoulder. He put his arm around me and we stayed like that for a while. Then when hanging out yesterday, we cuddled a few times and rested our heads on each other and hugged. I also held his hand on a walk. 

I feel such a genuine connection with him and he is literally the sweetest thing ever. I admire that he is respectful of my space and isn’t forcing himself on me, but I wish that he would initiate physical contact more. I have anxiety and I overthink and that maybe he doesn’t like me. I really want to kiss him but I want to give him the opportunity to show me affection so he feels good about himself. I’m just worried that he’s too shy to initiate contact or that maybe he doesn’t want to.

Just feels like all the men of these dating apps just want to have sex right away or they get bored. 

Based on past experiences I need to be comfortable enough with someone to have sex with them, but seems most people aren't that patient. And since coming out from an abusive relationship, I really need that security in a way that I can trust the person. It's so hard dating, especially when you have just come out of an abusive relationship. No one feels safe. It's like they just see me as a pretty object but not as a person, or a human being.

I met a girl on Tinder. We sarcastically went back and forth with one another over text. Eventually got her number.

Then BAM. I got FaceTimed. I wasn’t expecting it. So I kinda flustered my way thru it and said I wasn’t really available right then so then I FT’d her back later on.

We had a good 2 hour conversation or so, but it was getting really late and it was a weekday so I was making it pretty clear that I had to get off but she kinda kept not respecting that. Then, I finally was just like “listen I’m going to bed” and I turned off the lights and she hung up. She then texted that she understood that I had to go but that she was “upset by how I said it”. Honestly, this was red flag #1.

So the next day she kinda just texts me outta the blue talking about something that happened in her class. So we banter back and forth and then BAM…I get another FT call but I was literally in the middle of working out so I said that and quickly hopped off. She was upset. It seemed kinda clear at this point that she didn’t respect I had other things going on in my life.

So I call her back again later when I’m free. She doesn’t answer and immediately just texts “🙄” then said I hung up on her earlier. Then she randomly says she’s about to be naked. I kinda just brushed that off cause we didn’t know each other real well and it came outta nowhere.

She wanted me to FT shortly after this so I did…and she was in the shower. Like it seemed that I interrupted her and she didn’t want to speak cause she thought her roommate would think she’s weird. So I just said for her to call me back when she’s done.

She then got upset that I didn’t want to talk to her or see her naked. I basically just pointed out that we barely know each other and it just felt weird to me.

Then she goes on about how I don’t want to talk to her. I basically just pointed out that we had agreed to meet in a couple weeks and that I was busy otherwise and that her calls were just random.

I kinda got fed up with the BS at that point and I blocked her. Idk, just felt that my boundaries didn’t matter.

To simply put, I had a major crush on a girl that was an awesome friend of mine back in high school. During the time we spent she would always text me, visit me, and support me in every way I couldn’t stop thinking about her and how much I wanted to keep making her smile. I wanted to ask her out but after so much rejection in the past from other girls, I was afraid of how we would end up if she didn’t see me the same way. One day I decided to take a shot and ask her to the movies, and to my luck she agreed but after going to the theater and waiting that night she never showed up. There had to be a logical explanation, but to add on to the bad news she stopped texting me and just disappeared for 4 years. Now flash forward to today: I have graduated college, she’s joined the military, she’s back on the grid, and she’s responded back to my texts as if nothings happened. I want to ask her out still but..maybe I’m still living in the past and thinking she’s still the girl I dream of being with. Should I take another shot or should I just move forward?

I’m a 24 year old female and I am always been told that I am the total package. That people don’t know how I’m single. Yet I’ve only been in two serious relationships in my life and have always been broken up with. I can’t find someone who wants to stay in my life. 

The only times I’ve been happy are when I’m in a romantic relationship and usually they end up being toxic and takes away my happiness Bc I have an anxious attachment style while they are avoidant. The last guy I was dating, seemed perfect. We literally had everything in common besides the fact that he didn’t want to be official even though he claimed he liked me so much and treated me like a gf. This was one of the first times I’ve ever set boundaries and have been the one to end the relationship because my needs weren’t being met. Usually the guy always ends things with me. 

I’ve worked on being less anxious, but it seems like I still can’t get out of that cycle. Once I think things have gotten better and I’ve done the work, I get into a relationship, and a similar cycle occurs. 

I’ve went on a couple dates since that guy and I ended things, and I can’t help but compared everyone to him. That guy and I were just so compatible. I’ve never been so similar to someone in my life. 

I honestly just feel super let down with dating. I don’t feel like there is anyone that I like or am interested in on dating apps and it’s so hard to find people in real life when I go to the gym or when I go out. 

I honestly just feel really miserable and I hate how my happiness depends on a guy and whether I am in a relationship or not.

I think this is absurd because it certainly doesn't match my behavior on dating apps.

Then I hear from men on here talking about how they get no matches, how if they write custom messages based on a woman's profiles they still get no replies, and how they can't even get a date or second date if they get a first. That matches more what I see in the real world of what men I know go through.

So who are all these guys women are complaining about? Who are the guys who have so many thousands of women trying to date them they just don't even care anymore and behave this way?

Do they even exist? Are they all tall white supermodels? Or is this just a fiction?

It reminds me of how women talk about how ""guys only say hey as an opener,"" but when I see any online dating experiments with a woman's profile (or any female friend/relative's profile) they get loads of well thought out messages.

I feel like there's some disconnect here that's not adding up.

Like there's one thread on here where a woman asked ""Why don't men make any effort in dating?"" and then she goes on to describe how she's chasing a guy who's stuck at home on a DUI and just keeps asking her to come over to his place but she can't find anyone else because ""he's so good looking.""

When I do have free time I prefer solitary hobbies: playing guitar, reading, painting, etc.
I hate bars, clubs, and loud crowded environments in general. I’ve always been quiet and reserved. I basically work and if I have free time I only seem to have energy for my solitary hobbies.
I like being alone for the most part and rarely feel the need for friends. But I’m only human and sometimes I do feel lonely and I know I don’t want to be alone forever.

I always had Tinder and Bumble downloaded on my phone but never really tried too hard to find dates or a relationship for a couple of years out of college. My father and mother started to really encourage me to find someone in my life so I tried a little harder to seek out a significant other. 

I had relative success with finding dates and etc. I would usually get about 2-3 dates with different girls each month. It was fun but most of those dates never really develop into anything serious.

On the girls that I really felt good connections and feelings about it always end up breaking my heart. Two of those girls have told me that they're talking and seeing other people after like the second date. Whenever they tell me, I am always flabbergasted and unsure where I stand in their eyes after those talks. I always feel like I am playing some sort of games where I need to prove how much I want them. It always feel really fake to me and I don't believe that love should be a competition between men but something organically felt between two people. 

The recent one really broke my heart. I just ended up deleting all my dating apps and getting off of social media. Had to really dig deep inside myself and ask myself what do I want and how do I want to live a life with others or even potential be alone forever. This subreddit helped me a lot that I am not the only one with dating woes.

I am going to step away from this for a bit to recollect and understand some things more clearly. Going to focus on the simpler things in life like studying for my certs and running for new PRs.

I replied on Wednesday and he didn't reply until Thursday. He apologized to me and said, he had a busy date at work. He told me that if we could plan a phone call this weekend.

What do I mean regarding online dating?

1. High quality photos of your great lifestyle. (Photographer)
2. Well fitted clothes.  Buy custom clothing if you want dates.
3. Have goals and a schedule that is more important than dates or dating.
4. Have pre-planned well thought out messages that you will copy and paste.  You are a Company looking to hire someone, not the other way around.  Your way or the highway.
5. Send no more than 5 messages to get a date.  If she wants more info, delete her, move on.
6. Control the date, planning, schedule, time ect from the beginning. If you lose this part and let her start planning you will lose the girl.

On dating apps when I mention that I don’t drink or smoke it’s a turn off for most and it makes me feel bad. I don’t have a problem dating/trying to get to know someone who does smoke or drink.

And every time people assume I don’t drink because I had an alcoholism problem before. I don’t drink or smoke like I used to anymore because of my mental health. I was at an all time low three years ago and when I quit those things and started going to the gym etc I really did improve my life. I became more stable and happy. I don’t smoke or drink just for myself and I’m proud of how far I’ve come and I don’t ever want to try and mess that up. But that’s hard to also open up about in the early stages of dating out of fear of judgement.
