Honestly it’s made me feel so much better to give up. It was an immediate load off of my chest. I can’t imagine having to feel the way I used to for any longer than I did. I’d probably have ended up roping before I even graduated college. 

 Now it’s something I don’t have to worry about. I don’t have to deal with girls telling me I’m too ugly for them, I don’t have to stress about if a girl likes me or not, I can delete every self esteem destroying dating app. I’m done. I don’t have to care anymore.

Never had one in college. I lost my virginity at 20 years old in a tinder hookup (also the first time I kissed a girl and saw one naked irl), but that was after 2 years on the app and she was the only one that ever agreed to go on a date with me from that app. I’ve also tried bumble and hinge. Last time I met someone from a dating app she and I texted and facetimed for like 2 months before meeting up. It went ok. The next day I texted her good morning and she had blocked me.

I’m in college now, my first co-ed experience since pre-school, and I have no clue how to talk to girls. Talking to girls in my classes about where they’re from, what their major is, etc. makes me seem boring (and desperate imo). Then they always bring up their ‘boyfriend’ to show they’re not interested.

I’m not unattractive. I don’t dress like a slob and I’m pretty physically fit (started lifting 2 years ago). I don’t have a bland personality by any metric, I’m just incredibly shy. My whole experience with dating has been pretty negative aside from getting lucky that one time. It’s to the point that I’m pretty resigned to just giving up.

Initial attraction is important so you can approach people and get to know them. If they don't seem interested or attracted to you then it's gonna be hard getting dates. That's my understanding, of course, you can disagree with me.

Here's a bit about myself:

I (21M) like to dress well, have a good hair cut, maintain my personal hygiene, and I like to have a positive attitude. Of course not all days are ""good, happy days"" and today's that day... not very optimistic, I mean. I'm 5'7"", dad bod (working to get in shape). People tell me that I look cute rather than hot and that they enjoy being around me as it makes them feel validated and safe.

I have had both successes and failures in the past and I flirt with women as well. The thing is I wanna put my best version out there.

Okay, so my question is as someone who is a 6-7 on the look range (or maybe even an 8 for some, on a good day) what can I do to put my best self out there?

What are some qualities that can help me stand out and put me in the category of ""definitely a good catch"" basically, haha?

I was like oh for us to go out a year later, this is meant to be, she made me feel so desired and we had like so much in common, we went skydiving, spent whole days together, and I hate that I still have her on my mind. It doesn’t help that I essentially lost my virginity to her and a couple weeks later she stopped wanting to see me bc it was getting too serious.

Now I just feel like I want that same level of intimacy so bad but it’s so hard to obtain that, and it feels impossible and like I can’t force for that to happen again. There was this one time where we were just in her bed staring into each other’s eyes giggling, we would see if our pupils dilated, I played with her hair, massaging her neck, and our bodies were just wrapped around each other, and I haven’t had that feeling again even after hooking up with two other girls since. 

Yesterday I met this girl and I’ve been really anxious and had felt like I lost a bit of my mojo once school started, but I met this girl and we danced and made out, slow danced a bit, i kissed her goodbye, snd we’re just chatting over messages but it feels a little bit pointless. I was so drunk I can’t really remember how exactly her face looks like, but I doubt it will go anywhere, I don’t like that’s she’s a year older (although who cares in the long term), and somehow it came up that she’s not really touchy snd she was only really touchy when we met bc she was drunk. 

I feel like there’s has to be so many check points, I have to like her, she has to like me, there’s a certain personality that I consider like relationship material (I really like goofy eccentric girls), she needs to want a relationship and that’s about it. I’m 21 so I know there’s time, but like I feel like the clock is clicking bc i haven’t been in one serious relationship. 

Again I hate that I think about that other girl sometimes, when she was just trying to have fun and I stopped meaning something to her, and now I don’t get excited unless I feel like those butterfly feelings in my stomach, I know they have them too, and I want that chemistry again with someone.

I’m a pretty low-key guy who wears his emotions squarely on his sleeves.

The problem is that what I described above is the exact opposite of me. I go on multiple dates with these women and as I get invested and want to take things to the next level I always feel the need to make my feelings known. This seems to without fail scare these women away and leave me a depressed mess who feels pretty hopeless.

Something just isnt clicking. Ive been on several tinder dates with girls but every time i completely chicken out on the sex part and just don't ask about it. Then after like the second date they just ghost me because i guess they determine that I'm too boring and that I'm not a real man. I don't know why I'm this way. I am honestly a life long self hater. Ive been like that from an early age like first or second grade i started realizing that i was probably not as good looking as all the other kids mostly because of my eye color being brown and hair being black and skin being caramel colored. So i kind of feel like i don't deserve it, and that i will never be good enough either for anyone to feel genuinely attracted to me or that i will never be good enough sexually. I never have sexual dreams or wet dreams as they call it. It might happen just once a year but that's it. The last time i watched porn was 2017 I think. I just one day realized ""why am i watching something ill never experience or deserve?"" And i have never gone back since then because it just makes me angry and i can't imagine myself doing what the people in the videos are doing. I do jerk off maybe twice a week but i don't watch porn while doing it, it's mostly in the shower. But this means I'll never be able to get married and have any kids or have a family because no girl wants to marry a person that's incapable of being intimate. I don't want a future all alone forever. I feel like when i imagine it in my head it seems easy but when i actually see the girl in person i just shut down and think ""so I'm going to have to see her naked and put my dick in there, how am i going to do that"" yup, laugh if you want, but that's just what happens to me.

I have been cheated on in various ways in every single relationship I’ve ever been in. I know this isn’t a coincidence, and I know my behavior plays a part somehow, but I also don’t think that’s an excuse for how people have treated me in the past.

But I thought I had finally figured out how to read the signs. I trusted my ex even though I always had my suspicions and that odd feeling in my gut, any time I confronted her ended up going nowhere. I didn’t realize how good she was at manipulating my short attention span, but she completely smokescreened me. 

I let her convince me that I was imagining things I had seen with my own eyes. And it is very troubling to me that I let someone—essentially a stranger—have unfettered access to my life and deepest secrets, even though it was pretty clear that she wasn’t a trustworthy person.

So at this point, I am having trouble trusting myself to differentiate between abusive/manipulative people and those who are acting genuinely. This has basically led to total reclusiveness, as I don’t really feel like humans in general are very honest.

Has anybody had this issue? How do you trust people when most of your relationships have ended in betrayal?

39,pn7i72,1631503842,This girl I was interested in started seeing another guy and know I’m so hurt,"Im hurting so much right now. 

There was this girl I really liked and I done a lot  of things for her. 

1. I always check on her mental health because she opened about her depression to me. 
2. Always use to walk her home at night 
3. When she was broke I bought her food and never asked for the money back 
4. She always comes to me and be like guy a said this about me you don’t think it’s true 
5. I always involve her when she get left out because she’s shy 
6. She always downplays her self because of lack of confidence and I always uplift her 

I was too slow as well I waited almost 6 months but I was actually going to ask her out on a date today I asked for a walk and at the end of the walk I was going to ask for a date. She said she was busy 

Got home and went on the phone with my friend and the stuff I heard really hurt me. She’s been seeing  this guy they aren’t officially dating but she travelled 4 times during the holiday to see and they had 4 dinners together which is basically 4 dates even though they not official. When I asked her to hangout in the half term she shut it down. Then this guy helps her move in by driving her self. Then they go cinema together today and that was the best I’ve ever seen her dress. 

I’m literally so hurt it took me ages to build up my confidence and I was ready to do it today. My friend even told me on the phone that she said I’m good guy but I  over  exaggerate a lot and that she could never date me. She always disses me behind my back after everything I done for her. 

I wanted a Genuine relationship with her I don’t care about having sex with her I was even in her room one time alone with her and nothing happen because I generally care about this person and wanted to build a long term relationship. 

I’m so hurt right now and I want to cry but I can’t cuz I don’t want to give this other guy any satisfaction and  I hate him with a passion. 

I know the comments are going to say there’s other girls and stuff but I’m just hurting so much right now she was definitely my favourite girl I meet so far I guess she don’t care about me since she always dissing me and cancelling plans and I never did anything to her. It’s so sad man 🥺. I’m obviously cut her off but I’m in so much pain I even still want to ask her out just for the closure and for getting my conscience up but there’s not even a point anymore 

One time a romantic song was playing and she whispered in my ear this could be us in the future why would she do and just leave me for the other guy and it’s not about being too slow she even told my friend she would never date me 

tl;dr build up confidence to finally ask this girl out and now she’s seeing another guy and I’m in so much pain",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pn7i72/this_girl_i_was_interested_in_started_seeing/

41,pn7rax,1631504854,"I am questioning my mental sanity right now, I feel like a crazy person","I had never had a girlfriend before,pretty much I asked my high school crush out and she said yes, initially she used the words ""we'll see how it goes"", 4 days in she was introducing me to her friends and family saying ""this is my boyfriend "" , at this point I got insane levels of imposter syndrome, I have adhd and this sent my emotions through the roof, I thought I had the green light essentially, then later on in the night Me and her got too drunk and her childhood friend showed up and started flirting with her while I was right there saying ""you look hotter now that you've done this"", my mentality at the time was ""It's her friend, she should be the one to say something, if I do something I look insecure"" so I did nothing, although I was trying to subtly send a message by touching and kissing her a lot, the next day I felt like a creep for doing that while drunk. She then proceeded to make a sexual joke involving me and that friend, in hindsight I'm concerned that she did this to scare me off because I was being to touchy with her. After she left I was left with her friend who told me ""I can't see you two lasting long"".

So I invited her for coffee and we agreed a few things, firstly that we wouldn't see her friend anymore, secondly that I would respect her more and not be too touchy in public. Honestly I was just nervous and being very irrational, but beyond this is where I essentially went on self destruct mode. We're now on day 6 of us dating,  we've been seeing eachother every day, i forgot to mention that she told me ""next time you have protection we can have sex"".... I didn't know what to do because I percieved the other night that I took a massive L by allowing him to flirt with her and then her making a sexual joke , my adhd impulsiveness kicked in, after telling me that she would come over to my hotel that i was working inI set out rose petals, candles ,music and champagne for our first time having sex.... yeah in hindsight WAYYY too much, I was overcompensating for what happened the night before, what's worse is that nowhere in my town sold candles so I had to ask the staff at the hotel for them, yeah involving my work colleagues in my sex life was a bad idea....Problem was it turns out she was out with her girlfriends drinking and she got too drunk and decided not to come by. I didn't want the room to go to waste so I sent a video of the room, she saw it expressed surprise and then immediately changed the subject.... then I got super insecure and realised how insane what I was doing was , I asked her why she changed the subject and what her feeling were now, I also essentially confessed that the confidence I displayed in asking her out wasn't real and I viewed her as out of my league, I saw the attraction drain from her face rapidly.... then the whole staff knew that I got rejected (because I involved them) and that information spread around.

The next day we went for coffee , I apologised for being so presumptuous and entitled , she accepted and verbalise that she wanted to carry on dating, but I could tell how awkward she felt, she said ""it seems like you're really into this whereas I'm just seeing how it goes"" and the initial energy we had at the start was gone, so I ended it. She's now blocked me.

Aside from my adhd I come across as fairly put  together on the most part.... but after this I genuinely think I am slightly insane, I find it hard to be rational when I'm stressed and the whole situation definitely made me stressed, but even so... this to me is next level stuff, seriously what was I thinking?!?! That I could win her over by acting like a serial killer?!?! And then involving my work colleagues in this?!?!? Wtf was I thinking.... really liked her and thought I would be better than this in my first relationship....  its not all my fault, in hindsight its weird that she wanted to call me ""her boyfriend "" after 4 days of dating, which made me think she was more up for stuff like this than I thought, but still I don't know how to deal with this as I'm in perpetual cringe mode right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pn7rax/i_am_questioning_my_mental_sanity_right_now_i/

Recently I’ve told him how I’m feeling, saying I’m a little insecure about my English and my “intelligence”. I don’t know how other girls would feel if they get those comments from guys and if they could laugh it off, but I don’t like it when it comes to “pretty” and “not smart” at the same time.

Anyway he said he didn’t mean anything serious with what he said, and if I couldn’t laugh at myself, I ain’t gonna like him in person.

Am I acting too serious about this?

We haven’t met yet, lockdown of course. But I’m usually be said as funny and friendly and chill by many people and I actually am. Not sure if I’m making this a big deal as I still want to meet him in person after lockdown.

Sure my English is not perfect, but getting the jokes-native jokes, I probably should get a very highhhhhh certificate I guess.

Unfortunately I’m not very good at showing sexual interest, and I rushed a kiss at the doorway as I was dropping her off to make sure she knew I was interested in more than a platonic friendship.

46,pn82sv,1631506079,My ex reached out after 3 months no contact…,"After the most devastating breakup I’ve (29F) ever endured in June, my ex (27M) reached back out on Thursday. He had me blocked on IG/FB until early last month but hadn’t reached out until now. We are long distance of 3 hours. The breakup was completely random and he dumped me like garbage suddenly with no care for me or my emotions. He claimed at the time he was too stressed but refused to give me details, communicate like an adult and shut me out completely ice cold from his life. Well, after a summer of pain and hurt thinking about him every day he texted me apologizing and asking to speak to me. We talked and it was interesting… He ultimately said he ended it due to stress piling up mainly from a legal battle he was having with his ex wife regarding cyst of their son. He didn’t want me involved so he didn’t tell me any of it. At the time right before the breakup he had mentioned he was stressed due to work but refused to say anything else. In some ways I find this very hard to believe that it was only a custody battle and I think there’s more he’s not telling me. Plus how do I know he didn’t date some girl all summer, got bored with and lonely and reached back out. He claims he didn’t do anything with another girl but I don’t know if I believe that. He claims he’s missed me and thought about me all the time and still cares about me. Then why wait 3 months to contact me? I have more questions and need more explanations, I’m not making any decisions right now. He smashed my heart into a hundred pieces causing me enormous amounts of pain and now my walls are back up. If we continued again down a road of more I don’t know if I could fully trust him not to get stressed and dump me out of the blue again. I also have no idea what it would look like for him to regain my trust. This is an abnormal situation and things would not continue traditionally. He would need to go to therapy to improve how he deals with stress. Because I assume he’s made no effort to change or improve himself. Otherwise he would repeat the past. 

All of this is extremely confusing for me. It’s tugging on my heart strings. Half of me hoped he would come back and half of me thought I’d never ever hear from him again. I cannot deny I’ve missed him and seeing him on FaceTime again got me missing him. I’ve missed him all summer, I’ve thought about him everyday. Ironically the night before he reached out I was crying about him and had a dream about him. Various friends have given me different and good advice to think about. Ultimately this is now up to me. I feel stressed and unsure. But I need to talk more to him. This may take time and patience. If he’s not willing or patient or says anything negative or put me down or I find out he’s lying then it’s done forever. Any advice here?

47,pn83wo,1631506203,Best date I’ve ever been on but what next?,"I’m 21 f and he’s 24 m. 
We are mutual friends and had met once before (8 months ago). It started off on some sexual footing without really getting to know each other. I had a problem with the sexual nature at the time and he apologised about it saying he’s not that type of guy.

Until maybe 2-3 months ago I had messaged him a couple times to hang out but he lives quite far away (hour away) and I didn’t view him in high enough regard to chase it up so no meet up was ever established. Every time he used to say he’ll definitely message me when he’s near my area but he genuinely never was. He’s quite principled so I don’t think he would purposely be deceiving or disrespectful. Nonetheless he would watch everything I did on social media and that’s the predominant way we stayed connected.

Then about a week ago I asked to catch up regarding something purely business related stating blatantly that I wasn’t asking him out this time. I genuinely had in mind to be only professional and nothing more. So we hung out for the first time properly one-to-one a couple nights ago over some wine and the conversation progressed from business talks to personal demons. 

Just upon talking about deeper topics very personal to us, us getting along extraordinarily smoothly (not a single dull or awkward moment and convo flowing great) and some attraction vibes (eye contact) I mentally assumed that it was a bit of a date. And at the end he wanted to pay “as the man” so that confirmed it as somewhat romantically meaningful. It definitely was the best “date” I’ve ever had in my life. And I know he was very impressed by me on both a personal and professional level (particularly personal - he was vocal about his positive view of me). There was no kiss/sex/physical intimacy, but I didn’t expect it to go that way (yet!) considering our little issue 8 months ago. 

At the end, He did say he wanted to catch up again and I responded with the same. He replied to something on my social media story the next morning, we spoke very briefly about the evening and he said he’s very curious about me. I reciprocated the sentiment. 

I understand I need to be patient. But...
What should the next steps forward be? How long should I wait for him to reach out to catch up again? What are some other signs to look out for about getting or not getting a second date?

However, seeing that my ""type"" is toxic, gaslighting and abusive, and usually unemployed, it was kind of refreshing to see a guy that was absolutely nothing like any of the guys I am usually seen with. He made me feel safe, there was literally zero pressure for physical intimacy. He loves his mom, has his own house and works for/with his dad's company. He's a nice guy.

However he shows zero interest in getting to know me. I have picked up hobbies such as fishing, gambling, football, all for the sake of getting to know him. Meanwhile he has *admitted* that he is not even attempting to get to know my interests. Basically he wants me to join him in his life, but he's not willing to join me in mine. 

He's bought me flowers, and came over to my place *once* while I went over to his place six or seven times... It was obvious that he want me to go to his place again, and he tried to find an excuse not to come over after we went out for dinner, but I put my foot down. (And just in case anyone's wondering, my place is very clean. My apartment is literally as many square feet as his house.) I'm really tired of exerting my energy to meet him where he is at, while he does literally nothing but the bare minimum for me.

I have known this girl for 4 years now, we are starting to hang out more, and I really hope she knows that I like her, and not just as friends."," So as background, I've known this girl since 8th grade, and I have asked her out before, so she knows I did like her. She wasn't willing then, but we have remained on good terms. I wasn't able to talk to her last year, and I started to see her again the year. I told her I wanted to spend more time together, and she invited me to walk to her house with her after school, but due to our schedules I wasn't able to walk with her till a few days later, so within those few days I told her we should hang out some time for a few hours when she was free, and she told me she was free this weekend. We made plans to go to the movies, but then she got into a fight with her grandpa, so I asked if we could just hang out at her place, as to be more relaxing, and we planned to hang out that Saturday. I finally got to walk with her that Friday and she told me she appreciated me walking with her, and I told her I was glad to and enjoyed it a lot, and she said I was welcome to walk with her anytime. That Saturday she had work till 4pm, and I texted her after she got off work and she said that her best friend (who she hasn't been able to see in over a year) asked if she could come over and spend the night. She said that she would try to work something out so we could still hang out, but after a while I just told her that she should spend time with her friend (although I didn't tell her this and I don't know if she knows, but her friend hates me for some reason) and I didn't want to make it akward for her. I'm pretty confused overall, since I'm almost sure she knows I still like her, and I dont know that she would just be willing to hang out alone with someone she knows likes her unless she likes me back. It's had me really anxious all week, and I'm really hoping I don't come off as super bothersome about the whole ordeal, but I'm gonna keep trying to find some time for us to be together. My self esteem is pretty low and I've never had a girlfriend or even really thought of any girl other than her as long as I've known her, so I don't have a lot of confidence, and it's hard not to confess how I really feel for her when I tell her that I enjoyed hanging out or had a good time, and I don't feel like that's the right approach with her because before when I told her straight up how I felt she turned me down, saying that she just isn't ready for a boyfriend, (and to my knowledge she hasn't had a boyfriend or girlfriend since I've been talking to her,).
  Im hoping to talk to her in person tomorrow, because I can't communicate very well through text, and try to get some better understanding of the whole situation, but I'm gonna let her take her time with the whole situation.

60,pn96sz,1631510818,Bumble Dating advice,"Met a girl on Bumble. Had a great first date. “This is obviously going well.” Came back to my place to hang out. We didn’t kiss, cuddle, etc. I went for a kiss at the end of the date and she responded with “ kiss on the first date? We’re you raised by wolves” and then gave me a long hug. After she got home, she texted me “Was nice to meet you, thank you again for the drinks! Ill have to buy you dinner sometime!!”

I was asleep. Next morning I text her “It was nice to meet you too, dinner sounds nice! What are you thinking?” 

*She didn’t respond 4 hrs later and it’s 1pm. Found out she unmatched me on bumble. * (hindsight, apparently this is not uncommon after meeting up)

Me: If you’re feeling indecisive about meeting up again, that’s totally fine! No pressure. (we were joking all night about how her indecision was her defining trait). It was a pleasure getting to know. Good luck with school and opening up your business! 

She responds saying “Ah sorry its been a busy morning! Oh…well thanks 😐”
Me: *called to clear things up.*
Her: *declines call*Sorry im with my sister and her kids rn!
Me: Oh I assumed since we unmatched on bumble.
Called to say I enjoyed my night with you. Would take you up on your dinner offer.
Her: For sure, I’ll look up some places and hopefully in a couple weeks we can schedule a day!!
Me: That works. Thanks for working with my busy schedule. Get in touch with me when you find a decent spot with free parking!
Her: Will do and of course!

Don’t really know what to make of this situation.
My current assessment: she likes me but also has doubts (maybe I came on too strong trying to kiss her). She unmatched me but kept her bumble so she’s keeping her options open. She’s a slow moving and indecisive person. 

Would love people’s view on this. What do you think is going on? Why “couple weeks” then schedule a day? Is she just being polite and hoping we never follow up? Is she just not sure yet and keeping her options open by having time to go on other dates between then?

69,pnaoaz,1631517906,Any advice? In a bit of a panic... :-(,"  

So, I’m in a bit of a bad way and can’t stop panicking. I (male, 33 years old) have been in a relationship with this guy (42 years old) for almost 2 years now. This was his first relationship. He came out about 6 years ago, and his parents reacted quite badly (his dad started crying and they didn’t talk about it again, and his mom just told him not to tell anyone else in the family). His sister (44) has never been in a relationship, which I’ve always found strange. They both depend quite a lot on their parents, and until recently my boyfriend’s mom would do all his laundry/ironing and most of his cooking. She’d almost come to clean his flat, where we both live (I moved in a few months ago). 

Anyway, since I met him, he has had a tendency to see things negatively. He basically doesn’t enjoy anything – going out, his job (he’s a doctor), often I get the sense he doesn’t really enjoy our relationship. He kind of just seems neutral/negative about everything in life. He’s said a few times, jokingly, you’ve complicated my life; life was much easier when I was single (which is basically his entire life). He’s always complained that we don’t have enough sex (it’s true, some weeks when we’ve both been working lots, we’ve only had sex once a week), and when we do, it doesn’t meet his expectations (he’s by no means a very sexual person, as you can imagine of someone who doesn’t get a lot of enjoyment out of life in general). He has also been hassling me to go to the gym, and he says I need more muscles for him to be properly attracted to me. My friends say he’s seen too many movies and doesn’t have any experience, so has completely unrealistic expectations (he also compares himself to everyone going).

Anyway, I’m from UK (we live in Spain) and want to go back, as my job prospects are dismal in Spain (I’m self employed and the conditions are horrendous). We’ve talked about it, and he applied for a job at a hospital in England. He was offered the job and now just has to pass an English exam to get his license to practice, before starting. At the same time, he’s studying for a public exam to get a fixed-term position in Spain, as he says he doesn’t want to leave Spain without having a job to come back to (here, civil servants can leave and come back to a job with their name on it ha). Now he’s saying he can’t leave his family (btw, I can’t go their house when he goes because of his dad’s homophobia, so I feel like, I don’t have my family here, and can’t have a relationship with his either, which is shit). He literally is just thinking about his needs and I’m pretty sure that if he had to choose between carrying on working in Spain or our relationship (in the UK), he’d choose the former. I fact I’m almost positive, as not once has he said something like “let’s do this together”, “what do you need?”, and just goes on and on about how he can’t leave his family, his apartment, his current hospital, etc. The way I work in relationships just isn’t like that – I think a couple should be a team who embark upon projects together and are flexible in terms of the other’s needs. Maybe, I’m being unrealistic as well on that point, and that’s not how couples work.

Anyway, yesterday everything he looked at me, he’d kiss me and say “such a shame” or something along those lines and look sad. Then yesterday, he said, he’ll have to talk one day about where we’re going. So I’m now in a panic. I live with him in his flat, and I don’t know if he’s going to want to break up. Am I right in thinking it’s almost a given at this point that he will break up with me? Any other advice would be very greatly welcomed 😊. I do love him, and don’t want to lose him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnaoaz/any_advice_in_a_bit_of_a_panic/

71,pnb0zn,1631519801,Can someone help me better understand this girl I’m dating?,"I’m in my late 20s and she’s in her mid 20s.

I’ve been dating a girl for about 2 months now and I’ve never quite dated anyone like her before. 

Now, I’ve dated a lot of women, gone on a lot of dates and have enough experience with different cultures to have a good sense for dating new people.

She’s the most quiet person I’ve ever dated. Usually, I ask a lot of questions and am genuinely interested in the people I date and they talk a bunch. 

She answers my questions and is very pleasant and laughs at jokes, but almost goes silent after a question is answered. Without asking follow-ups of her own.

It’s not that she isn’t interested, from what I can tell. She is always engaged and excited to go on dates together. 

But she is shy on a level I haven’t experienced before. Someone stiff, might be a little awkward but I haven’t seen her outside of 1-on-1 dates.

We hardly text. And when we do, it’s to schedule our next date and hangout. I’m fine with not texting, since I’m more of a caller, but we don’t call either.

We’ve had sex, and make-out passionately together. I really enjoy our physical chemistry.

She recently invited me on an exotic trip outside the country. I’ll meet almost her entire immediate family. 

She told me she’s never been in a relationship, and never introduced a guy to her family before. 

Despite all of this, I still can’t read her at all or how she feels. I’ve never dated a girl that was this shy, or at least who didn’t open up more after a lot of dates.

I don’t know much about her on a deeper level, her insecurities, her flaws. She doesn’t know mine either, but she hasn’t asked.

I guess I say all this to ask, is she just very shy/awkward and doesn’t know how to communicate with dates? Anyone with experience like this before?

I’ve never seen her interact with friends or family so I’m excited for our trip to get to learn about her more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnb0zn/can_someone_help_me_better_understand_this_girl/

I've been banned from Hinge because of my ex-girlfriend. She harassed me for more than a month after we broke up, sending me about a hundred unsolicited texts, showing up to my domicile to make a scene, and depositing various objects in my mailbox, hoping I'd get back to her. When she realized there was no hope, she brutally turned against me, trying to tarnish my reputation and pretending that I had been violent towards her.

She managed to get me banned from both OKCupid and Hinge (the two apps I was using at the time I met her and thus told her about). I have no idea what she told them, since the apps don't want to tell you what you're accused of. Nevertheless, I sent to Hinge a police report detailing what she had done to me, and, less than a week later, I can use my Hinge account again.

76,pnbee1,1631521860,Regret not dating a great guy (Guy Y) at 27. I'm 33 and still single while he is with another woman. I wish I could move past thinking he was the perfect guy for me. Any tips?,"Before I met Guy Y, I got engaged to a guy X (arranged marriage proposal) but I was just not feeling any chemistry with Guy X. The way arranged marriages work is that you aren't given enough time to know each other. Guy X seemed really nice and his family was putting pressure on us to get engaged. I was stupid enough to give into his family's pressure. But in all honesty the chemistry/click was just not there.

Thankfully we parted ways before we got married - my therapist asked me to not settle and to not give into pressure. She also told me that chemistry is essential for a successful relationship.

A year after that through OLD I met Guy Y. He was nice and even handsome but a few things stopped me.

1. He made a comment about how American women sleep around and aren't cultured.
2. He told me that his friends are homophobic so he brings up topics around gay men in front of them to make them feel uncomfortable.

I felt he was old school and judgemental to think the above things and to have friends who are homophobic.

3. This is superficial I know - he had an Indian accent which I don't mind at all. But he would say a few words with such a thick accent that would turn me off. 

4. I had not dated much so I was not yet good at sex and in fact I was a bit scared of it. And I don't think I was ready for all of that yet.

After a few dates, I decided to not pursue him.

That was when I was 27. Since then I've used OLD, discovered my sexuality, and really enjoy the American way of dating- where you get to know someone, are allowed to look for a true connection and chemistry.

However, I deeply regret not dating Guy Y. He was both nice and attractive to my eyes. I'm yet to meet someone who is both nice and that I'm attracted to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnbee1/regret_not_dating_a_great_guy_guy_y_at_27_im_33/
77,pnbmc3,1631523078,Telling the guy that I’ve been seeing that I’m dating someone else,"It’s a lie but it’s the only way to let go. He will never take me seriously and I’ll never be good enough. He’s 31 and can’t commit or make a real connection. 

We have spent so much time together and even gone to another state together. Unfortunately, he still cares more about traveling and not being tied down. He’s “finding” himself. It hurts because when he does leave I’m just something he’s leaving behind and he has seen what he has needed to see. The time spent  doesn’t matter but the need to leave and explore greener pastures does. Being a nomad isn’t attractive when you leave a wake of hurt and regret behind you. 

It’s too bad he doesn’t think I want to travel  despite trying to finish nursing school. I know other couples who want to make it work. He just doesn’t want to make it work with me. 

That’s why I’m just pretending I’m going to date with someone else. Because at least I can make seem for once someone wants to fight for me. It’s not like he will care anyway. He will say “oh okay I care about you.  Sorry I couldn’t give you what you need.” Like a typical fuck boy who thinks he did nothing wrong. Done seeing those tinder notifications turn up.

I have completed my Army training, started a career, got my own place, and am financially independent. Online dating sucks, so what’s my current mission to go from bachelor to stable, long-term relationship?

Some possibly helpful information:
- I’m super Bi. I like dudes, I like girls, I like humans. I’ve got a pension for femboys and tattooed, goth/punk girls.
- I’m a teacher, so I have a pretty normal schedule (7am to 4pm)
- No drugs, and I’m sober (but I don’t care if my partner drinks). 
- I live in Northern Louisiana
- I’m Christian, but don’t expect that out of my partner.

TL; DR - Single Bi Man wants to become not single Bi man.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pncc8o/whats_the_play_here/

95,pnerwe,1631537493,I've got a date with the new counter girl at the ranch store,"There's a ranch up in the mountains about 12 miles away from my (19M) house, and out by the road they have a store, which is open from 9:00am to 3:00pm every day and sells produce, meat, snacks, and drinks.

I've been their occasionally over the years, but lately I've been going over there a lot more often because there's a new girl (19) working at the counter, and I like her.

She just moved into town about month and a half ago, and I met her about a month ago. We hit it off pretty well, and every time I go there now, I always end up chatting with her. She's fun to talk to, easy on the eyes, and super sweet. After about a week, I managed to get her number, and we've texted a lot.

There's a white rose bush outside the ranch store, and one day I decided to pick one when I was about to go inside, and give it to her, just as a nice gesture. She happily accepted it, and when I was outside I could see her through the window holding the rose and looking at it with a smile. Now, every time I come I make sure to pick a rose.

Well now, this coming Friday night, we have a dinner date at the one single nice restaurant in this small town. Our first real formal date. Wish me luck!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnerwe/ive_got_a_date_with_the_new_counter_girl_at_the/
96,pnetre,1631537676,Confused about this guy at work,"I was attending a party at work and there was this guy that is now working in a different department. We used to be on the same team in the past but we only worked there for a couple of months.
We clicked (professionally) very well, we never discussed personal stuff other than small talk but he was willingly giving me feedback on everything and he was always supportive. 

Last weekend he texted me that he’s coming to this work party and maybe we could get a drink there to which I said yes sure. I knew that he’ll be there with his girlfriend and it didn’t feel like he was hitting up on me (although I’m a bit attracted to him but not willing to make any move since I know he currently has a girlfriend even though their relationship doesn’t seem so serious). I met him accidentally and we only had a small talk for about 2 minutes or even less, no drink was mentioned. He was the one that ended the conversation. After a couple of hours I received a voucher for free drinks and I didn’t want to drink anymore (and my work friends were kinda waisted) so I texted him if he wants that voucher. I assumed he’ll use it with his girlfriend anyway and it was definitely not an invite.
He opened the message 3 days later and didn’t even bother to reply something like “sorry I didn’t see your message” or anything. 

I’m wondering if I’ve done something wrong or offensive? Isn’t his behavior a bit weird?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnetre/confused_about_this_guy_at_work/
