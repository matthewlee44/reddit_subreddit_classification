This was the first time we broke physical contact and I think the cinema would be the good old school thing to do, where we could escalate the physical aspect that much more, without initiating sex yet (touching legs, making out etc) I just think this might be better than going to the park or dinner. The last 3 dates were bowling, quiz night and fireworks display. (she initiated the last date)

There's 2 women (early to mid 20's) that live a couple doors down. Since day 1, I have ran into one of them quite a bit, like coincidentally opening our door and leaving at the same time many times, and just seeing her around the complex or on the street. We usually just exchanged smiles or said hello and kept it movin'. Eventually I introduced myself and asked her what her name was since I run into her so much. She's extremely attractive, but I haven't flirted or acted on anything, not trying to be creepy or that obvious about it. It seems to be pretty common for people my age to just ignore or pretend to not see the same people they see day in day out every day, but I find that odd and usually acknowledge people I run into all the time and introduce myself. I saw her as she was coming in and I was leaving a couple times and I said hello, and when she answered it was that kind of sound where you have a frog in your throat or need to clear your throat, kinda funny cause it happens to me all the time if I'm nervous to talk to someone (not that she was necessarily nervous but it's the same sound) and she kinda mumbled something incoherent and scurried off.

Over the past couple weeks, I've seen her a couple times on the street outside our building and in the complex outdoor area and she sort of pretends she doesn't see me or pulls out her phone after seeing me from a distance. Sometimes I've seen her look and then look the other way, like when you see someone you know in public but don't want to acknowledge them. Also, her roommate will do similar things but even more obviously, like immediately pulling out phone or looking down/other way (towards a wall) if I'm in the hallway or outside. Not that I need to speak with my neighbor every time we see each other, but it seemed like obvious avoidance. Again, I have not done anything but said hello a few times over 2 months and introduced myself, but I've ran into her probably 50 times.

just yesterday, I saw her a couple times in the same day and she gave me a huge smile both times, actually said hello coherently, and didn't seem awkward at all.

Probably sounds like I'm a lunatic, but can I gather anything from this or am I way overthinking it?

And for my whole life dating has never worked out. 

In Middle and High school, I can chalk things up to being a dorky hopeless romantic who saw to many movies, and needed a better idea of how reality worked. 

During College, definitely gained more life experience. Also, on my part I did sideline dating (which probably turned out for the best since there was a lot of drama at me school, so bullets dodged I guess). Did venture out a few times, but this I started to notice the problem. When it came to finding compatible others it was just a list of either being already taken or just being too far away.

Post College (as recent as last year), things were staring to look up. Found someone of interest that was near by. We went out, hung out, and talked. But this was part of the getting to know each other phase, not actual dating. It was for the best that we never did date because that person was, for a lack of better words, toxic. Not aggressively toxic. It's that they simply a drama magnet that dumped all their problems on to me. I'm happy I had to will to get away from that person, it was still disheartening that things did not work out. 

This year, I started out being more proactive. Got back on the dating apps and found a new one I liked. Was getting more matches and conversations but nothing leading to a real date. Until I found someone I really clicked with. As nice as that was there was the problem that they were the next state over. Still we managed to talk and video chat for a good chunk of the year, even planning to meet sometime. But things fell through when a few months ago they had done some soul searching and realized that they were not in a good place in their life to date. They didn't want to drag me in a relationship where they couldn't give the proper time and effort. As much as I admired and respected this, I was will left heartbroken and asking why things don't work out. 

 Over all I know that statistically and from experience there are those who do find me attractive. I'm not completely socially inept. I know can communicate and initiate relationships. All of this to say theoretically I'm no better or worse off than anyone else who can obtain a relationship. 

But when you're alone and unsuccessful for this long, you can't help but feel that you just have the worst luck. That you'll never find anyone no matter who much you change or try. It's a growing fear. Not just one of being alone, but one of losing hope and becoming resentful towards others. Recently I've begun a to feel an iota of envy towards friends and co-workers when they bring up their SOs. I've been hating myself for it. I don't want to become that person. It scares me to become that person. But again all of this just has been wearing on me. I don't know what to do. I know I'm not alone, but I just don't know what to do.

We really hit it off, sending text paragraphs daily, updating each other on what we are doing throughout the day when we have time. We‚Äôre both 28 years old, so although we don‚Äôt text constantly, our texts are meaningful and I‚Äôd say we know a lot about each other and ask plenty of questions.

We eventually met for the first time this week. We both enjoy outdoor activities, so we decided to go for a a long walk in the afternoon. This definitely confirmed the chemistry we have. We both laughed a lot and had a great time. I drove her home and she invited me in. We sat on the sofa and talked for ages, but she had plans later that evening so I left to let her get ready. I didn‚Äôt even hug her which I was kicking myself for, but I was so nervous. 

She suggested another walk in 3 days time, but a day later I messaged her asking if she fancied dinner instead. Again, great time. I also paid which she was tried to stop me doing, but was very thankful. I drove her home again, it was very late so I didn‚Äôt expect an invite in which was fine. She said she would message me about going for another walk or something next week. 

I guess I just want to know if I‚Äôm on the right tracks. We‚Äôre both quite shy, we also both came out of long term relationships this year and it‚Äôs been nice getting to know someone on such a deep level. But I don‚Äôt want to ruin it because I really like this girl a lot. I feel like since I‚Äôve been single I‚Äôm really struggling with wondering if what I‚Äôm doing is right in terms of ‚Äúmaking a move‚Äù or if I should just continue to play it cool and keep getting closer to this girl and not force anything. The thought of going in to kiss her scares the hell out of me and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of doing it. How do I even get close to her?

I know it‚Äôs probably going well, but I get so nervous about it all and even wonder if she just sees me as a friend. I don‚Äôt think either of us are the type to physically flirt in person which makes it a lot more challenging.

I‚Äôm so broken. When we first started dating I asked him if he wanted a serious relationship that will evetually lead to marriage, because I was over casual flings. He said he wanted it with me so we got into a relationship. This night he broke up with me after dating for 6 months because our relationship is becoming ‚Äútoo serious‚Äù. He told me he loved me and that he never felt like this for a girl before since this was his first real relationship and that he wants to end up with me later in life BUT since he‚Äôs in his early twenties he wants to be single for some time. Such a shitty thing to say to someone. But here‚Äôs more important thing I wanted to tell you with this post:

I literally had a gut feeling that we‚Äôll break up tonight, I didn‚Äôt even feel like meeting him. I also had a feeling that he became distant the last 2 months and because of that I felt so anxious. I asked him if everything was fine and he assured me nothing is wrong only to tell me today that he felt like this for the past TWO MONTHS. Literally when I started to feel something was wrong. And the last thing that give me really bad anxiety was one of his girl friends. I had a feeling something was going on between them, so the whole time I felt nauseaus when I saw her, I lost weight, had a panick attack and was throwing up almost every day. I was silly to think it was just my overthinking and anxiety since I‚Äôve never been that anxious in my life. Today he told me she invited him to her place a couple of times while we were together and he told me  he didn‚Äôt go but that I was right about having a bad feeling about her. I feel so stupid for ignoring my gut feelings and convincing myself I was overthinking. I posted on here so many times asking for advice because he was acting distant and I deleted it every time because I didn‚Äôt want him to find those posts. I feel like I‚Äôve been played honestly. He said he wants us to stay friends since he doesn‚Äôt want to lose a person like me.

And what I mean by geeks is someone who is obsessed with things like Super Heroes, Video Games, and computer stuff.

And just a side note I am actually a geek myself, and I am learning programming and animation to be a game developer with the hopes of starting a studio.

I'm also 6,4, lean or skinny body(I'd day lean), and have a deep voice along with kind of maybe an ovalish faceshape and I have blue eyes. 

I'm basically trying to figure out if I am someone's type or not because it seems like most women like guys who are kind of lean or skinny

Also I'm going to give out my dating history, so basically I didn't get any crushes until I was about 16 and before I was 16 I did actually date a couple people but rather than me approaching them, they instead approached me and I dated my first girlfriend for about a year and I thought she was cute but then we broke up because she moved away and I didn't have a phone to contact her, and that was in middle school, and then during my sophomore year of high school(which is when I got my first phone btw) Another girl thought I looked hot and one day when I pulled out my phone she actaully took it out of my hand and put in her number and I was like ""Ummm okay then"" and so then we started texting and we both had some of the same interests but then after a month we just outright ghosted eachother and never talked again and broke up, and honestly I think there was multiple reasons for that but I'm not going to go into those though. And then about a year later when I was 16 I just outright decided that I was going to find another girlfriend and so I went onto YouTube for advice and tried to date another girl and boi did I make alot of mistakes trying to find a girlfriend lol.

Also I'm 18 now btw and have officially graduated.

An example of that is a time a couple days ago when me and some friends of mine are discussing a game that we are making and one of my friends was discussing something while I was thinking about something else that he said and so therefore he had to repeat the thing that he was talking about after my brain went randomizer mode lol.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124565,public,self,For those of you women out there.

I (M21) was seeing this girl (F20) since the end of August. We were becoming quite close, but out of nowhere things kind of unraveled starting around mid-October.   


Although I guess it wasn't really out of nowhere: during this time, she mentioned that she may not be romantically inclined. However, she did say that she was also open to intimacy (cuddling/hugging/etc.) among other things in previous times. Heck, we even came up with a ""companionship"" compromise.   


She was struggling over Halloween weekend, so I brought her some flowers to cheer her up. She said they were very sweet. Two hours later, she says: ""I think we should stay friends and I'm sorry if I led you on.""   


Mind you, she is also in school and is dealing with familial issues as well. After trying to explain how I felt about the situation while hearing her feelings out, she said that she didn't have anything else to say. I mistakenly didn't take the hint and continued texting her about my thoughts on this with zero hostility or malintent. I thought she was done with her side, not the *entire situation.* 

It's been five days since I last heard from her. We were both open to the idea of us still being friends as well, but nothing has occurred since then. 

I've since archived our text conversations, and while I am still open to being her friend, I also understand that she might need some time to herself.

It's just so hollow to try and date. To open empty apps, void of likes and matches, change up some photos, hoping they'll give you some matches.
It's shit to keep being on the apps, opening them and spending hours mindlessly swiping and reading profiles that will ignore you just because you hope deep down that all it takes is one good match and it really is a numbers game. 

I hate it all. No one ever crushed on me. I miss feeling hopeful, being motivated to improve myself for my eventual romance, to see others live their happily ever after. 

I feel like shit these days about it. I keep grinding the apps even though it's been months since the last like in the hope that my one person, my twin flame, my soul mate will like me and we'll match and everything will be okay. The loneliness and fears, gone. 

But deep down I know. It's bullshit. They're just emptying my wallet and selling me false hopes. I'm an idiot. I deeply want to know what it's like to love and be love. But it's not in my story... 

Besides. If someone finally ends up with me, they'll just be settling and dream of the one who got away, then they'll look into my eyes and wonder where they went so wrong. But they'll stay. Knowing they failed to get a handsome man. 

I'm tired of walking alone. Knowing I'm not handsome or funny or good enough for someone to hold my hand and tell me it's gonna be okay. No one would accept my flaws because they love me.

We met at work. She asked me out. It's her first relationship, first kiss everything. I've been in both serious and casual relationships.

Things between us have been great. Although we don't have a lot in common (different careers, maybe the age gap), but we've always had something to entertain us. We meet twice a week and started slow on calls but it's almost daily/alternate day. But the thought of not having much in common stays in the back of my head.

Yesterday we met at a hotel and both of us went down on each other. It's the first time for her (we didn't have sex). But the whole experience of going out to a hotel as well as the going down was a first for her. We come from a conservative country and her parents are all the more conservative.

She seemed nervous at first (although she was pretty keen for the hotel plan), and enjoyed the whole experience. However, she was nervous today and texted about ""whether she lost her virginity"" (owing to misinterpretation on the internet and maybe lack of sex education in our country). But I spoke to her and she seemed to seem happy again.

So were supposed to talk on call at night and I smoked a joint a few mins earlier. Now I've been smoking on and off for a few years with a few weeks as a tolerance break in between. I smoked today after 2 weeks.

However, before the call, I was somewhere hoping she'd bail out, so we don't talk and I don't have to make an excuse. I was nervous we don't have anything to talk about.

She did call and the call did seem dry. Normally we talk for 2+hours easily but today, there was so much awkward silences and the conversation definitely felt forced. It lasted for around 15 mins but even that was a drag.

I hoped she could lead the conversation but at a point, I rambled random things about my day, and I could sense her getting bored.

I'm unsure if the weed added to my anxiety and actually made things awkward (she doesn't know I smoke and I've spoken to her a lot of times after being high). Or that, we don't have much to talk in common (the fear in the back of my head since start), and we should talk less to have more to talk about in future, if it makes sense?

I do know I'm attached to her and we both have pretty strong feelings. Or maybe the hotel aspect and her first time going down experience, caused her to shut off. Since the awkwardness was definitely not just from one end.

We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I realize that I have a bit of a crush on her, and so I start to pay attention to her out the corner of my eye. Thats when I notice she stares back, and its quite a lot. There will be times where if her friends make a joke, she'll start laughing, and turn her head away from her friends to look at me. If she leans over to get something out of her bag, she'll look, she'll look over her shoulder if she passes me in the hall, her eyes will linger for a moment if she looks over to the whiteboard, and sometimes she'll just stare for a few seconds. This goes on for about 2-3 weeks before I do anything.

In one of my classes (physics), we are free to work with whoever on assignments, and she sat with a few of my friends so I went over to her table. I could get her to laugh a few times, but its when everyone else did so I don't know if that was too special. We have to present to the class how to solve assignments on the worksheet with our groups, so the whole class gets to ask questions and know the process of the problem. When i'm over there, I ask the group at large if I should stay there to present with them or go back to my table, and she's the first one to tell me to stay. There is another girl at that table, and she'd look at me instead of the other girl when the other girl was talking to see how much I was listening to the other girl, though I hardly talked to the other girl. She'll turn and talk to me if I end up next to her before class, and there was a time when one of my friends invited me over to her table, and she was leaning over the table to see if I was coming.

So I see all of these signs, and one day after a class where I went over to her table I ask for her number. She gives it to me, and I text her that weekend. No response. I check with one of our mutual friends that it is the correct number, and it is, but that friend said that sometimes she hasn't gotten a response either. When she first gave me her number, I immediately sent a text so she had my number, but she saw me send that text, so she knows it's me. The issue is, now we've moved seats in physics so I don't have a excuse to go talk to her, she doesn't sit with my friends anymore.

About a week later, still no response, so I ask her after class if she got the text. The text was a question about soccer since we both play soccer, and she said she got the text but was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back, and just forgot. The weird thing is, that week she still was staring a lot. She was glancing over a lot in the first class, and when she had to give thoughts on the poem she was looking at me out the corner of her eye the whole time, and not the teacher (the teacher is in one corner of the room, and I am on the same wall but other corner, and she sits in the middle of the opposite side but facing me). She did that any time when she had to share thoughts in that class last week. In physics, she's glancing over a lot too, and one time when I was presenting with my new group, she was leaning over her table to watch, and didn't do that for other groups. We also were in the hall with our groups one class, and I was behind her group, and she repeatedly looked over her should back at my group, and when I moved to her other shoulder, she started looking over that shoulder.

She is a shy person, she'll talk really quiet when presenting or meeting new people, but she's not shy around friends and not shy around me. We'll make eye contact a few times each class, but I make sure to look only if she's looking first.

Is she interested but really nervous? She is shy, but I wouldn't guess that shy, and its not like I'm weird looking or interesting enough that she'd stare for weeks and not get bored, so idk what she's staring at if she's not gonna text back.

I usually just stare at the elevator screen and make no conversation because I usually do not know what to talk about, and I do not get any signs that they want to engage in conversation. I am also really shy and can get anxious when it comes to attractive women. When I first moved to the apartment complex, I would try to initiate a conversation with the question ""Hey, are you new here?"", and I would get mixed responses. I would get friendly conversation at times, but I would end up never seeing the other person again. Also, most of the super attractive women at the place are either taken or are lesbians so it would be kind of awkward when I saw them later on with their SO or when they told me that they were at the apartment to visit their boyfriend. It was also awkward when I would see someone that I had a conversation with a couple of days/weeks back and she would just murmur out loud to their friends: ""I think that creepy guy is following me"". I just thought to myself ""Okay?"", when that happened. These experiences had made me not want to try approaching women at elevators anymore because I am not super brave, and I don't like being called names that I am not. Also, I am literally on the first floor where the complex starts which is the 6th floor, the rest is office space, so conversations tend to be really short. Nonetheless, whenever I don't initiate conversation I later feel that this might have been a missed opportunity of meeting the love of my life...

For a lot of guys I met, it was sometimes their longest relationship and they really seem to cherish their first girlfriend experience. 

As someone who hasn't dated a lot, I wonder why more people don't reach out to their high school or college exes, assuming they're also single? 

People change a lot over the years, that's true, but I also don't think it's unlikely to meet the perfect person for you too early in life. 

High school and college is a time of flux and change and it's unlikely most relationships last, but I think that has less to do with the quality of the relationships and more to do with circumstance. 

Barely anyone's high school relationships last because it's so natural to grow apart because of post-high school plans. It's been described as ""puppy"" love. Maybe if they met at 27-29 instead of 15-16, they'd have a chance at having something real.

We'd casually had sex as the lockdown happened and had stuck inside. From time to time he asked me about deeper things for instance how people start a relationship in my original culture etc, but back then I was intimidated going further from it and I assumed he either. And then he once gave me small gifts but I thought it wasn't more than a casual thing since we were basically meeting for having sex and ending up having sex. It kept like that for about 4months, then we had a trip together and we started talking about having a long distance relationship cus I had to leave back to my country for quite a while. Back then he knew that I've seen other guys a bit and seemed hurt but I discovered he was also chatting with other girls on apps and wouldve probably had casually met them or more so even the while we were together. Anyways we had these walls to each other and he said he felt that too, so I asked him if he was up for a relationship and he said that is unfair for me cus I'm way younger than him (about 7years younger) and would get lots of opportunities to meet other young boys but let's see and try it if we both still had feelings to each other even though we got apart longer than two weeks. I thought it was an absurd excuse and he was just bringing up excuses cus he didn't consider us as a thing. So I started packing my feeling and said farewell to him inside myself at the airport. He then started chasing me while I was away ignoring him, then said he felt bad about how he treated me and how deep his feelings were and how he'd like to meet me again and take me on a date and he would come wherever I settle down etc... I said I'm not sure if we can make it work but he always tried to reassure me. But we gradually started texting each other once or twice a week (9.5/10 started by his attempts) Anyways so we kept in contact for 7months then I settled down to another country nearby his. There was a bit of drama, he was very assertive saying he's gonna come and see me right after I arrive but then after I actually came here, he went like saying I'm busy with work so can't come over yet. Anyways he came visiting here but the reason he was coming over was his sis lives here and he was gonna take care of her baby for a few weeks so they came together after  having a family trip. 
So I felt like I'm just a person here when it's convenient to him. Anyways we finally met yesterday, and I started saying how our conversation and sharing feelings have lacked and I'm tired of this ambiguity for this long time. And asked him if he consider me seriously, then he said yes, but he didn't know that I was having the feeling that much since he was always the one who tried to keep in touch. And he thought I'm no longer interested in him cus i was settled down in a new city and started ignoring him. So I said I've had a strong feeling but restrained myself until we meet in real life again and have a proper talk. So I asked him if he want a relationship then he said the same thing as before it's unfair for you and we are gonna be in a long distance relationship again etc. And then he said ""You are about to dump me, can we just enjoy our company at least I'm here for a few weeks?"" and then I said ""it's not gonna happen that way anymore. it sounds like you wanna have fun for a few weeks while you're here. I was ready to end up things if I still can't make it clear. It's been almost a year and I've had enough and we don't trust each other so it's also problematic"" So he said if I feel like that I don't have to have sex with him etc... And the convo ended up like let's try to make it work we have feelings for each other.. and had a date during the night and again we ended up having sex at mine. Sorry I know it was very long til get to the real point. So, we had sex during the night and slept cuddling, and then the next morning had sex again. And then he almost instantly left saying that he needs to leave because of his sister since she doesn't really eat and he needs to cook for her...but asked me if I'd like to come over his sister‚Äôs place tomorrow which was Sunday, So I said okay ask your sis and let me know. And then he left. So I was waiting until he lets me know and then he texted me that night but didn't ask me to come over but just asking how I'm doing and that was it. So I asked on sunday 'so I assume that we aren't meeting today, are we' and then he said it's not a great time to come since the baby is sick and they'll go to an emergency room if she doesn't get better. I do understand the situation of course and I know he always has reasons...But I just can't stop feeling like I'm just being used for sex, also I've found that a pack of a condom he left at my place was already unpacked before we use it cus 3 of them were already used which means he had sex with someone other than me at some point. (Not sure about when but during the time we were apart) And I just feel like he just had to be here to take care of his family and I was just here as well for his convenience‚Äôs sake, he just enjoys my company but nothing more than that.

I told her I wanted her to be happy and that I would do nothing to harm her current relationship. I truly mean that and want only the best for her. We had a deep conversation about the entire thing, she was incredibly sweet and understanding of my feelings and took the news as well as one could expect. She said she needed time to think about everything and we've only talked on a very limited basis sense. I'm absolutely okay with giving her space and expected that going into it.

I'm just not too sure what I do now. She did say she was happy in her relationship but she never specifically told me that she wasn't interest.

This week all my friends broke up and it was finally my turn‚Ä¶ My bf (22) left me (23) after dating for 5 months since our relationship was getting more serious and he wasn‚Äôt ready for it. We were friends prior to our relationship and for the first time I thought this was it. I was dating a good friend of mine and I thought it will turn out so good since I know him and I had a good feeling about it. I felt loved for the first time ever, like someone really loved me for me and not just my body. I even wanted to lose my virginity to him. 

After breaking up with me, he told me he cheated in his previous relationships but never on me since he cared about me more than about those girls and I was his friend after all. He knows cheaters are my dealbreaker, no matter if they cheated 5 years ago, just yesterday, one time or 10 times and yet he never told me that. I didn‚Äôt even know this information as his friend. He said he was so proud to be with me and he liked showing me off. He also asked me if I wanted to be FWB now that we‚Äôre over. Now I‚Äôm convinced he liked me for my looks as well, and wants to keep me around just because he‚Äôs used to talking to me about everything and he doesn‚Äôt want to lose a free therapist lol. I don‚Äôt dress provocative but I go to gym for 6 years already and I do have a nice body and guys only seem to see that and date me because of that. I‚Äôm so hurt because I always give my all to people I care about and try to be their support and someone they can trust but no one makes an effort to be that for me. There were times I felt so alone in our relationship but I kept telling myself ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good guy you know him, he‚Äôs your friend‚Äù.

We met online so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much to be honest.  But I was pleasantly surprised and we were having a great time together. We were divulging a lot. Seemed to have a lot in common. Got very personal. 

I should have known better than to believe everything he was saying at face value but I‚Äôm gullible I guess. I let his words make me think it was maybe going somewhere. 

Had me over for dinner last night. Made my favourite dessert. We were talking about how we‚Äôre both givers. I told him that I have never orgasmed from sex before and that every guy sees it as a challenge, which is really annoying. He assured me that he‚Äôs not that kind of guy. Fair enough. We had talked before about bedroom stuff so it wasn‚Äôt the first time I told him that. We eventually started making out. I told him I was on my period so I couldn‚Äôt sleep with him but there was plenty I could still do to him. He said he was fine with it regardless but I didn‚Äôt want my first time with someone to have any restrictions. Anyways, we go up to his bedroom and he‚Äôs rock hard. We fool around. Cuddle. Talk. Nothing really eventful. 

This morning I get a text saying he didn‚Äôt feel a spark last night. Really? He‚Äôs telling me he can‚Äôt wait to do all sorts of things to me. The parts are clearly working but no spark?? How does that work exactly? 

He said he‚Äôs really into giving someone orgasms thru intercourse and it‚Äôs specific but the truth. That‚Äôs what he gets aroused by. 

Fair enough. I love giving and receiving oral, I just don‚Äôt finish without some mechanical assistance lol. 

So I literally got dumped bc of my inability to orgasm thru sex?? How does someone not take that personally? 

I was gracious and thanked him for his honesty. But I‚Äôm pissed. Why not just tell me this before he took me to his bedroom? I can handle someone saying it‚Äôs just not working. It happens. 

Anyways, I don‚Äôt care about the guy, but I am feeling pretty shitty about myself right now.

We are both in the same major and whenever we‚Äôre together our conversations flow effortlessly. We have so many common interests and we always hit it off every time we‚Äôre together. We have hung out from time to time outside of class and even then, we always have a good time. I never considered those as ‚Äúdates‚Äù by any means, just two friends hanging out socially.

Since I‚Äôve known her, she has dated someone who lives a few hours away from our college. I don‚Äôt know much about the guy, but I wouldn‚Äôt speak about him regardless. Last week I told her how I felt and how much she has meant to me over the last year. We tell each other everything and we promised not to lie to one another. I‚Äôm getting close to graduating and as that date gets closer, I‚Äôve found myself questioning what I should do. My career will likely take me away from where I currently live and I would have hated myself for not telling her. Last week I decided I should tell her how I feel, not to pressure her to break up with her boyfriend but to explain that she means the world to me.

Our conversation went incredibly well. She took the news better than I could have expected and was incredibly sweet and understanding about the entire thing. She does care about me as a person before anything else, and I care about her (in a non-romantic way) as well. We talked for quite a while, and she said that it wouldn‚Äôt have been unfair for me to go on without telling her. She didn‚Äôt mention a lot about her current relationship, other than she wasn‚Äôt unhappy in it. She said she would need some time to think and process everything.

Since then, we‚Äôve spoken on a very limited basis but when we do talk everything seems alright (aside from the elephant in the room) She never told me no or that she wasn‚Äôt interested. She doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an awful person for telling her. I just want to give her as much time and space as she needs right now. So, what should I do going forward? Do I treat it as if nothing was ever said? Or do I ever bring it up to her again?

I believe them. Because I've been there and I know friends who are like this. 

The stories of the rejected are interesting. It seems like the other party will have another person they're more interested in than the rejected person. 

So what could they be lacking? And what are the qualities of the people who they're getting rejected for? Both the men and the women?

After the both of the first two, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. We talked for hours and I thought he was really attractive and sort of perfect, and we had insane amounts of things in common. After only having been in one relationship prior where part of our problem was me never really having the feelings for him that I should have, this was so exciting to me.

I think there were a few factors in killing that attraction in a little under a week before our next date.

1. This guy is so different over text. Seemingly a little too intensely polite or trying too hard, something that almost made me cancel our first date out of fear, but he was again really lovely to talk to and laid back in person. Since there was a week gap between dates, we only communicated over text in that time, so I was only seeing the odd side.

2. I sorta kinda found his Instagram because I was trying to confirm his last name (this looks stalkerish and sort of crosses a line, I know) and subsequently found his YouTube channel. Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶it was pretty cringey. Totally wrapped my perception of this guy who I was head over heels for prior to that moment. We‚Äôre talking trying every flavor of Oreo cringey with a stereotypical forced enthusiasm thumbnail. I had my friend leaf through the rest of his channel lest I destroy him for myself and he ultimately told me that the videos themselves weren‚Äôt so bad and that he had some decent content that was a little less, again, for lack of better words, cringey. I thought I felt relief but I don‚Äôt think I ever kicked that feeling that he was far from who I thought he was.

3. When we DID see each other in person again, he was kinda touchy. It‚Äôs the third date mine you so this is pretty normal and were it happening to anyone but me, I‚Äôd think it was nothing but standard behavior. But it rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe just because my attraction had died. Touchy in a touching my shoulder, arm sort of around me way, nothing too weird.

We‚Äôre planning another date but I‚Äôm tremendously bummed that I can‚Äôt make myself feel the same way about him that I did before. We still have a lot in common and he‚Äôs still the same guy I liked a few weeks ago. 

Do you think this is something I should try to kick myself out of or am I justified in listening to my gut here? I 100% blame that damned YouTube channel, just a matter of what comes next. 

On a side note: I‚Äôve recently started thinking about how normal and romantic I find things in movies and TV shows and yet when I put myself in the character‚Äôs shoes, my fight or flight kicks in and it seems intense. I relate this to the rest of the post because it boils down to the same sort of question: so I have some reservations and nerves that I need to get over to be happy or is it right for me to have this double standard for romance I imagine and that I live through?

TLDR: Had an amazing first couple dates with a guy and discovered some of his social media that completely changed my opinion of him. Even after I talked myself through it and realized none of it was a big deal or even that bad, I still can‚Äôt get myself to be attracted to him again like I was before. Worth it to try to push my brain through those reservations or should I follow my gut?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124615,public,self,Is losing feelings for someone ever a mental thing that you need to kick rather than genuine lack of chemistry?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qp2gmk/is_losing_feelings_for_someone_ever_a_mental/,no_ads,0.0,,,,
