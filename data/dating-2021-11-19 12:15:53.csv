5,qxmiwo,1637346963,"She said she didn't like me, then made out with me. What do I do?","Title says most of it, but here's some of the story.

So I (M21) have been friends with her (F20) for a few months. 
About a week ago I asked her on a date and she said yes. She even suggested we have it at my place.

Fast forward to yesterday, she came over, the date was good. At some point she decided she was going to sleep over.

So the date progresses, it was pretty great and fun.
We are just about to start making out when she stops me and asks if I like her. I was like obviously yes. Then she says she didn't like me.
My response ""Oh sorry, it's cool, my bad.""

She asked if that was all I had to say and I said yes.

I didn't want her to feel weird or trapped since it was pretty late and she couldn't leave so I kind of gave her space.

Few minutes later she said she was cold and asked if I wanted to cuddle. Of course my horny ass said yes.

So we cuddled and at some point we made out. It was pretty late so we slept off. Morning came and we made out again (Note she initiated it both times).

 She asked if I had a girlfriend before she left (I don't know if this information is relevant to the story).

She left. I texted her, she was pretty much cold, one word replies. So I stopped and haven't texted her since.

I was planning on not texting her again and just moving on. But I want to know what you guys think I should do or what you'll do if you were in my shoes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxmiwo/she_said_she_didnt_like_me_then_made_out_with_me/

7,qxmnnv,1637347347,Can I get back my first love(childhood love)?,"The story started when I read in class 10 and she reads in class 5. We talk a lot and spend time together. We both like each other a very deeply. Though we never say “I love you to each other”. 

Actually we are relative but not blood relataiton. We meet, we talk. Time flies. I am in engineering degree. She in class 11. Due to a family problem we stop talking almost one year. 

I call her, she behaves strangely. She behaves like she doesn’t know me don’t want to talk with me. But I know that she just angry on me due to that family problem.
So, I take a decision to goes to her school and meet her. And My plan successful. I meet her and told I miss her. This time she not angry, her watery eyes is visible. She looks at me for at least five minutes. But her talk is not sweet she just avoided me.

After one year, we meet in a birthday party. She avoided me. But looks at me continuously from corner. To test her emotions that she loves me or not, I come back early from the party. My sister told me that she (gf) is very sad as soon as I leave the party. She also leaves.

After some weeks, I suddenly find her on Twitter. Because she block me on other social media. I tweet her that I miss her and love her. This time she reads and not block me. So, I continuously tweet her every day, she reads every tweet. I get this result from tweet analytics. But she never talk with me and reply me. So, I stop tweeting.

But she not blocked me. A little twist is, another person also loves he she doesn’t like him but talk with him a lot.

As soon as I stop tweets, she try to jealous me, by changing her DP matching a cartoon with that person who loves him. I know that she just try to irritate me.

The last part is, now she is in a different city to study. I am worried because that person who loves her in same city.

I am 200% sure, that she still loves me. My question is how I get back her? How to emotionally force her to talk with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxmnnv/can_i_get_back_my_first_lovechildhood_love/

I have a tendency to avoid guys that show a lot of interest (I freak out and stop liking them) and thus I've dated mostly emotionally unavailable guys, reinforcing my avoidant tendencies. But I have started recognising the pattern and trying to have more healthy relationships (learning about attachment and ROCD is helping so thanks Reddit for letting me know its a thing)

I had some weeks ago a great first date with a guy from Bumble, and a bad second date because I was too in my head. I've been working on letting go of fear, perfectionism, and specially being ok with uncertainty. 

In the third date I will be trying physical contact without running away. Since the pandemic I have gained a personal bubble I didnt think I had. I've had sex in a first date before, a couple of nightclub one night stands, and hell I dance bachata so I am used to strangers being super close. But now with this guy, I was attracted to him and wanted to kiss him, but I was retreating whenever he even graced me...

14,qxn8fn,1637349022,Friends giving me crap for not wanting to date for an indefinite amount of time.,"I've made a few posts/comments recently explaining my experiences dating the last 5ish years but here's a little summary. In 5 years I've been on probably 10 dates. 2 resulted in relationships lasting a bit more than a year. Both relationships sort of imploded for a plethora of reasons. The other dates were mostly bad. Either slight catfish feels or just unpleasant and not willing for a second(from either me or them). I have also been stoop up 6 times. That's right. 6. 

Given these experiences I've decided that I'm not willing to out myself out there. I joked with some friends saying I attracted a type of woman that I feel is bad for my mental health and as a result I was going to go celibate. Obviously I was joking, but they both gave me crap saying I need to work these things out and get out there and that I was generally happier in relationships and dating. I disagree. I do think I have stuff to work on as my 2 relationships helped me realize and I don't think I can do that while dating actively. 

So the advice I need is a few things. A) How do I not feel awkward when people ask if I'm seeing anyone and I answer no and they give me the, oh that's a shame you're so nice and would make a woman so happy. And B) Am I crazy for knowing that I tend to get toxic in relationships at times, sometimes brought out by my partner but also sometimes by my own doings, and deciding I don't want to see myself like that?

These past few days have been the worst out of the last month and a half, he's online, he views my stories, he texts the groupchat, but he doesn't reply to me, it sometimes takes up to five hours for him to reply.

56,qxqo4w,1637359292,Getting mixed messages and I'm unsure how to proceed.,"I (M17) randomly started developing a crush on a girl (F17) from my class in the middle of the previous school year. We have been in the same class for about 6 years now and we always were friends and had mutual respect for each other, but never actually hung out together outside of school. Last year, I started getting a crush on her and I figured that I had nothing to lose by shooting my shot.   


Long story short, it turned out we had a few mutual interests and we started talking more and more with each passing day. It started feeling like we were connecting and soon enough we were staying up till late at night texting (she's known for sleeping really early during school days so naturally I felt like that was a good sign). However, we were still in lockdown then so when they announced we'll be going back to in-person school, I started feeling nervous about how things would go.  


At this point I feel like it's important to note that both of us are somewhat introverts and a little awkward. Both of us also have never been in relationships before. She pretty much has a close resemblance to the ''good-girl'' stereotype and her parents are a bit strict and basically control a big part of her weekly schedule.  


At school, we would not always talk that much (we're in completely different friend groups) except for gym class where we'd usually sit together talking to each other, sometimes we'd even be late to class because we'd lose track of time talking xD. When I'd approach her and talk to her, she'd get blushed most of the time and would get nervous (not in a bad way or anything) and she always would prefer staying to talk to me rather than join her friends who would always pester her to go with them. There were even times were a few of my mates would spot her staring at me when I had no idea and would tell me afterwards. Generally, I never actually believed that she could be interested in me but my two closest friends who I'd go tell them about the situation both were convinced that she was definitely interested in me, I still was hesitant though.  


One day, we were talking about summer getting closer and closer and I told her that I actually had planned to go swimming with friends in a couple of weeks from then. She repiled by texting:   
''AHH THAT'S GREAT, I REALLY WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH BUT NO ONE HAS ASKED ME YET :('' (sorry for the caps lmao). So naturally, I figured that was my cue to ask her to go together and surprisingly, she accepted. Eventually we did go and we had a great time together. We would go out either to the beach or for ice cream/food several times during the summer (would have been more if our schedules weren't so unbelievably opposed). I'm not sure if these count as dates but I don't know what else I can call them. She'd never go out with other guys alone and she would always ask me if we could take pictures together hugging for ''memories'' when we did hang out. I started feeling that perhaps my friends were right and she was interested, the signs were getting too many for me to notice so I finally decided I had to come clean.  


On one of those ''dates'', I took her for ice cream, we went to the arcade and had fun, walked alongside the beach at night and I felt like I had a chance. It even struck me as weird that she would randomly start talking about the time period in which we started talking more and more often so I thought maybe that was a good sign. As the night was nearing it's end, I started telling her that I've been having a great time ever since we started getting closer. At that point, I started fumbling my words as I was really nervous but she kept pushing me to continue and it felt like she knew what I was  going to tell her so eventually I did say that I liked her. She told me that she's being having fun as well with me but that she's a ''go with the flow'' person. Now I have no clue what that meant exactly but all I know is that she's really done her best to avoid putting me in the Friendzone on multiple occassions where she easily could have. Both before that night and ever since then.  


I was a bit crushed for a couple of days, we didn't speak at all for that period. One day, I felt lucky so I called her out of nowhere to invite her to a random beach party a friend was organizing. She sounded both surprised and extremely happy to hear me. She couldn't come because she was flying out with her parents on vacation for a few days, what struck me as weird though was that as I was about to end the call, she asked me if ''we'd be texting eachother''. I said yes and we went back to how we were up to the day I came clean to her about how I felt.  


The whole event was not mentioned again as I felt that it would be too awkward to bring it up. Until one day, we had our first fight/disagreement through texts as I got frustrated at the whole situation and how I was getting mixed messages all the time. Usually, we'd just be non-confrontational but that day we both aired our frustrations. I actually thought the whole thing was over until she called me and we talked for some time. She, like me, is an overthinker. So that call was somewhat of a therapy session for both of us haha. For the first time, I felt like she was being upfront about the entire situation when she told me that she just finds it extremely hard to manage the situation and sometimes she feels like she doesn't know what she wants (which I suspected). Among the things she said, she told me that is glad that she has a flow with me and that we can spend time together at school and I that she knows that even though she's shy to take the first step, I'll be the one to take that step to approach her. Now I was confused because that's not always the case with me, I'm also super shy and up to that point, I didn't always approach her as I was nervous. Kinda felt like she was telling me what she wanted me to do haha. She did tell me earlier that she wanted me to spend more time with her at school so I guess that has to be it. We've been doing much better ever since that conversation.  


Now, I don't believe that she's playing with me, I consider myself a good judge of character and she doesn't feel like that type of girl. However I'm not sure if I'm getting any messages wrong but she's making a point to not put me in the friendzone despite being given many chances and has made efforts to keep us connected in different ways. Idk if y'all have any advice for how I should proceed, am I a fool for still having a bit of hope that things can still end up going good?

69,qxrv6m,1637362954,Coming off of first relationship onto a new one. Need advice,"Hi,

So I, 29m, Had a relationship fall apart a year ago with someone who was my first serious relationship.  Long-story short, she had unspoken hesitations or unhappiness in the relationship about 4 months in and hid it there for a while until she was done and telling me she was leaving. Which hurt a lot, as I had really tried to date her in a way that allowed for her to communicate openly.

There was quite a bit of electricity there after the first month or so. Just one of those things. I saw her wit and some elements of who she was and was pretty confident she was someone I wanted to marry. There was always just something there when I kissed her or held her hand.

It took a while to heal, and maybe I still am healing at moments, but I'm very convinced that I'm past wanting to be with her anymore.

Enter a new girl I met online. Really sweet, physically attractive (to me), compatible in more than a few ways.

I held her hand last night and gave her a kiss goodnight off of a second date. It went well, I enjoyed my time with her, but I'm honestly kind of confused. I just don't feel that electricity.

Is it possibly one of those things where my experiences in the past are keeping me from being psyched about her? Or that the first relationship is always different than the ones following? I like her, but I just am wondering if there's a problem here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxrv6m/coming_off_of_first_relationship_onto_a_new_one/
70,qxrybe,1637363220,What does it take for a man in his 20s to date a woman in her 30s?,"The idea of dating a woman in her 30s came up to me fairly recently. I as a 26M wanted to expand my options. However, when I look at dating profiles of women in their 30s, my age *barely* makes the cutoff point in their preference or requirement. Let's be real. Most women don't want to date younger men even though using the ""half + 7 formula"" I can date as old as 38 (preference for me is 23-35). [Statistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#Statistics) only 14.8% of the married couples where the woman is 2+ years older than the man (summing it all up) while a staggering 51.2% have their husbands 2+ years older. So the odds are against me.

What does it take to overcome these odds and obstacles? How do you make up for your lack of age (besides wait a few years)? What do women want if they're going to date younger men?

71,qxrz0g,1637363278,Am I (m29) losing interest in her (f24) or just just don't want to text with her?,"We have been dating for about 4 months (long distance). We see each other a couple of days at a time every 2-3 weeks. We almost texted everyday and also talk sometimes. We are enjoying eachothers company and like eachother alot.

She has never been a typing kinda person. I am also sure of this because I have seen how she writes with friends and family. She even tries ""harder"" to be a better texter with me sometimes. I had a girlfriend prior where we had awesome time texting. We had great banters going. But with my current there never really was. I was mostly entertaining her, making her laugh etc. It isn't that she isnt funny or witty, which she is in person. Just really bland in text.

So now I text her much less because Im tired of 'putting in the work' while she doesnt. Texting is almost our primary communication because of the long distance, so it might be why I am confused if I am losing interest in her.

Im not sure if she noticed that I text less. But Im thinking she must have. She hasnt commented or anything. Of course we reply everytime one writes. I was also used to write cute morning and night messages which I again do much less, because it came naturally when we were texting during the day. So now I do that seldomly too, even though I think she enjoys it. But for me it would be like forcing me to now. I also stopped texting her of things that would remind me of her, knowing I would just get a laugh from it and some bland answer back. Her bad texting really kinda ruins my love for texting.

I am so confused. I guess I dont want to text her really anymore. Is it fine now just to text whenever we should meet up or is it going to ruin our relationship, because now that it seems like I lost interest?

76,qxsc9n,1637364472,Mindset,"Mindset is important when you are going to be undertaking the quest of picking up a woman. Whether you are just trying to get a date, find a relationship or even just make a new friend to spend time with - mindset is going to be the biggest factor.

You see, at the end of the day, actively pursuing women is nothing more than a numbers game. Some women will like you and some just won't - it's the reality of the situation. By adopting a mind set that prepares you for rejection and puts you in the right place to keep trying, this is how you're going to ultimately succeed at your goal.

Some numbers to keep in mind:

\- 3/10 girls will dislike you by default

\- 3/10 girls will like you by default

\- 3/10 girls it will be up to you and your behavior if they like you

\- 1/10 girls will hate you

\- 1/30 girls is actually insane and will try to ruin your life

Now, when I say ""like you"" I mean be open to chatting with you and won't immediately disqualify you or shoot you down. These numbers are important to remember. At the end of the day, 40% of women simply won't like you and won't talk to you. 30% of women may or may not like you depending on how you act and 30% will, at the very least, talk to you without too much trouble.What does this mean?

Well, basically, you have a 30% chance at getting a phone number and you can rest assured that at least 40-70% of the time you are going to get shot down immediately.There is some science to this and it has to do with personality types. People like people who they know, like and trust. For example someone who is super outgoing and talkative will probably get shot down by someone who is super introverted and quiet. Or, more likely they will never talk in the first place.This mind set is important because when you do in fact get shot down, instead of turning inward and blaming yourself, your self image, or whatever else you think is wrong with you, you can simply chalk up the incident to the 40% that will always not like you or the 30% who may or may not like you. It's not you, its just 40-70% of people you talk to who won't immediately like you.

So, now that we are comfortable knowing that 40-70% of the time we will get shot down, it simply becomes a numbers game. Basically just approach women until you find one that has a similar personality type and you can get to know them without much trouble.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxsc9n/mindset/

Intimacy was pretty good, intense, gentle. In the morning he kissed me on the forehead and after he followed up a conversation. 

Not so long after it he invited me to go for a trip. We went for one and during the trip we spent a good time but he tended to be over intellectual speaking about all the hard topics(economics, law, etc). And I wanted to be more romantic. In the end trip turned out to be cute, with lots of kissing and hand holding and discussing our lives.

I could see he felt not nice about it but the fact is that he did upload it after the trip :D 

So I said that I didn’t like it a lot and I unmatched him. After the fact that I told it hurt me he did that he never messaged me back. But he found my social media and was looking through my stories (even though I have no idea how he found it and we had one week of no communication).

Several days ago I messaged him asking how he was. He replied immediately. He told me that he believes it still was not a reason to unmatch him and it’s a bit of a drama but if it’s a mistake he’s sorry. Then I asked if he missed me and he said yes. But he proposed to meet and try to enjoy our companies without overthinking things. I said sorry but I liked you for more. And he never replied me , it’s been one day. 

Does it mean he just wants it casual and as a hookup with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxsesn/was_i_a_hookup_for_him/

She has completely taken over my mind, and i think she kind of likes me too, judging from how she acts around me, especially when im not looking ive catched her staring at me with a smile. About a week ago she told me she was going on a second date with a guy. One hand i think thats where it ends for me, but since they're only dating i also think i might have a chance...
Could i still get her or is it too late?

81,qxsldp,1637365301,How do I (20M) have success with women?,"I’m 20, a senior studying economics at UCF in Orlando, FL, 6’1, 211lbs, work out three times a week, have decent social skills, yet I have no luck with women. I’m autistic so social cues are very challenging for me to read. I’ve lost 75lbs but this hasn’t improved my dating and sex life thus far. This girl I was talking to was initially interested in me and I hung out with her twice, once alone and once with my buddies. A few weeks ago, she suddenly lost interest and I haven’t spoken to her since. I think a lot of the issue with this girl was my overuse (and misuse) of behaviors I learned from dating, seduction, and pickup videos online. I was forcing touch, flirting, and making inappropriate comments because my friend, also into seduction, was making them in her presence. I will no longer be consuming online dating advice and will learn from experience. How can I have better results? I don’t want to be stuck in the friend zone or rejected because of my behavior.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxsldp/how_do_i_20m_have_success_with_women/

Friday night... just the both of us. We went for a long walk, went to the park and then for drinks and dinner. 

We didn't feel how fast the time went, we lost track of time. 

I went home with the warm feeling in my chest and I can't stop smiling. The world seems so beautful. I am in love.

OP: should I reach out to him/her? Conversation died. Fizzle. I’m still interested 
Comments:
1. If they wanted you they would make it known
2. The fact you’re asking is telling you they aren’t interested 

And then there are these responses:
Just write back. Not everyone thinks like “if they had time they would.” (Or something to this effect). Basically, stop thinking so black and white. 

What are your thoughts?! 

I have a recent encounter, where I thought it died down. Some have told me the ball was in my court and that the guy just didn’t have time for me. Others have said, I didn’t make it clear enough and that my response wasn’t direct enough. 

So I’m interested to hear what your thoughts are. I’m sure you’ve seen these post.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxsqq1/how_do_you_know_when_to_walk_away_with_dates_vs/
85,qxsrf3,1637365852,Rejection,"I broke up with ex about 4 months ago and since then I have been a bit of a serial dater - I’m going to guess I’ve been on dates with about 12 different men. Usually, I go on the date and I don’t like them but they’ll usually like me and text me right after the date, im absolutely not used to rejection and without bragging, I’m a good looking and intelligent girl in my mid 20s. 

Last night I went on a date and basically as soon as I arrived he looked disappointed, as if I wasn’t what he was expecting. I have a lot of self awareness and I know I can read body language quite well and I know he wasn’t into me. The date went well, we got on and I was attracted to him but he was super distant and just not into it, he left 3 hours in and said he was tired. 

This has really bruised my ego, to the point where I deleted all dating apps and even my social media because now I feel like I need a break. I know I’m handling this wrong and rejection is a part of dating but I can’t help but feel like I’m not good enough.. the worst part is I would have really liked this guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxsrf3/rejection/

We started talking and getting to know each other for like 3 months(talking stage) and everything was going well. Then one day we talked about our intentions, i told her that i liked her and i wanted to date her but she said she hasn't thought about it yet and she will like to do that. After that, she seemed distant from me. When i ask her to hang out she says she is busy, she barely returns my text or she leaves me on read. My friend who introduced me to her went to talk to her about it all and we talked about it. She said she didn't know she was doing that and she will change. We started talking again and we were cool. Then one day we talked about intentions again. She said she has no feelings for me but we should still remain friends. I was hurt and i got distant from her for a while. She told my friend that since she rejected me i stopped hanging out with her and all that and that i promised we will remain friends if it didn't work out. I went to talk to her about it and she said i should give her time. She also said that we aren't close enough for her to be vulnerable to me. She also said that she felt i was rushing things, that i just wanted the relationship and not the process to get there(which is not true). So we just decided to start over but she said to not expect anything. But nothing changed. We were still distant and we barely talked or hung out. Pls i need advice on what to do about it.

I’ve had multiple men tell me they “aren’t ready to get married” as their way of ending things, which to me is so random. I never wanted to marry you, bro. And now that I’m older, so many guys are like “I want a wife” or “you’d be a good wife” before I even meet them or on our like first or second dates. To clarify, I have never in my life said I wanted to get married or wanted a husband to any man in any way. I literally don’t even want to get married. Do I just have wife face or something? Is that a thing? How do I get this to stop? I just want someone to date casually and have fun with, no pressure. Not someone who wants to get married immediately or is already naming our children or is going to tell me they love me 1-2 months into dating, or alternatively men thinking that I for whatever reason want to marry them.

Gal #1 lives out of town and he's known her for years, Gal #2 is pretty new, but spends a lot of time at the house. Both are similar-looking and have similar personalities. 

He claims they know about each other and are totally cool with the polyamory. I've told him before how weird I think it is, and how I think gal #2 actually wants a relationship with him. 

Anyway, gal #1 is in town and they're both coming over tonight. This is the first time all 3 will be in the same place and I honestly think he has no idea what he's getting himself into. I told him there's absolutely no reason to have them meet besides having a threesome, but he insists the gals will be fast friends and they'll all chill and play video games together.

Add on the fact that we have a small house with only one small couch in the living room. They will all be forced to sit close together. Idk I just don't believe the gals will like each other. I've warned him of this before, but he dismissed it. 

So here I am, in my room waiting for gal #2 to arrive. Idk if it'd be worse for me to be right or wrong at this point. Safe to say, no matter what happens I'll be in my room all night.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxv3cu/my_brother_is_putting_his_polyamorous/

I get plenty of matches but getting conversations going can be hit or miss, people like to flake out especially if the dates too far out, ghosting, etc.  It can all get kind of discouraging.

Had a date tonight with a girl who I could tell within 10-15mins wasn’t my type.  She was much more outspoken and extroverted than I am and a bit rough around the edges.  By the end of the date she was straightforward and said she wasn’t feeling it and offered to pay for dinner.  I still paid for dinner in the end but she did the tip.  As I hadn’t been feeling it either I thanked her for being direct&amp;respectful and not wasting my time.  I wished her luck and she did the same and we peacefully parted ways.  

It was just refreshing to have someone be honest and upfront without simply disappearing etc and it restored my faith in humanity a bit.  

TL:DR  Had a date where neither of us was feeling it but the mutual respect was a refreshing experience all the same.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxvd5k/had_a_refreshing_date_that_was_refreshing_despite/
