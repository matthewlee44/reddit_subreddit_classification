With how 1 in 5 marriages are met online, it looks like the future is going to be virtual. There are so many problems with today's modern dating culture.

I remembered even in 2012 when I was barely out of high school, my profile pics looked like I dressed like a high school freshman. Yet on OkCupid, I was consistently getting replies from even attractive women. I signed up for A-List to see if they saw my message and A LOT of them did. These days we're into phone apps where it's all swipe based purely on looks. I don't know if this situation is going to get better. I've dressed better, taken better photos but have had a far less match rate than my 2012 OK Cupid days. Both men and women struggle with dating apps. It just shows that more mainstream apps are becoming Tinder-like where it's 90% looks and only a small portion about compatibility/hobbies.

Let's not mention we're still in the middle of Covid. While some places have already lifted restrictions, I doubt social places are going to be packed like it was in 2017. There will always be cautious people and that limits your dating pool. I saw a bar where it was 80% guys and 20% girls recently. Yikes. 

It looks like cold approaches are becoming less of a thing now. Given that women out here write about how they're not here to get picked up in non-flirty locations and are just going a normal day. Even pre-Covid cold approaches were fine. But with masking and social distancing (still), is that even viable?

So overall, do you see the dating culture getting worse as time goes on? It's pretty clear that meeting in person is less viable because of this pandemic and how most people have already shifted online. It also doesn't help that dating apps are very imbalanced to both men and women (and non-binaries). How is the dating culture going to fix itself? Will the end of Covid suddenly make people delete apps and socialize like it's 2017?

She is amazing person, always there to help ppl, never wants something in return - pure soul. Let's call her Clara.

Clara met her boyfriend at the start of 2018 - from my first experience with him, I had positive vibes towards him - back then he was 21 and she was 17 and he already had plan with his life, average looking and communicative. I was really happy for her.

Anyway, things turned out to be not so bright at the start of 2020. They had a fight and he broke with her since he didn't feel happy by his words ( turned out that she found out that he is taking drugs RARELY but still taking - which is huge deal breaker for her, she tried to convince him to stop but he said that he choose them instead of her). 3 weeks passed and he called her and said that he wants to talk - she had no plan to get back to him but as you probably guess - she went back to him since he promised that he will never take drugs again. Present days he is still taking ( again rarely with friends).

End of 2020 - while talking with her on the phone, she shared that she has strange stomach pain. I told her to tell her bf to drive her to the hospital - she asked and he literally refused to driver her since he wasn't IN THE MOOD. Me and a close boy friend went with his car and took her to the hospital. Turned out that she needs a surgery - after a week being there, we again driver her back to his apartment. Later I was told that he had a party with his friends and he literally told her if it's possible to clean the place ( you know with an open wound pretty much). She also shared that she has panic attacks when he comes back from work for whatever reason. He broke with her ( again he) in january 2021 again for not feeling happy.

Me and her friends tried everything we could to help her forget him. She was almost healed when he phoned her again for a talk - AGAIN she was saying that she won't get back to him but somehow he managed to manipulate the s\*\*t out of her mind.

For the longest time, I didn’t realize that I was much more “successful” on dating apps than the average guy. After reading post after post on Reddit about how only the top 10% of guys get any matches, and how OLD destroys most guys’ self esteem, it dawned on me that I guess I belong in that 10% after all. 

I strictly use Hinge and I typically I get about 25 or so matches per month. Obviously not all of them respond, or turn into dates, but a good amount of them do, to the point where I am talking to/going on dates with about 5-6 girls at a time. 

The problem is, I’ve come to be almost addicted to the pursuit and the never-ending chase of new girls. I also assume that this is how most women use dating apps (have tons of options, always talking to more than one guy at a time, etc.) and I don’t like the idea of “putting all my eggs in one basket”, just for her to ghost me for one of her many other options. It’s hard for me to turn down a cute new girl that I matched with. I suppose part of that is because of my male programming, and also due to the fact that I was not able to have success with this many girls until about a year ago, so I feel that it would be a waste for me to not go out with as many as girls as I can.

If you’ve seen the show How I Met Your Mother, there’s an episode where Barney Stinson puts his number on live TV, and afterwards his phone literally never stops ringing due to girls wanting to date him. He goes on a date with one girl, and midway through he gets a call, leaves and meets another girl, and so on. He always believes there is a hotter girl around the corner, so why just stay with one? Obviously it is over-the-top and he is very flawed, but ironically that is pretty much how I feel. 

Will this make it hard for me to be in an LTR in the future? When I’m so used to the thrill of multiple girls at a time, could I be satisfied with just one? While also being able to be loyal to her? I’ve read that some guys who were used to getting lots of girls struggle to stay faithful in a relationship (I have never cheated btw).

sometime later she started sending me more selfies saying she bought new makeup and asking me if it looked good on her. this included some really dark red lipstick and in nearly all of them she was puffing her lips too, I thought maybe she changed her mind. so I asked her out again and got the same response and she stopped texting me for a while.

then later she started texting me again but. I decided I wasn't going to ask her out a 3rd time and seem desperate and possibly even get in trouble at work. then she started sending me really risky pictures, saying she bought new lacy underwear (like a red corset and stuff) sending me pictures and asking me if it suited her figure and so on. well I asked her out again and got rejected.

Long story short. I messaged someone on Instagram. Our conversation frequency went from like once a month, two a couple times a month, to every few weeks, to like every other week. It’s picked up very recently, maybe a coupon times a week. We have similar interests, same kinda music, film. Very similar politics and world views, so we get to enjoy that subject pretty often. 

There has been more than a few times where we will effort reply to one another and have a couple paragraphs of exchanges each. This past week it’s gotten to where it’s almost a bit much to reply to bc it requires some effort. She even sent a message saying “ I haven’t forgot about this, just wanna put effort in my reply”thoughts that was cool to do considering doesn’t owe me any reply at all. It’s just been interesting because we both are stranger but can go back and forth like this, when most internet are very low effort. 

I haven’t thought much of it, but recently I kinda started wondering like how much longer will we do this. Is it going to be an online friend thing? Or are we gonna see how we interact in real life? I did ask once if she ever wanted to hang out, that I’m down. This was after her mentioning how she found it hard to meet people and make friends. But it was early on so she didn’t reply really to that statement. Perhaps it was too soon?

Sometimes she can drop off the convo and will come back around a day or so later. I can also do that if it’s a lot to reply just to have to think. There have been times where a convo will die out or will be left unfinished and eventually a new one will start. People get busy. Sometimes I kick myself after bc I wrote so much back lol. 

I guess my biggest dilemma is that I’m somewhat intimidated because she is leaps and bounds more attractive than I am. Like when I say this I mean she’s super super pretty. I am not super pretty, at least on her level. I’m also kinda lost on how she’s single because she definitely would not have trouble meeting people. 

I am admittedly bad at catching hints or reading signs. I guess I need to overcome any sort of hesitation due to appearances.

Ladies my question is, are some of you the type that would never ask a dude out even if you really wanted to?

Hopefully this will help anyone that has been ghosted to not take it personally. Because, I have been ghosted and its not a fun experience. 

So, I am currently talking to this girl who I have been texting with for maybe three weeks now. Honestly, I just feel like our conversations are pretty dry and the vibe doesn't seem to be there. I have been trying on my end, but I don't know. Also, there has been times where she will take several days to respond to texts. Which for me is something I wouldn't do unless I was completely uninterested. So, we have a date this Friday set up. But, I am not feeling it at all. I texted her last Thursday and she responds Sunday night like it's no problem. 

I know she is interested, but at this point I'm just not feeling it. So, my gut this morning was to just ghost her. I don't want to carry on texting feeling this way and that is my only option. Like why explain everything. Also, I just got out of a relationship with a girl who gave me similar treatment and I definitely don't want to go back to that. Do I really need to explain all that? It's just so much energy. And I think at times it easier to preserve your own energy even when it will probably hurt the other person and they will wonder what they did wrong. 

After, thinking about it I decided to not ghost her and send a text being honest.

I see her at work on the weekends so it’s not like I haven’t seen her at all and we text almost everyday but it’s not just us 1 on 1 in person.

The reason it’s been so long since our first date was because of her going through a lot of things and that she wasn’t in a great place mentally and I had to help her a bit with that plus her getting covid and the snowy weather being horrible where we live.

After our 1st date she was really joyous for the 1st week and even planned our 2nd date but after everything went down she’s not super enthusiastic but still wants to go on a 2nd date with me. that’s why I want to know what I can do to make it really good for her so she can be joyous again and get back the initial spark back

Should I try to flirt more or gently touch her or try to kiss her when/if appropriate? I never did this on our 1st date and was just my shy self but since it’s the 2nd date I think I should take it up a notch. 

She wants to go slow and wants to get to know me better before putting a label and is a introvert so I don’t know if that would be uncomfortable for her if I did the things I mentioned. She says she feels comfortable around me so I don’t want to ruin that.

I also got her a teacher teddy bear (she really likes college) as a late Valentine’s gift for our date since we won’t see each other on Valentine’s day, is that too much?

Over the weekend I took her to a nice resort for Valentines weekend. While it wasn’t our first trip I didn’t plan well. I left some of her things behind and picked her up an hour late. Absolutely my fault and I take full responsibility.

We get to our vacation we have fun but she was rather on edge the weekend. Saturday she boiled over and told me “thanks for this trip but honestly I don’t want to be around you. You ruined this weekend” this made me upset but I understood. I wanted to talk it out and she didn’t. I kept pressing the issue and she yelled at me and told me to get out of her life and never talk to me again.

The morning came and she felt better. We went on a nice date and had a good day. We came back home last night and I thought she’d go home but she stayed with me and wants to stay with me today and have dinner tonight.

Regardless she is distant and won’t kiss, cuddle or show much romanticism. She didn’t want to cuddle in bed last night and today said “I don’t want to be touched” when I went to hold her hand.

Like she seemed to be doubting herself alot and seemed broken and it felt that her mindset was sad and negative towards herself and like something was holding her. She couldn't agree on dates and eventually opened up that she is depressed and really tired all the time and said that its really exhausting for her to meet new ppl. Time went on and we were chatting every now and then and i started thinking that depression is quite broad concept and if she would really like to meet, she would or then something is really troubling her. It still felt and she kinda let me know that she really wants to meet, but not now.

The she opened up more and told me that she recently broke up and it was violent relationship and she is sometimes blaming herself for it. Then she also told me that she just got diagnozed with BPD.. i gave really supportive answer, which made her cry and afterwards we were talking a little. I tried to ask date few days later, it would have been nice to talk f2f, but she couldn't agree again.

Should I ask my new partner I've been dating for a little over a month to move in with me? My soon to be ex wife is moving out April 1 and my new partner needs somewhere to stay in April funny enough. Is it odd to offer if there really is a need? I'm worried about seeming too forward. We hang out almost every day doing small things like going to Walmart, walking and talking, usual dating things. Good conversations and vibes.



So my wife and I are in the process of legally separating and she is moving out April 1 into her new apartment. We have agreed on seeing other people and going our separate ways and will finish our dissolution soon for incompatibility. 

Since January I have been hanging out with a coworker of mine (42f), taking her to and from work to help her since her brakes need replaced and she's trying to move out of her current living situation. We've had good chemistry and good talks. I am 23(M), I hadn't planned to get right into another relationship but it happened that way and in confident in myself and what I want. 

This relationship with my coworker (works in diff dept then me) has evolved into a deeper one and I have been partially helping her with some things, we hang out pretty often 5 days a week or so. We do not text much as we had mentioned not being fond of it and more for face to face conversations. We do not talk on the phone as we don't enjoy it.

I have been getting her new things and flirting with her and helping her with some small bills no more than 10-20 sometimes and it hasn't been often 🤷. 

She has only asked me to help her with 25$ once, before that I just usually pay for people in interested in when I ask them out to do things. If she asks she usually will pay unless I have the money then I'll offer. 

It's moved pretty quickly. I was with my wife up until this point from 19- April this year. 

Since my new partner is looking for a new living situation and my apt is opening up, would it be weird to ask her if she would want to move into there with me? 

I feel like it would be helpful so they don't need to save up 1500 or so to move somewhere. I had mentioned it in conversation about my wife moving out Feb then she said April and then a week or so later when we were talking about apartments new partner had said she would need to hunt hard for  apartments and to find somewhere by April when she's out of her house since the renter is selling it because of the other tenants.

Should I offer a spot in my place to her or is it to early? Im happy to do so, but not sure if that would be too forward or not

Some context was that toward the end of the year I was seriously depressed &amp; anxious, he knew about this but felt he didn’t see a future with me and just ignored me instead of communicating this to me. I honestly, lost my mind and became so unwell. We agreed to meet up in January to give things another shot - we did (even went to couple’s therapy). Last Monday he was making plans for vday weekend &amp; said he was excited to see me. By Tuesday morning he was calling me on two numbers - I’m a teacher so I answered during break and he said what he said. I’d heard it before so this time I just thought I’d comply and agree. He has blocked me randomly before and then unblocked me when it suited him. I did appreciate that this time he communicated it. I’m old enough to understand that we are incompatible and I take some responsibility for the breakdown and ending of the relationship. He has said many things that hurt me intentionally before, but I know I said and did things that upset him too.

I also ended up surrounding myself with some really bad people. Didn't know how to solve my problem so I cut off all bad people from my life and focused only on my friends. Four years ago I said I will just pause one year before things clear up a little bit in my head but after that one year I got used on peace that I have when I get home from my jobs, no compromises, no fights, lies,... I finally felt like I am healing from affect of the outer world.

Then came pandemic. Media turned people against each others, not that people hate themselves now just based on nationality, religion, taste in music and movies, but also who is vaccinated and who isn't. I also found kind of happiness in glimpse of such world. I loved being the only person outside, in a city where during whole day you couldn't see not a single person outside. Except police patrol cars. It was like I was living in Silent Hill type of feeling, just waiting for some horror to happen.

In meantime I started my own company, did lay new plans for a close future... My life already was crowded with my existing hobbies, activities and work, and after starting my own company, it became... Well... I do not have a life now. But I can't complain, because I love what I do. But still... So I thought finding person similar to my views and activities is best option. Because she would be interested in the same or similar things I do, would have something to talk about... and reason is... I do not know how to talk anymore, except about those few things I am interested in. In most conversations I am quiet and while other person talks I just talk with myself in my head, and then when person asks me something I am like:""What?! Whoo?! Yeah, sure!"" Because in my head I already finished that talk minutes ago and kept thinking about something else. I know... But I got used to spend most of my time in my head then outside. It is more interesting then the outside world.

Before I could talk about anything, and now I find it pointless. I also escaped attempt of kidnapping years ago and when I am meeting new people of similar interest my brain just jumps into ""inspection"" mode, and you know what that does... makes me overly courius about someone to the point when other person feels weird. Like:""Why do you have so many questions?!"" Or ""You are asking too much questions!"" Or ""What is your problem?!""

I do not seem to function with anyone anymore outside my world of interest. Is this happening to everyone older we get?! Biggest problem is older I get more I know what I want and that now looks like... Few days ago I installed a dating app and in 100 swipes only one is toward the right, all others are toward the left (I am pretty sure that is not how those apps should work). I am also trying to stay open minded and accept the conversation with women who send me a message. But the conversation is poor and does not lead anywhere (talks about children, past - I have a dark past so I try not to talk about it with someone I do not trust yet, trips, travels... That is all just chit chat and I dislike chi chats. I need science level talks where I can learn something or find out how stupid I am). So at the end I just  stop texting. I miss talks about design, coding, ideas, possibilities, plans, books, stories... Something I used to have plenty in my younger days. But now... As full-stack where I can operate as one man company, it seams that now when I achieved my dream of becoming one man band I feel lonely. (Not in that way - as an introvert I really love living on my own terms, but there are things I would love to share.)

About dating in real life, last 5 years I didn't had not even one day free. Before that I traveled the countries on my bicycle every year two times a year for 60 days, and met plenty of people, good people. Now... I don't see getting there where I was any time soon. 

So how do I return to dating in whatever this world is now?! I fear of being used again, I know what I want which lowers my options for a lot, and I do not have time for someone who is completely opposite of me where relationship would require a huge amount of compromises to work (which I consider not a relationship at all but a road to unhappy and wasted life with someone).

I do not need myself, but someone of similar interest. So where to find someone like that?! But then there is another variable. Do I have anything of value to offer to such person?! I do not know.

My ex (24f) and I (24m) broke up, because career choices sent us to different cities. We only dated for a few months, so I didn't want to do long distance. She was initially upset about the break-up, but now we are close friends. For context, we were also friends before we started dating. We are both single and visit each other every few months, but we are also clear about not dating. Should I send her something nice for Valentines Day, or maybe just a call?

Now I am starting to think that for some guys they are questions that are great for PUA type guys to ask because he can know what will sweep you off your feet and try to be “your perfect guy”.

I think that getting to know what a person likes should be organic and not forced, a more appropriate question would be “what kind of food would you like to get for our first date?”, I think for the first question. For the second question I think it shouldn’t even be asked. I mistakenly answered this question honestly before with a guy I dated , stating that I prefer guys who aren’t arrogant and are confident. He would make remarks about himself when we were dating and would say at the end of them “that’s what a confident , not cocky guy says “. I would cringe, he was obviously using what I told him to try to win me over and pretend to be someone he wasn’t. 

A person that you go on a date with will be able to know by asking you questions about your political views, likes and dislikes etc if you are compatible.

TLDR I was in a really bad car accident. Finally putting myself back out here after 5 years (the accident ended my last serious relationship.)

I am not looking for a caretaker I am fully capable of taking care of me. I just miss being someone's someone. I want to ease back into it all slowly. Said therapist suggested to try online dating as I do not drink so I cannot do the bar scene.  Also trying to meet someone doing hobbies I just- don't have that in me either. 

To get to my point, some profiles if the guy has a name that is the same as my Father whom I had a shitty childhood with, my stepfather that also gave me a hard upbringing, either of my jerk brother's names, my ex that got me in said car accident or pretty much any guy with a name that begins with J.
