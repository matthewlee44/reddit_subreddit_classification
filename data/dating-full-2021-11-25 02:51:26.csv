I feel a little weird/silly asking this, but it's better than assuming.  

I'm kind of old fashioned and leave the pursing to the man. I feel like if he's interested enough he'll put forth effort. If he's not, he won't. And we can just move on peacefully. 

Back story.
It's been at least 3 years since I've had a serious relationship. And only two relationship, both over 10 yrs prior. I took some time after the last relationship to work on myself. Build up some self-love and self-esteem that was lost in my last relationship. As a result, I feel I may have become a bit ""cold"", in the sense I won't chase men anymore.  Maybe I just don't know what I'm doing? But I won't over extend myself, other than being upfront with my feelings. 

I very rarely call, text 1st or make suggestions about possible date plans. Just can't seem to bring myself to do these things. I've tried. I don't want to bug, be overbearing or come off desperate. 

Just curious how men in my age group feel about this? I fear I may be leaving all the work to them. Which eventually causes them to become uninterested after awhile. 

I realized there should be a 50/50 in a relationship, but what about in the dating stage before a relationship is established? ",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1129457,public,self,"Guys (40-50s) do you want to be pursued?

In the lab I’m an assistant for there’s this cutie I’ve been crushing on all semester. We haven’t talked aside from a passing compliment about her boots (complimenting her suggested by my therapist). She seems like the shy type and up until the compliment I had never heard her voice. Even walking by her lab bench it was mostly her partner doing the talking and asking questions. 

I’ve told my therapist about her and she’s wanting me to ask her out before the end of the semester on the 2nd. We talked about strategies and what exactly I’m going to say but it still isn’t any clearer as to what I’m supposed to do.

My question is this. If you were this cutie in this situation how would you prefer to be approached? How do I seem as non-creepy as possible? Do I just go up and ask for coffee or do I try to strike up a conversation first and ask towards the end? If I should start a conversation, what should it be about? (Another reason i’m in therapy.

I (22F) have become friends with a man online, who is almost 30. From what I can tell, he seems legit. But I know that with online dating, people can choose to present a falsified image of themselves and the age gap does present a maturity imbalance. It is possible that I am just naïve and he is manipulating me. He tells me that I am mature for my age and all of that, things that may be a red flag depending on the situation. Nearly 4 months ago he messaged me and we got to talking. It started off pretty friendly and then got more flirty as time went on. We have quite a few common interests and he seems to be a neat guy from what I can tell. He has a decent career, owns a home, and he is pretty close with his family. I have seen a couple pictures of his brother and pets even.

We have very similar hobbies and opinions. We have talked on the phone, video chatted, and text every day. The conversation flows very naturally, however I am aware that when dealing with people...having everything seem perfect can either mean that you are dealing with a manipulator or your soulmate. He has mentioned his goal of marriage, family, and where he wants to own a home. He has made comments about how cute our kids would be and all that. I feel very comfortable when talking with him though. I feel like he appreciates who I am and shows a genuine interest in me and my passions.

He has asked about my family and is trying to find similar interests to make a good impression. He would like to meet me in person soon, he lives a few states over but I am not sure how to work this out or even if it is a good idea. Obviously we would need to meet in a public place. The issue I have is with my family that is pretty overprotective of me, being an only child...even as an adult. They would probably flip if they found out I was talking to this guy online and wanted to meet up. They are more traditional that way and just don't believe in online dating. They care about my safety even though I don't always agree with them. Me and him would have to meet without telling anyone and that does make me slightly nervous because ultimately, we are kind of strangers. We want to start gaming online soon and I am comfortable with this step.

I could really use some guidance on this situation, just a perspective of an outsider. Are there red flags that stick out to you about this relationship or is there any advice you could offer? I am feeling pretty confused about what to do. So far he has been pretty respectful and I do want the best for everyone involved. He always makes sure I am comfortable with the level of contact/communication.

Few days ago her car breaks down and I happen to text her when she told me and asked for help. I come there and there was already like 3 guys there (all fans of hers) she gets in with me and I offer her my car during this week to help her . She uses it for like two days and gets it towed, I forgive her and pay it but then the fucking horniness kicks my ass and I ask her if we can cuddle and she outright refuses (almost as if disgusted at the idea) she then invites me to her place with our son and here I am on her couch playing ""co-parent"" now a few things to disclaim. 1) that she has told me she feels like people are letting her down and even the guys that came to help she says how she is careful not to get close with them cause they always want sex from her. And 2) she has gone through alot during our divorce and alot has to do with over sexualization. I just can't shake the feeling of sadness and anger because of being rejected though.

So Eric and are hanging out at his place just chilling, playing games and talking, then he says that me and him don't really ""vibe"" that well. He says him and Alice ""vibe"" more and that she gets his humour but that I don't really. I was like oh I didn't realise we weren't ""vibing"".

Like why do you want to be exclusive with me if you don't like me? Then next day at night we had a long phone conversation where he basically spilled the stuff Alice told him about me. Made me wonder if Alice actually liked me from the beginning, well we have known each for only 2 months but still. Anyway he keeps talking about how we are doing and like if we are compatible or if we shoukd take things further. We've known each other properly for a week. 

He asked me yesterday do you think it's time see if we should take things to the next level. I told him can I think about it and let him know but honestly I don't know what to say. To me it seems kind of early but I do enjoy spending time with him. But I feel like he wants me to say yes which I don't mind saying.

My last date and 3rd with her was at my place and we agreed to take turns to watch our favorite tv shows. The date was going well overall, we shared a blanket, had snacks and commentated over the show a bit. I was getting excited to make a move so I just went for the arm around her shoulder and got closer. She had no emotional or physical response to it so I was concerned. I asked her in reassurance, “Hey I know this is pretty sudden, are you cool with this?” And she said yeah. I assumed it would’ve been alright with her, anyway since I took her hand one time during our 2nd date at a haunted house in a blackout room. Eventually, I broke off the arm wrap and got her water and let things simmer down. We continued watching the show and got comfortable again, and as soon as I found an opportunity to offer to hold hands she rejected it. “Idk I don’t like getting my hands sweaty.” To cut to the chase, I handled the rejection calmly and watched the show the rest of the night with her and still even got the chance to watch a couple of mine with her too. Made no more moves though. After our date was over, I walked her to her car and she surprisingly initiated a goodbye hug before we parted. 

After a couple days, I messaged her over snap Monday morning, asking what she thought about last Friday. Unfortunately she didn't respond or even read the message. To this day she still hasn't. I got really anxious so I was being nosy and couldn't resist temptation to check her snap score to see if she was still active and sadly to see she was. Here's the thing, she was always good at getting back with replying up until now. 

The next day I worked a closing shift with her so there was no avoiding each other. I was gonna try to see if things were alright between us. When she came in, she said hello and I waved while I was busy with a customer. When she clocked in, she went straight into the kitchen and didn't initiate any conversation (I work at a dine in &amp; takeout delivery restaurant with her). I can definitely tell she was not in a good mood. After enough time passed, I went into the kitchen and opened up some small talk to see how she was doing. I was able to find out she wasn't doing alright and she's been busy with family matters and school of course which was why she hasn't been checking her snapchat. Personally I didn't believe her, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Over time I brought up things like how I continued to watch her tv show by myself to lift her mood up a little. She wasn't very talkative of course, but we started getting really busy that night anyway. When things started to slow down, I praised her for how well she working in the kitchen and she gives me a dismissive response of ""I know."" I gave up trying to be cheerful towards her after that so I just went with the mood. 0 talking to her for the rest of the night, unless it's work related. It was hard for me to not talk to her, so I became more socially active with my other coworkers and customers until the night was over. She said goodbye after I had to leave my preclosing shift while she was the closer, and my friend offered me a ride home. I told my friend about this story since she was interested too. The important part of advice I took from her was that I did the right move to not be pushy anymore, and to give her space. She said that since she's a woman there's a chance enough time she'll miss me and reach out to me. Luckily, we don't work the same schedule for a couple weeks. I'm on the verge of giving up though so I don't get my hopes up. I'm assuming she just doesn't want to continue what we were doing anymore.

So, I [18m] asked a girl out [18f] over text a couple days ago as I am unable to see her until after Thanksgiving break. I asked her if she is down to go on a date after the break and she said she is ""totally down"". Sick!

Thing is, she took like 8 hours to reply to that. She is a really slow texter and sometimes doesn't follow up on conversations. She's been like that since I started texting her.

Does this indicate her interest, or is she just a bad texter? Should I be concerned? I've already been to dinner with her once and it seeeeeems like she likes me. She has no social media or anything- perhaps she's just not into texting?

How do/should I bring it up (over text, for the time being)? Or should I leave it?

I actually explained it to (31M) him before we had sex how it could possibly happen, but it usually just mean I love the sex or love how you make me feel during an orgasm. He understood, but told me I shouldn’t say that and try not to catch feelings. I withheld the urge to say it . We’ve been talking for 3 months. He moved 5 hours away recently and said he didn’t want a relationship because of that. I understood and agreed to FWB. Fast forward a month later . I see him for the first time since our last encounter. While I’m giving him head he says “if I say I love you, it means I love the sex.” 

I thought he was just joking because it’s what I said the last time I saw him. But in the middle of sex he really said “I think I love you. Maybe we can make a long distance relationship work out. I want to see you again next week .” 

I felt that was very specific and not just someone randomly saying I love you when things get intense . After that he never brought it up again. It was like what he said didn’t happen. We had a conversation afterwards and he said he wanted to see me actually after the holidays . Which is a long time from now.

I finally brought up the I Love you situation a week later,  he said he didn’t really remember it, because he was drunk. (But the first time he said it, it was before we were drinking ) 

He said  it was because the sex was intense and was the first time he was with a woman in a long time, so he said things he didn’t mean it. He said we both know what this our situation is and we shouldn’t say it anymore to not confuse each other. I agreed. 

But He takes me on dates, we have long deep conversations and we seem to have a connection. He constantly checked on me to see if I was okay when I traveled to see him. I’m very inexperienced with dating and appreciate anyones advice. Does he feel anything 

He’s told me before how he’s acted on his emotions quickly in the past and he didn’t want to do that to avoid anyone getting hurt.

Says to an average looking girl "" oh my God, you are so beautiful. I've fallen in love with you. I want to make you my forever. We will marry, have a nice home in the woods, have kids if you want them."" 

He misleads the girl that he's talking to her only. Creates another dating account to explore his options. Talks to them and gives them similar promises keeping first girl placeholder without her knowledge. Then once he finds someone better or more attractive, he ghosts first girl without putting an effort or having courage to give an explanation. Or gives a made up excuse ""I am suffering from big mental health issues"" or ""my parents are not happy with me being with you"" or ""I recently came to the realization I'm gay"" or ""sorry I didn't tell u earlier. I have herpes"". 

This is even a shittier way to end a conversation. Everyone deserves to receive a proper polite ""No"" and a reason for the refusal so they don't start to get a wrong idea in mind.

Such things also happen inadvertently. Let's say a girl sends a guy a Pic in which she looks much more attractive than normal. He falls for her. But later on, when they meet or he gets to see more of her pics, he realises he was never attracted. So, in such case, it's not entirely his fault for leading her on.

*My methodology :*

I never false promise. I make it clear that I'm talking to more than one woman at a time. I can't afford to close myself to other dating options  and become exclusive with one person while still in the getting to know stage. After we mutually feel a click with each other and accept each other, can we talk about exclusivity. I'm fine with her talking to other men too in the meantime. But if possible, we should be transparent and keep each other updated.

Also, I tell her ""I really like you, but we do have some incompatibilities. And areas where we struggle to understand each other. Realistically, it will be hard to make things work, but I'd love to give it a try. Our relationship deserves a chance. Let's not close the conversation so soon and let's continue to talk. I'm only saying it to keep your hopes and expectations in check.

Also, u should know that physical attraction is important to me. There's a certain type of looks I'm USUALLY not attracted to. But doesn't mean that's the case for every person who looks like that type. There are exceptions when I happen to be quite attracted to a person of that type of looks. ""

Then the girl says that she indeed happens to be that type only.

I reply "" yes. That's why I told you this aspect about myself in the beginning itself. I don't know why I'm not able to be attracted to all types of looks. And my intention was to not create in you high hopes.""

Then the girl says she doesn't want to talk anymore.

I say "" please don't go away. We connect so wonderfully on chat. I'd love to have a relationship with you. Instead of just closing off the possibility, why don't you send a Pic so we know for sure if I'd not be attracted. What have you got to lose? I won't misuse your pics. There is a 10% probability that I find you really attractive  And I don't need too much physical attraction if I connect with person in other aspects. I understand your privacy is important too but I feel it wouldn't hurt much to show a pic. It's not verified anyways. ""

She - "" no, forget it. You already said you are not into my type. I'm not that desperate to be liked. You'll find someone else, someone you like, don't worry. ""

Let's call him Joe. I've been with Joe for 5 years. We own a house together and have 2 dogs together.
 It was amazing for 1 year. 
Then Joe's depression came out along with his anger. I stood by him for 3 years, helping to build him up, get him help, counseling, anything he needed he got. (I'm going to leave out a huge chunk of this support and our trials because that is a novel itself) 
2 years ago, I made a major career move. I went from working on monday-friday 8-5 job with weekends and holidays off to a very stressful 12 hour per day job with no holidays off,  and 4 months of the year are night shift. It was a mutual decision because by working 12 hours a day, I would, in turn, get 3-4 days off a week. 
This career change and the type of work brought up some unresolved trauma from my childhood. Which he was aware of. While getting myself help immediately, I found out he drunkenly kissed my coworker. While I made the decision to forgive them both, it was a major hit to my battle with depression and set me back quite a lot. I did push him away. I threw myself into working on myself and my career. I sat him down multiple times and asked for his support. He was helpful with the support of the household (cleaning a bit more).
 I finally got on a medication that seemed to be helping. Starting that new medication was perfect timing. I started perking up on my birthday. We had an amazing family dinner with my family, and then his relatives came to visit. We laughed and joked. I finally felt myself again. 
He sat me down last night and told me that bow that I'm feeling better he can't be with me. He is scared this happiness will wear off, and I will become depressed again. I don't blame him for wanting a happy life. Everyone deserves one. It just hurts that my depression was his out.

But now I'm extremely worried and don't really know why.

They live in the state across from mine and are flying down to see me and their family. They were planning to fly down next Tuesday and we were going to spend like 3 days in the city hanging out (I live in a rural town 3 hours from the city so I was gonna drive there). And I was very excited.

This changed last night when they asked about a party I'm attending on Saturday night when they heard my dad and I talking about it. I told them about it and I think (I genuinely don't remember) I jokingly said ""are ya coming?"". She loves to tease and bully me and was saying things like ""well.... would you pick me up?"" Etc.. I was going along with it thinking that they were just teasing me the entire time until they told me that they booked the tickets for Saturday, and sent proof. I thought it would be something so unlike her to do. Like, flying to a city, getting into a guys car that's she's never met before, and travel 3 hours away from said city to a completely unfamiliar place just sounds like an insane thing to do. And it's happening. Like they told me how they gets SUPER nervous meeting strangers and has had trust issues and now this!?! I don't know what to think.

Now I'm like oh shit. She's coming into the middle of my life all of a sudden, and will meet all of the people I know, and all of my friends. I still live with my parents and am worried about what might happen. The party that we are going to is an end of year event for a community agency I volunteer at, so she will be meeting all of those people. And everyone is going to be drunk.

I'm watching a program called ""Becoming The Natural"" HIGHLY Recommended"" it's changing my view of women and dating completely. From the mainstream social narrative that I, and I'm sure you, have been fed! 

So anyway. Went out, spoke to 3 different women. 
Attempting to be as obnoxious and free worded as possible while still being respectful! 

Went up to the first woman I liked and said, ""are you into fat guys with beards?"" In which she just kept walking and I had a good laugh! 
Mission successful! 

Second woman I approached. I informed her how she aroused me as my gaze looked her way and it inspired me to talk to her. I then began saying anything on my mind!  I used a slightly subtler wording! 
She was alert at first but quickly relaxed and listened to me with full attention. 
After letting me talk and asking her for her number.  She lovingly said "" I'm actually getting married in 3 weeks"" in which I wished her all the happiness in the world. And continued on. Also having a laugh! 
Mission successful! 

Third woman was an Asian who I found out couldn't speak English! 
I asked her if she was single, and if she'd like that to change! In which she gave me this puzzled look. 
I recognised she couldn't understand me, kept talking anyway as if she could and wished her a good day. And to call me later. 
Also had a laugh! 

All in all, taught me rejection is nothing to fear like i thought. And it can actually be quite fun!

(We talked a lot about our friends, and in lithuania a lot of 18 years old hang out in the city with friends when they have nothing to do) 
I was holding her hand and  and she said "" could we meet your friends?"" 
I said no , but she talked me into it 
We went there, everything went fine, we went to the beach at midnight took some photos laughed and got back to city. 
Then everyone started to go home because it was late, and we went to near lake to talk for a bit. 
She said : "" you can put  your hand on my leg as you are driving if you want"" and later on asked me for a kiss.. 
 Then after like half an hour we decided to go home.. 
I drove her home and got out for a hug and kissed her to the cheek. 
 When driving home i asked would you like to go out tomorrow? She said yes we can
But the next day i had unexpected plans and had to go to a family meeting.. And said sorry but we can meet next weekend. 

The next day she writes me some serious signals which hurt me, something about not even talking anymore and.... 
I said could you stop doing that, and tell me whats wrong? 
She said we are moving to fast and I am not like that. 
 I was very confused but I thought okey, lets do it because i understood that, but was confused that she initiated a lot of things and now pushes everything back

 The next weekend she couldnt because??? Said she was going out with friends 

And then she gave again some mixed signals for no reason and she said that she doesnt like what we did and she wants to be friends first. 
I was hurt and said i dont want to be in friendzone 
She said its not really a friendzone she just wants to keep talking??? Cause she needs time to think about everything 
And every question i asked like :
How much time will you need? 
Do I have any chances? 
Do you want relationship 
To every single one of them she said ""i dont know"" 

Is she playing with me? 
Or she just wants to know more about me? 
The weird thing is, she doesnt talk much, and doesnt ask much questions..

More , when chatting she always gavę mixed signals acted hot and cold..

I’ve noticed this guy at my gym who I think is really attractive. I’m honestly not sure how long he’s been at the gym, it might just be that I’m going at a different time due to work so now I’m seeing a new set of people in the afternoons. He also looks like he knows what he’s doing because his physique is really flattering. 

I honestly don’t know how a guy would feel if a girl approached him and told him I found him attractive. Is that annoying to do at the gym? I obviously wouldn’t do it while he’s actively doing a set. I’m just not sure how to properly shoot my shot. I’ve never hit on a guy before or given one my number but this guy honestly has me contemplating putting myself out there lol.

I feel like I am probably venting as any logical person would say she does like me but I want to hear some thoughts on the situation/ someone to tell me I’m overthinking. So I have been talking to this girl for a little while, she has invited me to hang out before so eventually asked her on a date. Anyways the date went well we just talked the whole time and then went back to her place and continued to talk. I wanted to make a move and kiss her but couldn’t figure out how. Eventually I said I was going to leave and had a good opportunity to kiss her but lacked confidence but she actually kissed me and we made out for a little and continued talking. I’m not the most touchy guy in the world but she cuddled and laid on me and other little cute things. Having no experience I feel like I could’ve done better by playing w her hair or some other bullshit. Anyways I end up leaving, she asked me to stay the night which idk why tf I didn’t and once again folded on the opportunity to kiss her as I left. In the moment I enjoyed everything but didn’t really feel as crazy as I do about her now. After processing everything I feel basically in love which I have never felt remotely this way with any other girl as I pretty much have never talked to any other girl. We have texted over the phone last couple days but my insecurities basically tell me she doesn’t feel the same about me as I do about her. Like I don’t feel the same energy. I told her I want to hang out again but she said she’s busy the next couple days. Anyways she’s actually all i can think about and it’s effected my ability to focus throughout the day and my sleep has been terrible too. I feel like I messed up somehow by a lack of affection due to inexperience but I really feel like I need reassurance from her ASAP so I can stop stressing out so much.
