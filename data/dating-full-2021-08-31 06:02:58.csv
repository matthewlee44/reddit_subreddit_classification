Guys this will be a bit of long text so keep reading 😊 So I (25M) found this girl(24F) from Facebook and she sent me a hi through FB and said to share an online class banner. I shared it and I started talking with her very politely. So after like three or four weeks, we get to know each other well. At this time she was having some exams and she was pretty much stressed about it because she didn't study at all and her ex. Her ex used her two times and cheated on her. So she has that regret of being used. I told her how to manage the stress and other negative emotions just to make her life better because I felt bad for her. So again to exam topic, she said to she doesn't want to come on Facebook because of the exams and said to me let's meet later when the exams are over. So I said ok and time went by.

After two weeks a friend of mine called me and said a girl was trying to find me and she was scared of me because I didn't see the text she put to me (it's because of the covid). I immediately went to messenger and found that she sent me a message yesterday and I explained why I didn't see her text. My friend told me she asked my number too and he kind of supported me to hook this girl by giving her my number. I said ok to that. So we messaged and finally, she asked by sending my number to her saying ""is this ur number? a friend of mine gave it to me when I'm trying to find you"". I said yes it's my number and we started to message through WhatsApp. 

When I'm texting with her I feel a very genuine connection because she is always eager to message fast. She is a fan of animals(especially cats) Korean music and drama and me too. She sent me love emojis and very romantic, happy kind of songs from youtube. I also did the same. So after some days, I asked her why she takes pictures on her Facebook with the backside open not the front side. She said to me her face is ugly because of her big cheeks and slim body. So it feels like she has low esteem and insecurities. When she brought that up she said to me no one likes her because of her face and people neglecting her.  She thinks she is very ugly. But she is beautiful to me! I said ur beautiful and told her things to make her happy. But she kind of thinking about her insecurities more. We connect well. I want this girl in my life. I don't care about her face. But how can I convey this to her? How should I make her think of me? I really can't think of a way to connect with her more.

PS: Unable to meet with her IRL because the country I'm living in has covid Lockdown now. I kind of have trouble with texting because I'm a newbie and very shy. I have told her that she came into my mind when listening to a song before. Her answer was"" it's really good if you thinking of me"". I think maybe she feels something towards me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,980937,public,self,Desperately need help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf0cv3/desperately_need_help/,all_ads,6,,,

Growing up I always understood the ""friend zone"" to essentially be what happens when a woman tells a man that they are ""just friends"" which is code for ""I don't want to date you"".

But it always thought it was an odd concept because I never liked the idea of dating a stranger and never understood why other people would want to do it, or even why people would prefer it. It seemed to me that most women preferred it and I grew up believing that if you didn't ask a woman out within the first few interactions and started to become even slightly friendly that romance was automatically out of the question; many dating coaches, gurus, and pick-up artists even teach this (not suggesting that I'm particularly fond of any of those teachings). I'm not really stating what I believe here, just past experience.

So after seeing a study that found that 80 percent of relationships viewed by the study began as friendships and that blind dates, dating apps, and bars were the worst way to find relationships, I got to thinking ""does the friendzone actually exist and is starting with friendship really a bad thing?"" Of course I understand that if you're already friends for a long time and no romantic relationship has been established or romantic interest shown then that is one thing, but I'm thinking in more absolute terms. Women: are you strictly against dating men after you've met them and they haven't immediately shown romantic interest, and are you strictly against dating a friend? Is it more advantageous for men to avoid being friendly with romantic interests and/or should a man give up if a woman doesn't immediately show romantic interest after initially meeting?

I don't know because all I know is, I can't date someone I've just met. If I haven't known you for a few months at least, have had a handful of interactions, and have a decent idea of who you are, I'm not going to be interested whatsoever.

After 2 years of decent success as a pick up artist, I grew tired of the manipulative nature of the ‘game’, so one day I decided to change my approach. 


If I wanted to have sex with somebody I would just ask. That’s it. If I saw an attractive women at the bar, I would go right up and start some dirty talk. Or if I saw a hot women at the grocery store I would tell her she’s hot, if I managed to grab her number I would get straight to sending those dirty messages. 


As expected, I was met with hostility majority of the time, but that was ok. I guess we just wanted different things in life, there was no need for me to get angry about it. Respectfully part ways and try with the next.  


This was 1000x less effective than your traditional manipulative seduction bullshit hey I still managed to get a small amount of lays. I don’t even see the point of getting to know the person if all you’re going to do is screw each other. Wtf for? We’re here to screw man! And guess what these women had to say afterward? They respected it. There was no bullshit. This is how the world should be....


But everybody loves living in a fantasy. Everybody loves hearing sweet little things in their ear. Everybody loves fake. That’s the kind of world we live in. 



Even though I was getting a lot less sex (no sex at times) , a little voice inside of me felt proud. I was being authentic. I was being legit in a phoney world. Which fulfilled me more than what I was doing before. I used to be a fake Casanova who would woo his way into the pants of women. And guess what? It didn’t even make me happy. I just felt like a massive phoney. If you want sex then act like it, if you want a relationship then act like it. I rage inside when I see men picking up women at the bars, spitting all that phoney bullshit just to take them home and have sex for one night. What kind of world do we live in. We shouldn’t even be pretending to care about each other’s lives. 



If you want a relationship, then act like it. Don’t pretend to be interested in her romantically if you just want to have sex. If you really want something deeper don’t you think sex can wait??? 


I’m not saying to get on your knees and propose to her on the first date, what I’m saying is keep the aura about you.

My preferred approach is as simple as this: 

I see an attractive women shopping. I go up, look her in the eye and tell her she’s hot and I want her number. After getting the woman’s number, I’m sending her dirty messages straight away. This is as authentic as it gets. I’m signalling ‘I don’t want to get to know you, I just want to fuck you’. 

Or if I see a hot woman at the bar, I’ll go up and tell her ‘ I wanna fuck you. You wanna come home with me?’ . That’s it. You don’t need to exchange life stories to have sex with each other. It’s just pointless. I think flirting is pointless to be honest.


The problem with pick up culture is that there is too much emotional investment. It relies on Jedi mind tricks to bed women. Pick up is an industry I was heavily influenced by, and after becoming disillusioned with it and awoken to the bullshit nature of this world I had a massive problem with romance in our culture. 


Us men initiate everything right. So the problem starts with us. If you want sex, ACT LIKE IT. If you want a girlfriend, ACT LIKE IT. In this phoney world we live in, I promise you that being authentic will fix all your issues. 


Imagine if men were actually honest with women. A lot of bullshit would be avoided and no women would get get her heart broken.

Within hours we had moved over to Whatsapp and we have agreed to go for a drink soon. I said I would find a nice bar for us to go to and she has given me her schedule. 

– Tomorrow night,   
– Friday night (but can only have 1 drink)  
– Or next week, when she'll be more free  


How best to play this? Do I agree tomorrow while momentum is on my side (may involve a bit of frantic preparation), go for a quick drink on Friday and hope for a second date, or opt for next week and hope she doesn't change her mind or get bored chatting? I thought about giver her a couple of options but I heard that girls like guys to take the initiative.

About a day after posting my original post I (27m) decided to try out hinge, literally the first woman(23f) I match with ends up being one of the most amazing people I've ever met on dating apps. We immediately hit it off and our conversations last hours. Our first date went amazing, and we've been meeting up for dinner every week since. We've even planned a day where we can just spend all day together without worrying about work, just go to a lake and relax, and then riff on bad movies all night.

However, the girl from the original post keeps messaging me saying I'm an asshole for not talking to her anymore, but she made it clear in our last conversation she wanted nothing to do with me. I've since blocked her number, I don't need that stress in my life. It's not that I don't care about her, it's just that I know I'm not the person for her and our interactions just cause us both stress.

When it comes to potential partners, I'm especially attracted to women who are educated, are not afraid to share their opinion, and are either really passionate or good at something that they do. As I am introverted and Covid is still very present here despite vaccinations, I have taken up dating mostly through dating apps. This hasn't been easy, but I manage to get a date once in a while.   


Just yesterday I met a girl for a first date. We had texted for about a month prior to that. We made lunch together at my place and I showed her a bit around town (there's nothing to interpret about the date's location; I think I simply give off a harmless vibe). I enjoyed myself and I think I quite liked her, but I'm not sure I was able to show that properly (eg maybe not enough compliments). As I mentioned before, I'm quite introverted and it takes me a while to feel comfortable enough around a person to be my true self (especially if that person is a woman). This takes forms such as that I'm afraid to put on music I like during a date and instead try to look for something more generic, or that I sometimes have quite a lot of inhibition preventing me from saying things that just come to mind. Adding to that are general insecurities that I have accumulated over the 3-year period of being single, mostly that I will fuck up by not being enthusiastic enough, focusing too much on the informational content of my speech rather than the social aspect, not asking enough questions, initiating physical contact too soon or too late, and not being able to sense my real feelings through this veil of anxiety. Anyways, the date lasted about 6 hours and we said our goodbyes. I texted her later that night because she had forgotten something at my place and also because I was keen on seeing her again. In the hours before I texted her, I felt anxious, much like if I feared failing an exam. I played the date back in my head, cringing at some of my behaviors. Apparently, though, she also had a good time, keen on meeting again, although we didn't set a second date yet.   


I'm aware that y'all do not know me and do not have any way to evaluate whether I am completely socially inept or reasonably normal. I'm just looking for advice on how to approach dating such that I can allow myself to feel emotions that are actually related to the person I'm meeting and not to my anxiety. On top of that, I know that it takes me a while to develop feelings for someone. So, even without the anxiety, I would often be clueless. I find it hard to escalate things physically just based off of some societal schedule for Western dating. Should I communicate that? I don't know... Anyways, my thoughts for the (potential) next date are that I should steer things more toward relationship talk (I know, I should have done that before) and try to be a bit more relaxed, although I don't know whether I'll be able to succeed at the latter.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,981339,public,self,When anxiety overshadows potential feelings,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf6ppp/when_anxiety_overshadows_potential_feelings/,all_ads,6,,,

Then he had to go away with his family for a little over a week and we texted a couple times, then I didn’t hear from him for a week. When he got back he basically made a comment about that and that he was trying to gauge how I was feeling by not texting me. He was a very intentional dater, told me he wanted to be in something serious but, seemed to respect that I didn’t want to rush into something serious either. After feeling like he “tested” me I kinda freaked and said I think we are looking for different things and I’m just not ready right now.

Earlier this year she landed a great job in a field she has been wanting to be in for a long time. I'm happy for her. 

Now that she is making actual money, would it be fair if she took over some more bills? Or should our system that worked when she had less money still apply?

She obviously wants to keep the old system, and I don't blame her. Her hard work is paying off. But she noticeably has more spending money at the end of the day than I do. Which is fine, but also it would be nice if we both had the same amount of spending money.

My last relationship lasted almost 3 years, so I’m nervous to put myself back out there and I really don’t know where to begin. Online dating apps have been tough for me because I’m not great at texting and I just haven’t felt a connection to any guy that I’ve met online.

Another great example is my relationship right now. She’s a very sweet and nice girl, but after going on a few dates with her I got to know her a lot more and what she wants. All she wants to do is make out and not get to know each other on an intellectual level. We actually have a lot in common, but it seems like she was just let out of her cage when she met me, because her family is Catholic which would make a lot of sense lol.

I'm not quite sure if this post will help anybody but I hope it does.

So I'm quite interested in dating myself and have been browsing through Reddit community's all about dating and stuff.

But sometimes I wonder why they are so many people trying to get into a relationship as fast as possible. With out any regards for themselves and their emotions or for there partners feelings.
There are also the people that want to date with out being truly happy, by themselves and for themselves first and I don't quite understand, why.
I have read about people complaining, about things they have no control over, like there hight, face and etc., and I'm not saying that they shouldn't let out there concerns, it's good for oneself to let it all out, but it shouldn't be an obsession or an excuse to you to make yourself more miserable.

I know it's already a long post but i wanted to give you all a bit of advice even if it is obvious.

1. Take your time, don't rush yourself or others, most people forget that it takes time to life, to learn new things, and to find love.

2. Be happy first and have your life sorted out because a relationship is not just fun and games, many believe it is not there responsibility to take care of there partner, but that's just wrong and irresponsible.

3. A Crush and someone you love a two different things, it might be obvious but many often forget that.

4. Respect your Partner always be Respectful, you are both trying to achieve the same thing.

5. Know your boundaries and communicate these to your partner.

6. It's okay to have argument's it's actually normal, just know how to calm the anger of you both.

7. Don't blame yourself if a relationship doesn't work out, just reflect on your past, cry and try better next time, your life is long and there are many opportunities to find new love.

8. Invest time and effort In to your partner and I don't mean just at the beginning of your relationship but the rest of your life.

9. Be prepared to be mentally and emotionally exhausted form time to time, in these moments you need a partner that is prepared to protect you and be supportive of you.

10. Follow your heart not your desire, because short term things hurt if you are not prepared for them.

It maybe quite obvious to most of you but it is just a friendly reminder to take yourself seriously and be honest with yourself and the people around you. I hope you all take care and date responsibly for everyone's safety and  well-being.

She's pretty cute, and I like her. Previously on Facebook, it said she was in a relationship. Now I noticed that relationship status is gone completely. Despite us working at the same place, we don't have much contact. We just say hi, and have short chats sometimes. A year or so ago, before I knew she had a thing with her soon to be bf, I was into her and may have given her small hints of interest. She may have noticed me looking at her a few times, and I went to talk with her a few times. I can't know for sure if she saw it as interest, but I did stop doing that after she announced her relationship on FB (which she did shortly after all of this). I'm thinking maybe she realized I liked her. Anyway, I started to keep my distance from her from that point.

Fast forward a year. I check my phone a Monday, and to my surprise, there are two messages from her. Then I see that the two messages have been removed by her three minutes after she sent them. So I couldn't read what she had written. They were sent in the late evening the day before I checked my phone. I had been asleep when she sent them. This was on FB Messenger btw, and we are on each other's friend lists. At first, I thought it would be best to ignore it. Then I noticed she no longer had the relationship status, and it made me curious. I sent a message asking what the messages were about, and this is what she replied: oh I just sent it to the wrong person, in the second message I wrote that I sent it to the wrong &lt;insert my name&gt; 🙈.

That was probably what happened, but I just find it so weird and coincidental. I'm the only person on her friend list with my name, out of 130 or so ppl. How did she send it to me, if she was going to send it to someone else with the same first name? Wouldn't you have to search for that persons page and then hit the message button? And how often do you message someone who isn't even on your friend list? How do you NOT notice my close-up face profile photo when sending a message?

Could she have done it on purpose for some reason? To make me click her profile and see her relationship status gone maybe? Did she write something to me, and then panic and regret it? Was she just messing with me?

She wasn't at work the next few days after that. She had called in sick. Related? Today, I met her at work again and said hi with a normal polite smile. She seemed normal and greeted me back the same. Both of us are shy, and I find it hard to approach her to talk.  I wonder if she feels the same lol.

I'm not here to start any arguments or try to encourage sexist views of any sort. These are simply my observations. Please don't bring any negative energy

I'm an athletic, good looking PhD student who just moved to start his new program. Decided to get on Bumble recently to try and meet people I could explore the city with. Uploaded my best pictures, made sure to have a solid bio, and got swiping. After several days, I've been pretty underwhelmed

My takeaways:

- Though I've gotten a lot of good matches, hardly anyone actually messaged me (for those of you unfamiliar with Bumble, the women have to message first). I rarely extend, because the way I see it, if someone couldn't be bothered to message in a 24 hour window, they're probably not that interested (and I have no interest in playing games if the person is waiting to see whether I extend or not). On the rare occasion I did extend, it made no difference

- The messages I did get were incredibly low-effort: just ""hi"" or ""how are you""

- A lot of the profiles I've seen are really lazy. At least half of them just seem like the girls advertising their Insta page (you know the type: nothing in their profile other than their handle)

- One girl unmatched me after finding out I'm ""not American"" (I'm ethnically Middle Eastern but born and raised in the USA). Not sure why she matched me to begin with?

- While it's easy to quickly feel defeated on these apps, I think it's important to remember they're not a reflection of your quality as a person (this is true for guys and girls alike). I'm not sure how much this serves true for guys on these apps, but a lot of the girls I came across gave the impression of only being there for attention, validation, etc., and have no interest in actually meeting

- **This is especially important for guys to keep in mind on dating apps**: For those of you ""normal"" men like me, remember that most women on apps deal with a lot of awkward/creepy guys. I've heard a lot of horror stories from friends/acquaintances/dates. If a girl seems hesitant or wants to take it slow, don't take it personally

- That said, if someone seems flaky/dodgy, it's better to assume they're not interested and move on. If someone is genuinely interested, you'll know it. If you find yourself wondering if the person actually wants to go out or if they're interested, the answer is most likely ""No"". Trust your gut and don't get too hung up on one person

- While there is a lot of nonsense on these apps, there are also people who are willing to meet up with you. I've got two dates planned within the next week 

- Above all else, I think using these apps should complement your real life efforts, not replace them. I'd still rather meet someone organically, because then there's no ""hiding"" or tailoring a profile to only showcase somebody's ""greatest hits"", but having these apps, especially as someone new to the area, doesn't hurt. Just don't take them too seriously

- Last, and most importantly: love yourself and keep improving",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,981518,public,self,My honest impression of dating apps and takeaways,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf9pf6/my_honest_impression_of_dating_apps_and_takeaways/,all_ads,6,,,

Very few people dorm, and there’s barely any campus life. 

It’s my first day of school, so I’m on the train for the first time. I see a girl I think is cute get on also, and we glance at each other and make eye contact for a brief moment, before we sit down in separate seats a few rows away from one another.

Then transfer to another train to get into NYC. I get onto the train platform to switch trains, and the girl does as well. We make eye contact again for a brief moment, but I’m too shy to make a move. 
We finally both get off the train and arrive  in NYC. We make eye contact for a third time. This time, she asks me for directions. 

I confess that I don’t know the way around since it’s my first day, but I offer to walk with her and try to figure it out. She happily agrees.

So we’re walking to college (it’s a 25 minute walk) and we start chatting. The convo is going great. We have a lot in common, we’re both really involved and I’m really into her. She has a great sense of style, beautiful straight brown hair, sparkling green eyes. I can go on and on. 

We finally arrive at college and she’s late for class. We say goodbye to each other and agree emphatically to meet up in the future/take the train together. She gives me her number and we say goodbye. 

Later that day, I text her and ask if she wants to meet up during the week. She responds an hour later saying she has a super busy schedule so it probably wouldn’t work out. 

Understandable. 

Then I ask her if she’d like to meet up on Friday/Saturday. She says she’s away for the weekend.

I’m a relationship rookie and don’t know what this means. This is the first time I think a girl was even into me (I was really school/extracurricular focused in HS and didn’t  make time for girls/relationships.)

Is she into me? Are her reasons for not being able to meet up a polite rejection? How can I know if she’s into me or if she just wants me as a friend to take the train with?

If I lived in the lower 48, this would be less of an issue, I could take a day trip to a neighboring state or major city to look further. I've heard so many people complain that 100 miles is such a long way. Consider this - the nearest major city to me is Seattle, and I am 200 miles further from there than San Diego is. I cannot take a day trip to another state to go bar hopping or otherwise, it is prohibitively costly and time consuming just to get there, especially running the high risk that I will come home with nothing but rejections to show for it. 

Long distance is the only thing I can realistically do. If I am ever to find someone, it must be online or through some form where I know what city I need to fly to in order to meet her. I have accomplished this twice, but those relationships were before corona gave internet dating a stranglehold on the whole game. 

This is an issue that I don't think I've ever seen addressed anywhere, because most people can drive to another city in a couple of hours. No amount of ""being yourself"" and ""confidence"" and ""personality"" can overcome numbers like this, and so many people write off long distance entirely because they don't really need it. For me it's the only way possible.

I get approached on most nights I go out, bars/pubs etc, so it’s not that I know I’m undesirable, but I feel undesirable to the people I desire?

Every time a man asks for my number, he’s so far from my type. I always make sure to thank them and say that I’m not interested. 

I typically wait for the guy to make the first move, because then I *really* know he’s interested and can take it from there but after a recent experience it’s turned me so far off. A few days ago I was at a festival and gave my number to 2 guys who I had got chatting to and fancied (complete separate occasions). I felt great, “look at me!” I thought. “I’m shooting my shot for the first time ever with guys”. And you know the funny thing is? As I was leaving the festival, I was approached by a guy who asked for my number, but he wasn’t my type. 

But they haven’t been particularly chatty since. I’m tired and deflated. The same goes for OLD. If I initiate conversation they’re disinterested. Sometimes I’ll have a great conversation with someone but you never hear from them the next day, I call these guys “one hit wonders”.

The conversation flowed very well and she seemed interested in getting to know me. She confided in me that she had never been so long talking to someone by text (positively) and that the conversation never got boring. The idea was to have a date soon (in the last 2 weeks she has been away on vacation). However, at the end of last week, everything changed due to a single event.

We were texting and I told her I was taking a break from work to cook a snack. If she wanted she could call me and we would talk a little. My idea here was to transition from text messages to a call and later to a date (which would be this week, after she got back from vacation).

She said it was weird for us to talk by call and she wouldn't call. I was a little perplexed as I wasn't counting on the reaction. Strange to me would be going on a date with a person without hearing their voice or without getting a taste of the person's conversation. At least for me, it would be a more real way to see the dynamics of the conversation and whether there was chemistry. We talked a little more by text and then I went back to work. She no longer responded to messages I sent her. Okay, I was ghosted.

After 3 days yesterday, I sent her a message alerting her to an important situation (a stupid streamer on twitch that exposed her and other girls' profiles in a dating app) and she responded quickly in a long text and thanked me a lot. She spoke to me as if nothing had happened. The subject stopped there and I didn't respond to her bearing in mind that the purpose of that message was just to give you this information.

I have more options and so does she. However, I am perfectly aware that she was enjoying the conversation and that she was finding our interaction different from what she had previously (she commented to me). Probably, the only thing that made her ghost was the fact that I suggested a call with her. She may have thought I was a weirdo (sounds a bit extreme to me but she has the right to think that about me). However, we spoke by message for 1 month and she never had anything negative to me, on the contrary. She always said that I was super mature and that our conversations were different from others. It's all super confusing to me.

For now, I don't plan on sending her any message. In the future, who knows, but I won't think about it now. I want to know your perspective. What do you think of this whole situation and what would you do if you were with you?

Hi !

I made a thread the other day because I didn't wanted to engage in small talks. But I find it very hard in the current state of the dating scene to get to know women without getting through this phase. Since I'm not confortable approaching women in the streets, I think I'd focus on the dating apps. The 3 first pictures are on the dating apps (the first one is a different one without the paper)

I'm 6ft1, kinda slim but athletic.

I think I'm able to connect with people, and I want to. I just need to increase my opportunities, and I really have a hard time figuring out how. I really can't manage to have any matches, or only with girls that I don't find attractive or with girls who won't answer or be cold/boring. It is a really boring experience and I don't know how to get it more stimulating.

Maybe it's because I look like a child or a girl, or because i'm too skinny, or my hair. I really don't know what's wrong. I really like myself tho, but it looks like that's not enough for online dating",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,981650,public,self,Am i enough for dating apps ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfc6sp/am_i_enough_for_dating_apps/,all_ads,6,,,
