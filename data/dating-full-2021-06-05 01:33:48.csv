Hi guys, I (22M) have been seeing this pretty cool girl(23F)I met off of tinder, and we’ve been on three dates so far, all of which seemed to go really well. We went to a zoo, a botanical garden, went kayaking, and then watched a movie at my house. Nothing escalated between us, mainly because i’m very shy and awkward and I haven’t found a way to breach the topic. Anyways, today was a week from our third date, and I asked her out again for the fourth early in the week, around Monday and she said this weekend she’d go to a festival with her friend, but she’d see if she could figure out a day for us to go with her schedule. She got back to me and we decided today, Friday. Earlier today she texted me and she apologized and said she got really sick and would have to cancel, I said that wasn’t an issue and wished for her to feel better. I told my friends about this and they told me that was her politely letting me know she’s no longer interested because I failed to make a move on her the previous times we spent time with one another. My one friend who found his girlfriend through online dating suggested i check her profile on tinder out, because if she switched it up she probably wants to attract more confident guys or something like that. I checked and she added more photos and basically revamped her profile and put her instagram in her bio and said to dm her. I don’t have an instagram account or any social media and we spoke about that on our second date while we walked around this city getting boba tea. We had long quality conversations on all of the dates, or at least it seemed to me. Are my friends right that she lost interest because i’m too awkward and haven’t tried to make a move on her?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,816972,public,self,Is this girl letting me down politely?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsl5eb/is_this_girl_letting_me_down_politely/,all_ads,6,,,

Okay so about 2 months ago. I went on a first date with a girl that I matched with. We had spoken a few times via text and Snapchat for a few weeks prior to the initial date. She seemed a little inconsistent and hot and cold but I thought I’d ask her out anyway. When I eventually asked her out she seemed very enthusiastic. When we got on the date she made sure she looked her best. (Hair, nails done, lashes. Etc) which I found quite flattering because i think she’s done this the day of our date to make sure she looks good for me. But anyway she seemed to have very high interest initially. The date went well. We had dinner and some drinks and she ended up staying over at my place and we had sex. The sex was mediocre because I was fairly drunk at that point and a little off my game. Neither of us finished but at that point we were tired so we just went to sleep and she still cuddled up to me afterward. The next morning she seemed a little more distant. I went in for a kiss the next morning (stupid I know) and she seemed a little hesitant. I drove her home and then didn’t contact her for about 3 days. Eventually I initiated contact saying I had a good time with her and I would like to see her again sometime. He replies seemed to be a lot slower then they were before. But she still came off somewhat friendly and as though she hadn’t totally lost interest. I was careful not to over pursue this girl and at this point forward I started only really reaching out to her to plan dates. So the following week I tried to make plans with her but she was busy. Then I tried again the week after and she said something like. “I might be able to after I do this I’ll let you know” so at this point I figured it’s probably over. I gave up. Went no contact and stopped trying to plan dates with her. About 3 weeks of no contact at all goes by and she reaches out to me for the first time ever. And she asks me what I’m doing for the weekend. This got me excited. Because I figured me pulling back had obviously sparked her interest. We ended up going on a date that weekend and the texts leading up to that date she seemed like she was interested in me again. But then when the date came around she was late. (Although her excuse seemed pretty legit) and after we had a few drinks she started talking on the phone and texting a lot. Possibly even to other guys. This pissed me off but I tried to remain calm and not really react. Why would she ask me out on a date (when I was clearly prepared to move on) and then behave in this way when we are on the date? I also noticed she barely ever looked me in the eye. She did this a little bit on the first date but I figured it was due to nerves. But this time it was even less eye contact. She didn’t stay over this time as we both had plans the next day. And I didn’t get any action this time around aside from some kissing at the end. Since this date she has apologised via text because she felt like she got too drunk. We’ve had a couple small conversations back and fourth but I’m not sure what I should do going forward. I really don’t know if she’s interested in me or not. She’s talking to other guys I know that. And I get the feeling I’m not at the top of the list or even if I’m on the list at all anymore. I’m always trying to pursue other girls and keep my options open. But I’m more attracted to this girl than any girl I’ve been with in the last 3-4 years.

I’ve done a lot for myself and I recently started dating again. I went on a dating app where I matched with a really attractive guy that I had seen on campus before and I was excited when he messaged me and we agreed to get some food later that week. 


I had heard some rumors about him from friends about some of his history and I was a bit taken back but wanted to go on a first date with someone I was really attracted to after my breakup. I was looking to test the waters and see how I felt. 

Prior to the date, I bought a really nice dress and I was really excited but last minute he ended up canceling because he was too drunk to drive and “didn’t want to meet me for the first time drunk” I was really upset because I was all ready and I was basically stood up. (He was a senior in college so he was celebrating with his frat and that’s why he was drunk ) I cried that whole afternoon because I felt so defeated that my first attempt to date after my abusive relationship ended had gone so horribly. 


The next day he messaged me and apologized and asked when I was free again. I debated responding but I caved and gave him another chance. Since then we’ve been talking but not seriously more so casual. I definitely am playing it cool and I don’t appear as interested anymore. 

Last night, he posted a video of him out at a baseball game and he recorded the shoes of a girl that he was with. I immediately was turned off and was a bit upset but I wasn’t sure if it was his sister or a friend but I assumed  it was a girl he was talking to. This morning, I woke up to a text from him asking when I was free for a date. I was confused and I have yet to respond. 

He seems like a genuine guy. He’s very smart and funny and nice but I also heard that he cheated on his last girlfriend and he’s also leaving the state in a couple months for grad school whereas I still have a year left to finish my undergrad.

I'm in a new job that I moved more than a few states away for, so I don't really have anybody to hang out with. It was my birthday last week and I asked a bunch of my other (mostly male) co-workers to come out with me to a local bar to celebrate and most of them declined. She said yes and got a few of my male counterparts to tag along, so already in digging the fact that she was kind enough to come out with me on my birthday to celebrate (even if it was with other people).

I enjoyed hanging out with her and would like to do it again. But I'd like to do it with just her. We're friendly around the office and she seemed to enjoy coming out with me too. But part of the problem, other than the fact that she's a co-worker, is that this is a *very* professional ,white collar (literally) job. Everybody dresses business formal every day. So I'm not working some rinky dink job that doesn't matter. I don't want to ask my co-worker out and have it blow up in my face.

I already sort of attempted to ask her out, by the way. Asked her last Friday morning at work if she had any plans that night and she said she had to go to a baby shower. I know this was a legit excuse because she had mentioned it when we'd gone out for my birthday and I'd just forgotten. Anyway, I'm not sure if she could tell I was trying to ask her out or if she thought I was just making conversation. I didn't want to be too direct because... Well... We were at work. And there were other people around. 

The other potential problem is that she's an intern. I am a full-time employee. I am by no means in a senior position within the company. Not even close. However, I *am* above an intern. I don't want it to look like I'm leveraging my marginally higher position to coerce her, etc. That's not what I'm trying to do and that's not how I want it to look either. 

Anyway, I want to try to ask her out again to see how things work out. But I'm not sure if I even should and, if I should, how I should do it. It's hard to get her alone at work to ask since we don't work directly or closely with one another. But looking up her phone number in the company directory and texting her or sending a friend request on Facebook and asking her via DM don't seem like great options either. 

If she says no, I'll be fine. I'm not the sort of guy to make life hard for women who don't feel the same way about me as I do them. But I also don't want to find out down the line that I missed an opportunity. However, I also *really can't fuck up this job.*

What do you guys (and gals) think? Should I do this? Is it worth the risk? I have a good female friend who's told me she thinks it's ultimately a bad idea. But I wanted outside opinions.

Also we're both quite religious (not Christian) and that kind of thing is forbidden before marriage in our religion. There was also a thing where he dated someone and moved on *very* quickly to another girl. I talked to girl #1 and she said ""It was while not after"".

I have no freaking clue what it is. I already know that im really trying to make this work but I have no clue why. Ive been with other girls before in this manner but for some reason I have such an obligation to be romantic with her when I cant tell if its fitting or not. The thought of being with someone else is out of the question but I could be having sparks with someone else. Or I couldn't be. Maybe im not a sparks person if thats even a thing and it just takes lots of time for me to like someone. I just have no idea. I dont know what to do about it. Im going to talk to her about it next time we hang out but if anyone here could give some advice it would be greatly appreciated. Reading back on this post I dont even know what youd give me advice about haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing about our conversation not being great is we can have some good amount of silence. Silence doesnt bother me in fact I like silence. My job has me work in the car with another guy and I look forward to the days when I know the other guy is also quiet like me. But im always worried that shes uncomfortable with the silence and that shes thinking about being with one of her friends who she could be laughing with right now and having great conversation with them. Im also worried to bring this up cause I can guarantee I think about this so much more than she does. Well I cant guarantee it but I can just tell that im overthinking this tremendously. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive never overthought like this in my life and I just don't know why I am with her. Every other crush ive had ive easily ridden off when it didnt work. But with her i want it to work so bad. 

I talked to my mom about this and I asked if her and my dad had sparks on their first date and she said yes. I couldnt even type should I just give up on her cause it made me nauseous. But should I? A part of me really wants her and the other doesnt. But when I think of not having her I get ill.

We FaceTimed once so far (proposed by me a week ago) and it went very well, too. I was the one who ended it because I had to.

But when it comes to texting, she will mention small things about her day to start convo, but we only message a couple times throughout the day. Often we don't even finish the conversation on the same day lol.

When I mention stuff, I get simple responses like ""hell yeah!"" or ""that's sick!"" depending on what I mention. Never any questions, or meaningful additions. But every time she mentions something like above, I'll ask questions and the conversation will flow naturally. I don't understand it. Two major observations about our conversations that signal contradictory conclusions about her interest.

And on top of this, all dates and FaceTime are initiated by me. She hasn't once asked me to do anything, and it really makes me question her interest again. I plan on asking her next week to FaceTime again, as I don't want to pester her, but holy shit I really wish she'd ask me to.

This is driving me insane, and I'm only a third of the way through summer. It's honestly ruining it, spending all day questioning whether or not she's into me.

I have noticed a deep craving for a relationship less than a month after my breakup. 
Backstory is my gf at the time (middle of April) broke up with me due to me being unavailable since I’ve been focusing more on school and passing my boards. Luckily the split was mutual, however within 2 weeks I jumped into another “entanglement” with a girl that ended a week later due to her family’s disapproval of her dating. After this second split I became mentally burnt out with relationships and deleted all OLD apps to focus more on passing my boards and re-development. Recently, I’ve passed my boards and am currently getting on the job market to make reasonable money. 
However I intend on getting back to school for bachelors and possibly more, and I am not sure if it’s a good idea to get into any relationships while thrusting myself into school again. Despite this mindset, I’ve been craving companionship like crazy and I am not sure whether I should stick staying single (after 9 months of dating) or give a relationship another try.

guys if my crush \[M17\] says he wants us to work on ourselves before getting into any sort of love stuff, do i \[F17\] still have a chance w him in the future?

here's the situation that led me here for context. so my guy friend knows i like this other guy (his ex friend). my guy friend and i are always on and off, he's a very toxic friend and i liked my crush before talking to guy friend again but yeah. one day he went to a party and told my crush i liked him and crush said he didnt feel the same. guy friend comes back and tells me this so then i was badly overthinking abt everything (i am a very sensitive person and tend to take it personally).

the next day i decide to actually go to crush and talk about it at school. i was talking to crush about what happened and he said not to be embarrassed or ashamed, its not me, its just he wants us to both focus on ourselves. he called me attractive and believes i can become a surgeon (its my biggest goal) called me the most hardworking person he knows.

im feeling really confused rn, and im having trouble focusing on myself. i felt like i just chased him instead of letting things come to me naturally, perhaps some internal insecurity about trying to get him to reciprocate. when i get my shit together and he does too, would it be possible i could give it another go? we ate still good friends and communication wise there is no strain everything is as usual.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,817169,public,self,do i have a chance?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsnd59/do_i_have_a_chance/,all_ads,6,,,

I met him when he was in my town and we had a thing but he was just there for the summer and he left but kept in touch for a lil but we fell off for a while but recently got back in touch. he lives in europe and im moving there in 2 months so we kinda agreed to stay friends but wish to see eachother again but not actively making plans to it happening or committed to it.

So ever since that talk we chat at most every 2 weeks. We always have pretty boring (not to me because i like talking to him at all, dont know if its the same for him) convos but he still always texts me again so i guess he doesn't mind. I recently added him on snapchat after we had just been direct messaging because i like being able to send pic messages and i've sent him videos of me talking when i didnt feel like texting. But like he'll send me snaps of maybe his cat or a random pic of his face ,and i do think he sends it to other friends as well, and when I snapback a pic (usually just one of my face and not really responsive) he leaves it on open, unless i ask a question. Or once he sent a pic of him doing a poker face so i replied back in a pic ""poker face"" and he left it on opened but then a couple hours later responded to it. But then the day after that he sent a pic to me about his tattoo and it was in english so i assume it was just for me and i snapped him back a shocked emoji and he commented on me being in the woods (thats where i was when i sent him the pic) and we had a convo. But when I send him the occasional snap of me doing something he leaves me on opened, and i do send stuff that he could reply to, if he wanted.

So i guess im just wondering like is it a bad thing that he leaves me on opened when i send snap when he does reply to direct messages? Should i take it as that being how he uses snapchat or take it as me just being boredom relief?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,817246,public,self,Is it bad if when you send a guy snaps he leaves you on open but responds to actual texts?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsodil/is_it_bad_if_when_you_send_a_guy_snaps_he_leaves/,all_ads,6,,,

Well, I have.
So, I thought about how to fix this problem. The truth is, people’s “Wonderful” pictures and profile only convey a little. Maybe just 10% of what someone is really like. Often, they’re the opposite of what they say. No drama means drama, Easy going means Not easy going etc.
I’m hearing you think, but what about the text conversation?
Well, it’s so hard to communicate who you are in text and a lot of people that are bad at texting have Wonderful personalities and are great at in-person &amp; some Wonderful texters are horrible in-person.
And what happens after getting all excited about someone’s pics/profile and texting when the phone call or even better video chat falls flat?
Wow! It can be so disappointing. All that buildup, like a good movie/series with a horrible ending. It can be a real bummer, like dropping ice cream.
If you’ve had this happen a few times, you may have thought, How can I fix this problem?
Intro Video 
If you can immediately see the negatives of an intro video for dating, it could be because the thought of making an intro video sends shivers down your spine. What background/lighting should I use? Where should I shoot it? Standing or sitting? Alone or with friends? Etc. Etc. Then, you may think: What if someone records my video and does something weird with it or you might just be really shy and think, “I’m not a Youtuber, I don’t make videos.”
But, let’s explore the positives.
It’s just a minute or two. You can just sit on your couch, look good, wait until you’re in a good mood, make the video and upload it. Easy peasey.
And, if someone does something weird with it, chances are you’ll never find out, or even better, maybe you can sue them and get some money. But, let’s be honest, no one will probably care enough anyways. 
And what about Catfishing? Have you ever seen gorgeous photos and the person looked way different and accidentally was 20 years older?
Or fake spam accounts? I’d like to see their intro videos! Hahaha
And, let’s not take our eyes off the prize: Our potential soul mate, true love or even just friend/hook up. Them. The reason we’re swiping/liking 100’s of matches in the first place. Don’t you want them to know you a lot better? Don’t you want to know them a lot better? Don’t you want to spend 1-2 minutes (or less) Watching their personal video to see if they’re even worth a text / text reply that will possibly lead to a call/video chat/date? I do.
And, you could make your video last a few minutes, hours, a day or until you make your next video.
Online dating apps can not only be a real time sink/waste of time, but they can also suck your mental and emotional energy as well as prevent you from trying to connect with people in the real world.
Let’s be honest. Have you ever stayed in on a Friday or Saturday night, swiped and messaged a match on an app and “felt” like you’re dating? Like you’re making progress in your love life, only to never call/meet this person and actually are totally fooling yourself, hiding at home, actually spinning your wheels… Well, I have. And I’m not proud of it. There’s a little voice inside me saying, don’t message people, go out and talk to them. Meet someone in real life.
But what if online dating apps were much richer and more efficient with Intro videos? Now we’re talking!
In videos, you can read body language, posture, emotions, tone of voice and even background choice. I’m sure some people will make a video at the club or bar vs. living room/kitchen or at the beach. And what about people who smile, laugh, have pets or some interesting hobby. If it’s in their video, that would be a great ice breaker/conversation starter.
Ok, if you like the idea of an intro video, please message all the apps with a help message right in the app or an email.
What are some other ways to improve dating apps?
It would be nice if the apps gave everyone a score based on activity. How often do they login, send and reply to texts, do calls/video calls in the app and give out their phone number. Especially, how many calls and dates do they schedule and definitely how often do they flake out. Flakes are one of the worst parts of dating: Online and IRL! Obviously, the more active users (And least likely to flake) will get a higher score and you could be a VIP to pay to see their score. Just like Uber, if you can see someone’s active score &amp; be able to filter for it: I’m sure you will have a much better experience! My big problems are these:

Matches taking forever to reply to a text / Ghosting
1-2 word / short replies
Boring texts, For example: Hi, Hey, How are you? How was your day? What are you doing? How is/was your weekend?, What are your plans for this weekend? What are you looking for? What are your hobbies? And all these cookie cutter top 100 dating questions.
Not wanting to do phone / video call / date
Bad photos, Can’t see eyes/face clearly, too far away, too many people in pic, blurry, not smiling, boring look
Bad / short/ cookie cutter profile

Besides being able to filter or know someone’s activity / credibility score the only thing I can think of is being able to rate someone on a 5 star (with ½’s) rating system. If someone takes 3-4 days to reply, ghosts me, doesn’t want to do a video call/date or even is rude: I’d love to give them 0-2 stars before I unmatch them.
Also, auto unmatching would be nice. 2-3 days of not replying &amp; I’d love them to be auto-unmatched. (It could show on my profile and even notify them of being auto-unmatched…)
Lastly, I really want to salute Bumble for allowing voice  and video messages! I haven’t seen a lot of users add a video to their profile, but I really hope they do and allow you to select the option that you prefer if they do. If people like videos and push for it, I’m guessing more people will follow this trend and everyone, almost, will win! 
Lastly, let me promote voice and video messages in online dating. It’s all about saving time. I texted a match, we connected on Whatsapp and I sent a “cheeky” voice message before video chatting (Which I much prefer to calling). What was her reply? She was really taken aback and upset! Like stepping in shit! And what did I do? Apologize, feel bad...Nope, just blocked her on the app and Whatsapp: Double Block! And I didn’t have to waste time on a call/video chat. A 20 second voice message saved me a 20 minute video chat! Wonderful! Personally, I want someone with a sense of humor who doesn’t need 6 months to “get to know” me before I can be cheeky. I’m not knocking the walk-on-eggshells / best behavior approach to dating, but I’m 100% myself before, during and after 1st dates and if a woman doesn’t like it--&gt;Block or Double Block: Time saved!
If you have any comments, suggestions or dating experiences involving videos, video chat, calls or even voice messages--Please share!
Happy efficient dating!

I'm just not hungry. So many people love food, and center their lives around it. A great meal is always wonderful, and I try to be mindful that others need their three squares and a snack before they get ""hangry."" Sugar/sweets are also something I actively dislike.

Bringing this up in the dating process always feels odd. One relationship of mine fell apart partially because she hated eating alone all the time, and I was bothered she couldn't last more than three hours without a meal. 

Is this a dealbreaker? I feel neurotic, I just don't like eating when I'm not hungry, and everyone seems so food-driven.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,817299,public,self,Would you date a guy who doesn't eat a lot?

Sorry for long post 

There's this one person in my college classes [29F] who I [23M] would talk too occasionally and we had to work on some projects together. She seems like a great person and I enjoy talking to her in class but outside of that the only communication we would have would be about school via text. About a week and a half ago though she text and invited me to one of her friends birthday parties and then mentioned we should watch a playoff game together sometime. I couldn't make it to her friends party, but we set up a time to watch a game together. 

We met up and went to a brewery to watch a game then went back to her house to watch another and had dinner over there with her brother. It was a ton of fun but I honestly had no idea whether it was supposed to be a date or just hanging out because she initiated it. During the evening there were times when it felt like it could have been either and it left me confused. Since it was a lot of fun getting to know her, I asked her if she wanted to go hiking and we set a day for it. I love hiking and she mentioned she wanted to start going more so thought it would be a good idea. 

We ended up going hiking and everything went really well. Weather was perfect, trail was perfect, wildlife showed up which was amazing, and just in general had a really great time. However, at least for me, the vibe felt the same as the first time. Couldn't tell if she thought it was a date or a hangout and to be honest I wasn't sure either. It would seem to be going one way then go in the other direction. Ended up being like a 12 hour ordeal with driving included.

At the end of the day when I was dropping her off I decided to ask what she was looking for cause I was super confused and thought it would be better to just know and then go from there. I basically asked if she was looking for a relationship or something else (not specifically with me) because I wanted to have a clearer path forward. I think it would be cool to try and start a relationship with her cause she seems like a great person, but I would be totally okay with being friends as well. Well cause I'm an idiot and have minimal experience when it comes to these things, I worded it poorly and had to explain my question again and stumbled a bit while talking. She looked caught off guard and basically said she ended a big relationship a year ago and was not sure what she was looking for and then immediately got out of my car. We did day goodbye but that was it. Texted her when I got home saying it was fun and she responded back saying the same. Later in the night she text me sorry for being awkward when I asked that and said it was nice that I wasn't afraid to ask but she never answered my question. Saw her the next day at school and everything seemed as it was before. 

So onto my question, what in the world do I do now? I still have zero idea if she is just looking to be friends or if she is looking for a relationship. Do I just ask her on a date and see how she responds? I don't want to make it awkward again but I just don't know how to approach this. If she just wants to be friends that's great and I would be happy to have a new hiking buddy, but if she is looking for a relationship then of course I would do more then just invite her on hikes.

But I'm also looking for so many more important things in a guy, including personality traits and how he treats me. 

I was actually single for 5 years in my 20's because of self esteem issues and I had such a pessimistic attitude about finding someone that I didn't even want to put myself out there or try. 

I was physically attracted to my most recent ex but the personality traits and his treatment of me were lacking. After him I was seeing a few different guys over the past year but none of them were really ready to give me what I needed. 

It can get quite depressing going through the emotional fallout of these things ending and wondering if there even is someone out there that has all the things I'm looking for but I really want a partner and was pretty determined to do what I could to increase my chances. 

I came across a guy on an online dating app and found him very handsome and was intrigued by what he shared about himself. The thing was that he was shorter than any other guy I had dated (I think he's 5'7). But I decided to challenge the mental limitations I had and go on a date with him. 

We clicked well during the date and attraction was there. By the end of it I was surprised to find that his height barely bothered me. We took things pretty slow and built a connection gradually. Two months in, I'm extremely attracted to him (both physically and personality wise) and he can give me the emotional intimacy that was missing with the other guys I dated. 

I'm really grateful to have met him and just want to share the advice of challenging your mental limitations about dating.

I thought she didn't hear me so I repeated what I said, and she said ""yeah I heard you"" and then continued talking about her dress and her room.

I was with this guy for 4.5 yrs 3yrs of long distance, we were going to get married looking at rings and shit we had met each other parents and all...
Well all I asked was he moved to Canada with me and he kept saying yes then no then yes but never made an effort to move forward to which I gave him an ultimatum and ended up breaking off...

A few weeks after the break up my best friend called me and told me my ex was in jail (wtf right! Wait for it)
Apparently he was a con artist scamming girls for money.
One of those girls tried to commit sucide (luckily she didn't die) but she blamed him and she pressed rape charges too.
He was also officially engaged to another girl, his parents involved in this (his parents knew about me they met me ! So I am assuming they were involved in this).
I digged around and found out he was scamming 6girls at one point.


It's been almost more than 2 months to it and I am trying VERY HARD to say fuck it and move on and mind you I have managed to put out a happy brave face ...
But there are days and nights like tonight where I my brain is saying you are brave, you are strong and kind and you deserve better.... AND THEN there is this voice ""you were never loved and never will be"" and in this moment I feel like I can go to no one to just talk.
I feel like the world would be a better place without me (I won't harm myself that's not what I mean) but maybe I should stop getting attached to people in any form bcoz they all leave and I don't know why.

I was having lunch alone and she was staring at me so bad. Honestly she is super attractive and she was clearly interested. I asked her to come to order a coffee, and when she approached me, the sexual tension was unbearable. 

After I had finished, I called her again to get the check. She asked me how the coffee was and I said it was really good. I asked if the coffee came from Costa Rica, in Spanish (""Es de Costa Rica?""), and she said ""Yes, I'm from Costa Rica"". Then I told her that I was asking about the coffee and she seemed embarrassed.

I could have chilled out more than I did, looking back, but that fact would still be the case. During the breakup and whenever we've talked about it since, my ex has always said that it didn't have anything to do with me, that he could maybe see a serious relationship between us one day but that's just not what he wants right now. He admits it's literally the cliche ""it's not you, it's me"" and I believe that he genuinely believes that. But I also don't know if that can actually be the case. No matter how little I might want something serious right now myself, if he or another guy I thought was wonderful enough came along, nothing would hold me back, especially not me. I also have to acknowledge that not everyone thinks like I do though, and my ex definitely operates on an alien wavelength to my perspective when it comes to relationships.

I'm not invested I'm the outcome anymore, I'm all the way through the breakup grieving process, I'm just curious to hear others opinions. I like to have a clear path forward (thanks anxiety haha).

For a little more info, for the three months we were together, he was extremely torn between how little he wanted something serious and how amazing our time together was. He said on numerous occasions that he couldn't believe he had gotten this lucky, that I was ridiculously out of his league (untrue but such are insecurities) and we had the absolute best time together. We've both admitted we really miss each other and the breakup and everything since has been very amicable.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,817804,public,self,Does bad timing actually exist or are they just not that into you?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsuvjx/does_bad_timing_actually_exist_or_are_they_just/,all_ads,6,,,

My girlfriend has a good guy friend that I've meet 4/5 times at parties and out, we get on well and I can see us being guy friends, and he has invited me and my girlfriend out for drinks multiple times with him and his girlfriend. We both love spending time with them. 

My girlfriend works weekend evenings, as she works in a bar, but this weekend he messaged to see if we wanted to hang out with him and his gf. I told him that she was working and it would be great to arrange a time for all of us to spend time together, but he then asked if I'd like to come out for drinks anyways on my own with them.

I was excited to be invited out and to spend some time with new people, however when I mentioned this to my girlfriend she got very upset that I even contemplated hanging out with her friends. 

She said that she has said no many times when I haven't been able to make it and says that it should have been a clear ""no"" from me without any thought. 

I'm now very confused and not sure what I've done. 

I can see how she doesn't want me taking over with her friends and that she has sacrificed for me, but then again I don't have many friends in the city and my other option is spending Saturday night along while my girlfriend works.

Am I a bad person for considering a few drinks with her guy friend?

But i do am financially independent and although difficult sometimes, am living off my own since the last 5 years

So I(25M)have family friend of ours. They have 4 daughters and I used to be in a chatting only sort of relationship with the 2nd daughter(call her A) when i was 17. During this time, I found out that i had feelings for the 3rd one(call her B) and then wrapped up the whole thing with the A and confessed to B. I know this was the worst thing i could do, but as a teenager i didnt know what to do i was pretty much a brainless person during this time.
Well as you might think, the whole thing blew up but somehow we continued staying friends. We cleared the situation between us the youngsters and didn't tell anything to our families. 

Some months passed and she also confessed her feelings and we decided to not be in a relationship but just wait till we were old enough and we can marry. Well we held on to this and 3 years ago we wanted to finally to persue, but my father objected to it because of the other family's financial issues. He didn't want me to carry the burden and resolve their problems. During this time A sort of insulted me, when all youngsters were together and i sort of lost my shit. i think she did it deliberately to cause a drama and so that our families fell apart, well it all happened. I and B had almost no  contact, but i couldn't just stop thinking about her. I recently tried again to get my father's blessings but somehow he wasn't budging. Anyhow i ignored it and talked with B about how i am planning to unwind this mess and she said that she liked and still wanted to marry me. 

Now B is good friends with my younger brother and she told him that she didn't like me and how should she get rid of me. My Brother told me to stop going after her. I asked B about it and she straight denied it all and said she wanted to marry me, she doesn't know why my brother is trying to sabotage this. When i asked my brother he sent me the screenshots of the chat and it was all true what he told me. B again started to shove the blame on my brother and then on my aunt, straght away lying about the whole thing instead of apologising for the mess. I would have just let it go. But because of her lying, i realised that my relationship with my brother and my family would suffer in the future if this compulsive lying and blaming were just one part of her personality. I then told her i didn't want this and we haven't been in contact since then. She has been saying around that my brother wants to subotage this whole arrangement and he is the one to point fingers at and tbh he is also shocked at her behaviour just as i am. My mother who always wanted to see us together is now also against us being together because of this situation. 

The Problem: i seriously can't stop thinking about her as i have been in love with her since most of my adult life, never dated anyone else. I don't know if i will be attracted to anyone else the way i am to her( haven't been in the last 7 years). I somehow picture her as my dream woman. It has been 2 weeks since all this happened and i still am constantly dreaming about her and waking up in the nights because of them.

Advice needed: Am i the one who is wrong here by throwing away our chances of being together just because of this lying and should i just forget everything?

So, I’ve been in a relationship with this guy for a year and a half. We’re gay – I’m 33 and he’s 41. The relationship has been a bit rocky and he’s broken up with me twice, stating that it wasn’t what he imagined a relationship to be like. As a side note, this is his first relationship (his sister is 44 and has never had a relationship). He came out about 6 years ago, to the horror of his father, who I have recently met, but refuses to acknowledge our relationship. His parents’ marriage is also really unhappy (his dad will simply go to bed for days on end sulking and punish his mother psychologically). Another note, his mom does all his cooking and laundry, and his father comes to the flat without warning to check if everything’s ok, which I really hate. I was in my apartment the other week and his father just walked in and barely said a word to me. My boyfriend was annoyed but didn’t really bring it up with his father. His mother won’t dare argue with his father either. Anyway, we’ve been talking about going to the UK, where I’m from. He was semi on board with the idea and did an interview, and was offered a position, which he’d be beginning in October. Basically, today, we was really sulky and I asked what is wrong and he just said nothing, I need to tidy my apartment and need some time to myself. Then he said, I’m just not the kind of person who can leave my home town. No further explanation. That was this morning and I’m still waiting for him to call. Another thing possibly of interest is that he’s on antidepressants and has a tendency to be pretty negative, like both his parents (he’ll often say, I’m horrible, please leave me, you deserve so much better, I just want a solitary life with no change). He also keeps telling me I need more muscle for him to be attracted to me. He is very kind and thoughtful though, which is why I’m still with him. I was also looking to building a life together in the UK. Anyway, I now have no idea what to do. I don’t know if he’s going to leave me. Any advice would be much appreciated. I basically feel like he could leave me at any time.

I’m sure you can see the bumps in the relationship in my posting history.

I am not used to people being very friendly so it can be confusing, also I haven’t socialized properly in a long time before moving.

There’s this guy but I cannot tell 100%. if he is attracted to me or not. He is Japanese and speaks some English but he tends to be nice. He actually more outspoken with other people and he is shyer with me, not sure if it is because I speak more and he has said he is not confident about his english.

When we met he asked me for my name and offered some food at the school party while he was serving tables (language school, he had a party with food), when we met after a while I got near him and another girl, they let me choose a song etc

We had a long convo about a cultural thing and Japan and he seemed attentive, smiled and he was mirroring my body language too, eye contact etc

After that he walked me outside and asked me for my Ig and number, then he said bye. The conversation lasted a lot and we talked 2 hours or so, we were some of the few people who didn't go to bed lol it was 1 am

All students from language school went to a bar last Tuesday and he ran after me and stopped me to say, asked me if I was going scuba diving etc

I said maybe but today I realized I couldn’t go (period came randomly lol) so I told him but he loves swimming so he decided to go anyway before he told me.

The same night he invited me to go to the beach and there was also another guy he met there. He asked me about what tv shows I liked and I said South Park so he googled it and checked it out.

We had a barbecue at the school and initially, he only said hi etc, he talked with other people then he sat close to me and we talked and seemed cool. He made me choose a song and asked me about my music taste. He also patted me on the shoulder randomly but idk what it means, it can't be anything

I noticed sometimes he is hesitant and I asked him if he wanted to sit outside and he said no because it was cold (lol wut) then he saw me getting a cup of ice cream and he picked the spoon for me because I forgot, told me about he saw when he visited Italy (I am Italian but I am living abroad atm).

I stood very close and felt the urge to put my arm around him but I didn’t because I didn’t want to seem weird, then he went to talk with other people.

I see sometimes he stands around me and generally he is friendly but I have seen that he is less shy when he speaks Japanese and more confident but quieter when speaking in English.

I remember the first time we met he asked me if I did sport because I am fit and when the topic of relationships came up he said he is single etc and asked me If I have ever been in love. The topic came up because we overheard it while two people were talking about Japanese culture, I was quite surprised when he said people have to be in an official relationship to kiss, etc

He mentioned he had a girlfriend in the past but I misunderstood and he cleared it up by saying he did but now he doesn't have one, I said I never had a boyfriend too. He asked me if I have been in love and we talked a bit about the topic.

Some things make me think he likes me in general but some are confusing lol

Also recently I was supposed to go for dinner with one girl and her other 3 guys joined and I sat at the same table as him. He talked a lot and I pushed him on the arm and he did it back, he liked my earrings and touched my backpack before asking if the brand was popular in Italy.

Yesterday I noticed he saw around me without speaking or saying much but he smiled at me often. Sometimes if I looked at him he looked away quickly, I couldn't tell if he was looking at me or another girl. He is nice to everyone but idk, I even suspected he liked her instead because everytime I looked at him he looked away or behind me where the girl was. This happened a few times.

He is helpful and sends me random messages to tell me random stuff like do you know that supermarket, he also told me he goes to the gym at the residence where I am now

Yesterday we were at a party but I was not feeling it because I was tired and I was busy all week. I gave him some glances, sometimes he smiled or sometimes he looked away or we talked a little.

I said bye and left early but when I got outside he followed me and asked me why. I jokingly asked if he missed me and he said yeah and smiled so I told him to come to visit me here where I am.

He is friendly in general but he is often awkward when he stands there, he is around me but doesn't speak up (not always, we kinda talked and he is always nice).

IDK sometimes I am paranoid I am reading too much into it but he texts me first and I am not sure with the body language.

I am kinda getting a vibe but I am not sure, there's another turkish guy who is direct compared lol Like he asks me to meet and flirts, he even kissed but he is too old for me and he said it is nothing serious.

I noticed there are a few sub Reddit’s a day asking how to get over someone. So I wish this will help anyone who  still have that person in their head or heart and can’t get rid of them. 

First identify a true reason why you broke up with them or why break up happened. I found it is easier to get over a person when you believe that they wrong you. Be cheating, emotional abuse or toxic inducing behaviors as long as you believe in your heart that this person wrong you it will be easier to switch from love to hate and from there it is an easy transmission to “forgetting” (or if you’re a saint for giving )stage. 

Its gets A little more difficult when partner says straight to your face that they simply no longer love you or don’t want to be with you. It happens, but I believe mind and heart can still be tricked and redirected towards hate emotion rather than love. Because you can find 1 million reasons why this person suddenly decide to change his or her mind. And once you start to heat as described above the “forgetting” stage is nearby.

I recently met this girl and things have been going pretty well. Whenever we hang out, we usually spend hours together just talking or watching netflix until the early morning, we also do things like shopping together and we just got back from a lovely trip to the beach. 

I'm just kind of confused about how she feels about me. I wish I knew, because then I'd know for sure if I should make a move or keep things the way they are. Some people say that it seems like she likes me, others say that she only views me as a friend. 

One thing she does is talk about me with her friends. She tells her friends and coworkers about what we do together and she seems to speak very highly of me. I know this because she told me and I overheard her talking to one of her friends about me, saying that I was a good guy and she has fun with me. 

She also compliments me on my clothes, my eyes, and other features. She has said that I have a cute face. She also touches me pretty often, like a touch on the arm during conversation, or she'll invite me to sit next to her on the couch and scoot close to me so that we're touching. Sometimes she'll come up to me and hug me for a few minutes. I also noticed that if we're walking together she'll kind of brush her arm against me lightly. She likes taking selfies with me, with her arm wrapped around me. 

The reason I'm confused is because when I first met her, she expressed to me that she didn't want to date anyone right now.
