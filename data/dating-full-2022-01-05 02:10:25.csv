Let me begin by saying I am quite overweight (in the process of losing it all though ) but I am hygienic and I don't have any problems socializing other than some anxiety that's been getting better with age. She, however, is extremely extroverted and very attractive. In my opinion, out of my league.

But, here's the thing. She goes out of her way to text me on her own Accord. Sometimes just to encourage me. Every response I give receives the heart reaction on Facebook messenger. She keeps the conversations going with questions about me, and never seems to be averse to speaking with me in person. She gives me the ""side hug"" whenever we talk in person.

I've only actually started talking and texting with her a couple weeks ago but she seems to genuinely like me as a person and I just want to ask here if it seems like she may be interested in me? I have never been in a relationship. I have never been on a date. I've been working on myself for years because I am far behind most people my age due to mental health issues.

I'm quite lost and just looking for general advice, and I hope this sub is a good place to ask around since I wasnt technically dating this person. I've (M) meet this person (F) through online games sometime ago and we become friends pretty quickly. We shared our socials, discussed interests and struggles, had video calls, bought co-op games just to play together and lots more all within a relatively short span of time. One relevant note is we've never met in person because we're an entire continent apart. Overall I personally vibe and enjoyed every moment with her. Throughout this period we were both still single. 

Of course, I couldn't help but fall for her after a while and was planning to confess down the line. I didn't confess earlier because I was just anxious that I might ruin a great friendship and just wanted to take it easy to not potentially make her too uncomfortable (she had a rough history with guys in the past). On New Years night while texting her, she casually mentioned she's playing a game with her boyfriend. It took me a while to take that in but it overall crushed me.

The next couple of days was just a rather difficult time to keep my thoughts in check and having trouble sleeping. I haven't texted, talked or played with her since that night. Like some others, I play video games to distract myself, but I cant even pick up a game without thinking about the situation. Eventually we talked, I confessed everything, and she was apologetic about the situation. I responded by saying it's not her fault and its probably mine for being too attached in the first place. Apparently they only started dating no more than a week prior to New Years Day. Pretty much awful timing.

We played our usual games that night without issue for a couple hours before heading off, but I havent spoken to her since then, as she's hanging out with her boyfriend more often now. Currently I'm left alone to my own thoughts, and its soul crushing. This is not the first time this has happened to me, and I've handled previous ones alot better, but theres something about this situation that makes it a lot more painful that what I had faced.

I often keep stuff like this to myself, but I'm totally lost on what's the best approach to something like this. I know I have to set boundaries, but on one hand I'm glad she's found someone that she's happy with, but at the same time I feel helpless or just missed my chance.

   Just a pretty ‚Äúintroverted‚Äù person, even though I can put an extrovert face on temporarily if need be.

I‚Äôm okay with not doing much when we meet like I‚Äôm not expecting a dinner or anything. That‚Äôs way too personal for a first date but a coffee or a walk outside the house seems like a good start. I suggested eating out together to test the waters before I wrote them off too quickly. 

They clarified no they mean they‚Äôll order food for us in their room hahahahaha üòÇ okay now hear me out. I‚Äôm a little more invested than I realised. Can I or should I ignored the red flags?

My last rodeo with the online thing it seemed most of the women just wanted a texting buddy or someone to give them attention via their smartphone. 

I landed dates with three different women out of over a hundred messages, and one of them lasted a month before it went sour. The biggest problem I had was ladies trying to dig out your life story before the meet even happened. Those two dates were extremely short and awkward, I get meeting some random person online can be risky. That said it seemed like a downfall going that route, lack of conversation finally in person and just looking for a free meal once they assumed I was safe.

She was pretty cute, so I turned around and struck up a convo with her. It went really well, we ditched her friends and went off together, made out for a bit, went to a few more bars and then I dropped her back with her friends and went home.

I organized to meet her two weeks later. It was the first proper, for real date that I had ever been on. I booked us a table at a nice cocktail place, put on some nice clothes and cologne. It went really well for a first date. The conversation was a tiny bit shaky at first but after a while it was flowing smoothly. 

At 10pm, when the venue closed, I was about to announce that I was going home (out of respect) when she asked 'what are we doing now'? I was surprised by this but it showed that she was interested so I ran with it. We hopped to another bar and ended up back at my place. We had sex, which was both of our first time. It was pretty awkward but my friends assured me that that's normal so it was ok.

The second date however. I met her at a very loud bar at 7pm. It was 38 degrees. I had been on an interstate work trip that day that I'd had to wake up at 4am for. She was on her period. It was a minor shambles. The convo was not really flowing, there were large gaps of awkward silence.

Towards the end of the date, I asked her if she was looking for a relationship, she said not really but we will see where it goes. I asked her if she minded me seeing other girls and she said that was ok. She said she wasn't seeing other guys and judging by the fact that she was a virgin when we met and her general character I believe her.

I want to ask her out again, but her saying that it was ok for me to see other girls to me is a big red flag that she's not that into me. A girl that's attached to a guy would surely be offended at the notion that he wants to hook up with other guys? I don't know. I really want this to work with her but she's not showing all the signs of attachment that my friend's girlfriends have shown. She never initiates anything with me, she seems uninterested in dating as a whole. I want to walk away to save myself from getting emotionally damaged by this.

Sorry and ty

So it‚Äôs been around 1 year since I (25F) have been dating my bf (27M). We initially used to live pretty far away from each other, around 2 hours but he would visit every weekend and certain days on the weekdays which helped mitigate the distance. 

The distance wasn‚Äôt too terrible but there will be moments where it was slightly inconvenient. One day, however, after much thought, he decided to change his career from good job w/benefits to a music career. He felt that it was a good time in his age and place in life, and wanted to give it a try before it was too late. I was surprised but respect and wanted to help support his decision. 

He used to live with his parents (saving money for house) but because of job opportunities in nyc, asked to move in with me, which i agreed. At first, it was great and we were happy. But now that it‚Äôs been almost 3 months, I‚Äôm starting to feel a frustrated. Luckily I am in a good place in my career where I do not have to worry about finances or debt. Initially, prior to him moving in, we first discussed how we would split up rent and other forms of expenses such as bills, and groceries. He was very adamant about being equal and splitting everything 50/50 even though I tried to lower his portion of the ‚Äúrent‚Äù and bills especially since my rent is on the higher side (4k).

However, when he moved in, he didn‚Äôt pay any portion of his rent. Because I knew he was already having some financial concerns, and was struggling due to the new covid spikes and was getting much less gigs than he thought, I didn‚Äôt say anything about the rent. However after more than one month of him moving in, I slowly brought up the rent, and he stated that he will pay, and that he just has to go to the bank and get the cash. It felt like an odd statement/excuse? and I can tell he was a bit quiet about this topic so I just told him to not worry about the rent. He tried to put up an argument but gave up pretty quickly and complied stating that he would at least get all the groceries and I was fine with that. 

Now that it‚Äôs been more than 3 months, I feel frustrated because it also feels like I do everything in the apartment. I am able to work from home, and have a good work/life balance, but it frustrates me when all he does is play games or watch shows when he is free which is unfortunately most of the time. We have gotten into a couple of arguments where I would ask him to help around the house, and he has gotten better, but it is still not enough especially when considering he has much more free time than I do. I feel like the only time i can rely on him to do chores, if i actively request him to do a certain task everytime. I am almost at the last straw where I want to ask him to move out. 

I do love and care for this person, but I am worried that once I bring the topic of him moving out, he would take it very negatively and it would bring a dent in our relationship. Whenever I asked him as to why he was spending time playing games, he would tell me that he just needed some time to himself because he feels stressed esp due to finances. 

I have also recently brought up the topic of finances since I feel that it is unfair to myself that I pay mostly for everything even though we  live together. He took this very offensively and asked me if I thought that poorly of him where i thought ""he was mooching off of me"". Idk if it was the way how I phrased the topic, but I stated how I was worried since he doesn‚Äôt do much to help support things even tho he has been living here for more than 3 months. He stated very strongly that he will pay more than half of everything and do ALL the chores since he‚Äôs been living there for a longer period, but because it became a huge argument and I dislike arguments, I gave up and just told him to forget it. 

I‚Äôm lost and hurt in what to do and just would like some advice. It's okay if he lives here AND helps support but now with the current state, I can't help but feel that he is starting to be a freeloader and maybe needs a wake up call after being kicked out.

I (M20) met this girl (M18) at work in October (we‚Äôre coworkers) and I asked her out in December on a date and she accepted.

We had a really good first date, we talked at Starbucks for over 3 hours and said personal things about our lives to each other even though we‚Äôre both introverts. She told me that she doesn‚Äôt know how she feels about me but says she is interested in me.

She also said that she sees potential in us and that we could have a really good relationship.

She told me she wants to take things slow because she‚Äôs been heartbroken before and she wants to do this right with me and I told her that I am fine with going slow and for to take the time she needs. She also said she wants to see where my priorities lie because she is now part of my life

We used to text every single day and call almost every day but now today she says she doesn‚Äôt want us to talk for a few days so we can have more to say to each other when we do text. I was confused because I thought it would be normal to talk or even text to the person your interested in everyday just so you can chat with them. 

I‚Äôm just confused because the day before she asked me on a second date so why now today she wants for us not to talk for a few days? The next time I see her at work is Saturday so I‚Äôm just not gonna text her and see what happens on Saturday. 

I‚Äôm also concerned how long she wants to take it slow because she might be going to college in the fall which would be 25 mins away from me so I don‚Äôt know what her intentions are I guess.

So I have two questions for people:

1. For dating, would you make a distinction between somebody using cannabis and magic mushrooms therapeutically and somebody using them recreationally?
2. When is the right time to tell someone your dating if you use ""drugs,"" such as cannabis and magic mushrooms purely for medicinal purposes?

I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, which I've had for virtually my whole life, and I use both edible cannabis (I don't smoke or vape) and non-tripping doses of magic mushrooms as as-needed medications. I don't drink alcohol. I'm not a daily user. And I have taken multiple, months-long breaks entirely sober. I didn't drink or do ANY DRUGS (yes, even coffee) until I was 25 (I did drink green tea, if you must know), and I only turned to cannabis and magic mushrooms reluctantly as a last resort after I had bad experiences with antidepressants and xanax.

Cannabis is legal where I live and magic mushrooms are decriminalized. I have a medical marijuana card. When I go on vacation out-of-state, I don't drink or do any drugs. I've only had sex sober.

I don't identify as a stoner and, personally, do not feel comfortable being lumped in with people for whom drug use is more of a personality trait. One of the things that frustrates me about the conversation around cannabis legalization/acceptance is it seems to treat medical users, like myself, as kind of a joke. 

I only got high for the first time after I had severe insomnia and basically constant fight or flight for 2 months after a ski accident where I almost died (I went off trail by mistake, got only lightly injured, but almost went into a deep ravine). A single legal edible cured my insomnia. 

I was on antidepressants for 1.5 years and they caused me to gain a lot of weight, feel zombified, and I had to take them EVERY DAY. I was prescribed Xanax for acute anxiety but found I was totally nonresponsive to it. There was a time on the antidepressants where my mental health spiraled downwards, and I wanted to quit immediately, but I didn't because I couldn't quit them cold turkey without triggering withdrawal symptoms and I feared I might get worse without them.

In contrast, I can immediately stop using cannabis and magic mushrooms at any time if I feel off or want to take a break, etc.

I generally don't disclose my drug use up front when dating because I think it will give people the wrong impression. I DO tell people I don't drink, which is more reflective of my personality as someone who didn't use substances for the first 25 years of their life.

There are a lot of people who abuse marijuana and magic mushrooms. But that doesn't change the fact that both substances are invaluable MEDICINAL substances for tons of people. Please keep this in mind when forming opinions about both potential romantic partners AND drug policy in the USA.

If you want to ban all recreational use of marijuana and magic mushrooms, go for it.

A few weeks pass of her staring, I text again asking if she does actually want to talk to me as I can't go over to her in class anymore, and I have no other options. No response again, but she is staring excessively and fixing her hair every class now. I talk to one of her friends, find out she can't text back because of strict parents. I was confused as hell and nervous so I didn't approach her and avoided directly staring at her so she wasn't uncomfortable, she's kinda shy so she doesn't come talk to me anymore, but stares pretty much any chance she can get. 

Unfortunately, my schedule changed so I don't have any classes with her anymore. I know she read the text, her friend said so, so I have two options. In my effort to fuck this up, I idiotically waited weeks to do anything, its been 5 weeks of school since I last texted her, but she's been staring that whole time, even after adding on a 1 week break, so I don't think she was disinterested yet. But now that we don't share a class, that interest could go away very quickly, so I want to do something as soon as possible.

1. I can text her again tomorrow gently telling her I noticed her staring, and if she was staring because she did want to talk to me, that i'll be in the library after school if she wants to say hi, then tell her I like her if she comes. I know she will get the text, and I plan to do it during school so her parents shouldn't interfere. 
2. I can wait until Thursday, because we end up in the same part of school and I have a chance to talk to her in the hallway, and then tell her I like her.

Number 1 is me texting again, which I don't like as its not in person and clearly not a good method of communication currently, but it gives her space and is as soon as possible. Number 2 is in person, but not guaranteed i'll see her, and I have to wait longer. After messing this up as badly as I could, I'm scared of waiting, I don't want regrets, so idk which one to do.

&amp;#x200B;

non tldr 

In the two classes I had with her, she was staring at me a little bit before I talked to her, she would glance over more than usual, and I know she was looking at me because she would often glance over when I was alone, and nothing was related to the class by me. I already liked her, and I did approach her in one of the classes, then started talking to her pretty frequently, and it went well, like she told me to stay at her table the first day and would bring up details about me like my when a sub said my last name wrong, even when I wasn't near her, she would approach me before class, and she started staring more in the other class. So I asked for her number. I gave her my number and I texted her that weekend, but she didn't respond.

So, I thought she wasn't interested and I misread things, and left her alone for a little bit. But then, she was staring even more. Unfortunately I couldn't go over to her table anymore due to class policy change, but I decided to text her again a few weeks later as I didn't have a good time to talk to her, and I gently asked if she didn't respond because she didn't want me to talk to her. The day after, she looked at me pretty much every time she turned her head, and ever since then, she's been staring pretty much any time she could. Even if I was to her side, away from the class, or behind her, she would repeatedly look at me, often over her shoulder. She also was fixing her hair pretty frequently, at least once every class. Two weeks later I talked to one of her friends about the texting, and I found out she can't text me because of strict parents, which kinda sucks. 

She is a rather shy person, she speaks pretty quiet when she has to present anything in class and things like that. Since I thought she didn't want to talk to me, I made a serious effort to not stare directly at her after I texted, I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. Because she is kinda shy, her parents, and I wasn't looking over at her anymore, I think she thought I was less interested, and thats why she hasn't approached me and has just been staring.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1148441,public,self,"I'm going to tell a girl that I like her, pretty sure she did like me but I need advice",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwg3r8/im_going_to_tell_a_girl_that_i_like_her_pretty/,no_ads,0,,,,

So I am on online dating. I am 25(M) and she is 23 (F). We really hit it off on online dating. She had that she was a huge Austin Powers and Who fan.

I messaged "" Do I make you Timely Wimely Baby do I? "" Smoothest I have ever been. Well we have been 3 dates in everything was going fantastic. She is smart , she is pretty and in school to be a nurse.

When we talked about our jobs. I told her about being a Case Manager and she told me that she was a model. Which, this girl is so far out of my league. We connect, I had quite a few friends who were Abercombie models and other things. I was an amateur photographer. She said that she only does small ads and such.

Well the fourth date rolls around and honestly, I am thinking about making her my gf. We get to the place and one of the waitress goes "" are you username, I have been your sub for 3 years"". I asked "" what does he mean?""  I was thinking Twitch? 

She came clean about her cam girl job. 

She said that she lied about it, because she didn't want me to freak out and she liked me.

I was crushed. I told her, I really need to think about this. She has been texting me.

I am big in my church, I mentor kids and have been doing it 7 years now. It is my reason for being.

But I really, really ,really like this girl.

My parents would lose their minds, I am not happy about her job and my church will not allow me to work with kids and date her.

I don't know what to do.

The first time we met at the bar his friends invited me and my friend to their afterparty where he caught my eye but we did not talk. A few months later we bumped into each other at the bar again where he shouted me a drink but there was not much flirting. I thought he might've been interested because his friends shouted my whole group drinks whereas he had pulled me aside to buy me one BUT usually guys will start asking me a lot of questions whereas he was kind of quiet. I recall being cold and he did offer me his sweater.  

Fast forward we exchanged socials (Instagram) and he would usually reply to my stories when I posted scenic photos, art galleries, memes and he would kind of continue the conversation into ""how's your day"" but that's usually it because I'm not too good at dragging these convos for days. Most of the guys who are interested in me would often reply to posts of me with compliments, but again, these are usually the guys that are more interested in getting into my pants. 

We also have each other on facebook and snapchat but there isn't as much interaction. We snapchat everyday but the content is nothing significant. Last week I posted a scenic photo of a lookout on my Instagram which he popped up to and I jokingly told him to 'take me' (it was 1.5 hours from his house) to which he responded with an actual date to go. Since I technically initiated it I wouldn't say it was a date? 

During the drive there we spoke here and there and he was actually very quiet still as opposed to his spontaneous-looking Instagram photos, he was actually quite reserved in real life. Our conversation was quite average with occasional silences which for me was very awkward but he seemed comfortable in them. When we got there I wanted to go onto a cliff which he was very displeased about because he was scared but did it anyway since I wanted to. It was a bit of a rocky path and he would turn back and hold my hand where I needed help or hold trees away from my face so I could walk comfortably. There was a very steep bit where he offered to piggyback me to save me from jumping. That was pretty much it in terms of how far things got. 

I've been confused whether he is interested in me or just wants to be my friend due to the lack of initiative and to be fair we actually barely know each other (yes, kind of dumb that I went on a 3 hour round trip to a place with no signal with a technically stranger). He did seem like a very and cautious person but if you're interested you would usually come on strong (from my experience at least).  Most of his actions could also fall into a 'nice person' category which is why it's putting me off in terms of pulling a move because I am kind of interested.

We got really close in the group we met. To the point the group actually think we are dating. The guys and girls ask all the time, to me anyway, what are we, and I just have to say friends, because I have no idea wtf is actually happening. I originally started talking to her to see if I could date her. I asked advice and stuff from a couple of people in the group. A guy and a girl, and both of them said go for it, but when I have, I get back nothing.

Her (23F) and myself (22M) have become very close since meeting, and we talk everyday. We even got to the point where both of us try to spend time with each other as much as we can. We went on a little holiday away with one of my mates. Shes clingey when shes with me, and only me - like when we arent in a group setting. When we were on the holiday, she couldn't sleep in her own room, and came in and we talked and slept next to each other. She also openly was clingey with my mate around, idk if it was because she knew he was a good bloke, andone of my best mates. Also not connected to her really in anyway, so she knew she wouldnt be embarrased or something. We've spent time together overnight before as well, going on drives, watching netflix, and sleeping - next to each other, not with eachother. Basically the best way I can describe our relationship is platonic. We cuddle, sleep, hug, hold hands occasionally. We do other couple stuff like go get food together, go out to places, travel, watch stuff together, and we are influcing eachothers likes, espcially with tv/movies, with both of us becoming interested in stuff the other is. We also got presents for eachother for christmas, but thats a minor detail I'd say.

She says we are just friends, but she shares personal stuff with me, and she doesnt like sharing info about herself to anyone. I've been told off because I told someone a very tiny detail about her. And when shes done something a bit too coupley in public/infront of the group, she tries to make sure no one is watching or listening. Once, she was caught giving me a kiss on my forehead. She said it was a joke, but idk. It had followed a night out in the city celebrating one of our mates bdays. We got back to the airbnb at like 4.30am. I had had quite a lot to drink, but was starting to sober up at this point, because i stopped drinking after throwing up about 1am. She didnt like that she was caught doing that by one of the people in the group, and when questioned from what I heard told the person basically to mind thier own business. Which to me, makes it sound even more like we are dating but hey.

I tried to keep her as my only option, just by not actively seeking other females to date out. But I have started getting impatient, so I've scheduled a date with another girl this friday, because I'm just sick of being there and basically being her bf, but without any of the actual benefits or title. I get some girls and guys do that, but she doesnt seem like that kinda girl. She wasn't really happy when she noticed I was going on a date with this other girl, but didnt make an effort to be like ok, you mine or anything. Btw, not going on a date with this other girl to make her jealous, its a benefit, but the main purpose is actually to just date people and see where it goes.

Just really want an outsiders opinion about her for me. And if i should stick around, and just keep my options open or what.

Normally I‚Äôm okay with it, because I‚Äôm a lesbian and in my experience lesbians tend to be able to have an actual friendship only relationship after dating. Or so I thought anyways‚Ä¶ 

But I was burned so so bad in my last relationship. Im over that girl but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be over the hurt and betrayal she left behind. Especially when I was so understanding and lenient.   

So now knowing my new girlfriend of 6ish months is talking to one of her ex‚Äôs, (which she‚Äôs been super honest about btw) I can‚Äôt help these feelings from crossing my mind. On one hand I want to just trust my partner who has given me no reason not to trust her. But on the other hand I‚Äôm telling myself ‚Äútrust your gut, you‚Äôve been burned in the past‚Äù 

I know the mature thing would be to talk to her about it. But what else is there to talk about lol she‚Äôs talking to an ex who i guess is a friend and she brought it up to me. She did everything right. I feel like if I say anything about it it would just come across jealous/controlling. I don‚Äôt want to say anything about it. I have been checking this ex‚Äôs Facebook to see if my girlfriend has been liking her shit üòÇ I hate being this insecure, non trusting person. It‚Äôs not who I am usually.

So I guess I‚Äôm stuck between letting this play out, and hoping I don‚Äôt get burned.. which has done nothing for me in the past.

When I'm not attached to someone, I don't put much effort to maintain a friendship or continue getting to know them. Like I won't call/text and don't care if they call or not, because they don't have much impact on my life like someone I talk to every day and then we go two days without talking and feel something is missing. 

Couple of months ago I started talking to a girl on twitter dms (in my city) every other day where I initiated most of the conversations, getting to know them was interesting but as soon as I learned a deal breaker I stopped initiating conversation, the idea of meeting her is gone and I just reply.  This also showed who was putting effort to get to know the other since she stopped talking (even though she was engaging well in the conversations). Maybe she saw me as just twitter friend while I had hoped to be something else irl. Here I'm free from attachment because I no longer care if we stay in touch.

Now I started talking to a new girl and repeating the cycle where she gets my full attention to get to know her since we are clicking well and so far no deal breakers.

I never had very many friends and was picked on a lot as a kid, so when people ignore me or are mean to me, I take it very personally because feel like I need people to like being around me and care about me because of my trauma (although that term feels like too grandiose IMO). 

This has really worn down my self-esteem.

Because of this, I can kind of empathise with Incels. Not that I agree with their bigoted misogynistic misanthropy or anything, but I can at least understand how depression and frustration from being rejected and the ""I'm going to be alone forever""-feeling of existential loneliness can wear someone down over time, as I myself have even felt frustrated at my lack of a love life (although it stems from my own feelings of ineptitude, rather than the completely erroneous belief that all women are evil or whatever).

What do you think about the time in between messaging and has your opinion changed in the last few years? Mine has. 

*my story* I found that my opinion on this changes as I‚Äôm maturing, and as my responsibilities become more time-consuming. Also my intentions, lifestyle, and amount of ongoing personal conversations I have affect how much thought or time I put into messaging a crush. A few years ago, I would say things like, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs taking forever to reply. He must not like me,‚Äù with it being a few hours since we messaged to now saying, ‚Äúhe texts me every night. He must like me.‚Äù I‚Äôve been talking with someone for a few months now. When I reply, I usually would wait until I have a moment to put thought into a message if it‚Äôs not urgent. We‚Äôre getting to know each other over long messages once or twice daily. We started going on weekly dates last month and the emotional chemistry is electric. (I‚Äôm demisexual so it feels similar to lust but with someone‚Äôs personality instead of looks only after trust and bond has been built over time). I send him quick messages sometimes saying I read his text, something simple about it, and I‚Äôll work on my reply later. I sometimes skim the message to check the urgency, then save it for later to fully read it and respond in depth. I was at first worried my ‚Äúread 3 hours ago‚Äù notice on our thread would alarm him. He started to mirror my communication style and is doing the same. the chemistry is growing for me and he‚Äôs been more open about his feelings for me. 

With another guy that I lost interest for, he would message me back 1 liners almost instantly and would never go in depth. Always like ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôm going‚Äù to keep the conversation alive. It felt like a chore to me. Although, when we were in person it was so fun to talk.
