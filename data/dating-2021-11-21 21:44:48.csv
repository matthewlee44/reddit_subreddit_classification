1,qzci61,1637553730,Have you ever been addicted to a relationship with no future?,"So I’m about to come up to 1 year of an on and off relationship with a guy I love very, very deeply. 

He is my absolute ride or die, just gets me on a level almost no one has, always supports me, helped me prepare for really hectic job interviews for his company and therefore assisted me to get the job of my dreams, is the best sex I’ve ever had and is just the most fun I’ve ever had. Even watching tv with him is wonderful. I’m at peace when I’m with him and love every minute. 

We know each other better than anyone else and know each other’s deepest, darkest secrets.

However early on, we discovered that we both sit on opposing fence of family planning and neither of us will ever be willing to budge.

Since finding this out 1 month in, we tried going our separate ways and ended up getting in more deep by hanging out with each other’s friends and being sure that we could just entertain this as a casual thing.

2 months on he broke up with me since there was just no point in being together. Except the break up didn’t really stick and we wound up dating again.

From then on it became a series of breaking up and slowly getting back together. We tried everything. Not talking, blocking, trying to be casual, unfollowing each other everywhere, but nothing has worked. Anytime there is emotional turmoil or the like, one of us breaks the staying apart pact and the cycle starts over.

Our friends don’t even know that we are hanging out anymore, as there’s just no point in frustrating them with our endless cycle, so we see each other in secret.

Each break up has produced such bad anxiety that I can’t breathe and can’t function, producing this insane up down rollercoaster and this absolutely irrational relationship restart and addiction to him. I’ve never felt bereft without another person before, but it’s like I’m on top of the world when I’m with him and crash down to earth when it’s over.

This past weekend we talked about it and he asked what I wanted to do. I said I genuinely didn’t know as we’ve tried everything and just can’t seem to stay away from each other. He said, “I know. my head says this isn’t right. But my heart says something else”.

I just have no idea what to do anymore and was hoping someone else has experienced similar. I’m genuinely entertaining moving overseas with my company just to put a line in the sand (also because of the career opportunity of course) and he may be moving to England, as it seems like there is no other option here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzci61/have_you_ever_been_addicted_to_a_relationship/
2,qzcik0,1637553763,"I finally had my first kiss, and my head is still spinning","I (25F) have struggled with extremely low self-esteem for most of my life. I used to think I was hideous and disgusting. I couldn’t even fathom the idea of someone finding me attractive. As I’m sure you can imagine, I was also terrified of rejection, so never put myself out there. But at the start of 2021 I decided I was sick of feeling this way and put in a lot of work to change my mindset. Now I’m in a far better place. I even went on my first date a month ago, and even though he rejected me, I was actually okay afterwards!

Anyway, to get to the point, I had my first kiss/somewhat sexual experience last night, and my head is still spinning thinking about it. I went clubbing with my best friend, and I knew I looked really damn good. We went outside to the smoking area (we don’t smoke but we just wanted to take a breather) and I noticed that the guy standing next to us was extremely attractive and pretty much the definition of my type. I made eye contact with him briefly and glanced away when he saw. But he then started talking to us. He said I was gorgeous, and asked me if I was single, but because I assume that no one is ever attracted to me, I didn’t think anything of it. But then my friend went to the restroom and he asked me to stand closer to him. He put his arm around me and next thing I knew we were making out. 

We then went back inside to dance and started kissing again. His hands were roaming all over me: my cheek, my waist, my thigh, and then he grabbed and squeezed my ass. And I fucking loved it. I was feeling things I had never felt before and I literally felt dizzy. He whispered in my ear “you’re sexy as fuck” and “I want to fuck you so bad”. Given that I’m a virgin with zero experience I obviously wasn’t going to have sex with him that night, but man, there aren’t even words for how turned on I was. Someone saying “I want to fuck you” to me has been one of my fantasises for years. He asked me to go home with him, which I politely declined, and he respected my wishes without seeming annoyed or entitled. My friend and I had to leave not long after but before we did he said “can I kiss you again?”, and just the fact that he asked was so hot. The kiss was even more intense that time: we practically had our tongues down each other’s throats. When I got home, I could barely sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about him.

Today he texted me saying he had a great night and that I’m a “great kisser”, which I’m shocked by considering I had no clue what I was doing 😂. We’ve now arranged to go for drinks on Friday, and he says he’s going to show me a “good night”. I can’t wait. 

Yes, I know that it’s extremely unlikely that anything will ever happen between us romantically, but this was just such a pleasurable, hot, milestone moment for me that I wanted to share :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzcik0/i_finally_had_my_first_kiss_and_my_head_is_still/

8,qzcrep,1637554578,We made it exclusive! :))) (just a happy post),"I am very happy and just wanted to share some joy and a success story. I'm 19F, in university, and I met a guy 22M who's also in my university (doing an electrical engineering masters) on Hinge. Actually lol originally we matched on bumble but it said he wasn't sure what he was looking for and he was \*really\* hot (far out of my league) so I think I chickened out before we were going to hang out and said I couldn't and bailed (assumed it would be a one-night stand situation which I don't do). 

Later I switched to hinge and it had us as most compatible so he messaged me, I explained why I'd originally bailed, discovered he actually was looking for a relationship, and wound up planning a new date. I actually almost didn't go because the night before I had had a horrible date with a different man who lowkey sexually assaulted me and who was really awful and just- a ton of red flags. I was up until 1am, got 5 hours of sleep, and had to chug an iced chai tea to have the energy for the date. But I went and it was wonderful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I saw him again and again and like I still thought he was out of my league in many ways and so I tried to suppress my hopes a bit but I did start crushing and like long story short we made it an official exclusive relationship tonight and I'm just really really happy about it :). I think we are so well suited and I just feel so comfortable and happy with him and we are both a little weird in the same way and I really think we are good people for each other.

9,qzcvz4,1637555017,It's a tough (dating)world for introverted guys,"Oh boy. This is probably more of like a rant and should probably go in that group instead. What I guess I am looking for is emotional support. Please. 

In short: I find it impossible to get a girlfriend and girls either dump me after 1-2 dates or they just use me for attention in varying constellations. 

I am 29M and I never had a girlfriend and I am still a virgin. I had my first kiss and first (semi)sexual experience last year at 28 with a girl whom I met on Tinder and I was dating for year. But long story short she was leading me on. She was just 20 when we met and she had (other people suggested this as well based on my accounts) some covert emotional problems probably due to growing up with a mentally ill and alcoholic single mom. I never went all the way with this girl with whom I fell in love even though I suggested having sex more than once and she didn't want to meet up often - a red flag I know. She eventually just wanted to be friends but this was not possible I told her and broke of all contact with her months ago. Even though I do really care about her and worry about her on the other hand I think I did dodge a bullet. 

However, I can't help feeling bad about my situation. I know you can't change the past and that I should really take pride in making progress. I suffered from servere loneliness in my teens with no friends and my dad is an alcoholic. I tested as an ISFP and I really appreciated the answer a guy gave me about how as an INFP/ISFP it's pretty normal that I was just mainly observing girls and maybe talking to the ones I knew but I certainly was not approaching girls and/or making out with any back then.

But I still feel bad about it being so hard for me to just meet a girl and make her my girlfriend. These things have to happen naturally and I don't want to be a player. But the fact that Tinder is just mainly giving me likes from girls I don't find that physically appealing but I did try to just text them anyway and when I go on dates which I do pretty regularly when I am not taking a break from dating it usually ends with a cup of coffee and then it just ends there.

I am thinking about joining a regular group activity to meet girls. when I meet girls online I sometimes just text girls for the hell of it and it seems sometimes they just want my attention and I have a hard time breaking it off even though I solely have a platonic interest in them.

I am a fairly good looking guy, I am smart and have been described as intelligent, funny and charming by girls.  But I am introverted and even though I do initiate conversations with strangers but, it's not easy when you are an introverted male wanting to make a cute girl your girlfriend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzcvz4/its_a_tough_datingworld_for_introverted_guys/

I told her I liked her romantically, but she turned me down. However, we still kept in touch and actually became closer since. We've texted almost every day and would speak on the phone once every a couple of weeks or so. I've always still liked her, although I never brought it up again and didn't expect her to change her mind.

However, I recently realized (from another friend's social media) that she might be seeing someone now. I perfectly know where I stand, but a part of me is sad, especially because she never told me herself. We spoke about many things and she could have casually mentioned a boyfriend, even if she's only seen me as a friend.

24,qzdpf7,1637557830,Help please - Did I do something wrong/how should I approach this?,"I'm going to try to keep this short but that's not my forte so here we go 😂

I (30f) started talking to this guy (let's call him guy A - m37) a little over a month ago. Things have been going great for the most part. We've hung out pretty much every weekend up until the last two because he's out of the country visiting family. We end up staying up until 6 or 7 am because we never run out of things to talk about and he's mostly been very gentlemanly. My dog passed away before two days before he left for his trip and I was an utter mess and he invited me to come stay with him those next two nights and I dropped him off at the airport. We haven't talked about exclusivity but we've had many deep conversations about family and our past in general and I can't emphasize how much him comforting me after my dog passing means. 

However, there have also been a couple of (imho) red flags. He has mentioned that he tends to have a temper and little patience. I got upset one night when I met his friends for the first time and two of the girls kept grabbing his butt for an hour and a half. I tried to not spiral and let it get to me but I finally pulled him aside and told him I hated watching it happen for that long and how I had to talk to him for it to stop instead of him stopping it himself. 

There was another night when we went to his friend's house (just us 3) when his friend and I started talking about video games/movies and things that I guess he doesn't relate to. He blurted out that maybe his friend and I should be talking instead of him and I. After we went back to his place, he got angry with me for interrupting him at one point and then said he didn't see any potential in me long-term. We were drunk so I started crying and gathered myself in the bathroom and when I went back, he was really confused. Seems like he may have blacked out for those 10 minutes but I let it go for the time being. He's been on his vacation this past week and will be this upcoming week and we talked on the phone once so far (but still text a lot in general). We both have tough family lives and I know he's with his parents. Seems like he had a rough day with them but didn't want to give me details so I let it go. I changed the subtext and was telling him about a podcast I love which narrates short horror stories and he knows true crime/spooky things are a big interest of mine. He totally snapped and started saying his mom lives in fear all of the time because of things like that and how he doesn't get enjoyment from being scared and all of it is ""so so so dumb"". His overall tone just sounded angry and like he wanted to be mean/take out his frustration on me. He also said that I shouldn't bother getting him from the airport if he's not the last person I kissed which i get to an extent but to talk exclusivity when he's gone already felt kind of...controlling and possibly manipulative? He texted after that call apologizing and saying I didn't deserve it. I explained to him my sentiments from above and also that I'm hurting from losing my dog since it'd only been a week and i haven't been able to sleep in my bed since my dog was always my cuddle bug. He also knows my parents can be emotionally abusive so I don't feel like I have support at home which makes his anger feel even more palpable. I told him it makes me question the longevity of dating him if this is how he normally reacts and wants to put people down when he's feeling down.  

Historically speaking, I have made awful choices in men who mostly cheat and my home situation doesn't make me confident in many areas of my life (also I am in the process of looking for a new therapist). Because of that, I'm trying not to hyperfocus on one guy and instead, at least go on more dates so I can learn more about myself and what kind of person I can see myself with in the future. 

Fast forward to this past Thursday, I went on a date with a different guy (let's call him guy B, m33). I felt guilty even going based on what guy A had said but I talked to my friends and they said I don't owe him anything if we hadn't hashed it out already and I should be selfish in this scenario.. The date with guy B went very well and we have a lottt more in common than myself and guy A but I still feel strongly for guy A. Guy B ended up staying this weekend just to spend more time with me so we went to an event together. Thing is, I met them both the same night at a similar event a while back and thought I avoided running into guy A's friends but one was still there and took notice of guy B. I ended up telling guy A's friend the gist of the situation and how I'm not ready to stop talking to his friend but it seems more likely than not that he will stop talking to me altogether once I tell him. His friend agreed and that he hopes that's not the case because he was telling him to keep me around because the two of us seemed promising. To top it all off, I still ended up having a really great time with guy B that night and did text guy A saying I have to talk to him about something soon but again, he doesn't come back for another week. 

So my question essentially is how should I approach this with guy A? Do I tell him over the phone before he comes back since he said he didn't want me getting him from the airport if I did anything with anyone else or do I wait to discuss until he comes back? Do you guys think I did anything wrong...?

Just last weekend (before the previously stated incident) I was trying to get frisky with my gf because we hadn’t had sex in 2 weeks and we were both equally wine drunk, but she stopped me and said she didn’t want to have sex with me because it wasn’t the same as when we started dating and we went to sleep, that crushed me and I left her house the next day I can’t help but feel I’m being cheated on again but there’s never any proof.

So she'd feel as if she was dating someone below her league and that she'd lose the respect of her friends. I suspect she also wants to do it this way because she's got a few bullies in her university she wants to prove she's better than.

34,qzebg5,1637559989,What are people’s thoughts about online dating through a game? For any gamers out there.,"I’ve always had bad experience with online dating through the game. Idk if anyone found a long term relationship, and still be happy with that person. But for myself it always turned out to be toxic in the end. Idk what I’m doing wrong to make the other person hate me so much. I come on to play and spend time with him but it seems like he kept accusing me for something that I didn’t do. Just because I have other gaming friends too not just him which I only see as friends with them. He seems like just because I am girl, he thinks I’m flirting with them and hanging out with my friends as a boyfriend and girlfriend thing. Like I don’t understand men in general, I legit told him that I don’t see anyone more as friends except him. He doesn’t believe and he keeps accusing me for lying and hiding something. I am a very upfront person and even my friends agrees. I always speak my mind and tell the truth, but he kept accusing me and when I told him if he have evidence or proof that I lied about something. He says he does, and apparently he has screenshot of someone sending a photo of something to him. I told him “okay send me the photo then” so I can actually talk about it and explain. But he kept making excuses that he can’t show it which is kinda sus cos like why can’t he show it if it’s about me? It doesn’t make sense. I can’t read people’s mind and expect to know the answer to the problem..like wtf. Man idk I got so fed up of getting blame for something I didn’t even do, and if I did something I wanna fix it. I will never understand what is running through his mind cos I was legit dead ass honest and forward. He just kept beating around the bush and it’s really immature for a 28m. Btw I am 23f and I have to deal with this and I just got fed up and left and blocked him. 

I just want your opinions on this situation and what runs through his mind. I’ve already moved on so don’t tell me to move on cos I already done that.

I tried to stalk her socials (sigh) but came up mostly short because everything’s private. I did see a few photos though and she def had a boyfriend sometime earlier this year and looked like maybe she was with him in a recent photo but I saw her profile pop up on hinge not too long ago (but it only came up once and has never shown up since). also have never seen her with him once since I met her back in like May and have probably ran into her 15 or so times.

48,qzfgkc,1637564321,Do I stand a chance?," Hi guys, me (29M) and my crush (25M) are from the same lab and we also shared the same office too. He is my junior and is a newcomer to this lab. He is a shy guy, quite reserved but can be funny at times.

Anyway, I've been going my way to approach him so that I can get to know him more, such as talking to him (he really enjoys talking to me) and making cookies together. Since he's very well-reserved, none of his friends and classmates know if he likes guys or girls. Just recently, I noticed that he was in a bad mood and he didn't really want to speak out on the subject. Yesterday, after making cookies together, we had a long chat, and for some reason we brought up the talk about his bad mood. Surprisingly, he told me that he likes guys and he had a crush on one of my labmates, but his crush was not reciprocating. The bad mood was actually caused by his inability to approach his crush and also jealousy on his crush. I was surprised that he's being so honest about the subject, as he seemed reluctant to talk about it before.

We tend to have very meaningful and deep conversation with each other that doesn't really happen for other labmates. I do wonder if he really just gonna treat me like a friend, that's why he talks a lot more with me and get friend-zoned by him. I'm that kind of guy who only want to date someone I really know well. Right now my plan is kinda waiting him to get over his feeling on his crush, while also spending more time with him hanging out and doing some pastry together in the weekend. After some time, I wanna ask him out for a dinner on Christmas. I really don't know if I really stand a chance. At least now I don't have to worry that he likes girls, which would be a very dead-end for me.

Anyway, I really don't know what to do. Please give me some advice and kindly share your thoughts. BTW, we are both Asian, but I am more exposed to Western culture (I stayed in the US for 4 years for my BS in math), while he's a Taiwanese that is more traditional.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzfgkc/do_i_stand_a_chance/

57,qzg39k,1637566824,In a toxic situation with my ex,"Long story short: My ex and I have lived together for over a year and were together for nearly two years. Earlier this summer, she took an internship halfway across the country which made us long distance. I became very toxic and she broke up with me due to said behaviors and other unresolved trauma on my part.

Since then, we’ve been on and off NC and she has consistently talked about wanting us to get back together when she gets home from the internship. Recently, she began dating someone else but has made clear that the relationship isn’t permanent, that she is emotionally unavailable and that she is emotionally invested in our relationship and that he knows about this. She’a talked about how dating this person will help her trust her instincts again and work towards us getting back together after everything I did to her in our relationship, and that it will show her how to properly be treated by me. I personally feel like this is an excuse, and is her pushing me to the side as an option or second choice for when she eventually comes home. We have both talked about the fact that we would not be compatible together in an LDR, and that is fine, but I feel like this opens the door for her to move on from me entirely, even though she has consistently stated it isn’t permanent and that she wants to be with me when she gets back. I asked her if she was only reaching out because the relationship with him was not going well, but she stated that it in fact is and she stays over his place and works together with him, but that he is “not me” and cannot compare.

Recently, she had talked about the possibility of extending her internship to another half a year. I told her this makes me uncomfortable, especially with her dating someone else, and to compromise. She eventually did, and stated she took a demotion so that she could come back in two months and be together with me, but that she still wants to see who she is seeing for the reasons stated above. I don’t really know wha to do, nor have I heard of this situation before. She has talked about it being common for people to break up and date other people before getting back together, but this feels different and makes me feel inadequate as well, regardless of our past. At the same time, it’s only a two month wait (she declined to extend). I definitely feel like an option or like I was pushed to the side though. I told her how I felt replaceable and how her choice hurt me especially as she had talked about wanting to get back with me this entire time, and she told me she could not believe me for saying that, and that if she felt that way she would have blocked me and never spoke to me again, and that she wants to come home to be with me and to try to understand how she feels for once. Since then, she’s ignored me anytime I try to reach out.

I’m doing my best to, but this situation feels like a mess, and while I appreciate her being transparent and openly communicating with me, I don’t know how to feel about any of this. It feels like any day I can get a message from her between now and the next two months telling me she wants to seriously commit to him. I don’t know how to feel. I’ve had my life on hold for months at this point hung up over our relationship and these developments, and I feel like this has only created a more toxic situation. She says to wait until then, but I can feel my resolve waning each day thinking about her spending time with someone who isn’t me. I don’t know if this is a rebound or not, and I worry that every day I’m another step closer to being forgotten or things falling apart.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzg39k/in_a_toxic_situation_with_my_ex/

In the beginning of this year I made a post in r4r that blew up. I lost access to the account and never saw all the messages I received. 

Now:
A month ago I received a message request on my main account from a guy that used details from my original post and found my main account,since I never responded on the alt acc. 

He texted me he is sorry he is contacting me this way and understands if I didn't want to respond,but he couldn't stop thinking of that post. He has sent his letter to the alt. account two months ago, then texted the account a month later saying he read the book I mentioned in my post, then weeks later found my main account. Even though the way he found me is  technically stalking, I asked him to send me the letter he sent on the alt acc. 

To keep it short, what he wrote is the best thing I've ever read. I loved his responses, the amount of effort was insane, he was really funny, witty, thoughtful and we have too many things in common. Just everything I could wish for. We started texting and have been for the last month. 

I think he is great, except that he always screenshots all the pictures he is sending me and I find it really weird. He said it is because he doesn't want his location on the internet. 

He also says he is ""nervous af"" for a video call date (long distance). Which I don't understand because he is beautiful and hot af. He keeps saying ""I'm not saying never, but for now I don't feel comfortable"". I am starting to think he is in a living situation and is hiding me, or he is not the person from the pictures he sent me. We got into an argument over it and he said it's an insecurity of his, he is afraid he will forget a word in English and would look like a fool. I reassured him multiple times if he forgets we'll laugh it out and google it.

65,qzgraj,1637569546,My (27F) boyfriend (26M) surprised me with a gift of something I showed him in a tiktok video because I thought it was funny,"I (27F) haven't had great luck when it comes to dating, I've dated a few guys who did the bare minimum and thought that because those relationships were better than the abusive ones, that was the baseline. I've been dating my current boyfriend (26M) for three months and he's wonderful. He listens to me, takes a genuine interest in my interests, and is overall very kind and fun to be around. 

A few weeks ago, I showed him this tiktok of a little thing that you put on your toothpaste tube that looks like Shrek with dummy thicc butt cheeks. When you squeeze the toothpaste, it looks like he's shitting it out. It's very stupid but it made me laugh. Fast-forward to last night when we got back to his place and he showed me the mug I made with him at one of those pottery painting places last week. I noticed something small inside it and thought one of his little figurines got in there. But then I looked and it was thicc Shrek!!!!! He said he went and found it on Etsy for me. This is the first time I've ever been surprised with anything and the first time a partner has given me a gift. 

I can't imagine that it cost a lot of money but it's such a thoughtful gesture that he'd go out of his way to get me something that brought me joy. I'm incredibly touched, and I got a laugh when I brushed my teeth later! I wanted to gush a little bit about how great my boyfriend is and that good partners are definitely out there!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzgraj/my_27f_boyfriend_26m_surprised_me_with_a_gift_of/

72,qzh6df,1637571303,Long Distance Trouble (Srry for length),"So this is the very first post I’ve ever made on Reddit. Feels pretty strange still to be honest. But, I really need some honest 3rd party opinions. I don’t know if I’m being irrational/crazy or if I need to stand up for myself. Thanks in advance!

Here’s the situation. I’ve been doing long distance with a girl for the last year and a half. We live far away, so we only see other like once a month. We love each other a lot. We’re both 23, and we’ve discussed marriage and moving in together. We both want it a lot!

We talk every day. We text FaceTime/ call / Snapchat / or whatever social media stuff throughout the day. Probably 6 months in, we started falling asleep on FaceTime together. Kinda cool to end each day just us. 

I don’t want to make this post long, but here’s the issue. When we first started talking, we talked a lot, and had a lot to say. To me, the effort was 50 - 50. I asked about her, she asked about me, and it was just blatantly obvious we both wanted to keep talking. As things have progressed throughout the months, things slowly changed. Our texts became kinda dry, and our phone calls / FaceTime started getting more comfortable. She would be on instagram or texting her friends, and I’d be hanging out myself.

I started worrying that she was losing interest. I have a single point of trauma from a girl leaving me in the past, and I started getting really worried I was losing this girl too. And I knew I couldn’t lose her. 

So I talked to her about it. I told her like hey, we aren’t taking as much anymore.. I acknowledged that the honey moon phase needs to end and that I’m not trying to be needy, but just wanting to check in to make sure that your still happy and that I’m not losing you..  

She told me that she is just quiet. She loves me so much, and loves how easy our relationship is. She said she knows I’m the right one because of how easy it is, and how comfortable she is around me. She likes being on FaceTime “just hanging out” and that she isn’t going anywhere. 

I felt great. I was like, “well that went great!” Until a few weeks later. I started worrying again. We talked, she tried to say the same thing, a little frustrated that I was bringing it up again, but all good. 

Then again, and again. It’s been probably 4 or 5 times now and she gets really pissed when I bring it up. 

I’m writing this (unfortunately long) post because I don’t know what to do. Am I being unfair to her? Is she being unfair to me? I just want to know she loves me, and wants to be with me. I want her to flirt and be sweet. Like duh? Who the fuck doesn’t want their girlfriend to do that. I feel like I don’t need her to be a legit radio, but like you can’t ask me how I am or how my day is? Sometimes I feel like I just ramble on and she sits there. It’s like, do you like me, or do you just not want to be alone?

I tell her this and she doesn’t get it. She refuses to take any fault and thinks that “it’s all in my head.” She thinks that she’s been the same “level of quiet” this entire time and “is super sweet and nice to you all the time” and keeps dropping the whole BS line of like “seems like you should date someone else because I’m not ever going to change. I’m just no talkative so”

Some part of me feels like I’m being gaslit. Like she’s not taking any responsibility, not caring about how I feel, and not putting effort in. Another part of me thinks, that’s just how she is. It’s your problem, you need to realize she does love you, always has, AND even though it may be dry and different convos now, she texts you ever day and FaceTimes you every night. So stop being needy, and get your fucking head on straight. 

I try to do that, and it never works. That’s why we’ve had this talk and now fight over and over again. I don’t want to break up. I don’t think she does either. We love each other a lot, but this is obviously a big deal to me. I mean come on, I’m writing an essay on Reddit! 

I’m not proofreading, or even going to re read this. It’s unedited, straight from my brain. Would love to truly hear some opinions",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzh6df/long_distance_trouble_srry_for_length/
73,qzh7mi,1637571456,Should I buy him birthday gift?,"I'm currently working at a retail supermarket job, it's my first job and I met a guy (colleague) here.

Ever since my first day, he has always been helpful to me. He helped me, reminded me of my break times, asking to walk to punch out for going home together. This is a big deal as I didn't expect this treatment because its opposite gender helping me and his aisle is actually very far from mine. So he had to walk all the way to do all those.

I find him good-looking but found out he has a girlfriend. Our other colleagues also knows he has a girlfriend. Despite of this, our colleagues have been teasing for us to get together because I'm single and they don't take his relationship w/ his girlfriend seriously. The latter is because the girlfriend is a person he knew from online and they only started dating during COVID time - therefore, they haven't met eachother irl. 

However, since our colleagues have just started teasing us together, he has been way more approachable (?) to me. For example, when he's done with his work, he walked to my aisle and had a 1-1 conversation. Before this, it was just one sentence or walking together. But since the teasing, we talked longer. I also reciprocated to avoid awkwardness and walked to his aisle to have his conversation.

The teasing started one month ago and we got closer since. Today is his birthday. I greeted him in advance yesterday because today is our offday. I do not have his number just because we haven't had any reason to exchange numbers. When I greeted him, he jokingly said where's my present? and when I asked him his plans, he didn't have any. I didn't have the courage to schedule a hangout together and celebrate his birthday. 

My question is should I buy him a birthday gift - nothing major, just like a chocolate he likes and a handwritten birthday greet?

Why I'm questioning is because I feel like giving him present would signal more. I don't actually want to pursue us into a relationship because I don't see myself staying at this job for long. I don't see us together because his status (like education, financial) is not to my stability standard. But I feel bad for not buying him gift. Plus, if he's still together with his girlfriend and they broke up for me, I would feel bad to break up with him and now he's alone.

74,qzhjcj,1637572824,"I know she's bad for me, how do I forget about her","I was in a relationship with a girl about 6 years ago, we were only together for around 4 months and things were going well until I found out she was engaged.

One of my friends found out and when I confronted her she denied it but I found out it was true after seeing him on her social media so I deleted her off everything even though she tried messaging me just before her wedding.

She eventually ended up getting divorced a year in to her marriage, that was around 5 years ago.

Around last year we got back in touch and we got back together as she seemed to have changed a lot, but a while in to the relationship she revealed that she did have quite a few boyfriends before then and that she had slept with a few.

I was understanding and things seemed to be going fine after and we even planned for marriage, but then I noticed how much of a rush she was in to get married and how she said she always misses me. But lately we have argued a lot and she has really wound me up to the point where I didn't want to speak to her, she knew I wanted my space but to get my attention she ended up blocking me off everything.

When I asked why she blocked me she said she didn't want me to have access to her if I can't commit to her, even though she has a lot of random guys on there! She eventually unblocked me.

My own family wasn't happy about my relationship as my mother wasn't keen on her but I eventually persuaded her to accept (I realise now how stupid I was).

A few months later, I noticed her being open again about other guys but instead of saying anything I stayed quiet. When she asked why I was quiet, she insisted that I can talk to her about anything so I told her that I wasn't happy with how open she is with other guys, she then went on to say how she didn't want to be with someone that is insecure as her ex husband was the same.

I was quite annoyed at this point as she has said herself in the past that she is insecure too and she always had mood swings and emotional issues due to her endometriosis which I was always understanding of, it hurt that she couldn't be understanding of my mental health. So then she went on to complain about me not committing to her, at this point I had enough of it and said that if she wants to end it she should do it now so she went ahead and blocked me off social media.

She didn't block my number but now I have blocked hers so she can't get in touch with me. I told my mother that we had broken up so she shouldn't get in touch with her mother to sort wedding arrangements, at that point my mom informed me that she rang her mom a couple of weeks ago but she said that she was busy and and that she would ring back later which she never did.

I was tempted to unblock her and have a go at her for saying that I was the reason things weren't progressing. But I though forget it, I no longer want anything to do with her anymore.

Its been a month since she blocked me, I have missed her a lot and was tempted to try to get in touch with her. But I know she's not good for me, please her me what should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzhjcj/i_know_shes_bad_for_me_how_do_i_forget_about_her/

80,qzhqxe,1637573725,I finally had my first kiss,"At the age of 23, I want to share a terrible truth. I dated a guy for several years and thought it was forever: love, children, family…

It all started in early June, when I bought a test. And... two stripes. The next morning – the same result. My hands began to shake, tears welled up in my eyes, and my stomach ached sharply. I sat down on the floor and cried, not understanding whether it was tears of joy or great grief for me then. One thing was spinning in my head: ""What should I do?

When I informed my lover about the pregnancy, he said that he didn't care whether it was an abortion or ""you're going to give birth."" Will you!? Why not ""we will""? There was indifference in his eyes.

The next day I went to the clinic. A gynecologist met me and performed an ultrasound with undisguised disgust… I was told to come back in a week and bring the money. During this time, my beloved turned away from me, only gave the announced amount and left.

This week dragged on like an eternity. I couldn't sleep at night, and in the morning I was so sick of worries that I couldn't get out of bed. I didn 't want to eat at all…

During the second ultrasound, I was shown a small ""speck"" on the screen. I heard the words of a gynecologist that I will never forget: ""Look, this is your baby, it's developing so well and growing fast."" I was afraid…

After 10 minutes I took a pill, and the next morning I was told to go back to the clinic. When I got home, I called my boyfriend and, sobbing, told him everything, but I didn't hear any reaction on the phone. It was very insulting to me, because I would never have thought that our child would change it so much.

The next day my gynecologist was already waiting for me with a bunch of pills. I drank them, and they took me to the operating room. An hour later, my blood began to run so that I didn't have time to change the pads. I was afraid to tell the doctor and kept hoping that the blood would stop. Then the doctor came in and saw a mountain of pads, quickly put me on a chair and let me shove something into the uterus so that it opens. I screamed at the whole department in pain. And the doctor only covered my mouth with his hand and constantly said: ""Shut up, you fool, she agreed."" Then he made me jump with all my might so that the fetus would come out by itself.

My eyes couldn't see anything from crying, my legs were giving way, I was tired, I couldn't do it anymore. And suddenly I felt something fall out of me and blood flowed down my legs with terrible force. The doctor was delighted and took me to his office.

This is where the most terrible thing began: he took tweezers, opened the pouch and took out my baby from there. I lost consciousness…

It was very far for me to get home, I had the last money in my pocket for a minibus and one gasket, which would obviously not be enough for me, since I changed them every five minutes. I dialed the number of my beloved and said: ""Dimochka, pick me up, I can't get there myself, I'm bleeding."" ""Yana, I'm working,"" he cut me off.

I beg everyone who reads my story, believe me and everyone else who has experienced it for themselves… Do not take the life of your baby! It's not in your will!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzhqxe/i_finally_had_my_first_kiss/

We met on tinder and we told each other how unexpected it was that we will find someone we have such a strong connection with on a dating app.

I sent him a text to ask him if we could see each other soon to which he replied « No » and he then said « I didn’t miss you so I guess it is what it is ». 
Keep in mind that he told me a week before that that he was excited to see me again.
My heart shattered. I really fell in love with him and had a lot of my first times with him, I gave him my whole and right now I just feel like what I did wasn’t good enough and I could have kept him closer even if I know I did nothing wrong.

83,qzi7gy,1637575647,Debating on messaging my ex (first love),"I’ve been debating on messaging my ex that I broke up with 2 years ago (2 year relationship). She was my first love and well, unfortunately we made dumb mistakes in our relationship and I ended it because it couldn’t be salvaged. I needed to let her go to be happy despite how much I loved her. It has been just over a year now since we last spoke, but the two interactions I did have with her since we broke up, it was clear she missed me. I couldn’t express my feelings to her at the time because I was with somebody else. Well, now that I’m not taken anymore, i have been considering messaging her and giving a relationship another shot, after seeing how friends work out of course. I just hope she still misses me like I miss her. 

Any advice on how I should go about messaging her?? I’ve been thinking about just being direct and messaging her “I miss you,” to get a direct response back. Seeing if the feelings are likewise and asking her out for coffee to begin as friends again before considering a relationship. But I also think that would be stupid/too much. On the other hand, I could just say hey, see how the conversation goes (if she even texts back), and if it’s good then ask her out for coffee.

In december i called her out of the blue when she was in a relationship and she didn t respond. After some time i saw that she isn t in a relationship anymore so i had to release my guilt of me ignoring her so i can move on in peace. I called her again and i said that i don t want to lose her, she is a very special person to me and in case something bad happens, to reach out for support but she didn t said that she wants it too, she was in silence, we just had a friendly conversation.. that was at the end of april this year. And the thing is i always have the assumption, idk why, that i didn t fight for her to keep her in my life at least, cuz i know that we shouldn t be together now because of the circumstances. This thought that i didn t do enough to keep her in my life it stresses me like hell guys.

Had a call that night (Friday) and met up with her and her friend for dinner the day after (Saturday) and held hands when going back home. That night we called and she said we wanted to focus on me and told me that she messaged her other days saying to be friends cuz she doesn't wanna hold hands with someone and see other people. And I said I wanted to focus only on her as well. Then met up with her on Monday (kissed in a park that night) + Thursday + Saturday (she invited me to go picnic with her friends).

In the week we basically acted as if we were in a relationship, messaging a whole lot, using heart emojis, FaceTiming, saying I miss you but never I love you. We bonded over the fact we both broke up in July (got dumped), devastating heartbreak, and now knows how a healthy relationship should be, both christians. When we met up she said she liked my company, really liked me, said I was brave and cute. She also told me she was really afraid to fall in love and get serious cuz of her past relationship so she might be a bit slow (1 day after we matched), and I told her I totally understand cuz thats me as well and she said she will do her best to not hurt me and says there's something special with us. But then she was the one who took the lead in setting the fast pace (she initiated all the meet ups, asked to pin her chat on WhatsApp with heart emojis beside my name and be romantic in chatting).

But this morning she messaged me saying she was overwhelmed, saying we were moving too fast, she wants to take things slow. Asked me we are just friends right? Wants to keep our options open, not settle and meet new people and get to know each other and see what happens, but also wants to keep meeting up and everything. She then said lets delete our WhatsApp chats and restart from scratch which we did. Cuz in her previous relationship (4 years + engagement ring) they got together within a week, and her mum and bro said she needs to play hard to get, that we were moving too fast. (My gut feeling was that during our FaceTime last night my mum came in pissed that I was FaceTiming so late and she said it scared her and she hates confrontation (maybe that's why she says this?)

But earlier last week she was asking me am I the type of person of waits months to ask to be official, and when I said I take couple weeks and do you want me to ask she said its up to you cuz your the boy. She suggested to have sex in a hotel on thurs saying it would connect us more, but then the next day say she changed her mind and wanted to wait until we were in a relationship. She also asked if she was going to be my rebound, but when I asked her if I was her rebound she says no cuz she's completely over her ex now, never wants him back and happy he's not in her life (blocked) and sees me as an upgrade for him.

So basically, I don't know what to do, should I back off and no contact until she comes back? HELP

TL;DR - I \[M23\] matched with her \[F22\] on Bumble a week ago. Met up 3 times last week, acted as if we were bf/gf, bonded over recent heartbreak (July), and now she says wants to take things slow cuz we are moving too fast. What do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzizkh/she_wants_to_take_things_slow_now_what_do_i_do/

91,qzj0n4,1637579035,I will never use Tinder again...,"Unless you want banter, casual sex, or one response a day that fizzles into nothing, avoid Tinder now. In my area at least, it is full of copy/paste people who have no personality beyond what alcohol they like and mostly tend to match and ignore. I don't doubt there are decent people using it still, but it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

I migrated over to Hinge a few months back, and I'm finding the quality of people on that app and their willingness to put effort in to making conversation yields much better results than Tinder, with the trade-off being it's a little bit slower paced. Also it shows you who likes you and allows you to match them without needing a premium account, and the recommend profiles section somehow actually shows me women I like the style of (boho girls, geeks, house plant lovers). 

Just for context: I have a very specific type. I am an introverted and boho type of guy with long hair who doesn't drink, smoke, do drugs, or want kids. I have a LOT going against me for meeting somebody likeminded as most people want kids and love going out where I'm from, not to mention that my appearance and style isn't what the majority of women are into (and I'm okay with that). I've had decent success so far meeting people I click with on there, can't say the same for Tinder.

Anybody here struggling on dating apps who is a little more on the introverted or alternative side, I recommend trying it out. You'll get less likes or matches and it'll take longer, but from my experience as somebody who has failed on Tinder for years, Hinge has gotten me results. I've managed to meet somebody who ticks all of my very specific and weird boxes, so I recommend people make a profile that's honest and unapologetically themselves instead of playing it safe for mass appeal or the dopamine hit of ""you have a new like"" that tinder has gotten people addicted to.

92,qzj3ts,1637579402,Emotionally unavailable,"I don't know what's wrong with me but I feel like I just can't be loved or feel love or love another person. I am pretty distrustful and cautious when it comes to women because I hear so many fucked up stories and see alot of shit that bothers me about them that I don't really wanna get involved. But at the same time I feel pretty damn lonely, but I feel like it's an unfixable problem. I've never been good with girls, I don't think anyone has ever liked me, like as in like me as a person, not because of my looks. I feel like people are kinda selfish and they only want you to get something outa you. 

Idk man I've kindof given up ever since I was 13, can't do it so I don't bother trying. Rather focus on shit that I can actually do instead of things I can't change. But then sometimes I want to get out there but it never works out so I revert back to the 'I can't do it's mindset.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzj3ts/emotionally_unavailable/
93,qzjcjy,1637580389,She will have sex with me but won't sleep in my house?,"I have been dating this girl for a few weeks now. Few days ago I brought her home for the first time and we had sex. She didn't plan on staying that day but after sex she decided to sleep over since I also suggested it.

Today she is coming to my house again (2nd time), and I told her via messages to sleep in my house again, if she wants. However she said ''I don't think so, maybe some other time''.

I don't necessarily find this bad (even though I would prefer her to sleep in my apartment), but is it a bad sign overall? I haven't noticed anything wrong and we talk daily, but I was wondering if some women aren't comfortable sleeping in someone else's house at the start, even if they had sex with that person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzjcjy/she_will_have_sex_with_me_but_wont_sleep_in_my/
94,qzjh01,1637580867,I don’t feel right after finding out my GF has her ex’s initials scarred on her thigh.,"I posted this in a few other places because I’m struggling

It’s a stupid thing to be upset about because it happened when she was still with him and she did it during her self harming phase like 2 years ago. She’s been broken up for a year with him because he was mentally abusive and I’ve been with her nearly 2 months and she mentioned it and showed it to me and I don’t know how to process it. She regrets it and feels upset and I comforted her but inside I feel weird about it.

Everything I feel is irrational just to clarify. I’m aware that it’s wrong to feel like this but I can’t help it. I feel like an imposter being with her after knowing this because his fucking initials are scarred there on her thigh. I wish I never knew but she trusted me enough to tell me and I think the world of her and I’d do anything for her.

But why do I feel so sad and detached knowing that this happened in the past. I don’t know and I don’t want to feel this way.

My ex however (my first love) did end up getting married but now I have found out she has got divorced recently. I know its a long shot but she was my first love and I never really forgot about her, even though we haven't been in touch for years do you think there could still be a chance for us to be together again?

96,qzjmy1,1637581519,ONS gone wrong?,"So I met up with a guy from Bumble last week and we met up for coffee. We got along pretty well and after a couple hours went back to his flat and had drinks by the rooftop pool. We talked about our childhood, siblings etc pretty intimate stuff and then later had sex. I met up with him again at night for round 2. Anyway, we still chat again here and there for laughs. Thought nothing much of it but still thought we were pretty good friends. A week later he was in town again but we both didn’t ask to meet up and I also had an appointment to meet up with my friend at this bar anyway. He shows up with another girl at the bar and sat right behind us. He made eye contact but didn’t even said hi but just ignored me completely. I almost spat out my drink lol anyway, my friend and I just got up and left after awhile. I know I shouldn’t feel jealous because there were no strings attached but why am I feeling hurt?

Anyway after four days of this, I am stressed, humiliated and sad because I grew quite fond of her. Eventually her friend tells me that she talked to her and evidently the girl though that ""I was too good to be true"". I am a fairly attractive nice guy. And she had a bad experience with one before me. Through other people they found out that I was indeed not an asshole and she reached out. Anyway after the ghosting I was really put off. I expect clear communication because I really hate misunderstandings. Anyway after I rejected her she seemed surprised and even a bit sad. 

I like her a lot but those four-five days were really miserable for me... Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzjpt7/ghosted_for_wrong_reasons/
