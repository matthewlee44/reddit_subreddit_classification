so i (24) matched with this girl (20) on Tinder just under a month ago. we hit it off right from the start and came to learn that we had a lot of common interests and similar goals in life. we were communicating consistently and constantly (multiple replies every hour) on the app and everything was going well. i put out a few date ideas and she liked one of them so we were progressing towards setting up a time to meet up. during our convos my tinder app started glitching for some reason (the way some matches disappear and then reappear with the convos reset) and i asked for her number and we moved the convo to texting instead cause I didn’t want to risk any glitches in the chat.

now before i continue i just want to point out that consistent and clear communication is super important to me. i don’t mean i need someone that’s clingy or anything but rather someone that clearly communicates what’s on their mind or what emotions they’re feeling, NOT someone who beats around the bush or makes it unclear to me where they stand.

anyways, the instant we moved to text it’s like she became a totally different person. her replies became late (every 2-3 days), short (1 sentence replies) and showed minimal effort (no reciprocation of questions) and felt cold if i’m being honest. this was absolutely not the case when we were still communication on Tinder. i let the inconsistency slide a few times because i know having a busy lifestyle can hinder your ability to prioritize certain communications but i eventually called her out on it. she apologized and explained her situation as to how she’s working 2 jobs to get ready for college and is so drained that she just passes out pretty much every night and she didn’t mean to leave me hanging. i was skeptical but i’m a reasonable man so i gave her the benefit of the doubt.

during all this, i ended up leaving town for about a week or so to go visit my parents before i started grad school. i tried my best to continue communication with her during my time away (although it proved rather difficult with her late replies) and told her i wanna schedule our date once i get back and she agreed to it.

fast forward to me finally getting back and telling her i’m back in town and now she’s practically a ghost and replies once a week.

i’ve already made the decision to move on from her and don’t plan on responding any longer, but what i REALLY can’t wrap my head around and wanna know is why did her style and frequency of communication suddenly change when we moved things to text? and is there anything i could improve on my part to avoid this from happening in the future?

I (20F) have a guy best friend (20M) who I have known for about 7 years. We met in the eighth grade and we got closer as friends over the years. When I first knew him, I discounted him completely. He had asked me out on several occasions but I never once accepted because I simply didn't see him that way. He always took it really well and wouldn't make it awkward or weird. To be completely frank, he was not my type for a long time. It kind of became a running joke between us that he was ""always in love with me"" and I would ""always reject him"". 

Fast forward a couple years to high school. We went to different schools so we barely saw each other. We both dated (many) different people and had a good, albeit more distant than before, friendship going on. I'll also admit that puberty was good to him and he became quite good-looking. We both showed up to our mutual friend's birthday after not seeing each other for a long time and things just picked up where we left off. Our dynamic has always been very flirty but in a joking way with the assumption that we both knew it would never happen, so that was the energy that day. In retrospect, we definitely looked like a couple -- the birthday girl's mom referred to us as ""the lovebirds"" unknowingly, he was laying on my lap, I was playing with his hair -- but I didn't think much of it. Later that night, he kissed me (like a quick peck on the lips), to which I reacted with a certain extent of surprise but I was not opposed to it. I brushed it off.

About two weeks after that night, I went on vacation with my family. I was in the airport on New Year's Eve when he drunk texted me saying that he was ""in love with me"" and ""had actual feelings for me"". I was taken aback -- after all, I thought that kiss was more of a joke than anything (for context, we both have had a lot of casual things without any feelings involved). I told him I didn't believe him and would talk to him when he was sober. The next day, he stood by what he said and told me he wants to be in a relationship with me. I accepted without much thought and told him ""sure, let's give it a go.""

I should mention that I, though in denial at the time, was recovering from an abusive relationship I had left just about a year ago. Needless to say, this caused a lot of insecurity and pain points for me even if I did not recognize it. Us ""dating"" lasted only about a month. We didn't sleep together but we did everything else; we got close to it but he would tell me that he ""wanted to prove everyone wrong that we weren't just in it for the sex.""

After I told him I wanted to just be friends again, he took it very well and respected my decision. Things got back to normal soon after and our dynamic had once again returned to what it always had been -- flirty with the knowledge that it would never happen (again). He moved away for college so I saw him even less. Every time he would come back to town I wouldn't have the time to see him. We kept in touch through FaceTime calls and such, but we never really hung out.

3 years after we dated (or tried to), I was in his city because of work. We had made plans to hang out in advance because we hadn't seen each other in so long, and I was only going to be in town for a little bit. I had just moved away from home and was feeling very lonely and homesick. I went to his place with full intention of seeking solace in a familiar face. We had a couple drinks, smoked a couple joints, and he told me he was having second thoughts about his current girlfriend. One thing led to another, and in a stunning turn of events, we slept together. 

The actual act was unremarkable -- it wasn't the best sex I've ever had or anything like that. It was the comfort, the familiarity, the closeness that got to me. Because I haven't seen him in so long, I forgot how fond of him I was. I was simply overjoyed to hold his face in my hands, or to have his arms around me. He kept telling me he couldn't believe this was happening. I couldn't find the words to tell him what I did or did not believe. 

The next morning, he told me that we should ""probably keep this to ourselves"". I agreed, saying that our dynamic still ""feels like nothing had happened"" and joked that it probably won't happen again for another 3 years. When I left, we hugged goodbye. I wanted, instead, to kiss him goodbye. 

It has now been about a week since that night. I haven't stopped thinking about him -- I count the hours between text backs (the length of time, I believe, hasn't changed; I just notice it much more now), I think about seeing him again, and that night replays in my head on repeat. I don't know how, or whether I even should, tell him about this. I don't want to put our friendship in jeopardy. I also don't want to date long distance (I'm moving across the country in a month). Not to mention, he still hasn't broken it off with his girlfriend (I know. I'm sorry. I do feel badly about this part). What is the right thing to do in this situation?

I absolutely hate hookup culture, and I usually make that clear straight away so I’m not wasting their time in case that’s what they were looking for. But yet they still continue to go out with me. I think maybe they assume that a FWB will inevitably arise, but when they realize it’s not going to, they dip. I’m also a 20 year old girl dating 20 year old college guys, so immaturity is also a factor here. Anyway, I’ve tried making little ‘adjustments’ in the way i present MY wants. I used to say that I wanted a relationship right off the bat, but then they convinced me they wanted one too and tried to play me. I wish they would just be honest lol. 

Here’s the scenario I am in right now: I’ve been talking to a guy and we just went on our first date the other day. It went great! He asked me to go out again this weekend. It’s very hard to tell what he wants, because he’s not really a sweet talker like the other guys were. He’s not really trying to convince me that he’s a certain way or wants a certain thing. He hasn’t brought up the relationship topic, and we’ve been talking for weeks. I want to find out what he wants, but I feel like i will keep running in the same scenario. Is there another approach i should take that would be better than my previous situations?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1011311,public,self,How do I go about knowing what a guy wants without asking him?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppt4e3/how_do_i_go_about_knowing_what_a_guy_wants/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Which I guess isn't saying much. I'm 21 years old, female, and have only been on 5 first dates. Ever. 

I've always had crippling anxiety when it comes to dating-- I get sick to my stomach before going out, have bouts of insomnia, and get progressively more anxious the more intense the relationship gets. For that reason, I've sabotaged a few good things and have avoided putting myself out there. While my best friends have fallen in love, have had wild one-night stands, and candle-lit dinners, I've watched from the sidelines, mystified. How did this all come so easily to them?

But recently, after starting therapy and making a concerted effort to work on myself, I made the decision that I was ready to PROPERLY give dating a go. Instead of complaining about my situation, I was actually wanted to face my fears. I didn't necessarily think it was going to be easy. But I guess I really didn't think it would be this hard. I'd met great guys when I wasn't ready, so it stood to reason they would be around when I finally decided to turn on my green light, right?

WRONG. Man, I should have listened when people told me it was messy out here. It's been a week and I've been ghosted once, I've had to dump someone I wasn't even dating (yikes), and I've gone out with a bonafide weirdo (he run into oncoming traffic to kick a man's truck, and has a massive tattoo of Satan who he talked to like it was a pet). I was seriously wondering if it was even worth it. You have to put so much of yourself on the table, you have to put SO much energy into dating and...  It would be so much easier to throw in the towel and give up. No more sleepless nights, no more nausea, no more creeps. 

But my friends keep pushing me to be better. Damn them and their kind hearts! Screw them and their good advice!

They said good things aren't meant to come easy. They said 5 bad dates is too small of a sample size. They said I needed to go on 50 first dates before I could say I'd really given it a go. And I really do want to try. I don't want to keep sabotaging myself. Sometimes you gotta take the advice of the people who love you, ya know?

SO to make this fun for myself, I'm going to document the process. I'm hoping then bad dates will seem less like a waste of time and more like a good story. I'm hoping this might keep me accountable. Hopefully, I'll meet someone cool. If I don't I'll at least have learned something about myself. At least I'll have faced my fears. 

If anyone has any sage advice in the following categories feel free to share!

1) How to reduce relationship or dating anxiety and pre-date panic attacks/ why this might be happening to me in the first place (I honestly don't know what I'm so nervous about, in general, I'm a pretty self-assured person, so I don't really think it's performance anxiety, but I don't know what other issue it could even be...)

2)  How to weed out weirdos when dating online

3) Natural ways to meet people in person, particularly on a uni campus/ how to approach people 

4) Good first date ideas/ suggestions/ hacks and tricks to make it go smoother

5) Any dating horror stories to make me feel less alone

6) Any success stories to give me hope

I’m really shy so I rarely approach girls, but I just grabbed her hand, we started dancing, we ended up making out, and I kissed her goodbye.

I was so drunk that I honestly didn’t remember what she looked like, but when I was drunk I thought she was really pretty and cute. This sounds kind of mean, but she sent me a picture and it was different from what I remember and she didn’t look like what drunk me thought. It’s not that she’s ugly or anything she’s just not really my type.

I had set up a date before I had the picture sent, so now I feel bad about sort of going on a date where I might not like the girl, but I figure that recalling that night might be fun and interesting, and it could be just fun to hangout. 

And even more interesting is that she seems super responsive, and only one other time has a girl ever asked me how my day was, she also asks what I’ve been doing, how I’m feeling, sending me heart emojis, not one dry response, fast responses, and I guess this is what real interest looks like. She’s the one who keeps the conversation going, I feel like I don’t really have to try, and she seems super nice and thoughtful, which makes me feel bad bc I’m not as into her. 


I feel like I’ve been on that side of the coin sometimes so it’s interesting to see the other side, but in the past I was just head over heels for the girl and the girl might’ve been neutral or liked me as well, but she could never match my energy 100 percent over text.

But her nice side is she is so sweet and lovely childish and listens to me but she forgot the difference between what is bad in relationship and what is not.

Help me guys 😫



Here's some context it's from my last post : 


me : i'm more of a american style person (live's in asia) i care about small things or i care so much about anything and i love technology and i've been in 1 relationship before that breakup was horrible when i was in high school i'm 20 and i'm in college, and i think i know so many things and i act like i have so much experience and i know everything i like to take control of everything only if i know about that thing and so many time it turns out i was right and my plans never fails { this is how i'm }

my girl : from small village simple innocent and childish and little dumb more caring and talkative she loves me truly and she's honest and loyal

&amp;#x200B;

okay so we've been in relationship almost 22 Months and in the start i was super dumba$$ i broke her heart so many times but i was honest and i came back and made that situation right or solve the problem or convinced her but i didn't had that much of experience and after somedays things goes normal and after some time or days things goes same way i did some small thing she take it on heart and fight happens,

i'm more of introvert but i like friends i like to talk with them on chat but whenever me and my girl meet's she checks my mobile and i accept that sometime i fucked up i accidently sent NSFW gif to my bestie and she saw it which i accept as my fault and my girl got wrong idea and i also explained her what was the situation and she got convinced in 2 to 3 days but she keeps taking it out so many times.

i always convinced her even when i was in anger or frustration thinking of she's sweet and innocent and i hurt her even tho it wasn't my fault, i didn't care about my self respect and tried to convince her and still she don't respect me.

whenever i tell her watch this show for example i said watch friends and how i met your mother and modern family just to get a idea what is relations are and why they're valuable and how to treat each other she just directly denies it and says that ""it's a wrong influence that you're getting and learning from tv shows""

and here's the problem she always disrespects me and tell me that you have no personality and so many things and in my defence i know i made so much of bad impression on her but i didn't did that intentionally whenever i try to do something it goes wrong way and speaking of personality i have but i chose to not show her ‘cause  i'm her first love and i wanted to be an open to her as much as i can i was always honest to her no matter what and i was also loyal to her i never cheat on her ever but still she don't buy it if some argument happened she always disrespects me and i was the one who convinced her all the time and she always keep bringing stupid past things and then i feel like not to be with her anymore and i also get angry.

i know i did those things but can't she just move on i'm not that person anymore she changed me so much she showed me what is true gentlemen but she also makes me feel like i'm in jail trapped she just trying to control my life

i'm the guy who is eagle and she's like ""NO YOU Can't FLY""

in the start i was not in love with her i love her but little and by seeing her honesty and loyalty i just don't want to leave her and i know i know if i ever get that kind of girl who is honest and loyal.

now it's too much man i just can't handle it she disrespects and insult me so much.

please guys tell me can i change her in good way and stop this all shit or just last option is to break up with her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1011346,public,self,My girl hurts me emotionally 💔,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pptooq/my_girl_hurts_me_emotionally/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

One time I was getting out of my car after my break and i saw her leaving the store! So i used it as an opportunity to get her number in which i did! We texted for a few weeks and till went on a date and back to her place and you know what happened then….

This went on for a span of several months of FWB. Heres the catch, if i ever ignored her via text, she would get super clingy and very irritated, I eventually would make up for it with more s3x. Back to her age, she said she was 35 however when i would google her, her public profile said she was 52, but she also had an aunt who owned her house and had the same name as her so i figured it could have been that? I mean she looked great but idk if id say she was 35. Well, towards the end of our FWB i started to ignore her more and she told me she was pregnant and even sent an ultrasound!!I couldnt believe it…However i did more research and turns out she bought a fake ultrasound online with her info on it. Like what!? After i found this information out, I actually didnt confront her about it and left it as is and blocked her. However though is it possible she very well could have? We had unprotected s3x once but i was only in her for a few thrusts before i put on a rubber. I haven’t seen or heard from her since. We also have done it when she was on her period too.

The best I've had from it was a 6-8 week period seeing a girl back in early summer last year, but that never went anywhere after she decided she wasn't looking for a relationship anymore. 

I try to keep active as much as possible and make sure I'm not swiping right on too many people, all in a bid to be shown to as many people as I can - I've read these things play a fairly big part in that. Pictures are the most recent I have and (at least I'd like to think) I look fairly decent. For reference I'm 21 M from UK. I very rarely get anyone swipe right on me, and the times I get that lucky, I never seem to find them when I'm swiping through the app myself. 

I'm not one for going out a great deal and, as everyone says, I don't want to be someone I'm not, just to try and find someone, because that won't be the real me. I've been told a million times that I'll find someone 'sooner or later' and that there's 'someone out there for everyone' but I'm getting past the point of losing faith and patience with these apps. 

I'm not looking to sleep around or anything like that, I just want a long term, happy relationship with someone I can settle down with... Is that too much to ask?

So, I have an English teacher that I’ve always had quite a crush on since time immemorial. I know, I know, quite the usual thing. We were always on good terms long after school was out, occasionally texting each other and all that.

After my last breakup I’ve been laying low for a while. Coincidentally, we’ve had quite some good conversations with her on the social media. So, gathering all of my courage, I asked her out (specifically saying ‘date’) and she agreed, even offering to go out and have some wine and talk stuff.

My question is, how do I make myself look the best to her? And do you think that the whole setup (me using the word ‘date’, her suggesting going out for drinks) suggest she might have a sexual interest?

I saw the „you miss 100% of the shots you dont take“ on here and decided to give it a try after a couple of days texting and she said yes! (Yay) -my point being: it really do be like that!

A whole 13 years past, not seeing or hearing from her for the whole 13 years (lost contact). We never had sex. Only one kiss once 13 years ago. 

One day 13 years later she happens to see me on tinder, she messeges me and says she could never have forgot my face, and she also mentioned that sometimes my name would pop into her head over the years saying your name is a name I couldn't forget. 

When I was talking to her on the dating site she gave me her number and we spoke on WhatsApp video chat, she spoke for 4 hours with me and was bright red in the face the whole time, I knew her face was red by me just being with her on video chat. I asked if I could come see her round her place, and she agreed with no hesitation. When I arrived at her place she was very well dressed and make up on etc (she later confessed that she deeply cleaned her place before I came), we talked, she told me my name often popped in her head over the years, and that I had broken her heart, and when I said 'im surprised you remembered my face still' she laughed and said ',your face is not a face I'd ever forget'. We kissed but It didn't go further. 

She did mention earlier she like me a lot except the shyness. But towards the end of the date I sensed something wrong, I thought she would be putty in my hands (arrogant I know), she carried on speaking to me, later she asked me to come around again, I said I couldn't go because I was fixing cupboards. She carried on speaking to me. But days later I actually got ghosted by her. She then unghosted me at one point when my father died and I told her, she then later went quiet again and I just left it.

A month ago, I (19M) hooked up and lost my virginity with a classmate at a party. There was also another girl at the party and we talked a lot. However she had to leave soon and so I texted her if she wanted to meet sometime. In the following month, I was spending time with the first girl and started to crush on her. So I decided to tell her but she shot me down. I was disappointed but at least I got it out of my system. The same day (after the confession) I was talking to the second girl and she mentioned our planned ""meeting"". I took it as a meeting between friends who didn't get time to talk during the party. She however, took it as a date invitation. After she told me this, I, a recently rejected guy, told her that I am fine with it and that it can be a date. Since she is a nice girl and we have much to talk about, I didn't see a problem since there was nothing going to happen between me and my crush. I am looking for a relationship anyway and also it would be nice to focus those feelings on someone esle and get to know her. Big mistake.

Both girls are friends and the first girl told the second about what I confessed to her that night. The second must have taken it badly and thought that I took her as a ""second choice"" or that I was trying to make the first one jealous. Anyway, she texted me the day before the planned meeting (a date at this point) and called me a jerk and a player. She also said that she hates two sided people and that it was a jerk move. I was baffled. It never occured to me that this situation might happen. Yes, it might appear that she was a second choice but I never intended it that way. I tried to explain myself and that it is just a terrible misunderstanding but the damage is already done. Not only that, if it spreads, I might be known as a player and girls will avoid me. I am definitely not a player. I have never had a relationship and I lost my virginity a month ago (the only sex I have had to date). I apologized and still feel bad. Both for her because she must have felt terrible but also for myself because I lost 2 girl friends in the span of a day and damaging information is being spread about me.

When he was young I made sure to give him special attention and to hold him quite a lot so he’d be more likely to be fond of people.

It just seems like there is a real stigma against guys who own a cat and somehow it’s taboo and that if they post a pic with theirs, much less even own one they are automatically seen as weak beta males. Not even sure why. I wouldn’t ask this if I hadnt seen it on many girls profiles where they “can’t do guys with cats.” 

So I guess it’s almost forbidden to even admit you own a cat, if youre a guy. 

Personally, the girls who have appreciated that over the years have seemed to be just a different kind of type. A really good type.

Some context about me( 23F) so you can understand why I’m writing this. 
I’m a african woman who was born and raised in Northern Europe(Sweden) 
When it comes to dating and relationships I have never had issues with that since most of my relationships have been with Northern Europe men. I’m seen as attractive by the larger mass of people here, and it sounds so ego speaking about yourself like that but it is important in this context. I’m tall and very skinny wich is the norm here.

But what I constantly see online is black women, usually from the US write an repeat that black women are undesirable. They keep repeating that black women are unwanted by men and it just really upsets me that I have to be put in the same category as these women who keep demeaning themselves. I have never experienced being undesirable or rejected but it feels like they are so adamant in reinforcing that. 

And of course there are people who might be racist or just awful people who also say these things. But I have seen white/latino/black and asian guys compliment black girls and a black girl will literally respond, “No, we are seen as to bottom of the totem pole” like…can’t you just accept that people find you attractive?

And maybe black women, sometimes it’s not because of your race. There is other factors that might make you undesirable. 

Body shape/ body type and of course weight, a lot of you are overweight so that will be a problem.
Behavior and way of speaking.
Dress sence and other things that might ad to guys not being attracted not your skin tone. 

Because this black women and undesirable thing has now gone globally and is just upsetting to be put in a category that I have never experienced.

A few might be upset by what I’ve written but that’s just how I see it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1011801,public,self,Desirability and black women,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppz10q/desirability_and_black_women/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I (M24) have been a serious relationship kinda guy my whole life. After a tough breakup 2 years ago, soon followed by the pandemic, I occasionally dipped back into the dating scene to try and find ""the one"", but didn't have much luck with that.

This time, I met someone (F28) who I went along great with and was really attracted to, but I just couldn't imagine our relationship working long-term. So we decided to be friends with benefits instead (her idea). Since I hadn't had sex in 2 years, I was stoked. 

We finally met in person after texting for a few weeks, and ended up in bed about an hour later. It went great, we both really enjoyed the experience and I was looking forward to repeating this a couple of times.

Unfortunately, just two days later she texted me that she'd developed feelings for me which she thought she could suppress, but just ended up making this more difficult for her. She said it's probably for the best to end all communication so she can move on, which I agreed to.

I couple years ago when I was 16-17 I was working at a supermarket with the mentioned girl. We always talked with eachother and had fun there, after some months she messaged me on Snapchat. After some time of talking I was realising that she was dropping hints of a date, and that she was interested in me. I chose to ignore her advances because I was a bit scared of going on a date with someone, as I never had a girlfriend back then, so I sort of stopped talking to her.

Now looking back at this I realise that I was an idiot for being scared. Now I still follow her and see the things she posts, and a part of me regrets not asking her out. So yesterday after 2 years I sent her a message to start a conversation again, and so we’ve been talking again. Now the problem is I’m not sure if she still has these feelings for me, and I would like to ask her to maybe hang out some day, but I’m not sure of when to drop the question. Should I do it now and not waste time, or is it too fast and should I wait a couple of weeks?

Also I’m not sure what an ideal place for a hangout/ date is? I was thinking of something active like ice skating, there is a place nearby where we could go.

We went out, had a great time together and even made out at the end.

For the first time since my breakup last year, I felt light and genuinely happy that I was dating again.

We both kept texting, but I found that when she texts, she seems a different person than when she is in real life. Meaning, she would take a long time to text at times, but it seemed that she wanted to keep in touch. I adapted to the way she texted and invited her to dinner last Tuesday.

She said she couldn’t because of work, so it was postponed to the weekend. I said it was absolutely fine, there was no need for rushing things. And I meant it. I even asked her if she liked Japanese food, she said she loved it and so I said “I’ll take you to a great Japanese restaurant then. Trust me”.

A few days went by where nothing was said between us. I decided to text her “good morning” on Thursday. Got no reply. And now it’s Friday.

It’s the third time that I’ve thought she has ghosted me, but it seems like it’s for real this time.

Bear in mind that if she doesn’t want to meet me or talk to me anymore, then that’s absolutely fine. Yes, I’m not a fan of ghosting people, especially after someone says that they would have dinner with you, but at the same time, people change their minds and that’s totally fine too. I’m in no way trying to blame this on anyone.

I just wanted to vent a little, because I have difficulty dealing with this. I really wanted to be with this girl again and just talk with her. I wanted to explore this feeling a little more, since I lost a lot of trust after my breakup and wanted to feel excited for dating again like I did last week.

I would normally send a text asking whether the dinner would happen or not, but I’m trying to learn that if someone doesn’t text you, it either means that they are too busy or most likely they are just not interested in you anymore. I’m trying to teach myself self value and so, if someone thinks that I’m worth it, then they will reach out to me too.

I want to reach a point where my brain isn’t constantly battling my emotions, but rather my emotions feel the same as the way that I think. Meaning, if my brain is telling me that I did everything I could, then I want my emotions to feel the same way. And right now, they don’t.

It also doesn’t help that I saw my ex-girlfriend last Sunday (at a wedding) who has been dating someone for the past few months. I’m happy for her, but it still stings a bit.

The convos are still running smoothly, you're making even weirder jokes, and that awkward laugh of yours comes out. He is thrilled, not disgusted by it, and you laugh even more. You realize how easy it is to be comfortable around him. You demand more cuddles. And so you cuddle into the night. At some point, you realize he has a boner from all the cuddling, but he's still taking it slow. Very gently, he lowers his hand from your waist to your leg, ""accidentally"" touching your butt in the process. But you like it. You want him to squeeze it. But he doesn't. Your mind goes crazy over the fact he's not gripping you as hard as you'd like. But it's not because he doesn't like you. It's because he's taking it slow. And so, your mind goes crazy over getting touched by him. You want more, and he's very slow.

The date ends with a more passionate kiss and you wish each other a good night. Throughout the next few days, he chooses one day for a date and immediately asks you up front about your schedule, while also keeping some casual small talk active. He's now become a person you're gonna send texts about whatever funny/weird happened to you. Now you're getting connected. The texting never dies, but is kept on a casual level. No burning topics discussed, if possible, leave that for when you meet live. Just casual and carefree. 
 
The third date is a bit more romantic- he takes you out to a dinner with live music. You're enjoying the meal, the music, and his muscles as you lean against him and enjoy the atmosphere. You're chilling. At some point he turns to you and says something along the lines of ""I like what we have going on. I think we're compatible enough to be committed to each other and I want you to be my girlfriend."" You're over the moon now. Of course you'll say yes.  And so you do. A smile runs over his cheeks all the way to his ears as he leans in for a kiss and locks you in a hug. You spend the night enjoying each other, the music, and the food. After the date ends, he expresses how happy he is to be with you. He makes sure you get home safely and sends you a barrage of hearts for good night (or something, whatever)... 
 
Still, no sex. It makes you wonder and makes you crazy - do I turn him on enough? When will he take me to bed? The way he treated you so far made you feel so good in your own skin that you just want to share that feeling with him. You want that sex, and you want it bad. So far he's done nothing but make you feel good, comfortable and safe. He's observant of your reactions and knows how to react to you. He knows what you like and what you want- he wants it too. So why is he waiting? 
 
You're not there yet. He values your intimacy and wants you to enjoy it to the fullest- he's not gonna rush it. He too , wants to know just how vulnerable HE can be around you before you two get to perform sexually. He's not gonna risk any awkward accidents at that stage with someone who could wound him severely over it. He wants to know he can trust you, and he wants you to know you can trust him too. Sex has to come in a relaxed environment, and if that's not there- tensions will ensue, and you're not really gonna enjoy yourself, unless you zone out. That's not good sex, and he knows it. He wants you to be able to laugh and enjoy yourself while being in your most vulnerable position. And until that level of trust is there, you two won't have sex. And that's okay. 
 
By the time you two do have sex, you'll be crazy from waiting. You will want to be all over him. And you'll probably try to, because waiting has made you crazy, and because you've grown so comfortable around him, you'll have no problem trying out all the funky weird stuff that's been clogging your mind from the first moment he touched you. You don't worry about his reaction, because you already know his reaction.
 
With those two cards at hand, you're sure to have sexual chemistry. All it took for that was ensuring the level of trust and comfort is reached before you act on the impulses sent by your dysfunctional amygdala.

If they don't like someone out of boredom, or there are problems within the relationship, or they see a new shiny person there is no incentive to remain in a relationship. They do, however, have to deal with many unsolicited attention and many bad crops to get the ones they want. Their standards are obscenely unrealistic. Many love the idea of the marriage but don't actually want the marriage, or the man for that matter.

Last night after sending me a cute selfie she asked if we were ever going to meet up IRL. I told her I’d love to do that this weekend. However due to the fact that we live about an hour away from each other I suggested meeting somewhere halfway between us, and even gave a suggestion of specific places we can go to. She refused those options, and would like me to drive all the way up to her town, one that I’ve never actually visited ever, and didn’t give me a specific place to go to, like any particular restaurants or activities or anything . 

To me, this sounds ridiculous. I don’t know this person and she wants me to clear out my schedule to drive to an unfamiliar town for the chance to meet her, and even then it doesn’t guarantee that we’ll like each other or lead to additional dates with her. She’s not putting in the kind of effort I’d like from a prospective date. IMO if you want to meet someone that is a considerable distance from you, both people should coordinate a way of meeting halfway between them so not one person has to travel a significantly longer distance for a first date.

I was initially attracted to him but slowly as I got to know him more I’ve seen quite a few “red flags” in my book that have given me the ick. I often get the ick in new relationships when they are just starting out so I initially ignored it and pushed through it, got over it and things were going well. I now have the dreaded ick again after initially getting over it. He’s a really great guy, seems like a genuine good person which initially attracted me to him. But from day 1 he has been kind of pushy to make things official which is usually not my style. I like to be more casual about things and take it slowly usually to prevent rushing into things and awkwardness surrounding a relationship that “went too fast”. He’s made it clear that he’s very into me and even “one step ahead of me” in our relationship but I keep flip flopping between being all in and regretting making things official which makes me totally uncomfortable. He seems slightly insecure because he’s constantly asking me if I’m okay or if somethings wrong and I feel like we’re having this conversation at least once a week. Which, to me, shouldn’t be the case especially in the beginning of a relationship. Hes 1 year younger than me and I can see his immaturity coming out in some ways surrounding his expectations in this relationship. He’s very possessive which is a HUGE turnoff to me , for example we went out with his friends last weekend and his guy friend had his arm around me because we were chatting and he literally yelled at his friend and “had a talking with him” about touching me. Which I thought was ridiculous and turned into a huge drunk fight in which he kept me up until 6 am demanding that we “fix it and talk it through now” in which I said let’s talk about it tomorrow morning when we’re not drunk anymore which I thought was reasonable. He then proceeded to start crying and I was so repulsed by him. He also says the cringiest things like “I like my night nights before bed” referring to us saying goodnight to each other either over the phone or text every single night. I literally feel like the guy in this relationship and he’s always acting like a needy clingy girl. We’re constantly having this discussion too.

I've become much more successful with women this last year. Learned the tricks, became more attractive, dressed well, and socialized correctly. However, I've not had a single real lasting relationship, and I'd like to give it a shot, though I struggled finding someone I could connect with. 

Well an opportunity has appeared. 

There's a girl, with whom I share what seems to be unreasonably high compatibility. We've met eachother a long time ago, but we only really got to get to know eachother very recently. She's already part of my main friend group, she and I are both very witty in conversation and often start joking and laughing sprees, last time we went together in a group, she non-stop complimented me on my appearance and smell (I dress formally and use cologne, even in casual social events, it's become a habit), the two of us were very much flirting, and a lot. And we talked about our dating struggles and difficulty finding someone to connect with (very cheesy, I know). It all felt very natural.   

This all came as a bit of a surprise because she and I share an unfortunate (but brief) history. That history is:

1. She used to be a very close friend's crush. The two of them are still on very friendly terms despite the disappointment my friend had with her. 
2. She lied to another very close friend that we shared about the fidelity of his girlfriend, and then pretended to not know anything when she saw my friends and I comforting him following the breakup. 
3. As a reaction to her lying to my friend, I confronted her on it, in front of him, and though I believe my words were justified, they were harsh. And I thought at the time she'd never want to speak to me or my friend again. 

And yet, she repaired her relationship with my friend, re-entered our friend group, and has been nothing but kind, friendly and flirtatious to me since. 

Under normal conditions, our history would immediately cross her out as a potential partner, without even a second of thought. Yet she left such a strong impression on me as of late.

When a lot of guys approach women out in public, they are outcome focused first and foremost— a number, an eventual hookup, or sex is the objective. Of course, those are things we all want with a beautiful woman, but the problem is this objective-based mindset forms the basis of the conversation.

In this frame of mind, you are seeking something from her, which puts her in a subtle position of power of over you. The whole purpose of your interaction was contrived so that you can receive some form of validation from her. Guys get nervous approaching with this mindset because it frames the interaction in a way that he inherently believes is bothering her, it’s essentially a sales pitch.

If you see a beautiful woman, and she really sparks something in you, tell her without expectation. See where things go.

“Excuse me, I just have to tell you that you are gorgeous, and it made my day seeing you out and about here”

If you really feel it, are smiling genuinely, and aren’t overly nervous, slightly playful, most women will be pleasantly shocked. Most guys they encounter aren’t as bold, or if they are, are usually trying to hit on them.

She may smile, it may lead to a conversation, she may scowl, there are several potential outcomes. But outcome doesn’t matter when you are in this mind frame. Being bold enough to tell a woman that she made your day while having fun and not being concerned about the results is a powerful and freeing feeling.

It just has to be authentic and not a canned line with an intended result. And yes, it can be scary being that vulnerable with a stranger, but if you focus on trying to give them a positive experience where they wonder, “Who the fuck was that?” in a good way,and you walk away with the same level of confidence no matter how they respond, your overall interactions will be more positive.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1012077,public,self,Men’s advice.
