16,paj6ru,1629793691,found out he had a gf 2 months into dating,"Met this guy on Bumble and he seemed too good to be true. We went out for a month and decided that we were dating but not exclusively yet because we didn’t know each other well enough, so we’d give it some time to decide. 

Turns out this whole time he had a girlfriend who’s currently overseas for work. He lied to me about his past relationships (said he’s been single for a year) and when we had the “what are we” talk he told me that he isn’t a fuckboy because he’s been truthful to me about everything the whole time. His house had 0 traces of a girl presence. 

I found out because he left me at his house while he went to run and errand and I was watching Netflix on his TV. There was 1 other profile on it which was his girlfriend’s full name. I searched her up on instagram and the last post was in May, it was a couple of pictures of them celebrating their 1 year anniversary. 

I confronted him about it and he told me that actually it’s an open relationship agreement. He said they’re allowed to do flings, so initially he kept it from me and as things progressed he didn’t know how to bring it up, and also because he started liking me he’s breaking the rules of their agreement. 

I believed him at first but he started deleting our messages and that’s when I realised he was just flat out cheating on her and had 0 intention of ever telling me. She’s due to come back in a few weeks and he’d probably break things off with me then. 

I’ve messaged the girlfriend on multiple platforms and she hasn’t responded yet. I didnt want to get involved but I decided to reach out to her when I realised he was trying to clean out our chat history. 

It’s been a wild fucking ride with this loser, but i’m glad I found out sooner than later.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/paj6ru/found_out_he_had_a_gf_2_months_into_dating/

Oh, I believe in yesterday... 

Well first time this song has ever hit home and connecting with every lyric just hurts, I'm sorry for anyone else who has also felt this.

Went on 2 dates with this amazing girl that went pretty much perfect. We were talking nonstop inbetween, perhaps it was all a little too much too soon but everything was great and then next day.... bam something just seemed off, texting changed and was like something just clicked for her and it's no longer the same :( 

All I can think of is she somehow found out I went on a date with someone else, I've (M24) only been in first proper relationship at the start of this year everything being a new experience with girls for me and it ended messy because I dived into that relationship way too quick saying yes to the girl I wasn't sure on that wanted to swoop me up ASAP.

I just didn't want that again and wanted to be sure this time atleast meeting a couple different people first... not that she asked to be exclusive or anything, but was saying stuff like all she could think about was me and I said the same back  which was the truth but I forced myself to explore other options.

Could be its not that tho, maybe she's just found someone else, that she's got personal stuff going on or that she's just not feeling it anymore... but guys seriously it was all amazing, we both continually expressed our feelings towards eachother and how great the dates went and it all just seemed to suddenly change...

I've realised in the meantime how much she meant to me and that I've gotten pretty attached feeling distraught in the way things now are. I'm still in touch with her and just about communicating but don't know whether to just give her space? Confront her on this? Open up to her, or what really?

With things feeling so strange between us now I'm not sure whether to bring up 3rd date? But perhaps would answer my question?...

Also when is a good time to stop seeing other people, should it be when you go on these types of perfect dates and everything seems right?

How do I break this habit?","Like  the title says, I just straight up ignore any girl I find attractive.  This also occurs with nearly everyone else…but it’s even worse with  girls I think are cute.

I don’t  look at them. I don’t glance. Eye contact is something that I never,  ever allow. Talking to them? I feel like my brain would literally just  turn to mush if I tried.

I try my  best to just pretend they don’t exist. I think it may be a combination  of not wanting to be a creep in any way whatsoever while also thinking  that there is entirely no point in even trying because of low  confidence.

Even if I seem to be  getting the vibe that a woman is also attracted to me or maybe is  throwing a few hints, I keep up the same behavior.

In  the past, I’ve only ever had anything with women when they’ve literally  thrown themselves at me. I’ve never asked a girl out. Never approached.  Never really even flirted.

Occasionally  it’s occurred where I need to talk to a girl I like because of life  circumstances (e.g. school, work) but even then I just do my best to  stay as platonic as possible and I try not to convey any interest  whatsoever because again, the last thing I want is to come off as a  creep.

It’s even difficult to be  friendly sometimes cause I’ve had instances in the past where I  genuinely was friendly but then got labeled a creep…and I could never  really figure out what I was doing wrong.

Idk,  I guess I just want to know how to break out of this and be social with  women without this overwhelming anxiety that I’m going to just be a  negative interaction in their life.

At first when I started working id say Hi and all and smile at her even leaving and saying good bye. but now it just seems I can’t really get to talk to her

She does work in the front of the shop but towards the end of night helps in the back and I try to start a convo with her but she seems just to lurk back to the front or just not near me long enough to strike up a convo

I recently heard her and another girl talking about some guy that are hot but didn’t get to hear to much of the convo

Im just curious to know if she’s nervous around me or just doesn’t want anything to do with me like I said everyone else I can joke around with an have a easy convo

Bc I don’t see them as someone I like.

Just don’t wanna go to ask her for her snap or something and get rejected and make it awkward to work with.

She is pretty hot so it makes it that bit harder for me bc I just adore her, I also go to the gym every day and are quite fit and healthy so I wouldn’t call myself like Unattractive but Im not like gods gift.

I just wanna know what peoples thoughts are and if I should pursue or just give up or is there anything I could do to try benefit me.

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pam3ek/need_help_knowing_if_its_worth_perusing_this_girl/
39,pamff4,1629808454,Sick and tired of being abandoned,"I'm just so tired of getting hurt every time that I fall in love or even just like someone. I don't know if there's something wrong with me but literally every single time that I get into some kind of relationship, or just start dating a guy they ditch me. I liked 6 guys in my life so far and all of them did this to me. The worst thing is, they are all very interested in the beggining, sometimes even more than I am but they just get bored of me, I guess. I feel like my self esteem is getting low because of this and I am afraid of falling in love again.

Recently my boyfriend of 2 years(who tried so hard to be with me, even after I rejected him once) broke up with me literally out of nowhere, before that we were in love, or at least it seemed like that. When I realized I was ready, I went on a date with a guy and we literally talked for 4 hours and then ended up making out, we really vibed and he used to text me all the time afterwards, seemed very interested and then just stopped.

I know that I am too sensitive and that I fall in love and get hurt easily, but I don't know how to change this. I feel really bad and embarassed, but I needed to rant somewhere. Please help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pamff4/sick_and_tired_of_being_abandoned/
40,pamky4,1629809044,would you prefer to look better irl or in pictures?,"# 

you see, i am 30 year old and i am just getting into online dating and i need good pictures to show on my profile. i was never much of a take picture kinda of guy.. just because i've always been insecure in photos. and recently i am apart of group where every time we meet up we take pictures together. i go through the pictures and i look UGLY in all of them.

taking selfies and even getting professional photograph doesn't do me any good. I have a crooked flat big nose which is more visible in pictures. i have uneven face with crooked teeth as well.

now, in person i've been told i am handsome, and the general consensus is i look good in person but when it comes to photos HOLY. what explains this? how do i know attractive physically i fall into?

some might say it is better to look irl than in pictures, but is it really? everything is shown through pictures. pictures on dating , picture on IG/social media, photos in everything.

irl only happens AFTER the photo.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pamky4/would_you_prefer_to_look_better_irl_or_in_pictures/

42,pamlk7,1629809108,"He ghosted, but still keeps tabs on my social media ?","Me and this guy were sneaky links to each other. I enjoyed him while it lasted . The reason why it ended , he said he was trying to work things out with his ex. I was hurt a bir because I think in my mind I was hoping it would turn into something more . He apologized and just  said he knew I’d find someone and get everything I deserve. I moved half way across the country and we somehow reconnected again. He said things didn’t work with his ex and he was single again. It was a casual convo then turned sexual. I had a bit too much to drink that night and we began to sext each other on Snapchat. He said he missed being with me and we basically were having cyber sex (I guess that’s what you’d call it) at one point he saved one of my photos and I asked why he did that and he said he just wanted to look at it whenever he wanted to but he unsaved it once he saw I was concerned. 

He asked a few days later if I was worried he’d show people because he could tell it was a concern for me. He said he wouldn’t do that and how he understands because he wouldn’t want his stuff out there this I thanked him &amp; we just continued. We had been doing that for 2 weeks straight and began making plans to see each other in person again. The next day I snapped him and he ignored it. It was just a “wyd”, I figured he was busy . Later that night I sent him an nude. He opened it and never responded . Days later I just asked if he was okay. Still no answer . It’s been 4 days and I just texted him and jokingly said did my photo scare you away still no answer, but he would always view my IG story. 

He just started a page for his dog &amp; he followed me through the dog account . It’s a bit weird and confusing to me lol . Why is he acting like this ?

43,pammo8,1629809214,Is it possible to cheat on someone you love? Even if you were just getting revenge?,"It makes no sense to me. 

I know this married couple who were obviously a joke, because they tried to be hypocrites when confronted about the husband sleeping around on his wife with someone to get “revenge” from her cheating 2 years ago, the husband was a pathological-lying lowlife and tried to pull the victim card and that the person he slept with was crazy. 

Surprisingly enough, the wife fell for his bullshit and I’m guessing she has for 9 years.. and even went to the point of defending him when he contributed equally.

She was suicidal for a while after she cheated, that was the only difference.

She claims they never divorced because they “loved” each other and couldn’t live without each other.. sounds either like a financially-bound marriage or some sort of weird toxic shit going on that they can’t seem to get enough of. 

He buys her lots of shit and he needs her to raise his kids so I highly doubt there’s anything there except his fear of getting divorced and financially drained. Who knows.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pammo8/is_it_possible_to_cheat_on_someone_you_love_even/
44,pammzm,1629809249,Friends or more?,"Going to try and keep this brief. I'm 32M, she's 29F.

I'm divorced. Technically like a month, but there's a 1yr mandatory separation period in my state and I haven't seen my ex since she moved out, 13mo ago. We were married less than 2 years.

I started seeing a girl in November. Met her through work, got along great and things seemed to be going well, hanging out every week, were intimate etc. I felt her start to pull away and blow off plans, so I asked her if she was still interested and she wouldn't give me a straight answer and I probably put too much pressure on the relationship too soon. 

Cut things off and we don't talk for a while. Few weeks later, we're back to texting and being friendly, but nothing more. Over the next 6 months, I've gotten mixed signals constantly. I consider us good friends now, but there have been times we've gone out and she's been all over me, we've made out multiple times - the last being 2 weeks ago, but haven't had sex since last fall. There were phases where she'd invite me out with her friends and such a lot for a week or 2, then we'd go several weeks without seeing each other. Lately, we've gone out to dinner a few times, kissed the other week, had what I consider a ""more than friends"" relationship. However, I know she had just gone on a couple dates with another guy that didn't work out, is currently on a trip with some GFs and a guy who she says she's not with, and hasn't made any indication she's interested.

Im am horrible at reading signs and can't tell if she's interested. I asked a generic question the other day and she responded that she was single.

I guess I'm not sure how to go about asking if she's interested in more than friendship. I value our friendship, but I see the potential for more. we have some differing ideas about what we want in life, but there is certainly a connection that feels stronger than friendship.

Do you think she's interested? How do I ask her? I mean we go on what I would consider to be dates often, she's never balked at me if ive put my arm around her or kissed her, but hasn't been as forward as she was last fall when I know she was interested.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pammzm/friends_or_more/

We went out on our first date a few weeks ago and it was amazing and we saw each other a few days later. It's been about a month now but we've seen each other about three times. On our first date we ended up in his truck talking for hours and it was like high school all over again. We both have our own places but we knew if we went to one of our places we would've had sex and neither of us wanted that at that point. So while we were talking we shared some pretty intense stuff and was very open... By the end of the night after we were both at home I texted him and said I was nervous about us being more physical because I know I'll get attached and he said he felt the same way but we both still wanted it. The thing is part of that conversation he told me he wasn't sure if he wanted anything serious and he wanted to meet me and see if he was ready to be with another woman bc his last relationship ended about seven months ago. I told him from the beginning I just wanted to see where things would go and I wasn't going to just jump into anything either well obviously he's freaking wonderful and absolutely my kind of perfect. I never told him this but I think he knows how I feel about him. He also text me every morning and night and we talk throughout the whole day..He's in therapy for his PTSD and those days I never expect to hear from him but I do. He always text me and the next day he calls and kinda talks to me about his session and I feel like he trusts me and I appreciate it so much. I'm trying to keep boundaries as in I don't ask to many questions, I give him space, I don't call or text him late in the evenings after we say goodnight but I can't stop thinking of him. We make these plans to try new places together... When I see him I just melt and he is just so kind and he makes me feel so secure. Every now and again he'll tell me not to fall in love with him and I should see other people bc he doesn't want to block anyone from really loving me the way I deserve and I said ok....I went on a date. I didn't tell him till a few days after and the look on his face was shock and sad but he asked me how it went and I was honest and told him it was terrible. It really was bc I was just not into it. I was thinking of him. And he kissed me and said he just wants me to be happy and I asked without him and he's like no I want to always be a part of your life and now I'm confused.... We say we're just friends and only friends but I don't treat and talk to any of my other  ""friends"" like this like at all. I mean there's a lot of other details but that's pretty much the gist of it. I want to just cut it off especially if nothing is going to come out of it but I cried so bad just thinking of the word to say to him if I did. I think we are both stepping into grounds that we didn't see coming and don't really know how to react. I just don't know how to take everything. I'm trying to be patient bc of what he's going through and not to get political but everything with Afghanistan is really affecting him bc he's lost a lot of friends and family over there while he was serving so that's another reason I'm trying my hardest to be patient with him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pamnoz/were_just_friends_but_i_think_were_dating/

52,paoghj,1629815355,Yesterday's dating experience self reflection,"Long text incoming:

Today I was on a date after a long time (1,5 years approx.). We went to a nice place and got red wine. The girl was pretty. The type of pretty that she looks alright without makeup, but amazing with makeup. She wasn't wearing any makeup, which I wasn't expecting. 
Throughout the conversation it was apparent she didn't wear any to convey a point : ""this is the real me, like me or don't"". I found that attractive.

Additionally, amazing body. Curves where you want them. In other words, boobs and boooooty big time. 

As we spoke I started to like her less and less. It was like hearing every cliché after another. Ofcourse as you might've guessed she is into astrology, she grabbed my hand and was looking at the lines,... At this point I knew I don't want to have anything to do with her. 

Initially I was going into this of considering a serious relationship. I thought I am at the point in my life when I want to settle down, but I realized that's not really what my life needs yet. 

After realizing I don't want this to be a relationship I completely loosened up, opened up and told myself at least I'm going to get some nice kisses out of this. Going to be nice to kiss a girl again after more than a year and half. 

I could see I impressed her a lot, started to hold hands, eye stares, etc. You know the usual. 

To give you a time perspective, we sat there and talked for almost 4 hours. I did enjoy some moments, shared some of my intimate issues, she did too. By the end I got a meal, she didn't want to eat so just got a bite out of mine. 
I paid. 

We decided to go sit by the river. The walk there took around 10 minutes. By this point I can see she is pretty tipsy. We sat there for maybe 40 minutes. We came there holding hands. We didn't even get to sitting down, her tongue was already in my mouth. I forgot to mention she is a smoker. In those 4 hours she managed to smoke a pack of slims... I am completely against smoking. Even though I do smoke weed lol. But no tobacco for me. 

Kissing a smoker is disgusting first and foremost. I actually pulled out and made a joke about it. We laughed. Sat down. 

We kept on talking, kissing, cuddling,... And the most curious thing happened. When I was this upclose to her and after all the things I heard, she completely lost her attractiveness. 

One would think that a 24 year old single man's brain is going to be at least thinking of hitting that eventually. But, I completely lost the desire to sleep with her, which I didn't expect at all. 

So I told her that at this point in life I'm not looking for a relationship. I was straight forward, we talked about both perspectives, but she kept on convincing me that we should give the relationship a try. I don't want to hurt her and say NO like that or give the impression that I went out with her just to sleep with her(which isn't true). 

We than came to an agreement. She understands my situation and respects it and appreciates that I am honest about it. 

I got her a cab, kissed her goodbye and went home. 

Now I am only hoping she is not going to try to make this a relationship. 

What I learned from this experience: When you are not dating for a while, at some point a time of peak hornyness and desperation comes. At this time it is not that hard to find someone, because 90% of them are at the same spot in life and that's how you find each other. However, if you don't click, you realize that it is not worth trying, forcing and pretending just to get laid or to BE in a relationship just because of peer pressure from society. In other words: Don't force a relationship because at your age you are expected to be in one. 
It is much more worth to not force anything that's not meant to be and eventually you will find someone the natural way. 

Although, that doesn't mean you should now sit on your ass doing nothing and waiting for some miracle to fall in your hands. If you don't try it won't happen. Just don't try because of: ""I should be in a relationship"". 

This is my first time reflecting on a date with written text. It is an interesting experience, I encourage everyone to try it at least once. 

Cheers.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/paoghj/yesterdays_dating_experience_self_reflection/

I dont really feel like having best education, best clothes and being super fit solves issue as my older brother of 25 got everything and still says that learning how to pick up made the biggest difference for him.

67,paqa5s,1629821043,"I have an 'all-or-nothing' kind of attachment style, but because of that, I've been severely hurt. After 4 years, now I wanna start dating again. Any advice?","Bad experiences definitely ruin a lot of things when it comes to dating and life, something similar happened to me as well. I was 17 (I'm 21 now) when I realized it was never gonna work out with this amazing girl I had a major crush on. It's safe to say that I was starstruck, but even though we were closest to each other we never ended up in a relationship. She did do a couple of things that were straight-up manipulative and I was left feeling worthless.

After that, I went to college (depressed of course) to study Computer Science and actually had a pretty decent time in college (bachelor's). But I didn't date anyone... I was too scared to get attached to anyone again and get completely destroyed. For some reason, it felt like I was doing injustice to the feelings I have for her too. So, I kept studying, building my self-esteem back up, working on my confidence, and basically trying to stop 'self-loathing'. I was constantly telling myself that I wasn't good enough just because it didn't work out once or twice. That I'll never be good enough for anyone... all that shit. Now I'm personally in a better place and I feel relatively good about myself, still a lot to do on myself but I'm getting there... one step at a time. I've completed my bachelor's with good grades and I'm going abroad (UK) to do my master's in VR/AR.

Now I know what I want... I want intimacy and connection (hopefully from the same person, lol), but I'm too afraid to even let someone in again. I feel like what if all of this happens again? What if I fuck it up once more? I don't want myself or the girl to get hurt because I know it sucks. I know it's a necessary risk, but I am afraid ngl.

Here's a bit about myself: If I had three words to describe myself I'd go with... ""considerate, resourceful, and wholehearted"" pair that with being a flirt and you'll get the basic idea of my personality. Now I get it if they're not the most fun traits but if you consider long drives, stargazing, sunset/sunrise, cooking meals, surprise gifts, compliments, and making out in different places other than just the bedroom sounds fun to you... then I think you'll find me interesting. Physically, I'm a 5'7"" Indian guy (and before you say it... no, I'm not gonna ask you for bobs and vegana on Instagram, haha). Anyways, so I like to take care of myself. I've gained weight during the lockdown but now I'm getting back on track as I used to work out in college. I dress well, so I'm told, and people tell me I'm more of a cute guy than hot, which I consider a compliment. I think I'm an average-looking guy and I try to make the best of what I have... so outfits, confidence, personality, and education.

I'm thinking of trying casual dating to eliminate my fear of attachment (or rejection) and have some fun, live my life. I mean I'll still get rejected a lot of times but at least now I'll have a positive attitude towards all that. And it could help me get started again as I kinda want that... a good relationship. I personally think that long-term relationships are a good fit for me but like I said I'm afraid that I'll end up getting hurt and/or hurting someone again. So here I am posting this seeking some advice from people of any and all genders, races, sexual orientation, and age on how can I bring myself to start dating again?

How should I mentally and physically prepare myself for short-term dating?

Should I go for online dating platforms as well? And what I can do to have some success there?

I know it's going to be hard, dating is difficult, but I wanna get out there and I wanna enjoy and be happy. I think everyone deserves a bit of happiness. &lt;3

86,pashhp,1629827682,"My (29M) Boyfriend Broke Up With Me (24F), and I Cannot Seem to Cope","So, just over a week ago, my (24F) boyfriend (29M) of nearly one year broke up with me--and I cannot bring myself to accept this. He picked me up for a date from the train station, and he took me out for dinner, and right when I was to go home he asked to chat. He pulled out a dress he had bought me that he was intending to give to me in September when I would start my new job, but decided to give it to me as, through tears, he said, ""I am giving it to you now, as I don't think we'll make it that far."" (context: he's 30 and I'm his longest relationship...).

I was devastated and shellshocked. I felt that after months of some rather unhealthy communication issues, and me starting a positive journey to combat my mental health issues, I felt we were finally on a right path for a good progression of our relationship. I love him with all I had, and I wanted to do whatever it took to make this work!

We both had toxic tendencies when it came to resolving conflict: I want to discuss things in the moment, causing me to overstep boundaries, and he would shut down and become defensive, giving me the silent treatment for days claiming it was ""just the time I need to process my thoughts."" With almost every tense discussion, I felt that it always ended up with me feeling guilty for bringing up something and I would end up apologizing, even though I was the one that felt hurt from the start. Even today, he'll never agree that he had this toxic behaviour, or how it may've played a role in this end instead of just my issues. He said he felt I magnified every issue, made issues where there didn't need to be, didn't value his perspective/mental health, and didn't provide love in a genuine way. This hurts because I feel like I tried so damn hard to take his thoughts into account, and all of my gestures were genuine! He said he just couldn't try anymore, and has felt ""heavy"" from the negativity and the putting in all the effort he could.

I never met his family and I always had a hunch it was because he wasn't as sure about me as I was of him.

I know this sounds silly, but the thing is, I fear I will not find someone who will be as thoughtful and kind as he was..He drove an hour in the rain at night to pick up a dessert I could eat when I had my wisdom teeth surgery, he'd drop off snacks at my house to cheer me up when I was sad, and he'd thought of the most thoughtful Christmas gift that I'll never be able to receive. This fucking kills me.

And not even a week after this excruciating discussion, I was told he's already back on the dating app we met on...I am conflicted because I know we aren't the healthiest match right now, but I cannot seem to stop obsessing over the most beautiful moments we shared. How can I heal, please help me! :(

87,pasntc,1629828189,(Serious) are dating apps really even worth it anymore?,"I (f 20’s) haven’t been on a date or had sex in almost TWO years. I cut things off with a guy right before the pandemic, and haven’t really connected with anyone IRL ever since. 


I live in a big city all by myself, no friends or family, and have been here for almost 3 years.


I’ve never felt so awkward, socially anxious, and alone. It’s starting to get to me. I work from home, so that doesn’t help in regards to connecting with people &amp;amp; socializing. I’ve also been feeling physically unhealthy, but to be honest I blame my health issues on lack of social stimulation.


Physical touch is something I crave so badly, but I also don’t believe in hook ups and fucking strangers.


I just want to find a guy who is mature, will have sex with me after warming up to one another after some time, and loves giving and receiving physical and emotional affection. Someone who will show up and be there for me and vice-versa. Basically a relationship lol.


Okay okay, aside from some health issues, I REALLY feel like I’m ready for a relationship, after dedicating myself to self-growth, traveling, and living alone over the last so many years.



I just sit here and wonder if dating apps are safe &amp;amp; worth the time at this point. I’ve only met weird and off people on apps, and gave up a while ago, but am reconsidering.

89,pasxfz,1629828976,Dating Same Girl 3 Months. Old Flame Heartbreak Flare Up. Need Attention/Validation From Others.,"Been dating this girl for about 3 months now. We never actually discussed or affirmed exclusivity, but with how many dates we've been on, we talk -- about 3 every other week because she has kids -- it feels like it's almost an ""exclusive by default"" time frame. Plus we talk every day, adding to the weight of it.

This is basically exclusive stage, right? I feel like it is, and it feels wrong to try to worm my way out and pretend it isn't and I'm totally within my rights to continue using Tinder and talking to other girls because there was no ""actual conversation"" about being exclusive.

**Anyways... here's what's happening and why I'm here in need of advice....**

Right before I started seeing this girl, I had some heartbreak a few weeks before with an out of state friend who I thought was really into me, but wasn't. I got over it quickly by using Tinder and talking to girls. 

Talking to girls, having them be interested in me felt really really good. Crazy good. It got me over the hump and I really didn't care about the friend rejection after about a month of attention from other girls. Just talking to them and going on casual dates.

Well, the feelings for that old, out of state friend flared up HUGELY and basically overwhelmed me with emotion when she closed the door... FOR GOOD.... on any chances with her. We're just friends, she doesn't feel that way about me. OUCH. 

The door was ""left open"" before now. She was ""thinking about it""... which, at the time,  was obvious code for ""not interested but I'm being nice"".

I'm facing the emotions of the rejection as best I can, but I have to be honest, the girl I'm seeing is not cutting it for me. Is it that I cared way too much for the friend and haven't faced those emotions OR that I don't care enough about the girl I'm with?

I want to feel like I did when I was on Tinder right after the initial friend rejection, talking to a bunch of different girls... drowning out the thoughts and feelings until I'm whole again. It really helped. I felt wanted, validated. I felt good. I felt ""hey, if you don't want me, that's fine, there are plenty of women who are interested, you're loss!"" I want that feeling again.

Also, I dropped 20lbs and am looking better than I ever have before, and I imagine I would have even more success on Tinder too and I want to find out.

But here's the thing.... in an attempt to make myself feel good, I don't want to make her feel bad. But the process of not making her feel bad, keeps me in this loop of sadness and thinking about the friend rejection.

**TLDR**

Old heartbreak has flared up again. Need validation and attention from females to get over the hump again. Girl I've been dating 3 months, who is really into me not helping like I thought it would. At 3 months and with my emotions in such disarray... am I obliged to tell her what I'm doing? Feels wrong not too, but I don't want to hurt her feelings... likewise, I don't want to remain sad just to keep her from being sad.

I've been talking to this girl for a month. We've been on two dates. Whenever we talk on the phone or interact in person, my brain feels certain this is someone that actually likes me.  She would project into the future, remember things that we talked about, hint she wants more investment, complain about things I did or didn’t do etc.  

However, the moments in between calling and dates, when we have to text, everything points to her being barely interested. This is because she often takes 24 - 48 hrs to respond to messages. To be fair, whenever she does reply, the reply is never half-arsed.

It's hard for me to believe she is as interested as she seems when calling and on dates when she leaves me hanging for a long time. This is especially since I don't even text to have conversations, I just text to ask if shes free to call or hang, so its mostly just yes/no answers I'm looking for. If anything, she's the one that actually sometimes initiates texting to 'share thoughts' like you would in a conversation. Even then, she would also take 24 - 48 hrs to reply after I reply to her initial message.

98,patt8k,1629831624,How to help someone in a relationship?,"I'm currently in a relationship with someone who has lots of previous experiences of domestic/sexual/psychological abuse, and i just dont know how to help them anymore. 

I love them with every ounce of my being, and i really do want the best for them, but i'm just not sure how to help them heal and i was hoping that some of you could help. 

They struggle eating, sometimes skipping days at a time, which is due to a very bad personal image and very low self esteem. I try to support them in everything that they do and reassure them everyday that they're perfect and i love them, but i want to do more than that. I want them to believe it themself. It hurts me to see them like they are, and i just wish there was something i could do to help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/patt8k/how_to_help_someone_in_a_relationship/
99,patxmj,1629831981,Met an interesting girl but im not ready to date,"Not really a question.. Just sort of a rant. Met a really cool girl on Tinder last week. She's hot, funny, interesting, and fun to talk to. We are sending each other literal paragraphs already and pretty much constantly texting, but today I realized that with work and school, I probably wont have time for her. I still have so much work to do on myself and I can't see how I could possibly juggle it all in one hand and someone elses needs in the other. Probably wouldn't be fair. I got on Tinder for small talk, maybe a hook up.. Didn't expect to actually find a real connection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/patxmj/met_an_interesting_girl_but_im_not_ready_to_date/
