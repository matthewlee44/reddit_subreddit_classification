Our egos are weak and this is due to a terrible upbringing or an inability to be out of our heads.

We develop infatuations on women and put them on pedestals and treat them that way.

When they say no we immediately rush to convince ourselves that they’re stupid and shit so they aren’t in the pedestal anymore and so our ego is protected

Talking about my disability is uncomfortable because pre-determining reactions is impossible. I will admit to not knowing anything about my disability so that's also another why talking about it is uncomfortable. 

I don't ever want to feel like my identity revolves entirely around my disability. I want people to see that there's more to me than my disability, but I struggle a lot with putting these feelings on the table. 

I've been single since the start of 2020 so it's been a while. But I'm just so terrified/ uncomfortable with having to talk about my disability with someone that I avoid dating altogether.

This feeling comes a lot from past bullying and views on disability when I was diagnosed at 14. People were a lot more cruel then.

12,ny0z3l,1623482005,Get denied so much that you stop caring about getting denied,"I'm finding it really helpful to just stop giving a shit about rejection and instead just ask what you want without the fear of getting denied. If you never ask you'll never know. I know it's been said a million times but it's so true, you'll literally never know what she/he is going to say if you don't open your mouth. 

I recently asked two girls to go out on a drink with me and both said no, and happy they said no. Exactly at that moment that I was denied I took a moment to feel what I was feeling and said who gives a shit, on to the next and it felt amazing and I want you to feel amazing as well. People love honesty and find it sexy. Be sexy. 

The things you're fearful of is exactly what you need to be doing, it's going to free you from the crutches your mind places on you. 

I'm by no means immune to denial yet and it's a constant practice. Some days I'm better than others (especially after a beer or two haha) but it's a mentality that is in constant practice because this concept apples to more than dating.

So... Here's the deal.
I (24M) just got out of a very demanding relationship and I'm kinda looking for... Dates ? I guess. Nothing too serious in any case.

I'm an average looking dude, I have good manners, hygiene and clothing. When my friends talk about me they tend to say that I'm a charismatic and knowledgeable man.

However, despite being a ""datable"" guy, I can't seem to attract any women at parties. I'm kinda shy and ooening out to people is a real challenge to me.

I'm kinda lost when it comes to dating and I just feel like I  never learned what to do or what not to do. 
How do I even talk to a woman without making her incopfortable ?
How do I tell someone that I like them ?

Women notice me, they talk to me. That's a fact.
But I seriously can't do more than ""talking"" because I' deeply terrified of making them feel unease... So I shut myself out.

26,ny2ke3,1623488770,How to break the cycle of situationships?,"I’m a recently turned 26F and I’ve been single for just over 4 years. I’ve previously had 2 long term relationships before I lived in London. I moved here when I was 21/22 and have had one situationship EACH year up until now. They usually last 2-5 months. Always start the same, the guy and I click, they make a lot of effort, arrange thoughtful dates, and then eventually they stop progressing and stay quite stagnant. 

They’ll end by the guy breaking it off with me (first one was in love with an ex), the second was also not over his ex (didn’t find this out until quite late), the more recent one felt we didn’t have a spark, that was last year. Currently I think I may be in another one, but I’m not sure.

Recently I noticed he stopped arranging dates so often and I thought he was creating space. Instead of jumping to conclusions, I stated my needs and said I’d like us to keep making regular plans. He responded very well which I took as a good sign. He asked to meet up and talk about it, he said he’s sorry about the plans and that he wasn’t doing it on purpose. He said he wants to keep making plans, we made some on the spot, which happened on Thursday. Since then we’ve not made more, so I guess I’ll just wait and see. We’ve been seeing eachother since April. 

He did tell me in that chat that he was a little guarded because he was broken up with suddenly last year by someone he’d been dating for 6 months. He also said he’s got a busy summer and is worried that I’ll be hurt if he doesn’t make enough plans with me. He cried a little bit when he realised he’d hurt my feelings.

I could be wrong but I feel like I’m heading down the situationship route again. 

How do I stop this from happening? It’s a painful cycle. I had some therapy and identified that I was initially going after emotionally unavailable guys, but now I don’t think this guy is emotionally unavailable? And I think he has a secure attachment.

I (still) have a hard time understanding why they needed to break up with me when our relationship has always helped us through many difficult times in life. 

I tried to be their friend but It was hard because I was still very in love with them. Every single second as a “friend” was torture since I was deeply hoping that we’d get back together. When they couldn’t give me an indicator if they were open to seeing me romantically in the future, I started being incredibly anxious and overwhelmed with feelings. I projected all my fears onto them and talked about how insecure this breakup had made me and after a few back and forth of villainising me despite my pure intentions, they decided to go on separate ways permanently.

It hurts me that they seemed ok from going from fiancé to friend and then to a stranger within 6 days. I feel that for all we’ve been through and all that I’ve done (won’t go into private details), I’ve been made to feel that I wasn’t enough and this breakup just affirms that anxiety. 

I’ve always been a confident, secure and sure person. I feel like they’ve broken me and I can’t go back to the me that was so happy and sure a month ago. 

99% of me still wants them back, but i don’t know what to do about that.

Another part of me think it is time I focus on me. Because I deserve better than someone who cherry picks on me when all i want to give was love.

I get so flustered and nervous. We have known of each other since i was like 8 but we never actually talked until he joined in with playing video games with my brother and his other best friend. I always thought he was cute but he was always my brothers friend to me. I didnt think id develop into being kinda interested in him for his character. Its just so embarrassing they way ive blundered my brain just stops i hope my observant brother doesnt know. Im not sure how to process or what to do. I feel like i am behaving so irrationally and its just so unlike me. Im very careful about controlling my emotions and this is so crazy of me to do. 

This is quite possibly the first healthy crush Ive had, one born out of genuine interest and not like for attention and validation, or me making up a character in my head. But logically speaking I barely know him. But his calm and confidence demeanor, intelligence,  and humour is attractive and admirable to me. We also some interests. But i just know this is not gonna work lol. There are so many reasons why not. Im not mature enough or grown or polished enough as a human being. Im aware I have a lot of growing do to before I can healthily maintain a romantic partner. HE IS MY BROTHERS BEST FRIEND NO. I am just a kid in their eyes, im their best friends sister. He could be aromantic, doesnt seem interested in love and is more interested in hobbies, i have never heard any dating rumours about him, but then again im never very up to date with gossip. I could go on. 

Its hard having a crush on someone unattainable. I'm  never this irrational and this is possibly the worst real crush to have on someone. I am close to me brother so im praying to everything anything that he doesnt pick up on my emotions and writes of me being weird and flustered off as me being an extremely socially anxious person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ny459p/first_tiny_crush_in_7_years_and_its_on_my_older/

Yet a couple of days ago I ordered mistakenly ordered takeout to the office on my day off. She messaged me, naturally ridiculing me for making such a dumb mistake. Going into collect it wasn't really an option so I said she could have it if she wanted. She thanked me for it and that was then end of it until about today. She messaged me saying she hoped I would order takeout for her again soon. I passed it off as a joke, but then she replied calling me totally oblivious and telling me she was hinting at something.

Okay. So I (24f) think it’s super weird and unnecessarily hard to make friends as an adult. Co workers sometimes turn into friends but not really. All of my real friends from childhood are all scattered out so ultimately I have no one to hang out with on a regular basis. I don’t have other women around to just go grab a bite with or a drink or go to each other’s houses or things like that… why is it so hard to find a friend. And don’t get me started on dating!

37,ny4jmh,1623496835,First date went well but unsure how to feel about it now,"Most people will probably say ""wait and see"" because at this point, the situation is unclear but I'm still going to ask advice.

I'm 39 and yesterday, after a long dating hiatus, I went on a date with a woman I met on Tinder that's 40 and has 4 kids. I don't mind women with kids. Been in relationships with such ladies before and I usually get along with kids just fine.

The date went well. There were no awkward silences and after we had a drink or two, we went for a super long walk in the park, at night, in the dark but she didn't seem to mind (it was her idea)

I noted a few signs of interest:

\- She laughed at my stupid jokes. Or when I made facial expressions that are funny, she laughed too.

\- She didn't really flick her hair, but I did notice she fidgeted a log with her bracelet.

\- She didn't mind when I put my hand briefly on her arm. No pulling back, but I didn't leave it there for long either as to not make her uncomfortable.

\- She talked... and talked... and talked a LOT. I listened and she looked in my eyes for long times while we talked

\- She leaned in closer on the table on multiple occasions and didn't seem to want to stay distant.

\- She told me afterwards that she had a good time and enjoyed the evening

\- When I told I enjoyed it too and asked if she wanted to go on another date, she said yes (though it'll have to wait till July because she has the kids till then)

\- We actually kept talking way longer than planned. On multiple occasions we were like ""ok time to go home this time. This reminds me of that one time where...."" and she went on talking again. Which I didn't mind

\- Towards the end of the date, I said I felt like hugging her and she said that I could. So we hugged, she rubbed my back and we both agreed it felt good after such a long period in covid-confinement. I jokingly told her I hoped it didn't feel too awkward when I asked for a hug but she said that no, it was fine but that if I had asked to kiss, she wouldn't have agreed (which I can kinda understand on a first Tinder date)

All this sounds kinda positive right? Well a couple of things make me hesitate. 

During the date, she said she didn't feel like that instant ""click"" and instant chemistry or infatuation, but she did add that she believes in love that can grow more slowly over time. And after that she did also say ""if you date me, please do keep in mind I have a lot of baggage I carry"". She told me about it and she did go through a few things. She didn't ahve an easy live and she also added that she was wary of online dating because she was massively disappointed when a few first dates ended with the guy just wanting sex and admitting he's married... but she seems like a strong woman because she's living a normal, productive life.

The fact that she said this does indicate that she doesn't find the idea of dating me impossible.

After the date, since we were both with the bike and it was really late (past midnight, we really had a longer date than we thought) I asked her to let me know by text once she arrived safely at her house. She did let me know. I told her again I had a nice time and would like to have another date with her in the future. She said that the date felt like it went really smoothly, as opposed to other dates she went on, and wants to go on a second date too, but she also added that she's conflicted about those thoughts of instant chemistry/infactuation VS love that can grow.

I told her that I just had a good time and that I would love a second date and that we'd just see how it goes from there.

I know I can't do much more than just let it flow and see where it leads us, but did I fucked up somewhere or would you say this is pretty much a lost cause? I mean if she suggests being just friends, I'll kindly decline because I have enough friends and I'm interested in a romantic relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ny4jmh/first_date_went_well_but_unsure_how_to_feel_about/

Considering what they read / see / hear about negative experiences girls have with guys in the media or how they are taught to be super cautious , suspicious around guys, etc, one could argue that they have all the reasons in the world to avoid guys and simply resort to fancy sex toys, pets and friends for company and for the more adventurous and liberal you can even experiment romance with other girls.

I was SURE there was some chemistry, but the problem is that when things become ""too hot"" and I feel there is mutual interest I become an observer, and I feel like freezing. I dont have problems with friendship with a girl, I have lots of female friends. But the problem is when I feel interested and I feel the interest is reciprocated, I panick. I know I can make some move, but I feel ""rigid"". If a girl touches my arm, for example, I freeze and I can say the fear makes me hostile. I dont do anything hostile, but there are some bad vibes that people I think unconsciously chatch. I feel judged and I feel rejection scares me so much that anticipating rejection makes me angry. So girls dont like angry vibes and every time I go home knowing that I could have ask a number, danced, kissed a girl if she was ready for a kiss.. and I feel bad because I push people away. Sometimes when a girl touches me I feel startled and jumpy. So the girl feel rejected and rejects me in return.

48,ny5vk9,1623501652,When a normal relationship feels wrong.,"-reposting bc r/relationships deleted my post-


Just posting here to see if anyone else has ever gone through this or felt this.

I (25F) am with the man (25M) of my dreams, the man I wanna marry and am going to marry. I love him, and he loves me. He treats me how I always wanted boyfriends in the past to treat me: respects me, listens to me, shows me he loves me every day in many different ways, gives me space when i need it, does everything he can to make my happy, the list goes on and on. He’s perfect for me.

In the past, every single relationship I had was bad. Toxic, full of manipulation, deceit, cheating, and I was most affected by being abandoned over and over. I still slightly suffer from some of the effects of abandonment, but my current boyfriend never makes me feel like he’s gonna leave me and I do feel secure with him. 

This relationship i’m in, in my head, doesn’t feel like a “relationship”. Because to me, relationships were always full of negativity, anxiety, chasing the man and him chasing me, toxic games, etc. I know logically my current relationship is “normal” and how it should be, but in my head it feels abnormal because I’ve never had anything like this.

It’s not a problem necessarily, I don’t doubt my current relationship at all. Sometimes I just think about how different it feels, and I scare myself that something may be wrong with it, but I know it’s not.

I now fully understand why some people choose to be with toxic people, and run from relationships that are healthy. I’m not planning that, I’d never leave my boyfriend unless something horrible happened. But after a few unstable relationships it really is all you know, and that’s your normal.

50,ny632e,1623502399,Any advice or opinions on how to maneuver this situation?,"Hey hey, okay so obviously it's my decision whether I want to try or not but I'm asking for some opinions on the following situation and how I should proceed from here.

Two months ago I (M20) met this girl (F21) online during lockdown, she doesn't live in the same country I live in but she'll come working here very soon so this wouldn't even be the main concern. Since I wasn't really looking for romantic relationships online, rather connections in general cause I felt lonely during lockdown at times, I didn't really prepare for this to happen. But I met her and we got along very well. Since neither of us really went into this looking for a relationship (we're both single though) it was never something we talked about. Still... we called a lot and I think I let myself go a little (hard to know whether she'd say the same about herself). And given that during lockdown I couldn't really see my friends that frequently (I usually mainly rely on them with my attachment needs) I felt lonely and that girl kind of washed that all away. Which is also why I noticed that I'm too dependent emotionally and in terms of my needs on her (even though it's ""just"" an online thing).

Okay so to get closer to my actual question... she's been acting distant lately and that could be because of the exam stress for her but those are over now and I don't feel like that changed. I noticed that I've been feeling very anxious about her being distant and checking how long she takes to reply and stuff. The usual ""anxious attachment"" kind of things. I'm guessing though that this is connected to how dependent I am on her in terms of my needs (for the past two months at least). We did have a conversation about that two days ago where I told her that I've been feeling anxious and also worried about her cause I felt like she's been distancing herself. She didn't deny that but she was genuinely surprised and told me she didn't really notice she was distancing herself and apologized for making me feel anxious (where I think it's not necessarily fair for her to apologize cause this is more about me but anyways).
Lockdown is slowly being lifted here and I'm allowed to meet my friends again, met them for the first time in ages yesterday, and while being with them all the anxiety was completely washed away and especially the dependent feeling too. Now that I'm back home I feel like I'm in lockdown mode again and the anxiety creeps into my brain again. But I'm optimistic that meeting my friends more often from now on will really help me.
To get to my question now... she's been acting distant maybe cause we've been getting closer to each other (which is nothing more than my narrative but I feel like it's true) and I'm usually more of the avoidant kind of person in terms of attachment so I only really developed this anxious style during lockdown. Meaning, especially when she said she didn't really notice how she was being more distant, I felt that and I could relate but I also know that during a time where one has this avoidant mindset, every attempt to get close is exactly what pushes them away because of their fear.

After giving it a lot of thought I think that I do genuinely like her beyond the dependancy I developed during lockdown. I have no idea whether she thinks the same about me or not .. maybe not at all but what I want is clarity and also if I shoot my shot, I want the best chances possible. Meaning if I was in an avoidant mindset personally and someone asks me out I'm out of there despite maybe wanting it (= low chances if I'd ask right now)
I'm not saying my chances are high, but I want opinions on how you'd maneuver my situation? If she distances herself even when she didn't really realize that... she's implicitly communicating that she needs distance meaning my plan would be to rely more on my friends again now that I get the chance and give her some time and distance. And then maybe after some time ""shoot my shot"" or at least tell her that I think I like her and ask for her thoughts on that and on me/us.
What do you think is the right thing to do? And how would you maneuver someone being in that avoidant mindset? (assuming that's what it is, maybe she is just distancing herself in general cause she is not interested)
And do you think there's already damage done due to me communicating that I feel anxious? (Something I was worried about)

63,ny8ha2,1623509524,I stood up for myself for the first time but broke no contact and need tips/motivation on not doing it again - please help :(,"Hi, 

I started seeing someone and we hit it off really well a couple months ago. Our dates were typically 5-7 hours, he had a lot of green flags, and I truly felt I could be myself and be appreciated for who I was around him. He told me some pretty personal things, valued open communication, wasn’t afraid to be vulnerable, and listened and supported me through a really tough meltdown. He seemed to really put in the effort. As someone whose love language is quality time, this was a pretty special connection for me. I had never felt that same amount before with anybody else! He told me directly that he liked me and I said the same later. 

Long story short, he suddenly withdrew and stopped talking as much, saying he can’t make any commitments *at all*. I chalked it up to him being sick and busy and also stepped back and kept myself busy with other things - but he still said he wanted to continue to talk/hang out. This felt better until it kept continuing and I realized I was increasingly becoming an afterthought. If I didn’t start the conversation or suggestion hanging out, I felt like he wouldn’t nor would he mind never seeing me again. It was very very low effort on his end. After thinking about it, I sent him some messages saying that while I really enjoyed our connection and it was special to me, I think I deserve to be treated better, especially since when I said I liked him back, I said it doesn’t have to be serious or get labels, I just want what we had to continue and he agreed. I felt pretty disappointed when he treated me SO well and didn’t communicate that he actually didn’t plan on continuing it (when he said he would communicate clearly about everything). Anyway, I said I’d rather rip the bandage off now if this is how it’ll continue to be. And if so, good luck and I wish good things for him. He never replied. 

It’s been a little over a week and I know he’s seen my texts. We are still Snapchat friends and he’s been active on social media. I previously had deleted his number and blocked his Facebook, but last night I felt so sad and hurt over how I was treated. I wanted answers and felt really insecure. I texted “Hey, can we talk?” around midnight and he hasn’t responded. I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t but I really need advice/motivation on how to not do that again. 

So far, here are the various pieces of advice that I’ve been given:
- I did that right thing because I deserve someone who puts as much effort as I do. If he really wanted to, he would do so like at the beginning when he was trying to get me on his hook
- He has issues of his own that I am not responsible for. He may have great green flags in the beginning, but the overall red flag of him being different later is concerning and wastes time
- its ok to grieve because it came out of the blue and I didn’t have time to prepare for it, whether he was official in my life or not. If he were to say for some reason yes it was fake and he lied the whole time, that won’t fix anything
- acknowledge the pain 
- take this time to focus on yourself 

Personally, the most effective ones are the arguments that I can use to talk myself out of not contacting him again, but then the hopeful part of me also tries really hard.

I knew there was going to be a lot of screen time in a long distance relationship but I didn't sign up for the first four years of our relationship to be 90% Discord calls. We were planning to move in together sometime mid to late 2021 but that has been delayed until God knows when and honestly I'm done.

I love him with all my heart but that only goes so far. I need physicality in the relationship.

I don't want another year and a half of this. Honestly speaking, if the dating subreddits weren't full of horror story after horror story of how bad dating is these days I would have ended things 8 months ago so I could see whats out there.

However I've never picked up a girl at a bar before; right after I turned 21 COVID happened so I didn't get a chance to gain experience. As I've discussed before, I had opportunities to have a girlfriend before but screwed them up due to my struggles with depression and social anxiety. Having finally overcome those obstacles and put them behind me, I just want to go out and have fun with the opposite sex. 

Does anybody have advice for this? In previous interactions with women I didn't really know how to flirt, partly because of my strict upbringing. Now I'm more comfortable complimenting girls on their hair, clothing, etc but since I tend to be a serious person I'm also trying to work on coming across and as happy and funny but without overdoing it.

93,nycfp2,1623520772,I had my first GF on accident.,"I did date someone younger, we both were grade 7 and I was grade 11. It happened when she came with me to watch the sunset at the school rooftops when after the theatrical practice when I ordered 3 boxes of pizza. One for the theater, one for those who asked, and one for me. Then we were last alone so I asked if she wanted to watch the sunset with me in one of my secret spots. She said yes so, we went to the school rooftops restricted to students. The sunset was beautiful The scene was like those you see in movies so I chuckled and jokingly said along the lines.   
 

“What a beautiful sunset...”    
 “Hey, do you like me?”   
 

I was expecting she would say no like they usually do so I’d shrug it off like a regular conversation, but nooo,   
 She said with a small pause “Y… yes...”  
 So i was shocked and also surprised.. So then I thought it was a joke so I said... “You sure?”  
 She then replied with a firm, “YES!” anime style.  
 At this point in life I didn’t believe in courtship and leaned on more to “If you like each other, date! If it doesn't work out, then that’s it. None of the trying to convince you I’m a good person bs.” type of dating. So, I blurted, “you want us to be a thing?” And she replied with a straight face “Yes.”   
 

“Cool. I guess I have a girlfriend now” I said to myself while my first thoughts in my head was... “I wonder when we’ll break up? 5 minutes? tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Eh… I’ll just enjoy it while it lasts...  
 

I offered her a pizza slice, then We both looked at the sunset peacefully as a new couple   
 ... until she remembered she forgot her sister was waiting for her.  
 

Long story short,  
 She was my first GF, I knew it would end sooner or later cause she was young, I loved her whole heartedly nonetheless. It was sweet and I had a decent experience. She got cold 2 months later and on the 4th month, we broke up in campus.  
 

After that experience. I realized I’m not mentally, and emotionally mature for a romantic relationship.  
 I still miss her form time to time, and I was thankful for the experience.  
 

people still saw me as a pedophile since I sold brownies and gummy worms to elementary and highschool.  
 

But I didn't choose her because she was young.  
 

Being honest, she was the first to admit to me she liked me (like first time ever), so I just grabbed the opportunity for the experience.  
 

So that’s my story on how I accidentally got a girlfriend.

So I was on the train last Monday and I saw this beautiful lady. I'm 31y and i hate dating apps so I walked straight to this girl and made my move. Just told her she had very beautiful eyes and that I wanted to know her.

She was really happy and all smiles told me she was flattered and all we've chatted a lot then when we left the train station we kissed and we added each other on Instagram. I don't know if this matters but she's 24y and i told her I'm 31y. We texted each other that very same day and she told me she arrived safe at home. I replied her and she never replied me back which felt like a first red flag but fine. A day later I texted her again just like ""Hey how's things"" like 8 hours later she replied and told me she was fine and asked of i was fine, I then replied her and again she didn't there was no ""seen"" on my texts as well. This time i didn't text her again, she was checking all my stories.

Today she just blocked me on Instagram and I don't know why :(

Is it that wrong nowadays to start things like this? I mean if she didn't want anything she didn't have to kiss me or anything. I was polite and respectful.

95,nyclkm,1623521246,Why do younger women seem to like me more often?,"I'm a male, 25 years old, and tend to feel attracted to both older as younger women. Age doesn't matter too much to me as long as it's within boundaries. To sketch the situation, that does mean I can feel attracted to women of 16-17 just as well as to those of 28-29 or those of my exact age, if their behaviour is attractive to me.

Over the past years, I've tried multiple ""dating apps"". Some of those were also available for younger people of 16-18. As of today, most (if not all) aren't anymore. 

Dating apps are highly biased towards women, as we all probably know. It's not easy to be successful as a young male, and I know that. Getting a decent amount of fruitful likes/matches is really, really hard for most men. Even for a (as far as I know) reasonably decent looking and sociable guy as myself.

However, when I used other apps years ago where I could meet younger people (also some considered under-age nowadays), I got plenty. Literally hundreds of ""likes"". Well, obviously I'm way too old for that app now.

I wonder, why did I use to get so many matches with underage women when I used to be just over 18, while now these apps are purely 18+ (which is pretty well understandable), I practically get zero?

Lower competition from other males? Being valued higher as a ""grown up"" versus a minor? I'm curious how this works in the female reasoning.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nyclkm/why_do_younger_women_seem_to_like_me_more_often/
