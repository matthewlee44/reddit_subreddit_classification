0,qas8ri,1634580246,Communication in a Relationship,"As the title suggests, how much communication is important in a relationship, specially in the early stages (4-5 months)

While I know it's a subjective opinion and differs from couple to couple, I wanted a general perspective.

To give you a context, me and my girlfriend live nearby (20 mins away) and meet twice a week. Initially we just met, and texted to make plans. Overtime, we started with goodnight/goodmorning, and flirts here and there.

Then we started talking on call, with it ranging from daily to alternate day for 1-2 hours (all of this is in addition to our meets).

While I understand that we've grown closer and hence feel the need to talk more, sometimes it makes me feel the value decreases and after a point there's not much to talk.

For eg, there was a week we met daily. Then we met 5 days later. The happiness of seeing each other after a gap of 5 days was substantially higher because of the gap.

So my question is, while I'll let the conversation flow naturally on how comfortable we are, is maintaining a little distance normal and healthy?

One part of my mind wants to create small gaps so we enjoy talking more and have more stuff to talk after absence. 

The other part of my mind gets anxious and starts feeling if we go long period without talking, the feeling will fade away.

tl;dr:- Communication in a relationship and create a small gap to keep it interesting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qas8ri/communication_in_a_relationship/

5,qaskn7,1634581169,"25M, never really dated before recently. Been on a couple dates with this girl [25F] and I'm unsure if I'm taking it too slow?","For background, I had depression during my later teenager years and put on a lot of weight. I moved around in my early 20s and never felt settled enough to start looking. I started losing weight and gaining confidence and then COVID happened. So I have basically 0 dating experience, haha.

We met on a dating app a few weeks ago. Since then we've been on two dates, and one looong (nearly 10-hour) study session (I graduated from a program very similarly to what she's just started taking) together. We haven't really done anything even remotely intimate besides hug at the end of that study session, and she gave me a small gift bag of snacks and stuff as a thank you for helping her so far. We have another date tonight.

I'm just unsure if I'm going too slow. She says she's not really sure what she's looking for right now, and I'm okay taking it really slow (I've been patient this far haha) to see how she feels. We text every day, reply to each other right away, video call etc. 

The fact that we're going so slow makes me unsure she wants a relationship. But the fact that we're still going on dates and talking so frequently gives me hope. I just dunno if I should try and be more intimate with her (I'm honestly a bit touch-averse :\) or if I should just continue with our slow pace, or if she might lose interest if I do that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qaskn7/25m_never_really_dated_before_recently_been_on_a/

She did mention she was only looking for friends since she wasn’t ready to date but I didn’t care. I just got matched with a hot chick who was into science. So we’ve been talking for about two weeks and I asked her to go out for coffee. She told me as strictly friends and I said sure. 

We talked for about 2 hours and we both decided to go home. I asked for a hug and she gave me a side hug. Felt kinda rude but whatever. 

I asked when we could meet again and she told me she has a very busy schedule. How busy can you be, you’re 19. 

I decided to escort her home and ended up waiting for her to go in. I had a little session in my car and ended up staying till I think she went to sleep.

She wrote that she’s a demi sexual but I never heard that term before.


We started talking and her personality was just humble , funny, wise and calm.  We were so chatty and interactive not something typical I get from those dating apps.  

We felt like we needed to see each other immediately, so I asked her if she had free time to go out and without even hesitating, or making me plan everything, she just requested me to meet her at this beautiful park for a walk, very simple of her. 

We  met,  gave cheek kisses to each other and she suddenly spontaneously hugged me. I felt like my whole body was tingling  and I was warm and flushed. 

I never experienced this  sensation with any hook up before.


We kept talking to each other and looking at each other deeply , until  we found out that 2 hours passed. It was getting cold, she said it was getting dark and decided  to start walking towards the exit of the park to return home.

I remembered that she mentioned that she’s demisexual so I asked her about it, she told me that she’s still a virgin and didn’t feel like anyone felt right yet and it’s impossible for her to feel aroused to the point of being penetrated by someone she’s just seen in a day. 

But she told me that she always wanted to try something .. She blushed then looked deeply into my eyes again.

I felt like she felt pretty safe around me that’s why she felt comfortable telling me. 

She told me, looking at my abdomen , that she always wanted to feel what a penis would feel like in her hands, and she always felt fascinated by how sensitive that area was for men and asked me if I felt okay if I would let her experience this sensation, but without me touching her in any way. Just her. Feeling my penis.

I accepted I felt comfortable too around her

We sat in the back seat of my car,, we started kissing, she was so sensual and soft with her kisses on my neck, 
I took off my pants and she saw my big erection. 


Her pupils dilated, and she put her little cold hands softly on it and began feeling it, of course asking me first if I was okay with it. And I noded and was almost on verge of moaning. 

She began kissing it so gently, then licking it until she reached the tip. I won’t elaborate more about the event but God I was in another dimension. She left me shaking, the feeling was so good I never wanted her to leave,  I never felt this sensation before in my life. And I never expected this timid beautiful girl to be so sensual and making me orgasm just with the soft touch of her lips.

I was still dizzy from the feeling, she kissed me gently and got out of the car leaving sedated.

I usually see him when I walk going to my dorm (we walk pass by each other). I notice him since I already thought he was cute when I saw him in Facebook before. I’m not sure if he recognizes my face, but I’m 99% sure that my face doesn’t look familiar to him even though I see him since he probably doesn’t pay attention. 

I don’t like him, but I have a crush on him and would like to get to know him more. (By looking through his social media, it seems like he doesn’t have a girlfriend). 

On the note I plan to give him, I will write that I saw his Facebook post before, and I started to recognize him once we came to our dorm. I will ask if he has a girlfriend and that I’d like to get to know him more if he’s willing to. I also plan to leave my number on the note and say that he can text me if he is interested.

Recently I connected with a woman through a dating site, we exchanged numbers and started texting. During conversation we were discussing shared interests and she sent me links to her IG. I checked them out, continued the conversation and didn't think anything of it. Then she asked me for my IG and I told her I had deleted during the divorce. Same goes for Facebook too.

I tell her I don't have either and the conversation just stops. Next morning she texts me saying it's creepy I don't have active social media. That it indicates I'm sort of weird loner or have some crazy fucked up secret to keep.

I never cared for either and only joined up to make my wife happy. Nearly all my activity was liking and sharing her various posts. I just don't want to live my life on public display pretending other people care what I had for lunch. So when things ended I deleted them along with all sorts of stuff associated to my ex wife. 

But none of that mattered to her so I'm fine with not going further.

This just feels like one more thing I'm going to be constantly judged on when dating these days and it's really flipping silly.

I gave up on tinder and have been using hinge for awhile now, and usually get about 2-3 matches a day. Getting #'s is successful, and as the title suggests, the person is very eager to meet me for the first time.

I dress alright, not like suit level but I don't look like a bum in sweats. I make sure I'm showered, smell good, look myself thoroughly in the mirror, keep my phone in my pocket on silent and go into the date on time. I listen, let her come up with topics as equally as I do, and never try to force a physical move unless it just feels right, such as if she is close to me when we are leaving and a hug would be good.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 0-9 so far this year. 9 first dates, and every single one of them had a response afterwards or a few days after struggling conversation that was something along the lines of ""I don't see this going anywhere"" or ""I don't think you are right for me"".

It sounds like she is playing freaking games and I have been straightforward with her. I asked her why she didn’t tell me she had a vacation invite before. She said “I am a popular girl.” Lol! Now, I’m starting to put 2 and 2 together and it is not equaling 9 but 4.

I asked her to help me since I had almost no clue what I was looking for.

36,qav9t9,1634588762,I [M20] am not sure how to approach a girl in the gym / advice needed!,"So in my gym there is a girl which I think is very attractive and I'd like to approach her. 
Normally outside the gym I'd just go straight up go to her and approach her. Of course it needs some courage for me to do that but it is nothing impossible.
But in the gym I somehow think its kind of weird to approach a woman because in most cases you will seem like a creep. I feel like woman are not comfortable with being approached while doing their workout in leggings and/or tight clothes. I think in those cases it just seems like I'd just chose her by her trained ass. You get what I mean.
Thing is sometimes I don't like to be approached by other people whilst doing my workout either (they usually ask things mid set which I think isannoying) in the gym so I totally understand that woman don't go to the gym to be hit on by men whilst doing their workout.
I don't feel comfortable with any kind of way of approaching her because I clearly don't want to seem like any kind of pervert or something. 
Do you have any advices what I should look out for while approaching her to not make her feel uncomfortable? 
Or is it just me who overthinks this whole situation?
Don't get me wrong I am not scared of being rejected or something like that I'd just be very pissed if it's because I've made her uncomfortable in this situation.

So I recently went out with a girl to a football game for our 2nd date. We go to the same power 5 school and were playing a conference rival for control of our division. It was a sold out game, and we won tickets on the 3rd row at the tailgate. It as honestly a pretty good date up until halftime. 

Her friend called to see where she was sitting, but after a few seconds she switched from English to Spanish. She then starts telling her friend how she had gotten a Snapchat from an ex and she would have ditched me to go hook up with him except for the fact the ticket office had our IDs as collateral for the 3rd row seat tickets. She also said she never would have gone out with me if she had known he had wanted to hookup. Then, she ended her phone call and went back to grabbing my arm and being all cuddly. She even tried to kiss me when the game was over. 

I never let her know I understood everything she said to her friend. But I also don’t plan on ever going out with her again. We’re not dating so idc who she hooks up with, but the whole situation made her seem a little toxic. 

So yeah, never assume people don’t understand you just because you’re not speaking English…

55,qaxges,1634595638,Advice on picking between chemistry vs compatibility,"I'm in the fortunate yet unfortunate position of having two great potential partners to pick from. I'm 31F. One of them (33M) I have greater chemistry with, though the compatibility is more of an open question. The other, (38M) I think I have more compatibility with, however the chemistry is an open question. I'm having trouble figuring out which to prioritize... and would love to summon reddit to hear about everyone else's experiences from this, especially anyone who has picked one over the other and how the decision turned out later.

For the one I have great chemistry with, we laugh a lot together, we like to have fun the same way, and the physical and emotional attraction to one another is through the roof. Things are simple and fluid between us. He has a good job but his approach to life is a bit more ""go with the flow"" which makes me slightly weary because I want stability as I do want children eventually. He does too, but he isn't as concrete about his plans. He is a good communicator though and shows good emotional maturity which I appreciate. My biggest concern is being able to see our 5+ year future at a glance. (I'm a bit of a planner but also like spontaneity). 

For the one I have seemingly great compatibility with, we work in the same field and have a similar approach with how we plan our lives and careers. He is a go-getter and knows exactly what he wants. He has a great career with a clear path on where he is headed. Our chemistry is not terrible, but it could be better. I don't laugh as much when I'm with him and while he is a sweet and empathetic person, he is a bit more serious of a person. He is ready to settle down with the house and children, etc. I wonder if our chemistry could grow over time. Will I miss the passion by settling with stability?

56,qaxn7v,1634596214,Pure Luck: How I got a GF when I gave up getting a relationship in College...Story &amp; AMA,"Pretty much, I moved into college the first year and started going to parties with the mindset of every horny freshman. After several parties and failed attempts, I had little to no success in the first 2 weeks. Once school started to pick up, I was like F\*\*\* it. I'm just going to focus on myself and have the best f\*\*\*ing college experience of my life and get wasted every weekend while talking to as many girls as possible. With that I started binging Trailer Park Boys late at night. (Great show, 100% should watch) Little did I know watching that show eventually caused me to stay up late missing one of my classes. 

One day, after binging the entire season 7 of Trailer Park Boys in one night, I overslept and missed my first class. I ended up having to attend the next class session. I got in the class, and I just randomly sat down. After class, I was just about to leave to grab lunch when I noticed some familiar people in a group gathered around the teacher after class. I talked to them and we each introduced each other, exchanged numbers and formed a study group. In this group there were 3 girls and 3 guys including me. We got lunch and we vibed pretty well, talking and sharing stories about ourselves. Then everybody starts to leave, I walk with 2 girls and they each were going into separate directions. I chose the other girl who had I felt was different from any other girl I've talked to before. We talked while heading to lunch and Idk it just felt right. We sat next to each other, did some work, talked and I thought nothing of it. We hugged, I left going back to my regular class time.

In my other earlier class section, I started to realize it was really boring. So I made the permanent switch to the class where we had formed the study group earlier. I met up with the group again, had lunch, talked. This time we headed to the computer lab, and I was just talking to a friend within the group just going through typical excel nerd shit. She leaves with the others, but then out of the blue she comes back and sits next to me. We strike up a convo, my friend takes a nap with a mask on his face and I just invited her to come to the basketball game with me and get ""lit"" with me. Mind you, I think both of us thought nothing more than a friendly hang out.

Comes game time, we had fun and chatted a lot before and after the game. We then grabbed food and talked some more. It was mostly her talking about her family and stuff going on. Later, we both head over to my friend's after party. Turns out at that party, all my friends had brought their GF in town. We were the only ""single"" ones. We both got drunk, one thing lead to another, and we kissed.

Shit gets awkward, but we texted a bit and we met up to discuss what had happened. She said she wasn't ready yet for a relationship cuz of her crazy ex. I was like ok cool whatever. Fast forward, the whole group decided to meet up to watch a movie, which happened to be at my place. We all got high, the rest of the friends drove off and she asked if she could stay the night. I said sure, and then later on she gets a phone call that wasn't good. We talked it out in my room, I said you can sleep here if you want. Then while we were in bed, we both stared at each other and started making out for the next 2 hours lol. It was pretty f\*\*\*ing fun. We both left for class the next morning and thought nothing of it.

Then we text again later that day and the phone call still got her really upset. I offered to come over and we made out again, this time with me sleeping over at her place. We do this for 3-4 more times, ran the 4 bases until finally the friend group caught on. We then eventually both agreed to be official. And we've been together for 1 whole year and counting now.

Fast forward to late August when he messages on fb. I ignored it at first figuring he was just pulling a submarine. He messages again about a week ago and I opened the message by mistake as I was sharing memes with another friend. He seemed apologetic about before, and psyched about making plans though I said I was busy with work for a week but we should chat on a regular to get a feel for our times (we both have odd work hours)

I was wary about giving it another go, but otoh, it was a little exciting to think about this handsome new person. It’s been two days now tho and I haven’t heard from him. 


I’m less bummed about it as I was the first time figuring this could happen again if I gave it another chance, but I don’t get the logic of it tbh.

I’ve tried really hard to get his parents to like me (buy them gift when I go over, buy presents for Christmas, order food for them) but his mom just doesn’t accept me. Wondering if there are any other Tibetan and Indian couples out there that are facing similar challenges. If so, how did you/ or are dealing with it? 

Btw we are long distance which makes it even harder because his parents don’t like him spending any time with me (whether it be on the phone, discord, going to see eachother). I get upset because of all this and I don’t know whether I can deal with this any longer. We have plans to move out together next next but that’s still up in the air.

68,qayw53,1634600141,Is me having a strong racial preference wrong?,"I am a latino 25M and I grew up in NYC. Growing up, most of my friends were POC, either being latino, brown (indian, middle eastern, etc.), asian, or black. I would say that probably only 25% of the friends I had in my life were white. Despite this, I have only been attracted to white women. My whole life, 9/10 women I had a crush on or were attracted to were white. The other day me and one of my best friends who is a 26 year old black women were discussing relationships and such. I was afraid to tell her that I was only attracted to white girl, so instead I told her what I tell almost everyone, that is that I am not attracted to latina women and dont think I could date them (which is absolutely true for me, for some reason I am not attracted to latinas despite me being latino) 
I am not saying that I absolutely would never even consider a girl of color, I have had a crush on a black girl, a indian girl, asian girl, and a few middle eastern girls. But despite that, especially now that I am older, my preference for white women has only gotten stronger and I have no idea why. I know very few white women in my life but I can only see myself wanting a white women. I honestly feel horrible about this preference. One of my best friends who is like a brother to me was trying to pair me up on a date with a girl he knew. However she was latina and I told him straight up that she is not my type. He was confused as objectively, she is attractive, but for me, I have no attraction for latinas. 
 
Does all this mean something is wring with me? Honestly I never consider ones race in any other circumstance, only dating. My best friends growing up and even now are all minorities. I do not think I am raciest but every time I explain this to people I feel like they are judging me or see me a certain type of way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qayw53/is_me_having_a_strong_racial_preference_wrong/

Some time around the end of the shift she says “It’s a shame that you’re leaving. You’re so funny. I like hanging with funny people.” I said that I appreciated that and we exchanged IGs. We talked until we closed. After we finished we both said that it was nice meeting each other and that was that.

I (M26) started texting a girl on a dating app. Conversations were very smooth, and she seemed interested in me. She pretty gentle and not superficial. Yesterday i wrote her if should would like in a near future to meet up dans do something together. She replied that she would adore it ! We scheduled it wednesday night, but she gave the idea to go eat at the restaurant. Thing is, i read a lot of girls here in reddit say that a guy that doesnt pay at first ""date"" are cheap. Thing is, for me, a first meeting is just friendly, that is why i always try to disomething that doesnt need someone to play. But this time, she seems to want this.

I got a lot of experiences in the past where i paid for the other person at the firsts dates when they were just not interested in reality.

87,qb01c4,1634603999,Am I doing the wrong thing? Venting/Any Adcive,"I will try to make this brief. 

hhh.. So I am new to dating. Okay like I have gone on dates but never had feelings for anyone or a crush until I met this one guy. We met online in the context of he was a member of a state group chat for ppl into gaming and geek stuff. We ended up messaging  private outside the main chat and things were awesome. We were gonna meet in person but we lived on opposite ends of the state and he ended up moving to a state over 1,000 miles away. One day he just never responded and that was that. that was five years ago and I knew I really liked this dude but I figured guess it wasn't meant to be.

Well earlier this year I reached out and sent a meme on twitter and we started talking again. I found out he was going through was breaking up with his boyfriend (the first one he had and came out to everyone with). up to this point it was his longest relationship and he had been thinking of moving back. 

At the time I had no intention of anything I was just glad to have a close friend back. It was like reconnecting with one of your bros. Well within a month of talking everyday and all the time, playing games and vibing on discord and helping him sort through his emotions I realized I had feelings for him. I understood he just got out of a very important relationship so I wasn't going to press but then I started noticing he would be flirting with me and one day we both expressed our feelings and I was overcome with this emotion of joy. Like warm but electric it was amazing! Something I have never felt before for someone. Remind you I am 23 and having never really been in a relationship so all this was so exciting and I couldn't believe we felt the same. 

I told him how I didn't like long distance and I wasn't sure but he told me this would be the best way to get to know each other. I said I was willing to try and put in the extra effort and explore these feelings.

Man the following month was awesome we talked all the time, got to know each other much more and deeper and everything was great. He planned a trip to come back to the state. I knew it wasn't just to visit me, he still had friends up here and family he was gonna visit but I was so excited to finally meet this guy in person. Like I never even had seen what he looked like. So the week comes and he arrives on a monday. I  made sure my whole week was cleared so if he had time to hang I could. We only were like, an hour away from each other with a big city equally distanced away. Well, that week came and he was like, busy.. He kinda avoided the whole let meet up and do a date/meet up. I finally got him to meet up on that Friday (he was leaving on that following tuesday). We met and yeah, he was better then I could have imaged and we clicked.  it was kinda awkward at first both being kinda introverted people but he had me do all the planning. Its like I had to be the one to say let's hang even though he was the one with the schedule and visiting other ppl. Okay we spent the whole day together was great arcade, mall, restaurant and walk around the city date. All went well and we both went home and texted later that night and everything was cool and we were excited. 

I was able to get him to do one more date that sunday and that was a great day, we explored a town, played soccer, frisbee went on a picnic and laid on a soccer field looking at the stars and the moon. Then he went home..

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things get weird. So he gets home and he stops responding as much. Normally we would respond in like 10 or so minutes and I normally dont care but he started sounding less interested in the conversation and sometimes wouldn't respond for 2-3 hours. He said he was busy with work and stuff which I understood but I would see him online with his phone on discord and he was one twitter so he clearly was using his phone. His responses were always closed and he stopped talking about himself and just kinda, did the basic hi how are you, nice. things. When I kinda played with the idea of applying to jobs down there or what his plans were with moving back here after visiting and he would always just avoid or change subject. So I stopped, I want to say I didnt push on the idea just was one convo.

I asked him how everything was going as we were a month in and kinda wanted to see the vibe of this dating thing. He then went on a long rant that culminated with, *""I dont think I can do this long distance relationship thing. I cant really get to know you and I express me affection physically and in person etc.""* I wont lie, this kinda hit hard but I knew this would be challenging. So we agreed we would just keep talking normally like friends and stuff which was fine cuz its not like we did anything.

Well, what has been bothering me is... The way he ended it he kept reiterating ""*Oh I am not saying I wont move back and not calling off the possibility of a relationship. I might move back I have nothing keeping me here.""* Ask about stuff in the state and talks about how much he misses etc. its all very confusing. The biggest thing is he now just hardly talks to me now. Like, guy doesn't play games with me anymore, sometimes doesn't message back for 7 hours or so and he says he work is busy. He said, yeah I have been trying to not use my phone as much and lean off social media. Okay thats great but THATS HOW WE TALK, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO TRY THIS WHOLE LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP THING. I made sure I would message him back. But he also says he always available to hang and do stuff with his friends. so like I feel like I am some back friend or something. He plays games on discord but wont play with me. He always says ""MAYBE"" and like, maybe means no. 

And just, I hate emotions right. I want to get over him and my feelings. I want to just stop messaging him cuz I should. He has treated me like crap and keeps dragging me on like I am some kinda back up. and like, he still talks to his ex. I know this cuz when we were on a date, his phone kept going off and I unintentionally looked once when his phone went off and like, I know they have kept in contact. He refollowed them on twitter and just.. I feel like i was some kinda of emotional rebound for him and that makes it hurt so much more. Like are they hanging again, why does he seem to have so much free time hanging with his friends down there. I get so annoyed with how he just, stopped talking to me... Yet I keep messaging him back... I don't know should I just stop messaging him one of these days? Should I confront him about it? Guy always says ""*yeah I am always down to game when I am not busy""* but always seems to be busy when I want to game and stuff. AHH I hate it but I like him and I need to shut this door but I is just so hard cuz it is something I wanted for so long and I had a taste of it. Maybe its because I haven't felt like this towards anyone in my life idk just... I am exhausted. I know I should let him go and just cut him out but.... HOW...

90,qb06d0,1634604506,Dating BOTH identical twins?,"About 2 months ago, I started dating a guy named Jake. At first things were great but it quickly went to crap as Jake was a narcissist, rude to me, put me down a lot, and has anger issues and blows up at the smallest things. But for some reason, I didn't leave because I was attracted to him... and probably because I was lonely and I was desperately trying to hang onto those good moments we had and hoping he came around eventually (I know, I'm stupid). When he wasn't in one of his weird moods, we still usually always had fun together so I figured we could just keep things casual for now. Plus we never really established a relationship and it seemed more like a FWB type thing and I was okay with that. Jake was also dating other women so I figure I might as well do the same and keep my options open.

Jake had told me has an identical twin brother and they used to be roommates but apparently they had a lot of drama and crap involving their exes so his brother Ben moved out. He had a lot of negative things to say about his brother (then again, he spoke negatively of almost everyone he talked about) but a few of the things he told me like how Ben was a gamer and into nerdy things intrigued me because I like those things. Of course, I wasn't going to tell him I wanted to meet his brother but I was curious about him. 

So this past weekend, Jake was moving from his old apartment to a new one across town and his brother was over helping him move. I had forgotten some of my belongings at Jake's place so I asked if I could swing by and grab them real quick and he said it was fine so I went to his place. When I got there, they were both stoned out of their minds on CBD gummies and just sitting around. The 3 of us eventually ended up hanging out and having some drinks while they slowly moved stuff to the truck. Jake was in one of his weird moods where he doesn't talk and just has this intense gaze and runs around frantically doing stuff and Ben just told me that this is normal behavior for Jake. Ben and I ended up talking a lot the whole time since Jake didn't seem interested and honestly, I was really vibing with Ben. I didn't know if it was appropriate to pursue anything with Ben, but since I knew Jake wasn't interested in being in a relationship with me, I figured it'd be okay to try. So towards the end of the night before I went home, I slipped Ben a piece of paper with my number on it and told him if it was too awkward to talk to a chick his brother was 'kinda' dating to just not worry about it. 

When I got back to my car to leave, Ben texted me immediately and asked if I wanted to hang out later. So in the end, I invited him back to my place and we ended up talking and hanging out for hours and eventually hooked up. Turns out, we have way more in common than me and Jake and he was also a lot nicer and confirmed all the negative things about Jake was his personality and that he had ruined almost all his past relationships because of his behavior. Ben and I are planning to hang out later this week and go on a date but now I am conflicted because I am not sure how Jake will react when he finds out. I don't want to mess up their already rocky relationship and I realize the situation is pretty awkward. Obviously, Ben already knows I've been with Jake but they don't really talk or hang out much. On the other hand, I feel like Jake already has a feeling we were hanging out because he called me randomly at 4AM in the morning (this is 2 hours after Ben and I left his place and Jake was suppose to be in bed for work the next morning and not awake) and I didn't answer because I didn't know what he'd ask or what I'd tell him if he asked his brother was there. I have never been in a situation like this before so I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't really know Ben that well since I just met him so I don't know where this is going to end up going, but at the same time I feel like I do sort of already know him because of what Jake is told me, pictures I've seen, and since.... they're identical twins.

But at least, I can now check off my ""dated both identical twins"" off my bucket list (/s) and in case you're curious, yes they are the same size if you know what I mean and even kind of do it the same way. And also, there's no way I'd confuse the two brothers because while they are identical and the same height, Jake has short hair and usually clean shaves and has more of a lean soccer player build while Ben is more muscular and big and has longer hair and a beard. But yea I guess my question is... how the hell do I deal with this situation?? I suppose I should end things with Jake if I am going to try to date Ben? But this is just super weird for me, but despite that, I still want to see where things go.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb06d0/dating_both_identical_twins/
91,qb08df,1634604706,Excuse to ghost?,"A guy I have been seeing on and off missed telling me happy birthday this past month and offered to take me out to make up for it. I say okay I’m available this weekend and he immediately makes an excuse for not being able to take me out. He says he’s going out of town and can’t cancel at all. I respond by saying “oh ok” he then proceeds to blow up my phone trying to make conversation. The next day he says “I postponed my trip. Would love to take you out if your free” I didn’t respond immediately. Because I felt turned off, he’s obviously lied about having plans in the first place and only wants to take me out now that he feels bad. He continues to blow my phone up and ask if I’m ignoring him. It was all a huh turn off and made me want to talk to him less. I personally don’t want to dignify his behavior with a response. We’re both old enough to know what he did wasn’t okay. 

TLDR: a guy lied to me about being available, then tries to tell me the truth after feeling guilty. He keeps blowing my phone up and I don’t respond. Am I being rude? I don’t wish to communicate with people that disrespect me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb08df/excuse_to_ghost/
92,qb09zh,1634604854,Anyone else think there’s a good chance you’ll always be single?,"I (27 f) have only been in one relationship when I was in high school. I’m really just not interested in that many people, and the people I do like don’t like me back. Blah blah psychology, trauma, etc. I’m fat and weird and really picky. Many of the women of my family have ended up alone in life. Honestly, for my mental health, I want to accept the fact that I may never fall in love/end up with someone. Anyone one else feel the same? How do you deal? Anyone older who lives a fully satisfactory single life? I really don’t want bullshit “you’ll find someone!” because I honestly might not",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb09zh/anyone_else_think_theres_a_good_chance_youll/
93,qb09zo,1634604855,Is it even worth the effort?,"There are some cold hard facts that make me question if it is even worth the effort to pursue romantic interactions. I do consider myself reasonably attractive especially in the face department and do ok on most dating apps.

1) I am extremely short for where I live (western Europe), the average male height is 1.85m while I stand barely at 1.73m . The average height for women in my country is around my height aswell. Height elemenates a lot of potential possibilities since most women want their partner to be taller than them, I also have to compete with men who are much taller than me.

2) I am 20 and only recently lost my virginity. Most women around from my age seem to view the lack of sexual experience as a red flag. I do not know how widespread this belief is but a lot of my female friends have said so. I could also simply lie about my previous sexual experience but I believe this to be a bit unethical.

3) People from my ethnicity, particularly males are seen as quite unattractive at least by conventional norms. My home country is also quite poverty stricken and has a very negitive reputation. I also do not know to what extent this plays against my favor. I regularly interact with people from a lot of different countries who tend to be quite open minded so this may be a relatively minor issue.

I did not come here to whine or socilit pity for my situation. I just want some honest opinions on if it is reasonable to spend time and resources on dating or to just give up. My time and energy is limited and I'd rather not waste it on something that is bound to not yeald results. I hope the information I provided was not too vague as I fear that getting too specific might make it easier for someone to figure out who I exactly am.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb09zo/is_it_even_worth_the_effort/
94,qb0c4e,1634605065,Boring conversations and awkward silences,"I have developed crippling social anxiety over the years and having conversations are a daunting task. I’m always fumbling in my head what to say next which leads to awkward pauses that makes both sides feel very uncomfortable. I hate small talk so much. I used to be outgoing, but depression and severe isolation has made me become very weird. It doesn’t help that I have no interests in anything anymore. Having conversations with people just feels like an improv that I am terrible at.

Looking for tips on how to have smooth flowing conversations and how to mitigate the awkward pauses/change topics. I guess the more interesting a person is the more there is to talk about. Too bad i wasted most of my life rotting in bed not living.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb0c4e/boring_conversations_and_awkward_silences/

96,qb0f40,1634605320,Update; I’m ghosting him after he made me cum,"Hi guys thank you so much for helping me yesterday. I know a lot of people wanted an update so here it is. 
(I (22F) Don’t know how to link the original post but the tldr is I went on a first date with a longtime classmate and accidentally had an inappropriate semipublic O while we were making out after dinner. I was mortified, and considered switching classes to avoid him)


Update; basically this is our midterm week, and he double texted me before I could text him to complain about the workload and everything ( so unfortunately I didn’t get the chance to hit him with the “sorry for coming on your leg like a fuckin poodle the other night. Do you want to get drinks” line) and he basically invited me over to study. 
I said yes and sorry for not responding for the past couple of days, that I’ve just been really busy. I was still really, really, nervous to see him in person but since posting on here that visceral shame and embarrassment definitely died down. When i got to his apartment , I immediately got it out of the way and just said “I’m sorry if I made things weird the other night”
To which kind of played with me and just laughed and ironically said “oh? The other night, what happened the other night? I have no idea what you’re talking about.” 
Then he literally just asked me f I wanted a glass of wine and moved on. Like that was it. I’d been freaking petrified that he’d think I was weird or it would fuck  everything up and he literally moved past it in a second. That’s when I realized guys were right!! He didn’t care, it wasn’t an issue. At all!
After that we just studied all morning and he didn’t bring it up again.
Bonus note: we ended up sleeping together, not sexually just falling asleep in his bed after lunch and he didn’t try anything at all, which made me feel even better bcz I was worried that the whole 1st date public orgasm would make him view me as easy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb0f40/update_im_ghosting_him_after_he_made_me_cum/

I dated in the past but, my major problem is I feel like I’m too picky. I’m not talking about looks solely, I find red flags way to quickly and just loose interest is this a bad quality to have? I’m a 26 m and I don’t know at this point if I should stop being so picky or am I doing the right thing.
