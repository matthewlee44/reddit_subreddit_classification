I've been dating my SO for 4 months. I've been recently noticing patterns in my SO's behaviors that make me feel like they're not interested in me. Examples:

* They don't speak at meals unless I start the conversation/lead with a question
* When I try to respond to their opinion with my own opinion/understanding, they say ""Well, it's more like..."" 
* If I try to talk to them while they're scrolling through social media, they won't stop scrolling. I just stop talking. 
* When we're together in bed, I'll cuddle up close to them but they won't reciprocate with any touch or movement.

I just feel like my SO isn't interested in the details of what make me *me*, and sometimes lacking physical intimacy beyond sexual situations. 

I've been telling myself that it's fine for my SO to be this way because they are so willing to comfort me without judgment whenever I go through a hard time. They're also very distractible (hyperactivity disorder), so I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing could be related to that (e.g. maybe it's harder to focus on what I'm saying?)

I've decided to give tinder a shot after a decade since its launch because of covid/social distancing. I am in my early 30s now, male. So the first time I signed up I got like 20 LIKES in the first 24 hours. then a few more LIKES trickled in for the next 2 days and then after that it COMPLETELY STOPS. NO LIKES. In total I got 37. 

I don't even know how that number compares to the vast majority of men, but because i was new, I got matches (probably because I left'd all these wonderful women).

so I did my research and apparently it is normal to have zero matches afterwards due to no more ""noobie boost"". so now either my profile was not available to the women, or the women in my area just doesn't like my look. 

Mind you, I set distance at first from 16 miles away (within my city (which is a large metropolitan area)). any further will be further upstate , etc and will require me to drive. But because of no further likes I've since extended my milage. 

age- I also have set it + 5 -5 from my age so around 25-35ish

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided to delete my profile, recreate it and now I ONLY GOT 2 likes? WHAT? what happened?

(This is from my experience) (as an ambiguously brown person) 

1. Because you said it. You stood there in a group of people, when nobody on earth asked you, and said “I only date WHITE GIRLS” and then stared me down. Hey you know what? I didn’t ask you out. I have no interest. But the fact that you turned this into an exclusion party is racist. 

2. Because you don’t even know what “your race” is. “I only date Asian girls” Your name is Johnny and you’re an American from Jersey. Stop. 

3. Because you’re describing features, not race or culture. You like Asian girls? My friend Chandrika from India is single. Oh, not THAT kind of Asian? You like African girls? How cool, this is Starsha, from Egypt! Oh, not THAT kind of African. 

4. You have no understanding of the race or culture you “prefer”. Thanks for the offer to date me because we both love weed and Cardi B, and thanks so much for asking if I actually love any of those things instead of assuming, based on skin tone. 

5. You sexualize a race, and lump someone in with it. No, I do not know any of the positions of the Kamasutra. No, I am not asking to marry you. No, I did not take off my hijab and sully my family’s honour. 

6. You’ll make an exception for sex…but you won’t bring me home. YOU’RE not racist, it’s your parents. You would totally want a long term relationship if THEY weren’t forcing you to date someone from your small island nation of 8,000 people….and find her in Canada. 

7. You will date outside of your race, but you will use this leverage to make racist jokes and comments, put down and disparage your partner…or worse, your kids. “My kid has ADHD because she’s black” -authentic quote. Or their features “omgeee I just don’t know what to do with her hayyyyaaarrr” 

8. You’ll break up with people who have the right features if they turn out not to be the “right race”. “I found out she was actually Portuguese and I just couldn’t be with her after that” “He spoke Japanese but he was actually Chinese” 

9. You think I’m beautiful but “it’s like looking at a pretty alien.” -direct quote

10. You and your friends build up the confidence and perceived worth of a specific race of people regardless of their actual looks. You stand around in a crowd screaming that any guy who dated me would be an outcast and a loser. That impacts who others choose to date and anyone who does date me is socially ostracized until he properly dates a white girl. You post entire threads online about it and call it a racial preference.

My other colleagues have been teasing us to get together so he's aware that there's something that might be going on between us cause he's also starting to approach me at work; before the teasing, we were rarely 1-1 together.

I want to get to know him more. I'm very conscious speaking in a space that I know anyone can pass by and eardrops us hence, I want to talk with him outside of our workplace. However, we are both very shy and quiet so I don't think he's going to initiate anything. I want to try initiating a beach hangout for the two of us.

The problem is, public transport is basically nonexistent in my country so if I'm going somewhere, I have to drive myself - I'm really bad at directions and driving. The thing is he knows I have a car and can drive cause I drive to work (it's just nearby, so I'm able to). 

I wanna get advice to create a script on how can I ask him if he wanna go to the beach together but for him to drive us there? 

It would be easier to play this out if it's on text but another problem is we haven't exchanged numbers despite its been 2 months since the teasing has been going on. If I'm initiating I can just say "" Hey, do you wanna go out together during your off day? Lets exchange numbers so we can discuss it.

A contract would be: I like you, you like me. So let's date exclusively for 3 months. At 3 months we do a review of what we like or disliked about the experience and decide whether we want to go another 3 months or so. 

Specific dating partners would be something like having a partner specifically for traveling with. Or having a bf just to hike with. It'd all be based on overlapping interest. This takes off the pressure of one guy/girl having to do everything with their partner. You won't even need to live together.

I’ve been in between work so I had the opportunity to come stay near her town. I booked an Airbnb for about 1.5 weeks with the goal of getting to know her better and this location has been on my bucket list for exploring (I had planned on spending a couple of weeks out here regardless). Fast forward to now. I’ve been here for two weeks. So we’ve been dating/talking for about 2 months.

During the time we were long distance, we talked on the phone, texted, and/or FaceTimed everyday. Texting all day. Our first official date was nice. Both of us nervous but admitted to each other that we really liked one another. The next day, our second date, we became inseparable. I basically ditched my Airbnb and have been staying at her place. I cook, clean, take care of the animals, and go exploring while she’s at work (M-F). At night we snuggle and watch tv. 

Sounds nice, right? Well the second weekend together became a roller coaster of highs and lows. We had an amazing date night Friday, went shopping Saturday, then went out for drinks Saturday night. Saturday night was going great. We were all cute and coupley. She mentioned only calling me her friend because I hadn’t made it official yet (ie calling her my girlfriend). Then she had too much to drink (I was dd so I hadn’t had much to drink). She was puking and crying about how she wasn’t over her last relationship. It was a mess. I took care of her, had a good cry, and went to bed. The next morning I got up and left for a few hours, while she slept, so I could clear my head. When I got back, we talked. It turns out she had only just broken off a year long relationship 10 days before we started talking. And it had been serious (think first girlfriend, discussion of proposal, etc.). Her previous girlfriend was not good to her and was potentially cheating. So I suggested we take it slow. Problem is, I am falling for this girl. If I had known about the timing, I probably wouldn’t have continued seeing her. At the very least I would have approached it differently. With this new knowledge, I’m sadly already heading towards falling in love. The last few days have been hard. It feels like we have less physical intimacy (haven’t had sex yet, less cuddling, make out sessions get cut short). I need to start thinking about leaving. I only stayed longer because it didn’t feel right to leave right after the rollercoaster weekend. But now I just feel pain and longing. I both don’t want to leave because I’m terrified we will fizzle out completely and know that we both need space (she needs time to process and I need to get some distance for my heart). What do I do about any of this? I’m also Demi so this relationship is the first time I’ve ever had such strong feelings for someone.

I have no confidence in myself or my chances anymore. I'm just so tired of trying. I feel like I've done everything right. I've went out to places more than I ever had in my life. I've reached out and connected with people and make a social net. I groom myself every day to the best of my ability. It always ends up nowhere

I'm tired of the fact that this is how my life has ended up. I'm tired of the fact that I've put in all this effort and haven't made a lick of progress.

I don't have any issues with talking to women, and I've never struggled with making friends. Yet, when it comes to expressing attraction, I'm *extremely* reticent. I keep it all bottled up inside, and it tends to manifest itself in really weird ways. Back in the day, whenever I'd work up the courage to try asking somebody out, I'd instead awkwardly confess to having a crush on them and follow it up by saying some variant of ""I know you don't feel the same way about me."" It's part of the reason why, at 28, I have still never gone out on a single *actual* date with a woman, let alone anything beyond that.

What separates me from a lot of other love-shy men is the fact that I neither identify with nor accept many of the toxic mindsets that they tend to adopt. Specifically:

* I have *never* bought into the whole ""nice guys finish last"", ""women only date jerks"" mindset. I believe that most women want a man who treats them respectfully, knows and takes care of himself, and responds to things in an emotionally mature manner. If it turns out that the woman I like is already in a relationship, I don't think to myself, ""Of course she'd rather date some self-obsessed douchebag instead of me."" My thoughts are more, ""He's probably a really good, solid guy to wind up with a woman like her.""

* I have never truly felt that the blame for my lack of success fell on anyone's shoulders but my own. Even in situations where I *have* pointed the finger at others, I knew I was just trying to delegate my own feelings of shame so as to make it easier for me to digest. I have always seen my lack of success as a consequence of my own actions (or lack thereof).

* If a woman ever outright called me ""creepy"", or said that I was making her uncomfortable, my first instinct has never been to assume that she's wrong for feeling the way she does, or that she ""misunderstands"" anything. Instead, I apologize and reflect on myself.

* Apart from maintaining good hygiene, I've never felt that ""creepy"" has anything to do with physical appearance; I roll my eyes whenever any guy uses the old ""attractive guy does it = flirting; ugly guy does it = creepy"" chestnut. While there are certainly exceptions, women generally call men creepy (or any of its myriad variants) when they transgress personal boundaries and fail to comport themselves in a socially appropriate manner. Staring, openly leering, love-bombing, invading personal space, asking overly personal questions, oversharing personal details, refusing to take ""no"" for an answer, failing to read and respond appropriately to social cues - *those* are the kinds of things that get men labeled as creepy, not the fact that they don't look like Fabio. And it's not that women ""misunderstand"" (even if they do, it's still not their problem to address); it is *on men* to modify their own behavior so as to avoid making women uncomfortable.

* I don't go around loudly and proudly proclaiming myself to be a feminist like it's a badge of honor, but I pretty much *am* one. My beliefs and attitudes align with those of mainstream feminism far more often than not. In my personal life, I strive to be empathetic and respectful towards woman in all that I say and do. I am *nowhere near* perfect in that regard, but I do try. It is extremely important to me.

These are just a few of the opinions and dispositions that I hold. It is not an exhaustive list. But it should serve to illustrate my ideological leanings.

Yet, any time I entertain the notion of shooting my shot with a woman I'm interested in, I always feel like whatever I'd say or do would run afoul of my aforementioned values. I always feel like I come up short, that I have been below-average in terms of respecting and empathizing with the lived experience of being a woman in our society, that I am poorly calibrated from an interpersonal standpoint, etc. I wish I could rid myself of all this shame and just ask somebody out, not having to worry about causing discomfort or getting rejected.

Now don't get me wrong he's alright guy. but after we've spent sometime together and had a few questionable ''red flags'' popped up. I'm honestly considering if it'll be best for me to cut things off.  


I feel slightly disgusted with myself for this but part of me thinks maybe he's a rebound although it's been quite some time before my last relationship and I never intended to use someone to get over an ex. Though honestly its more than that, his unwanted/unneeded comments about my friends or how I'm the one making most of the decisions on what to do together and even if I come up with two things he gets all crabby for me asking him to pick one. Him being very monotone (which for a person who had anxiety can mistake it as negative emotions) and if he does show some sort of emotions its when he's ''teasing'' because ''teasing'' is how he shows affections. even though time and time again I've expressed that it annoys or upsets me.  Told him to stop and explained why, though his response usually is ''it was just a joke''.   


I love when I can have fun and joke around with people especially a partner, but I know I shouldn't feel constantly annoyed and I know my boundaries and feelings should be respected. I feel for the most part I'm pretty easy going and I can be a people pleaser at times which hasn't been the best for me in the past.

I have been seeing this guy for three months we are both in our late 30s He was kinda casual and we saw each other one a week the most . I really liked him and always offered to see each other more often or do something but he wasn’t very interested, yet he did call me every day and texted me every single day we could talk hours on the phone. However he would never invite me when he went out with his friends. 

I understand that it’s too early but I can’t do casual so after a month or so I started to ask him what’s the issue and why we don’t spend more time together to which he never replied clearly .We had a few arguments about it but always made up. 

I asked him numerous times if he’s interested to date and didn’t say no or anything, I even said that I want out of this if he’s not into it and he asked to stay and that  he’s sorry and that we will do more things together.

When we are together we always had a blast. He started to get kinda distant. No really open with me. Ignoring me. Cancelling last minute .
I really got tired of this treatment so I confronted him and he said he’s not ready and scared that he doesn’t think we will work out , that he cannot give me what I want and a relationship, and that he’s not in the right state of his mind and life . 
He made stupid excuses like I live too far (25 min drive).

He said I’m one of the best girls he ever met but he thinks it’s not working , and that we are different. 
I said why he just couldn’t be honest with me rather than wasting my time and drugging me for three months . He said he was thinking it will work . Bla bla .
He does seemed to be interested at the begging but still was kinda casual . 

I even asked why he never invited me when he went out with his friends and he says he doesn’t want ppl to think he’s in a relationship. He told me many times that im fun , nice and beautiful I really don’t get what’s the issue. 

And the next day  today  texted me “hope you have a good day “. Why he’s texting me the next day after he said he is not interested ?
Should I even respond to this text?

TL;DR He said he can’t give me a relationship but he wants to be friends  and hang out , maybe even something will happen , he said that he wants me to go out with him and his friends as his friend. I don’t get what the hell is this even supposed to mean and why he wants to be friends .

I felt overwhelmed, and since I’m not the best texter, or maybe I just wanted some self reassurance I didn’t reply any message -this is the worst but I won't elaborate on that-, and decided to send my number to only one guy. We saw each other the same evening at my place, because of the curfew he (29) left. He contacted me after to do something during the weekend and since I already had other plans and I was pretty much focused on building friendships in the new city, my answer was very straightforward and not open to any kind of conversation. 

After 8 months, he texted me back if I wanna hang out. We went for beers the same evening, I wouldn’t call it a date but was a nice casual hang out that ended up with good sex, morning breakfast and the morning together walking and coffee/book hunting. All the day-together under his initiative. He texted back something the same day, and went silent for two weeks. I decided to sent him a message asking if he was interested I’d like to see him again. He came that evening to my place, although I meant kind of ""let’s actually meet each other"", I think he understood the message as a booty call. Of course I want sex as well, so it was ok for me. We talked about our expectations, neither of us want a relationship. The difference might be that I actually like to spend some time outside the bed with the people I hook up.

Later that week he texted me a random question since he -as I am- is a bad texter, the conversation ended up quickly. Which I don't mind, I don't like texting that much, but I do appreciate direct messages to hangout in real life.  Anyway, days after I asked him out directly, and we watched a movie and spend the night together. While we were having sex, for the first time in a very long time I felt very nervous, selfconscious about my body and overthinked all the situation. This is normally not the case, I'm quite confident with myself and direct with I want. If I were a man, this would have been translated in losing the erection. I felt bad, and since I no longer fake orgasms or fake enjoyment decided to propose to chill out. He managed the situation nicely and we actually had a great time after that. Yet, next day I went back home thinking, ok, that's it. This is absolutely done, and I was partially feeling ashamed of the failure of the sex mainly because of me. 

A week after he asked me if I wanna go to the cinema. I couldn't, I had something to do at that hour, and he asked if we could have a late night walk then. The walk was actually just a walk. He is not flirty at all, which hold me back to show interest. It is not that I want to be over him, but I like to be more direct with my words and body contact with the people I hook up, and feeling like it may be one-sided stops me. I found him extremely respectful with me, meaning a lot of distance whenever the situation is us not in an horizontal position. I wouldn't say he is a shy person, but seems to be the kind of guy that doesn't take much initiative, much of a listener. And considering that most of the time we hanged out after my initiative, which already shows some interest from my side, all what I could have done is done. I guess that he is just not into me. 

Yet, as I am and considering that I'll leave soon for Christmas break, after a couple of days I asked him if he wanted to join me to watch a film, he answered that had some deadline later that week and asked about my work deadlines... no interest or proposal to reschedule or do something else. I answered briefly in one sentence, and he said that I should tell him my thoughts after that movie that I was going to watch. Clearly, I haven't answer. What do you think? There is no fuck-buddy possibility here, no? 

At this point I feel like he just doesn't like me that much. I showed already interest with my actions in not subtle ways but directly.

I didn't feel connected to the trauma per se, it was more so the bravery and openness it takes to talk about it (and joke about it at the same time). I value honesty and the idea of 'let's get straight to the point'. 

Should note, the entire conversation didn't revolve around trauma. We both said ""here are some things that I'm working through"" then dropped it and just had fun. Also would note that we ended up sleeping together. 

\-- 

Now, the second date with Person 2 wasn't as free-flowing. In general, it was just awkward. I had trouble responding to her and keeping with the pace of conversation, so I just sat back and listened. 

Let's just say, to summarize, they are very successful in all aspects of life. They are really focused on their health, career, has long-term goals, has no trauma whatsoever, and so on. I do value how driven and healthy this person is both physically and mentally, though. I do find them just as attractive physically as Person 1. 

\--

If you look at it objectively, Person 2 is way better on paper. Person 1, while beautiful and has the personality I'm attracted to, but doesn't have nearly all the healthy habits Person 2 has. They are 'trying to figure it out'. They def have some toxic behaviors, like drinking a bit more than the average person, as well. 

So that's where I'm looking for your opinion, Reddit. Am I falling victim to trauma bonding with Person 1? Am I intimidated by the idea of dating a ""normal"" person because that's not how I view myself? I.e. A ""not normal"" person with problems that get's by and tries to have fun doing it? Why was I a bit turned off by all the healthy habits Person 2 had or couldn't feel connected to them?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138159,public,self,Trauma bonding vs. Normalcy/Slow healthy connection?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rhxz5o/trauma_bonding_vs_normalcyslow_healthy_connection/,no_ads,0,dating,,,,,,

I asked here the day after if she would be coming home any time or if I would have to wait a month to see her again. She basically said ""I hope its worth the wait""

We both decided to take it slow, so we've been on probably 20 dates and have moved very slowly. This was the first time he spent the night. I couldn't even sleep the entire night. I felt bad because I wanted him to leave multiple times but didn't ask him.

We both had the day off today, and so we decided to spend our first night together. I thought about asking him to be my boyfriend in the morning after having sex and cooking him breakfast.

Has anyone else had this problem? It made me so exhausted the next day, I didn't even want to have sex in the morning or spend the day with him. I told him I wasn't feeling well and went back to sleep.

I feel awful and shallow for not taking the next step with him because of this, but if this is a guy I could be living with at some point, I just can't do this. His snoring is just so loud!

Might be in my feels a bit lately but just want to set out my stall and see if people have been in a similar position or could lend some advice.
I’m 25M, live in the UK, well educated, good circle of friends, plenty of female friends too. I have had 3 long term girlfriends, and hooked up half a dozen times for ons/casual things in between.

I am a bit worried that I haven’t had a long term girlfriend in a while, since late  2019. To be fair Covid has been a strong reason and I wasn’t up for breaking the rules while I was back living with my parents who are older. 

Since the end of restrictions I have hooked up with someone once, after a halloween party. So I still have some game. I just feel a bit anxious about doing the full time relationship thing. I feel like I have a lot more responsibilities since the last time I had a full time partner. A new career, new hobbies and routines I got into during the last 2 years. 

How do I get over this? How do I overcome relationship anxiety and get out there again. I don’t tend to meet many girls who are single, and I’m usually too shy to go up and hit on a girl in public. Dating apps also really kill me so leaving that out of the equation. Am I overly picky? What’s the issue

Thank you all, I really appreciate it.  


So here's the situation. I have been talking to and going out with a fantastic girl for the past month and a half or so. We've been incredibly transparent with each other about our intentions and we've agreed that we really want a relationship with each other. I planned on making it official some time in the next week or so, until a conversation we had this morning.  


She told me that last night, she began suffering from panic attacks while she was trying to sleep, and she thinks that they might have stemmed from the idea and intimacy of being in a relationship. She said she wanted to pause and take a step back so that she can evaluate if she's ready for this or not. She told me that she is looking for a therapist to discuss everything that is going on. I told her that if there is anything I can do or change in my behavior towards her in this time to tell me, and I thanked her for how transparent and honest she was with me. She told me that she just wants what's best for me and wants me to be happy. Then, I told her I wanted the same for her, that I was here for her, and that we would step back as far as she needed to keep her mental health in check. After I said that, I haven't heard anything else from her.

&amp;#x200B;

Without being specific, she has had rough experiences with her own relationships and relationships around her throughout her life. There's a chance that this event is tied to those negative experiences. I'm unsure what to do in my position. I have an anxious attachment type, but I have gone to therapy to help me reduce those impulsive tendencies that come with that style of attachment (reaching out too much, seeming clingy, etc.) I have been doing much better about this thus far in the relationship, but this situation has brought that anxious side of me back out. The last thing I want to do is be selfish and reach out to satiate my own self-esteem issues when the thing she needs most is space and time.

&amp;#x200B;

When would it be appropriate for me to reach out to her? How long should I wait? At what point should I accept that maybe this won't work out and I need to start the long process of moving on? I don't think she's lying to me or leading me on; she said she's going to look for a therapist to work things out with, and if that happens, I've found a woman who is worth her weight in gold. I just want to be considerate to her and her needs first and foremost.

We have been dating for about 5 months. Its long distance about 3 hours drive. We met at a party and hit it off and been visiting each other regularly. We have expressed deep feelings for eachother and also said that we are in love with each other. We agreed to be exclusive and also became bf/gf.

Generally everything goes great, except of course there are some downs aswell. She is very sweet but she seems cold (her personality, her friends and family agrees). Also she can talk about past things that makes me uneasy. But I also feel she came a long way for me, which she hasnt done for anyone before.

When we started dating she told me her plan was always to move to my city after she finished her studies, because its the capital and lot of oportunities. I thought I could handle 6 months long distance. And it is due soon. Now she is expressing concerns about moving further away from family and friends, but still says she will move. I feel she has become more uncertain after i spoke to her again, where she had almost guaranteed she would move, but now I am unsure if she means it. On the same day, she were more 'unsure' she suggested we become bf/gf and I agreed (even though) we have been for some time, but we had the talk.

I mean I should not worry that she will move, and I dont have a bad gut feeling, but still kinda afraid. She  knows it cant go on like this if she doesnt because of the distance. She also shows other signs that she is afraid of losing me.

We have been talking about seeing each other as we do and even going on a trip out of the country.

But what I really want to do is start distancing me from her, to ease the pain the day she might come and say that she wont be moving. I am in love with her, think about her all the time, but also worry a lot and she also can make me happy and uneasy at the same time (even though she doesnt do it on purpose).

So overall I am thinking to distance my self and slowly pull myself back until the day she decides comes. But me being distant could have a negative effect also on her decision im thinking. How would you proceed?
