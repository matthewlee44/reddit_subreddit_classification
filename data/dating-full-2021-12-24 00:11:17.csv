Usually confidence implies that you are comfortable with yourself and in environment that you’re in, but also what kind of energy you put out.

For example, someone who just reached a new personal milestone at the gym, got a promotion at work or maybe just found out they they got a good grade on a school test, is probably going to be in a much better mood and give off a much better vibe than someone who’s feeling depressed or had a bad day at work. Even when you try to separate your personal alone time feelings from your public feelings, more often than not these are in unconscious and subtle changes that will never notice, especially tone of voice and mannerisms. So here’s the trick to practice displacing confidence. Ready for for it????

Walk with your head facing up and facing forward. 

I notice this a lot with people who are walking and I notice myself doing this a lot as well, which is to put your head down or look away when walking. This shows that you’re uncomfortable, you’re afraid to look at someone in the eyes as you head toward them or scared they’ll made a bad comment for staring at them. 

Being a confident man is about being comfortable. When you approach a woman or a man, even if it’s a completely platonic manner, don’t talk to them as if they’re about to reject you before you even ask or say anything; women can pick up on that instantly. Keep your head up, smile and make consistent eye contact. Not so much that it’s creepy, but reciprocate their energy and watch for body language to determine if the person is interested in talking or not.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140107,public,self,Simple trick to display confidence without speaking to someone,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn9gzy/simple_trick_to_display_confidence_without/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

That would be a 1 month wait for him. So he texts often (every other day) and he suggested we meet in early Jan. I told him that's fine.

He texted and told me he likes to date 1 person at a time, I said I don't mind that he continue looking for matches on Bumble and meeting with people. Anyways fast forward to today I received a call from the doctor that they were able to move an important surgery for me up sooner to Jan instead of Feb. I accepted this reschedule and then texted the guy to let him know that we could meet up 1 week sooner before surgery or after I heal (which could be another 3 weeks).

He said he couldn't meet the week sooner and that he feels played. That he doesn't want me to waste his time and told me I needed to call him. I called him to explain again the scenario and he said he thought about cancelling our date because he thought my surgery was a lie. He also said that he dislikes texting and prefers I call anytime we talk. I prefer text over calls.

I'm having doubts now if I even want to go on a first date? Just kind of felt odd he thinks I'm lying, is saying I have to call now instead of text, and twice implied I'm wasting his time.

Furthermore, in the rare occasions that the women stuck with me, they always seemed to be faking, or rather not be themselves. In bed, I noticed there is genuine enjoyment especially if its our first time together, but as it reaches the second and third times, they become more reluctant towards being on top.

BUT he also added that he's still waiting to hear back if he has to be up early for work and that if tn doesn't work out, that we could try for another night before i leave (bc i told him i'm leaving town for two weeks for the holidays). to which i say its ok bc ik he's super busy and i tell him i leave later that week. and i haven't gotten a txt from him since. rip

um so... did i get ghosted lmfao. but he knows im out of town rn. but also he never txted me before i left. but also... he does have a full-time job... or i mean... ugh. 

should i just give up and let it go. tbh i think the chase is what's making me want him even more LMFAO. ik this is so SO stupidLOL &amp; im self-aware so i feel stupid asking advice from my friends. so i thought i would ask here. bc i still want to see him. like a lot. ik we only met once, and again, honestly it's prob just the chase that's making me want him so much (smh). but what should i do. i don't mind just having casual sex at all... i mean, that's what i'm expecting. should i txt him when i get back? 

or is that weird... is this his way of telling me nicely that he's not interested anymore? it's just that he seemed SO interested before. and he asked for my ig before he met and he still follows me... lol

im definitely over-thinking this wayyyy to much. but yeah. lmk what u guys think. &lt;3",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140124,public,self,how to get an older guys attention,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnapsn/how_to_get_an_older_guys_attention/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

We are friends and just started talking again, so of course I didn’t think nothing of it.

seeing her comment on his things again. And he’s a single man so it’s okay of course.

I (m28) was at a friend's gathering this evening. A low key event, 5 people having a few drinks from about 9:30pm to 1am. 

I was the only guy there, one of the women is happily married, another is in a relationship and the other two are single. Both of the women in relationships have children and at least from my perspective, we were all clearly interested in platonic relationships and a bit of fun! 

One of the single women was kinda into me and after a fee drinks she got pretty handsy. Actually she got really handsy and ended up falling over on the table and  accidently breaking most of the glasses at the party.

It was clear to everyone else that she was a bit smashed and was overly eager. Two of the women tried their best to intercept and distract this third women. Ultimately I left and my friends put the person in question to bed.

Now I get that she was drunk and 100% I have no hard feelings. But this woman was all over me to the point where I had to leave the apartment and all her friends were aplogising for her behavior. If the situation were reversed and I was aggressively hitting on a girl who was obviously not into it, isn't that a reason to call em out rather than excuse my behavior. I'm sorry if this is stupid and sounds self-centered, but like isn't the whole deal that we should have an equal playing field where boundaries are respected?

Long time lurker here, I am a man in my early 20s with terrible social skills. My social circle is non-existent so cold approaches are the only way to find a partner. 

I’ve been suffering from anxiety and depression longer than I can remember and the only cure is that I could find someone. I have no parents, friends, no one. Unfortunately, my self-esteem got even worse because of tonight's experience. I decided to hang out by myself in a district mostly full of pubs, terraces, clubs, etc. I reckoned I could approach someone here. I took the advice from this subreddit to heart and decided to give it a shot. I wore my best-looking clothes (Polo shirt + jeans), went to a hairdresser, groomed myself to the best of my abilities. I have a rather average build which is not too distinctive. 

Anyways, I roamed around the district, checking out every establishment to digest the environment, after about 20 minutes, I saw a couple of women who were chatting in the street so I decided to give myself a go. I calmly approached them and I said “Hello, sorry for interrupting but my name is Vinny and I’d like to tell you that you look beautiful, would you mind if I join you?” I was saying this in a slight-cheerful manner to give them a good impression.

Their smile replaced with a sour face and one of them said “Go away creep!” and they walked away briskly. I never wanted to die so badly. Maybe I was at fault, either way, I just went straight home and cried in my bed for a couple of hours straight. It was beyond pathetic, I’m not sure how y’all can cope but I can’t. I have this terrible feeling inside me as I write this.

There is definitely an emotional and physical attraction but because we are Co workers and  professional it has never materialized into dating or anything.We work in a law firm with a pretty strict no dating policy and a dating  disclosure policy from HR. 

Also, and this is the big hitch...she is married

. It started of just as casual conversations but now  She comes into my office and we talk for a good hour about non-work related stuff  several times every week! Lately it has been getting more intense especially now w long lunches and I can't explain it but the eye contact is just really intense. We find excuses to spend time with each other at work. 

Anyway, last month I was cat sitting while she was out of town on a work trip and she came to pick the cat up and as she was getting into her car to leave and she gave me a hug, took her bag, gave me another hug and she said ""I love you"".   Not like a casual ""luv ya bye"" like I sometimes say to my friends.  Needless to say it caught me off guard and I did not respond.  About 2 weeks later it happened again!  Where we were parting and she said ""I love you"". I said it back. Also there are times when we hug probably longer than we should and the other day we were out drinking w friends casually and she was sitting next to me and she said ""Don't leave me hanging hold my hand"". I kind of laughed it off.  She doesn't really do this with other people at work. 
Problem now is that I really find myself liking her and although we can not be in a relationship I cannot stop thinking about her. Believe or not I sometimes think she is just being overly friendly and I am reading into things too much but now more and more it is becoming a distraction and I can't think straight.  She is the kind of person that everyone is attracted to and everyone at work loves so maybe it is all in my imagination. She is pretty friendly with everyone at work but I seem to get more time w her as she seeks me out but maybe she does that w other people too..  if she does she doesn't get much work done then..   Maybe I am just crushin. 

  I am not really ever gonna ask her out because she is married.  But man if we ever find ourselves out alone together especially if we have been drinking I don't think I will be able to stop myself from making a potentially bad decision.  What is going on here?

I’m in the process of losing weight but can’t lose it all overnight. I want to get on bumble, but I’m an overweight woman. I’ve been told I have been pretty-face multiple times and previous boyfriends like “thicker” I guess idk. Also I’ve been told my personality, openness, and sense of humor always seem to be a plus from what friends and guys have told me. 

Losing weight is the primary goal of 2022, but I would like to date in the meantime. However, I heard/seen so many men complain about overweight women matching with them instead of the women they deemed “hot.” 

In addition to that I’ve heard so many guys talk about settling for lesser to have someone. I honestly don’t want that. If they're not attractive to me physically, then a relationship and my time are wasted. I don’t want to disappoint a guy or have him like me cause of my personality.

Also, am I crazy for thinking about this guy years later and multiple boyfriends later?


For background:

In university, I (24F) had a male best friend (we were in the same classes and spent almost all hours of the day together). For years, I had feelings for him but didn’t act on them and always wondered whether he reciprocated or not. Towards the end of our friendship, we had a few drunk encounters where he would confess his “feelings” of being more than friends, but when sober, it was never discussed and i had assumed he had forgotten. Finally after one of these drunk encounters, the next morning he showed up at my apartment and re-confirmed all of these feelings. We decided to start dating, but the school year soon came to an end and we decide to do long distance for the summer. (It all felt very fairy tale-like)

We almost immediately broke up because it was too hard for us to start a romantic relationship long distance. But the beak up came with the assumptions that we would resume our relationship when school restarted.

Come the new school year, I went back excited, only to quickly be met with his cold shoulder. I wondered why and then quickly discovered that he had a new girl friend. I continued to see him basically every single day but we barely spoke because I was so hurt and clearly still in love with him. I started to avoid him as much as possible until graduation. He moved away.

Years later I would still find my self thinking about him, despite getting into new relationships. Recently, when I was single and I noticed that he was also single, I messaged him to tell him that I wasn’t happy with the way things played out between the 2 of us. He apologized for his part and agreed. We haven’t talked since. We both live on opposite sides of the country now, but a part of me still hopes that there might be a future for us.


Back to my questions, which might be a bit silly but:

Am I crazy for thinking about him about him all these years later, with very little contact?

Do guys experience these type of strong feelings for someone they have lost contact with?

What's the dating culture like where you live? 

For me, as a 24 year old hetero male in a 400-500k city in a western country (not the U.S.), here are a few aspects of what our dating culture is like:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Dating"" someone is referred to here to mean the time in which you are going on dates *before* becoming exclusive; *e.g. we dated for x months and then got into a relationship on y.*
* I've never heard women mention men's height in any capacity, let alone in the kinds of discriminating ways I see in American dating culture. I regularly see women with below average height men that are close together in height (and we have similar average height to the U.S.).
* Attractive men are viewed as ""untrustworthy"" and ""only for short-term not relationships"". Doubly so if you're in good shape. I frequently see attractive women with men who looks/weight wise are *much* less attractive than they are.
* Flirting never happens here, I've never seen a woman show any of the so-called ""signs or IOIs"" towards me nor towards anyone else. Ditto for things like dropping hints, saying something suggestive, touching, and all of the other things thrown around in ""signs he/she/they are interested"".
* People here generally don't talk to people they don't know in any situation. You could go out every weekend to multiple venues and 95% of the time no one says a word to anyone outside of their little cliques and social groups. I've never had anyone speak to me while out and about (even doing errands) unless they knew me or they had to.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140169,public,self,What's the dating culture like where you live?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnd2st/whats_the_dating_culture_like_where_you_live/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

She just caught my attention and I'd like to ask her out on a date. But I'm a little unsure how to do it. The way I see it, I can go about it in two ways. 

The first way, I could just ask her out right away. Walk in the shop, order something, and maybe ask her out and mention that she simply caught my eye. That's the easy and quick way, but maybe not the safest way. 

Then there's the other way. I could go slowly and play it really safe. I could start off by making some conversations with her now and then, whenever I'm there. And then I could then ask her out once I build up a rapport with her. 

I'm torn on what to do. The first one has a higher risk of immediate rejection, but I sort of prefer that approach because it makes my intentions clear right away and it doesn't waste much of her time, or mine. The second one is playing it safe but I could end up in the friendzone or worse, being seen as the weird guy who talks too much. So I'm still not sure.

It was a very emotional breakup - neither one of us really wanted to, but our goals in the relationship didn't align (namely the subject of having kids), so we felt like there was no future in it.

I loved her, though I never had to courage to tell her that. After the breakup, we contacted each other only 1-2 times, but it was too painful. After a couple months I realized it was a mistake, and I tried texting and calling her, but got no reply. I even wrote her letters in the mail.

I ended up moving out of state, mostly for a good job opportunity, but also a chance to start over. I've tried getting back into dating, but it feels like I'll never have the same level of emotion like I had with her. It almost feels like a subconscious notion that nothing will ever be as good as what it was with her.

I think about her a lot. I haven't tried reaching out to her again because A) I don't want to run the risk of having a restraining order filed against me and B) I now live out of state so it doesn't really seem to matter. For all I know, she's found someone else and is perfectly happy.

I'm not sure how to move on from this. It feels like I traded love in for a good career and salary, and that I won't ever feel that way again. I know it's silly to think that way, but I've gone on so many online dates and all of them are just so vapid. I haven't felt the ""spark"" since I was with my ex.

We live 2.5 hours away from each other and are going to be moving in together and renting in a flat next week.

The new flat will be 2 hours away from her current house, and 1 hour away from my place.

The job my gf is getting, she’s been trying for a very long time to get it, and got it in the city I’m living in, hence where the idea of renting and living in together came from. My situation at home is already complicated, so having the discussion of moving out with her was stressful but as it’s an opportunity she doesn’t want to lose out on, I sort of said I’ll move out with her as we are also a couple.

I’m the only child and me and my mum have lived together since I was born. She’s always been there for me and raised me up. My dad who currently lives with us, only just came back from living abroad 2 months ago. He’s going to return back abroad next month, which will leave my mum alone. He’s not lived with us for around 6-7 years as they’ve separated.

My dad is early 70s and mum is early 60s.
My GFs dad is early 50s and her mum is early 40s. There is a big age difference I know which puts me at a disadvantage.

Now that I’m moving out very soon, my mum is upset, feels worried that she’s going to be alone in the flat, lonely and depressed (she’s unemployed due to health issues and at home everyday on her phone on social media interacting with people that she doesn’t know). Her being alone might make her more lonely and depressed? She says it’ll be more depressing when my dad goes back abroad next month.

At first she didn’t want me to move out, but now she’s accepting it but has recently said that she and my dad are getting old and they’re feeling weak. My dad is struggling to walk and limps, my mum can’t lift her arm up fully and has muscle pains. It makes me really sad. Then she says they aren’t going to be around forever so I should spend as much time as I can with them. Which I want to, but because of my current situation, I feel I’m being dragged away by my GF.

I’ve already said I’m going to make the effort and come see her 1-2 times a week. Although I know I’m going to be quite busy with work, I’m still going to try once a week, but my friend thinks the ‘1-2 times a week’ will slowly decrease and end up being 1-2 times a month. Which I’m very scared about.

My mum has no friends and has no job. She’s got some health issues where she isn’t able to walk too much or lift heavy stuff. Sometimes I tell her that I’ve told her many times when she’s had opportunities to be friends with people or keep the friendship, she chooses not to and it’s her fault for preferring to be alone and have no friends as she enjoys not socialising with anyone.

A big part of me wants to stay and a small part wants to move. But as she’s feeling so stressed and upset about it, I’ve already had to rethink this moving out decision many times already.

I would feel sad that I’m not able to be with her during the times where she gets older (example if I saw her in a few months and she’s changed a lot, that would make me really sad inside as she’s already getting old and complains she’s weak and has muscle pain). And my dad going back abroad doesn’t help. I’ve not seen him for around 3-4 years and haven’t lived with him for 6-7 years. I don’t want the time of not seeing each other to extend even more when he goes back.

Some say I shouldn’t leave and just tell the GF I have to take care of my mum, and if she wants to leave then let her as there’s plenty of fish in the sea and I only have one mum?

A lot of people say I should leave as it’s unfair for me to care for her throughout my whole life and not live my own life?

For some context, I’m autistic, have OCD, and wouldn’t be surprised if I’m depressed (daily suicidal thoughts are fun)—however, despite my (many) mental issues, I’m an outgoing guy, who has no trouble making friends/meeting new people. 

I just finished my first semester of college not too long ago; this is the first time I’ve actively put myself out there, as opposed to just waiting for a relationship to come to me, and I’ve had some success in this. My mindset was also real good at the time; I was quite confident in myself, and didn’t think too much about rejection. However, a combination of my mental illness and my inexperience with dating cut this success off; I waited too long to realize that I had feelings for one FWB who was into me (and became despondent when she moved on), and then went full OCD on another and scared her away. This sent me into a bit of a tailspin; I shot my shot a lot, got rejected a lot, had a few people lose interest (talked to a LOT of people) and all this gave a pretty major ding to my self-esteem/confidence. I’ve been feeling pretty depressed this entire break, and have been reading way too many “woe-is-me” type posts on similar subs; this (obviously) does not help my mental state. 

How should I proceed in light of all this? I get fixated on stuff with my OCD, and I’m thinking this might be an expression of that. I understand that the best move would probably be to take a break for a good while and work on myself, but I *really* don’t want to stop putting myself out there/meeting new people, especially in college (again, outgoing guy). I’m real scared that I’ll cultivate/have already cultivated a woe-is-me/desperate mindset, and that it’ll become deeply entrenched in my psyche.

And hopefully get some insight from you all. 

I'm a 24 y/o dude with pretty limited dating/relationship experience. So, on a whim I decided to try out online dating starting about 1.5 months ago. 

I matched with Girl #1 and went on a few dates with her--from what I could tell through those few weeks, she was kind, supportive, funny. She was definitely ""cooler"" than me, so I felt kind of intimidated at times, that she would think I was boring but I don't think it was a big deal to her. We didn't have a whole lot in common and we had pretty different (but not incompatible) personalities. Still, we did have a fun back-and-forth through text, and I felt excited whenever she would message me. Definitely laughed a lot through text. However, I found it kind of hard to keep the conversation flowing in-person at times. Also, I don't know if this is or should be normal but after our dates, I'd feel pretty spent and tired. And while I'm not the most ""mature"" guy out there, I felt like we were on different wavelengths in that sense. 

I overthink a lot. I know this isn't a good mindset, but every time I kind of get interested in someone, I automatically think about whether I would want to be with this person long-term, and if the answer is no or ""eh"", I get confused or subconsciously less interested. And me being a naive guy thinking that things are supposed to have a ""spark"" and magically click within the first few weeks, decided to end things with Girl #1. 

Fast forward to now, I've been on a few dates with Girl #2. We have a LOT in common. Unfortunately, she's a pretty boring texter so I don't have nearly the same level of excitement through text as I did with Girl #1. But in-person, I just feel so comfortable and find it so easy to talk to her. I don't feel tired at all despite spending hours with her. She's also (from what I can tell) kind, supportive, funny. 

While I really do like Girl #2, there's something I can't shake. I just don't feel as ""excited"" about her, which is really hard to describe. She's definitely very comfortable, but there was something about the butterflies that the Girl #1 made me feel that I catch myself thinking about. 

What is wrong with me? Why is it that when I'm with Girl #1, I end up wanting ""comfort"", and when I'm with Girl #2, I end up thinking about ""excitement""? All this makes me feel like I'm too immature, and that I should step back and work on myself before getting into a relationship.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140219,public,self,Keep getting confused on figuring out what I want in a partner,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rngas3/keep_getting_confused_on_figuring_out_what_i_want/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

I used to date this girl 5 years ago in high school. Back then we knew it was not working out and decided to stop seeing each other, it was easy because we weren’t in deep love and then we left the city for going to different colleges.

In that 5 year span i dated 5 different girls, some became long term relationships and some were short. But after all of those girls i decided to take a break from dating i wanted to focus in professional life and personal growth and a break up was going to affect those areas of my life. That made think i was not ready for a relationship because if i were it wouldn’t affect those parts my life. After year without dating i learnt so much about life and joy, discovered a bunch of new hobbies and discovered a lot of stuff about me, tried new things that always wanted to try. I even got a new and better job at a different company.

So, this is where the problems begin. We re-meet at this company. She got hired the same day i did. Everything started as a friendship but i promise myself that i wont see her as a prospect, but somehow we started dating again, this brought back old behaviors so i tried to lift the gas pedal and avoided sex at all cost.

Last night was the christmas party of the company and we ended up at her place having sex. I am not gonna lie, it was amazing as the old good times. But the issue is that, today i can’t stop thinking about her, i have been avoiding her messages. I feel with no motivation and don’t want to do anything, i was in bed all day. That’s exactly what i wanted to avoid. I love her, but i can’t stand that feeling of no controlling my own life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140221,public,self,Day after sex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rngfzg/day_after_sex/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

Everyone told me that he is not a reliable and kind man and i should run as fast as I can (the entire story is in my previous post).

Anyway, here's a question I have. I am actually from another culture (South Asia) and came to the US around two years back. I know dating norms are different here than my country as I am quite conservative. With this man, when we first started talking, i told him clearly that i want to wait until marriage for sex.... that it is my preference to stay virgin until marriage. I'm in my late twenties.

The man, who is around in his late forties, agreed to that. He told me that he's looking for marriage in an year or so (he wanted children too), and so waiting for the this amount of time is okay with him - I told him this very early so that he can decide for himself. We had a few conversations over this and he always told me he respects it and is okay with waiting until marriage (he's NOT a virgin (he's too old lol), so it was my requirement... and not something coming from him. But as long as he seemed fine with it, everything was good.

Despite knowing this very well, he invested a lot of time and money in me. He would always initiate dates, drive for an hour or so to meet me, take out at expensive places, introduced me to his family, discussed about our future together, texts/call everyday, a lot of attention, compliments etc, basically love-bombed me for around 7 weeks or so... and then it started to feel that things began to slow down. Less dates, less texts/calls, and then blocking/unblocking games, being abusive, then slow ghosting etc. (the entire story is in my previous post).

Whatever happened, there is one question I have: do you think the situation could have been controlled if i was open to sex before marriage? Could having a sexual relationship stop this behavior? Would he have not faded out like this if he was getting sex from me? Or if a man loses interest, it is regardless of whether he's getting sex or not?

i had my first kiss freshman year of college (lol) and basically it went bad because the guy just wanted to hookup. im already super reserved around guys but i think that incident made me put my walls up even more because i don’t wanna go through that hurt again. i haven’t done anything with a guy since but the older ive gotten the more i think there’s something wrong with me. i wish i wasn’t so reserved with guys but it’s really just the way i am. i don’t think ill ever find a guy who will be patient enough for me to get comfortable. i think im just scared of getting close to guys because i don’t wanna get hurt. im someone who loves deeply and i just know a breakup would completely ruin me. 

i understand and well aware that a lot of not being able to find a bf is my fault. im always too shy to start the conversation or anything like that. im honestly trying to get better at it but at this point i don’t even have anyone interested in me. im also not a fan of dating apps and hope to meet someone organically like through mutual friends. i go out to clubs/bars with friends a lot (pre-covid) but idk i never go up to guys first and i feel like every guy there just wants to hookup.

Girl number 1 [F27] is a friend that we started dating about 2 months ago. I really like her, when we are together is amazing. We are like that perfect couple on the honeymoon phase. But here is the problem when we are not together it’s bad. She doesn’t know how to communicate, claims that she is to busy to reply to a txt, even when the reply is to tell me where she is Bc she just ask me to go meet her. Not just that we go out 2-3 days in a raw after that she disappears don’t a answer to a single txt or call for another 2-3. All that and in all this time we had no sex none.

Me and girl 2 drink, talked and before the night was over we went back to my place and had sex all night.  Now she txt me regularly asking how I am, wanting to hangout again and being nice and flirting with me, it’s effortless to talk to her and have a nice conversation. I was supposed to go out with her yesterday but girl number 1 decided to come out of riding and my idiot ass went running right back to her, and as always 2 good day together and today she invites me out only to tell me 1h later she was to stay home a little longer and will call me later. But she never does and I know she is out Bc her girl friend post pics of the two of them together.

I personally have no problem with my body and I make sure that I never get fat and easily maintain a 8 - 10% body fat percentage at all times. I had some people tell me to go the gym, but like I said I don't really want to change my body for anyone and I don't have a desire to get big. I like walks and sometimes running, I'd rather do that as I tend to have a lot of negative emotions and feelings in my life as well as depression so that helps with it and I'd rather not give myself physical tension and stress as thats not relaxing.

Have you ever been able to date someone again where the reason for the breakup wasn’t due to incompatibility, arguments, etc. and was just due to external circumstances?

If so, how did it go? If not, let me know your experience too!

Am I suppose to be with multiple women or selfishly give my all to one human being? 

I’ve been to plenty of places with friends so why is sexual intimacy the only differentiating factor.

I’m an extremely open book and super easy to read.

Am I just overthinking this whole thing?

I think, we think, the same because all the information everyone has is easily accessible by anyone. So no one should know anything less than anyone else about anything. No one is dumb in this planet. 

It’s kinda awesome. But I’m still confused about why I’m only interested in a monogamous relationship, but only commit to the idea when I need to rather than practice the idea. 

I think I’m monogamous in relationships, but act like I’m not by trying to date different women. And trying to genuinely fall in love with multiple women at once. 
How is that not cheating? 

It is definitely immoral because they are doing things I don’t know but I have to assume it’s similar.

How am I suppose to feel about my partner? Is that person cheating? Or are they just as scared that the one their looking isn’t gonna look for them because finding the one in 7 billion ones is almost impossible.

It sucks

I’m not unfaithful but these ideas are so intimate that I feel like an idiot for not seeing it until now. I feel everyone feels heartbreak when someone they want to date hits on another woman because the two are unsure.

So am I overthinking the idea or is monogamy and polyamory just defined after the relationship is established?  What if one persons wants an open relationship because they enjoyed the experience of finding the one for them so much that they want that connection again but just not with the same person.

Is dating then wrong? Should we all be automatically assigned to people based on hot hot we look and likeness of interests? 

Does it even matter?

Isn’t that easier and closer to love than anything else?

Maybe my ideas are born of my insecurities and lack of self confidence but still. 
I know someone out there thinks like me, does what I do, and does the opposite and still loves who I am.

Either way, what then of monogamy? It’s a selfish idea that there’s only 1 for 1. What of the that extra 1? The one who will never find that person.

Maybe I am that one. Maybe I’m arguing a pointless cause because they are monogamous.

Therefore for us to be perfect we would have to be monogamous and therefore I am to be forever alone.

If I were to ruin it then it would be like ruining my own relationship.

So in my forced monogamy I give up the one I love for her sake because I love him just as much because I must love myself just as much.

He and I are the same in mind but not body. Her infidelity casting doubt on our non existent metaphysical relationship.
She is polyamorous by force. She is a cheater because I love her or faithful because I let her go.
