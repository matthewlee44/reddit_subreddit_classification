0,pk1jjn,1631067733,Am I a bad person?,"So let me start by saying I know this will sound awful but please bare with me as I try and explain. 

So I (23f) have been single now for 4 years. This is completely 100% by choice. I took 2 years to heal, one year to explore, and this last year to make big changes. With all of this being said, I am a huge hopeless romantic. I absolutely love the idea of flirting and just having fun all around. 

Sounds totally fine right? Well I have fallen into the fear path of love. First I would meet the cute online guys and talk to them for a few months then just dip. Why? Because I loved the feeling of new crushes but hated the ""maybe I can come see you?"". 

Slowly it then shifted into ""well maybe I could try some dates?"" Which only lead me to going out with these guys and having a wonderful time but always dipping after the first date. Why? Because I loved the beginning but hated the ""Wow, you are really cool. I really want to get to know you more"". 

Now I'm at the point where I realize that I'm genuinely not ready for a serious relationship because I haven't found someone I can trust. I always said I don't want serious but I also refuse to have a fwb. 

So yes. I totally lead guys on but it's not because I don't care about their feelings. I'm just really scared that I will have to commit and then lose my freedom. I'm trying really hard to stop looking at everything as a lockbox commitment. The second I feel obligated to hang out with them more than I actually want to, then I totally shut all emotions off. Yeah yeah trauma or something but please tell me I'm not alone in this? Any tips on feeling more in control in the beginning of a relationship and not leaving at the ""I want to hang out with you more"". 

I just want to be able to enjoy someone in front of me without fear looming over me. I mean I'm in college now! I should be excited for new experiences but its not fair to keep hurting good guys. I really hope this makes sense.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk1jjn/am_i_a_bad_person/
1,pk1jvw,1631067771,Please just leave me alone until I want to talk.,"I (f27) started talking and hanging out with a guy (m27) I knew when I was much younger. We were in school together probably 15 years ago. This reconnection was still just like we were strangers because we were never close when we were in school. Just acquaintances. 

We talked and bonded over interests and watch movies and ate at my house a few times. I joined him with his friends for a game night and it was fun. He never made any physical advances until he eventually asked after hanging out about 5-6 times. Not even like rubbing my foot if I pushed it up to him during a movie. After we expressed interest and kissed, we became more physical and have still not had sex. That’s fine with me. We have talked about it and that’s not the issue. 

I am a very physical person. I like to be able to be transparent with a partner and not mask my personality or anything. I have felt comfortable being myself with him. At the same time I’m also very independent and value my time alone to do things I enjoy on my own. I have found myself pulling away and being less interested now that he’s interested and we’ve both expressed interest. He’s done nothing wrong. I feel like an asshole. 
Why do I pull away when things look good for the future? 

Is it self sabotage?? 

Is he just too available and I’m registering it as dependent? Or could he be dependent?

I’m an almost 28M, and I REFUSE to get married, have kids, be a corporate slave, or conform to the lame “mature crowd”. And for anyone who tries to convince me otherwise, GTFO!

I believe in “working to live” not “living to work”. I am ambitious about the things I’m actually passionate about (and it pisses me off that I discovered these late but that’s another topic).

I don’t want to get married. Or at least I’m undecided on marriage. I never got to have that “discovery phase” that everyone else got. I want that. I refuse to be the guy women settle down for once they have all their fun. And I refuse to marry or settle with the first girl I date. It would take a damn near perfect woman to change my mind on marriage. Especially if it were a first relationship. But yeah marriage for now seems lame to me. Also a huge risk given rates of divorce, and I refuse to be another alimony case!

It’s not like the sex is bad either. This is also usually following talking almost every day, if not everyday and seeing each other as our schedules allow. 

Intimacy is a hard thing for me given my past relationship and I’ve even gotten the whole “you’re fun, I totally wouldn’t mind a FWB scenario if you’re into that”.

But we’ve been talking and we actually FaceTimed last night and it was chill we talked for like 2 hours. I didn’t really expect her to message me the next day just cause I assumed she’d expect me to. So I asked her out for the weekend and although her response had less excitation than I expected, she was down.

But her responses are definitely pretty dry, I’m asking her questions and she’s answering and randomly throws me a question but rarely. So I’m like okay does she wanna talk to me or not cause I’m not even a good texter like I mentioned before so I don’t wanna be annoying and rather just know if she’s not interested instead of throwing stupid questions out there, but I guess I should wait ?
I’m not really sure how this even works since I just got the app but I feel like if I didn’t carry the conversation it would just die which makes me think she ain’t into it.

11,pk2pgq,1631072163,Experiences in online dating in recent years?,"Tried OKCupid, Tinder (yeah I know not great for actual DATING but whatever), Hinge and Bumble.

Tried it before maybe 3 or 4 years ago, and again about 2 or 3 years before that. I had a decent amount of success, went on a few dates, met some interesting people, it was nice.

So far in the last year the vast majority (i mean literally 8/10) of the profiles are either obviously fake, have maybe 1 or 2 pictures and no descriptions whatsoever, or are people from the Philippines changing their location (not to mention all the people actually from my country ALSO changing their location and really located on hundreds of miles away).

I'm not ugly, maybe slightly above average, I'd say a 6/10, 7/10 on a good day, and I'm fine with that, I'm even willing to believe that my profiles are not up to snuff and that's hurting my experience, but is anyone else finding it nearly impossible to even FIND profiles of real people, within 100 miles?

17,pk32fa,1631073606,How to combat dehumanization on your online dating profile,"I am giving this advice from a man's perspective, though I came to these conclusions through both talking to women my age (I'm 23) that I am platonically close with, and through trying it out for myself; I do  feel that other ages and genders could also benefit from it though. I also exclusively use hinge  which makes implementing this advice a lot easier, but I'm sure it would still be useful on other apps. Anyway, here we go-

* **Show what your personality brings to the table** 
   * If you were to ask your friends and family what one thing they consider to be the biggest defining aspect of  your personality, what would they say? That you're high energy, cool under pressure, animated, goofy, serious, thoughtful, outgoing, shy, very organized, etc? Whatever you think they would say, someone looking at your profile should be able to tell that about you based on your pictures, how you answer prompts, or ideally both. 
* **State your values**
   * What is most important to you, that you strive to live up to, that drives most of the decisions you make? Is it that you always put your family first? That you always want to be able to take pride in doing a good job? Do you constantly push yourself professionally? Are you here for a good time, or a long time? What specifically makes you a good person? You don't need to convey all of your values, but someone reading your profile should know something about *how you live your life* and *what values drive you to live that way*. 
* **If you can show it, don't tell it!**
   * Hobbies, work, cool vacation stories, favorite sports teams, etc. are all fantastic to put on your profile, but your space to write text is often super limited. Use that limited space to talk about things that cannot be easily shown in a picture or video, such as your values or parts of your personality that are hard to show. If you don't have pictures of your hobbies and adventures, get them! If it's a hobby or activity that doesn't show well in a picture or video, you need to get creative and find a way to show it and not just tell it. (looking at all my fellow video gamers out there- Throw an esports viewing party and take pics, or record your reaction to something crazy happening in a game, the sky's the limit- put yourself out there, and show your personality while you do your thing!)
* **It's not about standing out, it's about standing out** ***to the right people***
   * A common thing I see on this sub is how to stand out against everyone else, particularly for guys as women often get overwhelmed with matches. If you are looking for something more serious, the question isn't about standing out against others in general, its about how to stand out to the kind of person you're compatible with- and there is no better way of doing that than conveying your personality and values through your profile. Of all the couples I know that met through OLD, both partners usually something along the lines of ""They said \_\_\_\_ in their profile and that really resonated with me and showed that they were really \_\_\_\_ , which is something I look for in a partner."" Don't prioritize putting things on your profile that appeal to most people- put things on there that will *really strongly appeal to the right people.* That's how you stand out and really hook the interest of a good potential match.  

Bringing a profile up to this standard takes a lot of effort, careful consideration, and self reflection, not to mention time- it'll probably take several days of thinking and revising at a minimum- you need to seriously commit to digging deep, reflecting on who you are, and then figuring out how to effectively show that to others in the limited space you have, so that ***at a glance they get an idea of who you are as a person- not just what you do or what your interests are.*** For me, the results were very much worth it. After bringing my profile in line with this advice, my number of matches stayed about the same, but the quality of my matches drastically, *drastically* improved, way more of my matches resulted in actual dates, and those dates on average went far better than they had gone prior to my profile revamp.

We're all out there looking for a meaningful human connection- so show the world what is meaningful to you as a human! Spruce up that profile so that you're more than just a swipe in a sea of matches- you'll only be seen as a unique individual as much as you show yourself as a unique individual!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk32fa/how_to_combat_dehumanization_on_your_online/

25,pk3p7w,1631076193,"Me (F27) and my bf (M28) had big fight and he has change positively since then, but . .","This might be a very long post. 

We had a big fight 3 months ago because of his lack of attention to me. He literally will only text me once a week and that's it. He's a gamer and he's unemployed. I had a conversation about this issue, twice. But he stayed the same. He changed for a week then back to his old habit. 
No text. No call. No nothing. 

We have only been together for 4 months at that point. So I thought, I should break up with him now to not waste anymore of my time. So I sent him a text telling him that I wanna a break up. He kinda defensive at first. He then begged me not to leave him the next day. He promised to change and will text me every single day, so I trust him and give him another chance. Suprisingly, he did text me everyday (or everytime i didn't text him that day) until today, it has been 3 months since our big fight.

I know I should be happy about this. I am. But, he only text me at night and he did not respond immediately to my texts, we text for few hours (with very little conversation). He never calls (unless I asked him to). But whenever we're on the phone, he sounds really happy and will not let me hang up the phone until I fell asleep (because I'm working during the day).

He did say he loves me once in awhile. We're not the romantic couple. We call each other by name. No darling, babe, honey, etc. I did call him baby once on the phone, and he make sounds and said ""bruhh"". Never did I call him baby anymore since then.

My question is; Does he or does he not love me as he claims to be? Should I continue this relationship? 

Idk if this relevant to this question but all of his friends knows about me and he proudly introduce me to his friends. We usually on call while his gaming with his friends. So it is safe to say that he's not cheating and he is proud to have me as his girlfriend. The only thing is the way he treats me.

I want dates that aren't just going out to nice restaurants, I want to plan stuff together.

Would you be upset if you found out that someone that you’re having consistent raw sex with was pursuing others and talking (in a non friendly manner)? 

We expressed mutual feelings of interest in one another and we did talk about working on personal problems (communication issues etc) because we wanted to eventually be together… but I didn’t realize that one of those issues would consist of seeing other people.

I really like this girl, but I can never get words out to her because she always seems like she’s in a hurry to finish her work. And when she’s not, she doesn’t speak much back.

I've had the ""crash and burn"" before, but this was different. We talked about it, were both completely on the same page with our feelings, and it was amazing. Neither of us had felt this way before. Yes, that sounds silly but I promise you it was very real. I was out of town for 2 weeks so we couldn't meet right away. First date we couldn't keep our hands off each other and were ""deep in the feels."" She invited me back to her place after dinner...no sex but it was intense. Second date we made a point get to know each other more, but she still invited me back to her place. It was a pretty incredible night and strangers were commenting on how cute we were together. She said yes to another date.

Since that night (for about 4 days), I barely hear from her, and when I do it's very brief. She hasn't to talk or end things, so I want to believe everything's fine. She's normally very direct and communicative, so it wouldn't be like her not to address something. But, my gut is telling me something is off. I'm planning to call her tomorrow night and schedule the third date. If there's an issue hopefully she'll say something, but I wonder if I should ask what's going on?

I also wonder if I'm overreacting. If she's moving on, I think I at least deserve a phone call from her before I have to ask. Ironically she's a couples therapist, so you think she would know better.

Anyways, I met this girl off a dating app, chatted for a bit, swapped numbers and took her out twice so far in the past month. I'm assuming things are going well since the texting back and forth is still consistent and the dates both ended with us feeling like time passed by too fast. The chemistry is good between us and we both have similar personalities (infp and infj) plus she agreed to a third date afterwards.

With that said, I am a bit confused about pacing. I tend to be a bit more serious when I do date and prefer to really get to know someone before things get too involved. If I could I would flat out skip the small talk and ask the deeper questions but obviously don't because I don't want to come off too strong. Plus I do have other matches on the app and not sure if it's fine to see those other girls at the same time.

Since it has only been a month with her, when is a good time to get deeper and more personal, is it ok to talk with and see other girls, when does exclusivity happen, does making things physical speed it up.

46,pk5fe2,1631084340,"Incel sues Bumble for ""discrimination"" against men.","So today I got a very interesting email from Bumble, which I've used a while ago, saying that apparently I am eligible for some 3 million dollar claim cause some jealous dude sued them for giving women an advantage. Isn't that the purpose of the app though? I actually like having women message me first for numerous reasons, especially since it isn't a cliché when guys gotta do all the work. So this just very strange...

Here is an excerpt from an article that I've found relating to this lawsuit:

*Certain Bumble app users are eligible to benefit from a $3 million settlement resolving claims of discrimination in Bumble messaging.*

*The Class is made up of Bumble app users in California who used the app between May 29, 2016, and July 1, 2021, and identified as a man interested in women.*

*A class action lawsuit had accused Bumble of discriminating against male app users who identified as being interested in women because the Bumble app only allows women to send messages first.*

*The Bumble dating app grew to* ***100 million users*** *in 2020, according to Business of Apps.*

*Bumble denies any allegations of wrongdoing, and the Court has not ruled in favor of either party.*

*Instead, the parties have agreed to a settlement resolving the issue in order to avoid the cost and burden of moving forward with litigation.*

*If the Court grants final approval in the settlement, each Class Member who had an active Bumble app account on the notice date and does not ask to be excluded from the settlement will receive a one-time deposit of 20 free Super Swipes — a total benefit value of $31.98 —  in their Bumble app account.*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk5fe2/incel_sues_bumble_for_discrimination_against_men/

51,pk694q,1631088709,Should I go out with him again? [LONG POST],"I(21f) met a guy(21f) on bumble a while back. He lived quite close and has the same University background as me so we hit it off quite soon. We ended up meeting the same week in a garden nearby and had a walk where we discussed about life and career. Overall I loved the vibe and I was more than happy to be his friend if he didn't want to date. 

After the first meet ,we had a good convo over text where he expressed his desire to meet more often for such walks as we lived too close. I willingly agreed. Then a day after the first meet , he asked to meet again in the evening. We even decided that we would confirm the plan in the evening. After that he went offline and I pinged him in the evening to ask the status about the plan but he didn't reply. I felt he must be asleep and evening naps aren't that uncommon in my friend circle so I didn't think much of it. I got a reply from him at night about how he had slept and he was sorry and we could try meeting tomorrow and I was like we will see. 

Next day he again asks to meet and I told him that in case he is going to take a nap just inform me prior to that. He says fine and then when it's almost time to meet in the evening I recieve a text from him that he got a meeting related to university work and I tell him to get his work done and we can meet some other time in the most understanding way possible. He says he will manage something and abruptly goes offline and comes back online after 1 hour and says can we meet now. I was already out at this point and was a little pissed too cause I have told him that I can only take out certain time out of my schedule and I was ok if he was not able to make it but his delayed response in conveying that sucked. Had he told me he would come late I would have called some other friend for a walk( it is nice to have company sometimes). 

After this I resolved that I won't meet him and will just text( cause we have some real nice convos at times). But a few days later he shares some problem he was facing and we had a very late night convo regarding the same and I assured him that it would be alright. He suddenly asks if I would like to meet him the next day and I say that I am not sure if he would turn up. He said he was sorry about the last time and I can trust him. After legit asking him a 100 times if he would turn up I get a little assured and we make a plan. We are supposed to meet at 4. And I get a text at 3:55 that he will be there in 15 mins. 

I feel all is well and I go and wait for him at the meeting spot. Suddenly he pings me that he has some work regarding the problem he faced yesterday. I ask if he can still turn up or no. He says he is coming, so I wait for a while but no sign of him. He is not coming online either. He doesn't pick up my call either. Finally he does after 10 mins and says he got stuck and he is coming. I feel like a fool for trusting him but I was actually out of home at this point vand didn't want to go back cause I live with parents and they are strict and they would not approve of tinder dates so explaining them why I returned so quick would have been impossible. Hence, I am stuck outside waiting for a guy and he finally shows up at 4:40. 

I am in rage and he apologises. Going back is not an option, so I do go out with him for 2 hours and we roam around and have a good banter. My mood is back to normal. We part on good terms. But I make up my mind to not meet him again. Also he went out of the city for a week after that and is yet to return. 

But he has started asking me to meet me this weekend once he is back. But I told him honestly that I don't trust him enough. He keeps on saying he is really sorry and it was the circumstances and all. But I am not sure so I have made up my mind to not meet. But the vibe with this person was too good. And he does text with me often. 

He says he likes me. He really wants to meet me. But his actions have proved otherwise. Is that possible that he couldn't show 3 times due to some genuine circumstances or was he not interested in the first place? Right now he is begging me to meet again. But I am firm I don't want to.

53,pk6ds7,1631089381,It feels like the relationship doesn't even exist anymore,"I (24M) love my long distance girlfriend (24F) and I would HATE to break up with her, just the thought makes me curl up in sadness. But I feel like I'm holding on a thread here. 

**Tl;dr: How do I fix my mindset when I know logically that I should be patient with my girlfriend because she’s temporarily very busy with her career, but I struggle to do so?**

Here’s the story:

We used to call 20 minutes a day, or even longer at times. Now we've reached a point where we don't talk for days on end aside from the texts/voice messages we send when we're both awake. I'm trying to understand that she just resumed classes in law school and she may be really busy. But I struggle to reconcile with the idea that she could be so busy she can't make time to talk to me anymore. I mean, is that even possible?

I've talked to her about scheduling regular talks, but she just seems aloof all the time. Her original suggestion was to call while she walks to school, to which I said that while I would prefer another time because I want to sleep early, I'd be down for it if there was no better choice. She said she could call while preparing for classes. I agreed. But every day since, she's cancelled. I confronted her about this and she said she just can't make time happen. I don't think she even apologized for flaking. She said she's usually freer to make time around one hour before I wake up, but she wouldn't ask that of me. I told her that by all means she could if that was the only choice. She said she'll figure out a schedule and will try to call on the weekend. She hasn't. 

I'm trying REALLY hard to be patient, but if two people in a relationship can neither see nor talk to each other, I feel like the relationship doesn't exist anymore. She's the first woman I've ever actually loved and I really wanna make this work, but sometimes I can't help my brain thinking I'm the only one who's trying. I know logically that's far from the truth, but my emotions get the better of me sometimes. 

To add to that, she's previously asked me to send her a voice message greeting her good morning everytime I wake up. I had initially resisted the idea because there are days when I'm just not in the mood. Despite that, she made it known how important it is to her, so I eventually agreed. These days, it feels like a third of the few conversations we're having is just me saying good morning, her replying, and us going back and forth a little. 

I hate what I've become. I try to avoid having more talks about having more time for each other. Because even though I frame the conversations as having more time for ""each other"", silently, I know it's just me asking for more of her time when she already has most she needs of mine. Mostly, when we talk about time, I feel like I'm just begging. 

The other day, she called me out of nowhere to my pleasant surprise, but when I got to saying, ""I've missed you, there's so much I want to share!"" She said, ""I have 30 minutes."" Instantly, I felt like I'm talking to a countdown timer who just goes, ""Hmm… yeah? Uh-huh."" So I tried to shift the conversation towards her by asking, ""How about you, how've you been doing, baby?"" I was expecting more details about her life and she just basically  said she's tired and very busy. She said she needed to sleep after just ten minutes, instead of the intended 30. I playfully protested a little, to which she said, ""You know I didn't have to call you. Would you prefer I don't talk to you at all?""

When we started dating, I was very vocal about wanting an open relationship so I wouldn't have to adjust too much, but she's super into monogamy so I agreed to be monogamous. I think that through time she noticed how miserable I am about my inability to be with her physically, so she told me she would allow me to have sex with other women temporarily. I declined her offer because I knew she wasn't completely comfortable with it and the pandemic helped start me to be more comfortable with monogamy. Now I'm so tempted to ask again because of how absent she is. But I won't.

In terms of solutions, I know I just need to keep myself distracted. But then the more try to occupy myself the more I want to share with her. Now it's like we don't know what's going on in each other's lives anymore. 

I love this girl and I want to hold on, so I'm desperate for advice. I'm particularly looking for ones on how to fix my mindset, but any kind is welcome. Thank you very much!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk6ds7/it_feels_like_the_relationship_doesnt_even_exist/
54,pk6dx2,1631089401,Dating two people.. simultaneously? Should I tell them? Can I do this?,"I (24F) have spent now literally YEARS of being single.
I've had some hook-ups and some ""dating"" here and there, but it never ended up going anywhere
(I know this might not be correct English, but I'm using the word ""dating"" meaning ""seeing someone"", ""going on dates"", ""not a relationship yet"")
Anyways. 
I want a relationship now. 
So I actively started going on a lot of dates (tinder and not)
Until I found a guy a liked. Let's call him C. 
C is 19 older than me. I've seen him four times now. I find him very attractive, and he seems like a very interesting person. 
Although I don't seem to understand whether he is interested in a relationship with me, or if he prefers keeping it sex-only. I see signals from him for both things, so yeah. Also there's a few things that don't convince me fully about him. 
Since there's all this uncertainty with C (I know that I could just ask him, but I somehow feel like it's too early to bring up the topic), and it's been now 2 weeks that we haven't seen eachother (it was a busy time for both), I decided to go on another date. 
Let's call this guy S. 
S is 28. And holy shit we really clicked (it was just yesterday night). I know it was only one date, but I can really see myself with this person. He has almost all of the things I was looking for in a person.
And right away I know this is going to be actual dating ending up in a relationship if things work out. I know that he doesn't want a FWB thing from me.
I did not tell S about C.

C asked me out. I said yes.
But now that I've met S I'm not really sure anymore.
I could just tell C that it's over, but what if I go on the second date with S and we realize that we don't like each other that much or whatever? 
C and I have something already. I feel really good with him and honestly don't want to just throw it in the bin.

So what do you guys think I should do? Should I be straight honest with both and tell them? How would you react if someone told you something like that?
Or should I keep it to myself to avoid pressuring them or potentially make things uncomfortable?
I mean, I feel like it's totally fine what I'm doing. I'm considering my options before taking a non reversible decision.
I care about both and don't want to be dishonest or hurt anyone's feelings

TL;DR
I'm seeing two guys at the same time and they don't know about eachother yet. The thing is I really want a relationship and feel like both would be options atm.

56,pk73kx,1631093159,Interested in a girl (she is the best friend of my buddy's girlfriend) and i thing my self is keeping me back,"Hi all, so i like this girl which is the friend of my friends's girlfriend. We met a few times she seems nice and cute, i was interested but never made a move since i didnt really get to know her because i may see her once every 2-3 weeks. One time we were playing cards and we were sitting next to each other so we were talking and making jokes and all of that, i even ""teased"" her in a funny way, it was good we were vibing (she also leaned onto me and grabbed my arm when i told her smth funny). We were vibing imo and it felt really good (i think from both sides). So in a few days i go tell my friend, you know what i like that girl and it would be nice if we can arrange a day out or smth, he says cool i would love to help. 

After 2 weeks he texts me that he is in a cafe with his girl and also her friend ( the girl i like) is coming. For some reason i lost confidence knowing that my friend's girlfriend might know that i am into her friend. I was thinking not to go but i did meet them, i avoided eye contact with her at first i didnt feel really good, but then i gained some confidence and we had a casual chat nothing more, after that we went to eat (all 4 of us together) at night it went well nothing much though between me and her, i didn't really have the chance to sit near her at night and talk. And now its been few days when thsi happened and i am getting vietnam flasbacks of what i did wrong or not. I dont know how to proceed and how to approach the situation. Somw thoughts and advices are welcome :)

We havent chat in dm yet. Didnt add yer on insta yet even when i know her insta profile

In my case, I’ve hung out with this guy four times and each time has been great. He’s smart, funny, respectful, accommodating, and has lived quite a fascinating life. He told stories about himself all night and I was so invested. But it made me realize how dull I am compared to him. Whenever it was my turn to speak, nothing could really come out of me.

I think my biggest struggle when dating is the initial meeting. I never know how to describe myself (and to be honest, I don’t enjoy doing it) and I can get incredibly awkward.

I’m curious how and why this phenomenon is happening, especially to young cis women. Would love to hear your perspectives and experiences!

If you want to be exclusive, communicate that to see if you are on the same page. If you are not, then you should not longer date them because you want different things. 

If you’re wondering if your date in a few days is still on, just say that. If it’s not you can do something else on that day.

There is no cheat code for people. Your concern with looking desperate is controlling you and you deserve to know where they stand so that you can do what’s best for you and opt out of a situation that may not be working for you. People can’t know your needs/wants without you telling them. At the end of the day, you only have yourself, so you need to make sure you are surrounded by people who make sense for you out of respect for yourself. Mature communication just makes this so much easier and less confusing.

69,pk8k0o,1631100177,tired of all the errors in the trail and error process.,"the past 6 ish months I’ve dated a few different guys. they were all different in their own ways but the one thing they had in common is how shitty most of them treated me. there was one of two guys who weren’t that bad but they definitely didn’t treat me how I deserved. The last guy I talked to (let’s call him A) before the guy I recently met (let’s call him B) lied to me the entire time and I didn’t find out until after. it kinda really fucked me up. I’m a very open and understanding person, so as long as you’re honest with me it doesn’t matter what your past/ current situation is. If I like you then it’s worth it. there is no reason to lie to me so that’s really what got me. 

I decided to stay single for a few months up until recently when I moved and met a new guy. let me tell you this guy has treated me absolutely amazing, 1000x better than any guy in my life, ever. and I don’t say that lightly I mean actually ever. He’s extremely thoughtful, we get along so well, our personalities align very well, we are both more career/ success oriented, we are into the same hobbies, he’s very honest, &amp; overall he checked every single one of my boxes. except the emotional availability box, the most important one. there were no other red flags, and believe me I was loooooking for them. 

i’m very tired of wasting my time and getting hurt and I’m really ready for something more serious. I’ve known I’ve wanted this for a little bit too and I’m willing to wait for it to come, but I got really excited that this was that one. but they just got out of a long term relationship a couple months ago and don’t know what they are ready for. and trust me I completely understand. we talked about it last night after seeing each other for a little over a month. the worst part is even though he’s not ready he was so honest with me and put my feelings first before his selfish needs. he didn’t to waste my time and end up hurting me because I expressed that I was looking for something serious from the beginning. he differed from every guy in that past in that way. he actually cared. that is what is the worst. he even checked the closure box. 

I can’t decide if I still want him in my life but I know I’m really tired of investing in people and ending up with the short end of the stick being left high and dry after constant effort. Part of me thinks if I do start dating again, am I willing to subject my heart to all that pain. this guy still wants me in his life and he said yanno I check more boxes than any other girl but he just isn’t emotionally ready. He still wants to go on adventures and come over and fuck which I would really love. But if I spend time with him and invest in this, even if it only turns out as a friendship, am I going to miss the opportunity with someone who can give me a more guaranteed future. but also why would i subject myself to more hurt and pain to find something with someone that I have with this guy. I know I want something serious but he gives me everything I would want in that except the long term commitment. I’m worried though I’ll get too hung up or hopeful for something more and if it never comes I’ll get even more hurt. 

Maybe this is a lesson I need to learn or maybe it’s a waste of time. all I know is I’m so tired of getting my heart hurt. I just wish I knew if it was worth wasting my time on building a friendship or if I should just rip the bandaid off and move on to the next.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk8k0o/tired_of_all_the_errors_in_the_trail_and_error/

However, I made a horrible mistake and I am absolutely ashamed that I did it. I was browsing Reddit and I had subscribed to some NSFW subreddits previously and while browsing Reddit, my eyes were fixated in a post where I saw the names of those models that are on Instagram. I went to Instagram and followed them. All without letting my girlfriend know whether or not she is okay with it. Later on, my girlfriend went through the people I follow on Instagram and saw that I followed new people, that too models. Turns out, she isn't okay and rightfully so. She is now feeling extremely insecure of her body and she is thinking that she isn't enough for me. At the same time, she is having serious trusting issues and I personally feel like it will be a long long time she can trust me again. 

I feel ashamed, sad, and guilty because a) I feel what I did was wrong b) I wanted to be her comfort zone and some place she can feel secure but now I ruined it c) I feel like I destroyed the most important thing in a relationship.. that is trust.

For me, 29 and in the U.K., it’s after 3-5 dates. At that point I want to see the person exclusively, start exploring sexual compatability and start spending more quality time together beyond the introductory dinner dates.

If things go well after that, I’d instigate the conversation about being ‘official’ 2-3 months after that. Obviously it can vary with each relationship but I like to wait long enough to be sure I’m not rushing into things and blinded by the excitement of a new person.

87,pkb7j5,1631110011,Every avenue for meeting people seems to have the same issues," Ok so I am (28 M) from the UK, I have been dating this time for just under a year now. My issue is that every means by which I attempt to meet women seems to have the same issue, significantly more men than women.

At some point I tried to look into this and what I found was confusing. The % ratio of men to women in the UK in my age range is supposedly almost 50/50, and yet online dating sites like tinder have 9:1 ratios, the better sites like hinge maybe 5:1 (I suspect much worse based on my experience).

Outside of online dating I run events in my local area to help people make friends, at these events similarly attendance is 90% male at best. I also do active activities in which similarly there are significantly more men or couples, at least in this case its not as bad as 9:1. To top this all off every friend group I have been involved in since I was a child has always been either 1) All men or 2) Mostly men and women who have very few female friends and never introduce them to us. When I go out drinking almost every bar seems to be majority men and generally younger people.

At this point I am baffled, I do not understand how this makes sense. How can it be that every social/active activity I choose to do has consistently significantly more men than women.

Meeting a single human female of average (or higher) attraction seems to happen once in a blue moon for me. Meeting a single human female of average (or higher) attraction who is actually my age and not a early 20s student is non-existent. My bar of attraction is not high.

It really just seems like if there really was 50% women in this country I would run into them more often, but as it stands it seems that they all just hide at home 99% of the time. It also seems that the ones you do see or meet are not dating, ever.

I have always thought that dance classes would end up being my last resort as far as dating goes because its one of the few activities where I am close to sure that there would be women, although now I am wondering if even thats true. Maybe I would book a class and end up slow dancing in a room full of men all there for the same reason. Is finding women centric things and joining them legitimately one of the few ways to meet people?

Im not a pickup artist and I hate flirting, I just want to meet people on equal ground and get to know them, hence why I run social events. Regardless I now have this image in my head that all the 28yo women in the UK just hide at home surrounded by cats and houseplants. The only way I can realistically see of meeting people regularly is to walk up to them in the street and talk but to me that seems predatory and I hate the idea of doing it. I am not a creep, I have never been called a creep by anyone, ever. I am (apparently) of average appearance or higher depending on who I ask, the people who have liked me have liked me a lot for whatever reason. Im not trying to brag, its just I know what kind of responses these posts get, this is not some weird aggressive creep post about how awful dating is, I am genuinely baffled by this entire situation.

TLDR; Why do all things I do seem to involve significantly more men than women? Where are all the single late 20s women hiding?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkb7j5/every_avenue_for_meeting_people_seems_to_have_the/

Only Did not go for kiss as she mentioned during the date that she had recently been on a 1st date with a 30 year old guy who was highly inappropriate with her on the date as he touched her thigh made her and that made her uncomfortable. She also mentioned other experiences of escalation of physical touch  that made her uncomfortable. So I decided to play it safe due to that information I heard which I now regret. Also when sitting on a bench she didn’t get super close by my side so that was the deciding factor in not kissing. Regardless, I mentioned to her that If I could see her again soon and that I had a good time at the end of the date. She mentioned that she would definitely see me soon before I leave to London which is something I mentioned, but she thinks I’m leaving sooner than I am. Planning on leaving January and I’ve mentioned before to others that I’m leaving end of October. Once I got home she texted me “ Thank you again for dinner, it was lovely talking to you! Have a good night. Talk to you soon :) “ and I replied back with “Likewise.Have a great night! Would love to go out on a second date and listen to more music :)” and she hearted the message. Reddit how recommend proceeding to setting  up a second date. Also I really wanna kiss her the next time we meet. Thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkb8js/2nd_date/

90,pkbkxe,1631111224,What does it mean when a guy only compliments you by comparing you to other women?,"TLDR:Male coworker who is interested in me  only compliments me by comparing other women to me in a negative light. I tried confronting him about it and he was dismissive. This is the only thing keeping me from going out with him. Is it a huge red flag? Honest advice pls.

I've a male coworker who's taken interest in me lately. I like talking to him for the most part and I think he's funny and attractive. The one thing that puts me off is that whenever he wants to compliment me he phrases it like ""Wow I love your dress, glad to know that at least one woman here cares about how she looks"", ""The gym is doing you a lot of good, maybe you could try motivating [female coworker] to do the same"", ""I like that hairstyle on you, I admire that you have a feminine style it really sets you apart from the others"", etc. Each compliment feels...backhanded in a weird way? I've talked to him about it, but he was pretty dismissive saying that he's just ""telling it like it is"" and it's his way of showing admiration. 

Is this a major red flag? It definitely feels like it is. I literally have no other issues with him besides this one, it's so strange to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkbkxe/what_does_it_mean_when_a_guy_only_compliments_you/

94,pkc0zn,1631112671,Why is it so difficult to find a girl who's okay with an open relationship but is still expected to be loyal.,I feel as tho as a man its natural for me to sleep with many women but unnatural for a women to do the same. Due to biology and all that jazz. But with feminism on an incline its difficult to find a women who shares my views. A women feels like she should be allowed to sleep around if the man is doing it but its not the same. I can sleep with many women without being emotionally attached to them or loving them etc. Women can lie to themselves all they want but if shes sleeping with another guy she loves him and is attached to him to some degree. In this day and age women always try to compare these things and say they dont get attached but the tolerance a women develops for a man shes sleeping with requires some form of attachment. Her allowing a man to woe her up until the point that she opens her legs to him is a whole emotional process for women but for a man none of that stuff is required. I don't want to settle but I want a women who understands that a woman sleeping around is not as bad as a women sleeping around. And for her to accept me doing it but understand that I still expect her to be loyal to me.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkc0zn/why_is_it_so_difficult_to_find_a_girl_whos_okay/

97,pkcm01,1631114450,How To Keep Building A Forming Relationship With Temporary Distance?,"So I have been dating this girl and we both like each other quite a bit. She is going to be one state away in Idaho for a month which is only going to be about a 3 hour drive, we both live in Montana, and we have only been dating for about a month. Our communication when we are apart isn't so great and I don't want to get into the habit of texting non stop since we are both very busy people. I am going to see her this weekend in Boise as I have a trip planned and will take her out but after that we might not see each other for 3 weeks.

I don't want to puppy dog her and drive West every weekend just to see her and I want to give her the space she needs to accomplish what she is setting out to accomplish.

How can I keep building this young relationship over the 3 weeks after this weekend without puppy dogging her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkcm01/how_to_keep_building_a_forming_relationship_with/
98,pkcs9p,1631114984,Why would a guy go this on a first date?,"I had a fun first date recently. I date a decent amount so I can tell when I'm vibing with someone and when I'm not. We had drinks and apps and chatted for about 3 hours. I'm in my late twenties, he's in his early thirties. 

After our date, I was going to just walk back home, but he suggested we continue hanging out and grab ice cream. We ended up getting a pint (instead of cones) and we brought it back to his apartment and ate it while watching a movie. We made out and snuggled, but he didn't try anything more (nor would I have wanted him to). I left late at night (1:00AM).

I texted him when I got home and the next day and he responded but didn't try and continue any conversation. He's in the medical field, so has been in school for a while and I was like maybe he has bad social skills?

So I waited a few days... and I texted him and asked how his weekend was and tried to start a convo. He was slow to respond and kind of short. we went back and forth a bit and then I told him I had had fun on our date and would like to get to know him better and I said –  let me know if you want to hang out again and if not, totally cool too. 

He didn't respond, which I am taking to mean he's not interested. I'm not hurt, just kind of confused? If he didn't enjoy our date, why would invite me over and want to continue to hang out? And why not just say – hey I had fun too, just not interested in continuing this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkcs9p/why_would_a_guy_go_this_on_a_first_date/
99,pkcwlu,1631115350,"How do you effectively ""apply pressure"" after a 1st date without coming off as desperate?","Some background: One of the biggest problems I've had after seemingly good dates is how to act afterwards. I often fail to strike a balance between giving her space while also reiterating my interest in her. (&amp; a 2nd date). I can unintentionally come off as desperate. 

They may simply not want a second date and I acknowledge that. I've occasionally received messages saying the ""vibe isn't there"".  But still, I think my ""after date"" approach could be much better. Sometimes the interest/desire that's there during the date just doesn't translate to text. 

Any advice on how to best capitalize after a good 1st date? To maintain interest/desire (or apply pressure) while not coming off as too needy? Thanks everyone!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkcwlu/how_do_you_effectively_apply_pressure_after_a_1st/
