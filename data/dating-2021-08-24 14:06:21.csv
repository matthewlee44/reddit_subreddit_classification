0,pau4qh,1629832557,Any of you have opportunities but never from the people you’re attracted to?,"30F here and I won’t lie I get attention from men, but never from the ones I’m actually attracted to. The guys I like are always in a relationship or don’t really even bat an eye at me. Though there are plenty of dudes that hit me up asking me out on dates.

I know what you’re gonna say, I should lower my expectations, but no I won’t. I don’t want to settle for guys I’m not interested in, meaning I could hurt them down the road. I have pressure from friends and family telling me “why not them?!”

Am I the only one? I’m sure my expectations are high but I know what I want and like. It just seems like it’s unattainable. At this rate I’ll be chasing that guy forever.

Anyways, I'm finally going back to school after a year in a half. First time being around people since this started and am terrifyingly enjoying it. Hoping to eventually find someone special while I'm here

So in my public speaking class where I sit next to this person (they prefer neutral pronouns, so im gonna go with that) and I think they look absolutely beautiful. Like completely stunning. They introduced themself and they seem like they care about and it seems like the same kinda hippy stuff that I really care about. I didn't talk to them much. I told them I like their tattoo and they said thanks and explained what it meant and then we went separate ways. A little concerned I came off as awkward (something I do a lot). 

Anyways, it's the first day of that class so I do hope I can make something happen. But like I said in the title, I'm not sure if they're Into guys. I saw on they're backpack that the straps were the LGBT rainbow. It could be of they're orientation and not assigning with anything, but im afraid it might be a little more. So on top of trying not to come off as a creep and getting to know them, I'm also concerned if I ask them and they go ""sorry, I'm not into guys,"" and she wouldn't want to even be friends after that.

I’m 29 and used dating apps seriously for about 2 years. While yes I was able to have a couple dates, 90% of that time was an absolute colossal waste of time. 

Besides the all the obvious ghostings, people never responding in a timely manner or ever following through, what hurt me the most was the loss of confidence. Knowing that it was this hard to meet just one woman was mentally destroying. 

Once I deleted the apps I noticed my confidence coming back. I would smile when I looked at the mirror and said, “damn that’s a handsome looking guy” if I can feel myself for a moment. 

With my confidence back I noticed when I went out, it was easier to talk to people and strike up conversation. When you feel good about yourself people notice. 

Delete the apps. They’re for women and waste of time for most men. Make a goal for yourself to talk to at least one woman you’re interested in once a week and I promise it will get easier; even if it’s a simple Hi.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pauo4x/my_fellow_men_just_delete_the_apps/

9,pauyh4,1629835075,Are there drawbacks to dating someone that is less educated and less traditionally intelligent than you are? What’s been your experience?,"For background information, I (24F) am currently applying to grad programs in data science, mainly focused on international affairs and incorporating qualitative data. Most of my life has been spent on academics and running my own small business, along with doing freelance website design. I roughly speak five languages but am only truly fluent in two.

I met a guy(27M) that works in a sound studio and often travels as a fill in musician for different bands. He’s very talented at what he does, but has little interest outside of it. He  does however share several of my social-political views which is nice, but I’m yet to get deeper into it to understand why exactly he has those views. Aside from this he’s also incredibly attractive and responsible with his time. He never drinks because he doesn’t like feeling as though he’s out of control of himself, but isn’t at all controlling of other people. He’s very caring, gentle, and careful which are things that I’m very much attracted to. He also will simply say how he feels without trying to elaborate too much on it. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me and why he does.

I have noticed however that he doesn’t navigate the world in the same way that I do. I tend to think deeply about the things around me and make connections between things that aren’t apparent to everyone. While he just sees things for what they are on the surface(I find this relaxing to be around in a way since most of my ideas are constantly critiqued in my social circle. It’s a nice break, and he seems to enjoy life and be more peace of a person than I am).

It may be because I’m young and that it’s a rarity to find somebody with emotional intelligence in their 20’s, which is also a concern of mine.

Personally I think that in this situation it could work well, but I’m also scared that it might hold me back in that I prefer to be with somebody that encourages me and challenges me in a healthy way, which I don’t see happening with him but I could be surprised. I also don’t feel the kind of “intellectual” connection that I have with relationships in the past, but again I’m not necessarily counting it as a bad thing.

12,pavgwy,1629836598,"I (22M) had my first kiss with a girl (21F) I’ve known for months, but I have no idea what to make of our relationship now.","It was a Friday night on the last week of my college semester last May when the first kiss happened. 

I was about to head back to my apartment after a night of walking through the nearby campus college bars one more time before I headed back home for the summer. However, I decided to buy a local hot dog because I was feeling a little hungry. 

It was then that further up the line, I saw the girl I knew for a while. In the past, she was a bit handsy with me at the bars and events we met up at, but I knew that it was just probably her being drunk.

In the past, she was always friendly with me. During the times I saw her at the bars, she was a bit handsy with me. However, because I only ever got to see her at the bars or events, I only got to see one side of her. 

As soon as she saw me in the line that night last May, she screamed my name and clung onto me like some kind of monkey. I assumed she was drunk. Of course, I didn’t want to say no because I never got any sort of action with girls, so that was completely new to me. She clung onto me for a bit until she stood back to where I was and started holding my hands for a little while. 

Where I have my doubts about her though, is that she was apparently wanting to make out with as many people as possible that night. Gender didn’t really matter. Probably as some sort of late night fun. I saw her making out with some other guy a few minutes after clinging onto me while talking to one of her girl friends. I didn’t mind at the time, because I was feeling drunk myself. (I had a ride home).

Eventually though, I was kinda fed up enough to where I held her hand and gently pulled her back into the hot dog line and away from the other dude. We then continued to hold hands for a bit and she talked about how her semester went and what fun things we had planned for the summer. 

Later, in my loosened half drunken state, I told her that I had never made out with anyone before. She asked if I wanted to kiss her and of course I said yes. As a result, she kissed me square on my lips. I told her that I wanted to continue it for a bit and she agreed. We kissed for a little more before stopping. She also gave me a bit of feedback based on my kissing technique but I don’t remember much from that part.

We then talked with her friends for a bit longer while holding hands for most of the time waiting in the line. Before we were about to get our food, she told me that there were girls much better than her out there for me. She told me that she’s not the best one for me in terms of having a relationship. However, I remember telling her, right before she left the food place, that she was still special to me. 

I never saw her again for the entire summer, didn’t keep in touch with her either because I was too scared to say anything, until I got back to college this fall for my final semester. I saw her in the bars again with her fellow sorority sisters on their “senior bar crawl.” We didn’t talk much then, but I was happy to see her again. She acted like nothing happened though and left without talking much because she was with her sorority friends at the time. 

A week passed and I went out to the bars again, hoping to find her once more. Sure enough, I did, and made my move by sitting next to her against a wall outside a bar. 

We had a good conversation and she seemed fairly comfortable around me, despite the three hard cocktails I drank that night. (I know my limit, so I was still sensible enough to know what I still doing, seeing, and hearing.) When the time felt right, I asked her “remember when you kissed me?” She said yes, but before I could ask her to elaborate, her ride came and picked her up. I was wanting to go ride with her, but one of her guy friends I didn’t know riding with her didn’t want me to go with them. I don’t know why. 

I ended up going back the same way I normally come to the bars. Walking back to my apartment, this time in defeat.

I’m still wondering what to do now. I have her number and snap, so what should I do? Should I call or text her and plan a date? Should I talk to her through Snapchat? Should I wait until I run into her at the bars again? Or should I just move on and find someone else? Regardless of which option I choose, I don’t want her to feel like she hates me or is weirded out by me. At the same time though, I don’t want that kiss to mean nothing even though it probably might. 

That’s why I need some outside advice here. Hope this helps. 

TL;DR: A girl who was (probably drunkenly) affectionate with me for months gave me my first kiss on the final week of school last May. I tried talking with her twice about it after I came back to school last Saturday, but I could never find the right time due to other circumstances getting in the way.

I do love myself. I tried tons of dating apps and got nowhere even with the filters. I'm starting to believe that I'm not suppose to find anyone let alone love. I keep myself mostly busy school, work, and now I'm starting to make my own products to sell later on. I do have tons of hobbies as well. I do know that I struggle making friends, I have been isolated socially for almost 3 years and been outside for 2ish years now. I do talk to my co-workers, I just don't see them as friends just mostly acquaintances. I do try to be more social when talking to customers since that's apart of my job. I do have two friends kind of, but we barely talk and hardly hangout. I am also at school and haven't made any friends there either, mainly everyone is busy with life and all. I been at school for awhile and just can't connect to anyone.  I just want someone to share my life with and it's starting or has felt like I was meant for no one and that I'm suppose to be a decent hermit with no one to share. Even if I do try to look for love nothing ever happens, and when I don't look for love it also never happens either. I don't know anymore I just want to love someone and share my life with someone, but it feels like nothing is ever going to happen and that I should accept my hermit life.

Edit: I appreciate the answers, I just wanted to add that I no longer have any dating apps anymore, since it's just not happening for me. I don't how people do it, I've been catfish and met trash people on those apps. I just feel that dating apps are a waste of time and I don't like being deceived or being trick into talking to someone who wasn't even the person I was talking too. I do feel hopeless in finding someone even though I am young. Mainly I've never been in love and don't know what that would even feel like.

We were friends for a few weeks when I asked him out. We went out and he told me that he was poly and in a relationship and that he was interested in me. We did eventually get physical but I asked him soon after to stay friends as I couldn't be in a relationship/situation as it does not cover my emotional needs I have nothing against polyamory, but I need emotional security). I didn't want to lie with the hope that he'll change his whole life for me. Now we still chat a lot and we run in the same circles but I have a terribly hard time seeing him as a friend. I rarely like anyone and for the longest time I've been meeting interesting people with whom we could not go further due to different circumstances (and I'm not even going to to talk about the people who treated me poorly even though they knew my feelings for them). I feel both heartbroken and disheartened and I am going back to thinking that maybe I'll die alone (sorry this sounds overly dramatic).

29,pawzwk,1629841241,Advice for dating someone who is emotionally fragile,Hey all. A month or two ago I started seeing my friend (me 25m) (her 24f) again we hadn’t talked in a really long time like since last October and she had just got out of the hospital after a 3 week mental health visit. So far things have been going great we are taking things slowly and have been getting more intimate with each other although we haven’t messed around just yet because we both feel it’s best to wait. I have known this girl since I was 18 and have seen her on and off since I was 21 I think. I have always felt differently about her and I feel like she’s doing great and is way less fragile then she has been in the past. my question is since I really like this girl and want to do everything possible to make sure it works out what are some things that I should be aware of so it’s smooth sailing. Has anyone here been in a similar situation and if so what sort of general advice do you have?

He mentioned that we could possibly do something this Saturday but it would depend how the week went, as one of his friends is sick and dying. I sympathized and said it was no problem if we couldn’t hangout Saturday. However, some friends have asked me to hangout this weekend. I would like to not wait around for him and end up not having anything to do. But if he is free it would be nice to hangout.

32,paxa0k,1629842153,Why do so many women ghost after the first or second message?,"Seriously why do so many women ghost me after the first or second message even if I'm polite? 

It's often like that, that either she or I write the first message. I mostly ask about something related to her pictures or her bio (if she has one which is rare).  
  
It's often like that when she writes first: 
She: Heyy
Me: Hey! Are you in [Country] at [place] in this picture? 
~ no answer 👻


Or like that when I do the first move:
Me: I think you look pretty cool! I'd love to do [activity] with you! 
She: I can say the same about you! That'd be pretty cool! 
Me: Let's do that sometime! By the way; do you mind telling me the story behind [picture]
~ no answer 👻

Why is that? Especially when she's the first to write. I get that smalltalk can be pretty exhausting. I hate it too going to the same talking stage over again but you have to start somewhere. I love deep talk too and I can do it for hours but I need to fiddle out what type of human you are. 

It's incredible frustrating. Also recently saw a profile with ""Only swipe right if you're not boring"". Like gurl, if someone is boring or not is highly subjective. And it needs two for a convo to not be boring.  
  
I hate the talking stage the same way everyone else hates it, which's why I stopped trying as I seem to get ghosted constantly. You can't now if someone's boring after the first few messages imo.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/paxa0k/why_do_so_many_women_ghost_after_the_first_or/

I (22M) have been seeing this girl (21F) for about 2 months now, and as far as I can tell things have been going great. However in about a week, I will be moving overseas with the expectation that I'll be gone for about 2 years. This was a known fact for both parties before we started dating, so I had gone into it thinking it would be a temporary fling (although the move did get pushed up 1-2 months earlier than expected). However, as my departure date approaches I feel like I should initiate a clear conversation make sure we are on the same page.

We have not really had a DTR conversation in the time that we've been seeing each other, so this wouldn't really be an extension of an ""official"" / defined relationship. It feels like pursuing a long distance relationship after such a short / casual time is far-fetched, but I've not been in a situation like this before and am not sure how she feels about the future. **How exactly should I approach this DTR conversation?** Looking for advice regarding timing, phrasing, etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/paxfbm/how_do_i_approach_this_dtr_conversation_for_a/

I used to be the type of person to cancel my own plans and immediately say yes to whoever asked me on a date. I have learned to put myself first and still say no even if I had no plans that night. For me, I want someone to think ahead of time versus being an afterthought.

I don’t have a lot of experience with dating in the first place but I feel like since this is someone I work with I have to be more delicate with how I go about getting to know her better and showing my interest in her. 

I’m wondering if anyone had any advice or if there are any unwritten rules to this kind of thing. Like how long I should spend getting to know her before asking her on a date. I feel like I should establish a friendship with her outside of work before asking if she’d like to go out for drinks or something. Or is it alright to ask even if we haven’t had much contact outside of work, given an appropriate time and if she seems interested (though I’m no good at telling if that’s the case or not).
Also wondering if wanting to date a coworker is just a bad idea in general and I should ignore these feelings.

It’s a pretty small company and I work closely with her regularly so a bad response could be bad for work I guess.

This is all new to me so any thoughts are appreciated, I’ve never felt as strong a feeling as I do about this girl so I don’t wanna mess it up. Thanks for reading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/paygax/when_how_to_ask_a_coworker_out/

I (43F) only really started dating a year ago. I was a virgin (Ex-Mormon). The first two men I went on dates with were both Nigerian. The second man is the one I ended up having sex with the first time.

Since then I've been mostly doing the casual sex thing, but also been on some legit dates too. 

I've been with/on dates with probably 8-10 Nigerian men. I had no preconceived notions or judgements about Nigetian men, and had no problem dating them.

However, I've had bad experiences with every one of them. And it's the same pattern over and over.

-misogyny
-pushing gender conformity and traditional gender roles
-not respecting boundaries (especially in the bedroom)
-being very pushy about me having kids, and not understanding why I want to remain child-free at 43 yo
-being condescending
-talking over me/not listening to my opinion or disregarding my feelings

And I just unlucky or is this a cultural normity for them?

One time, i chatted up a semi cute receptionist, got her number and we started texting. brought her out for one date. next thing you know, she turns up on my doorstep in her car the next day unannounced saying she was bored and wanted to go out. scared me a little because it was stalkerish, so kept my distance, but went out a few more times anyway. also went to the club a couple of times with friends and one time this cute girl grabbed my ass a couple of times but i was too shy to respond. another time, another girl and i hooked up in a club, kissed, and then i brought her out for a date. she ghosted me later. another time, another girl who was in our friends group kept grinding up to me whenver she was drunk, made advances each time on me, but she was a friend of a friend so i kept my distance out of respect. another girl even grabbed my dick in the club while we were dnacing but i had late puberty so i didn't know how to respond to that shit.

however, 2012 came along and suddenly i noticed women were just no longer interested. for a while, i thought that i had suddenly turned ugly but when i look back at pictures of myself i actually look better post 2012. it was only years later, around the time i discovered this sub, that others have been saying the same thing and that social media had changed the dynamics of dating and destroyed dating for many men.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pazkt7/the_world_before_tinder_and_social_media_was/

I wonder if lockdown has made people really lazy to go out and date. Possibly could be an age thing as I just turned 29. I just got back from a date in which I was stood up and the girl claimed she thought  it was a different day.

71,pb184w,1629855502,I don’t know if I should continue pursuing this girl.,"So I’m (26m) recently single from a long term relationship as of a couple months ago and I’m having to try out online dating for the first time. This is proving to be very difficult and I can’t tell if it’s me or if online dating is just THAT difficult? 

I’m usually a pretty confident person and I don’t really pay too much mind into what I say a whole whole lot bc I feel like as long as I’m consistent with messaging and trying to be interesting, like it should carry itself right? But man, online dating (tinder) really has me second guessing everything I do and makes me think that I’m actually pretty boring at conversation lol. And a thought that’s been creeping in the back of my head is that I’ve never really had to be interesting in a looong time bc I’ve always had the same friends since middle school and always met people through my friends and met girls that way. 

Issue with that is that my friends are now grown up and in different stages of life so I’m really having to really stick my neck out there, which I haven’t had to do much at all. So I feel like I’m having trouble finding a new set of friends and I don’t really know how to do it?

Okay with that said, insert a new issue:

I started snap chatting an old friend who seems interested in me. She did try to flirt with me once but I rejected her bc I think I was talking to somebody else already? Anyways, since then she’s moved very far out of state and we haven’t talked in a long time until now but she still seems very interested in me. So while I’ve been trying to talk to people on tinder, I’ve also been talking to her and playing around with the idea of visiting her in a few months. 

So I guess the bigger issue is, if I do end up visiting her and we start something A. Long distance fucking sucks and one of us would have to move and it would be complicated. Also bc like I know her but idk her enough to know if I want to move out there. And B. Idk if starting something with her would be scapegoating my other issue of avoiding meeting new people, if that makes any sense? Also C. If I end up meeting someone else here before that even happens, I’m gonna feel really bad for stringing her along. Not that I’ve directly made any moves yet but still..

Multi-dimensional problem for me I guess.

But if either one of us moved, I would have to guess me tho bc she’s in a nicer state now and I wouldn’t mind starting a new life that way. Totally blind guess tho lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb184w/i_dont_know_if_i_should_continue_pursuing_this/
72,pb1k31,1629856696,"Mid-20s, never had a girlfriend, never go on a second date, please help","I'm 25, never been in a relationship. Assume I already follow the standard protocol: good hygiene, have my shit together, self-improvement etc...

I've gone on around 25 first dates in the last 2 years, and barely go on any second dates. Almost word for word, women tell me after the first date, I'm sweet, such a great guy, they just don't feel a connection. I never feel a connection with them either. Isn't the point of dating to build that connection with someone, how does one just feel it with a stranger almost instantly? I don't get it. 

This story and similar scenarios have happened a few times, I'm texting a girl from a dating app for a month, like 3 one-line texts every few days, then one night she initiates and literally drives over and we have sex. I continue my texting habits like nothing happened. Then a few weeks later she says she's in a relationship and it would be inappropriate for us to see each other again! I don't know where I messed up. Not all but some text how good it was and some come back but eventually lose interest. 

I only mention this paragraph so people don't say ""it's because you have a repulsive personality you don't have a girlfriend."" Years ago, I was a debt collector, my supervisor said unsolicited in all of her years I was the most polite employee, and I wasn't even trying. It's been a constant my entire life, people saying I'm very polite. My coworkers always hang out with me outside of work, I've maintained old friendships across the United States, made new ones etc.. My social skills I'd rank as average.

I'm super-polite, but I wouldn't say I'm a pushover, I have zero issue looking people in the eye and pushing back when wronged and I actually love public speaking and am not particularly shy.

I get that the person might have been surprised by my message,  but they called me creepy, to which I said I didn't think it was and then they blocked me.

I mean, if it was creepy to meet new people on social media, there would be a rule against it, right?

79,pb22pa,1629858586,Does she like me?,"Imma make this as short as I can but please read. So there’s a co worker I think likes me and I like her too. We’re both 17 and here’s the story so far. I originally didn’t like her because she trash talked me to another co worker about me taking all the customers at the registers (not on purpose but I just made eye contact first). Anyway a few weeks after that I had to help her at registers and she was super friendly, I remember thinking “man she’s talking a lot for not knowing me”. But I was super dry and blunt because I was mad at her remark she made at the time. She did things like ask what time I got off and then acted disappointed when I got off before her. Before I left I had to buy something and I went to her register. When I did she said “oh hey, it’s been awhile) and smiled and had a flirty look on her. She also was messing around with me and being mean in a playful way. Like messing with me when my card didn’t work and said “well we close in 30 minutes so if you don’t get it by then idk what to tell you” but it was flirty like I said. Fast forward a few weeks later and I see her one day and I decide to put what she said behind me and kinda have a “fresh start”. I started taking to her and it went so well. I made her smile and laugh a lot and she was playing with her hair a lot. I was looking to see if she played with her hair when I wasn’t talking to her and she was but not as much. It went so well that day. The next day I worked tho she was busy and around other co workers so it was hard to talk with her. I finally wanted to at least say hi. When I did I went full blown stupid and froze and just wave. I said nothing but she did the same, waved and said nothing. For some reason I looked away and then looked back. I have no clue why. When she left I told her bye and she said it back but she didn’t seem flirty or interested at all. I thought I ruined it until today and yesterday. Yesterday she was there and I noticed she had her hair dyed. I wanted to compliment but decided not to because after last time I didn’t wanna make it worse. So I just told her good bye and she said “bye, hey did you get your hair cut?” I did so I said yeah. She said “it looks really nice”. I said “thank you!” And went on. She asked “do you work tomorrow?” I said “yeah wby?” She said “not until Thursday”. I said “I work tomorrow and Wednesday but not again until Sunday” she replied “I think I work Sunday!” I said “ok nice, see you!” And left. Today is when it gets amazing. Today she came in as a customer and checked out at my register. When she came up she was playfully being mean and stuff. I got to the screen where I couldn’t scan her discount and she said “wow do I need to do your job? I think I do, cause I will if you can’t” we both made each other smile and laugh a lot and it didn’t feel like a normal conversation, but like she was flirting the whole time. I asked her “do you need a bag?” She said “if it makes your life harder I totally need a bag”. When she went to leave she asked “you work Sunday right?” I said “yeah, you do right?” She said “yeah!” I said “nice I’ll see you then, btw I like your hair!”. So I finally complimented her new hair

Her and I both go to the same college, but at that point, we weren’t yet in school. She seemed pretty interested, so she asked for my Snapchat and then my number. Then we started and continued talking to each other for about three weeks, really getting to know each other and discussed going on a date when we get back to college. 

So I moved into school on Sunday, and tried making plans with her for Monday. I first suggested taking her to this place that has a nice view of the city, but she wasn’t a fan of a first date being in a secluded area. That’s totally fair. So I instead offer taking her to an ice cream shop, to which she accepted under the conditions of her driving instead of me. She seemed pretty cautious which I thought was understandable. I set the date to 7:00 originally, then she asked if she could push it back to 6:00. 

She picked me up, and I was for sure nervous. My mouth was SO dry and I think my voice was shaky. This was my first date from OLD in almost two years (I’m very on/off on these apps), and I was excited to meet her as I thought she was a good fit. We went to the place, ordered our desserts separately, and then ate in her car bc it was very hot. 

It seemed like we were hitting it off. She seemed interested in things I had to say, and we both made good eye contact. I think I was a little too much in my head tho, as she had to initiate conversation way more. I literally made zero physical contact with her which I regretted right away. I’m a pretty shy guy, but I also think I’m charismatic when I break out of my comfort zone. An hour later and we end the date bc we both already had other plans. 

I text her today trying to set up plans for a second date and she replies saying she enjoyed yesterday, but only saw us as being friends. This really hurt, and I was kinda shocked.

How could I prevent this in the future? I know my nervousness probably hurt me, as well as not touching her at all. But it also makes me wonder if I’m not as attractive as I was in my profile. I felt like I had good pics that represented me well, but Idk. I’m a taller than average guy with a very athletic build.

94,pb364q,1629862661,"Ran into a crush today, and don't know what to do.","So back in January, I met this girl that worked at a store I started shopping at. The second I saw her, I was instantly into her. Felt like love at first sight and all that. But I don't like speaking in extremes, so let's just call it a crush. 
Her and I instantly clicked and if we ever had the chance, we'd talk for a while.

I always wanted to make a move, but it felt weird because I only saw her at her workplace. 

Eventually I stopped seeing her there a couple months ago, and then today, I decided to hit up the pizza spot in my city. It's this real authentic Italian pizzareia I wanted to try.
I went in, and it turned out she works there and she was the host.
She instantly remembered me and we had a pretty good conversation for around 5 minutes.
All those feelings came back.

It feels like we were supposed to run into each other again, because the chemistry is very natural and easy.

But I'm still stuck in this conundrum where I don't know how to make a move because she's at her workplace.

How should I handle this??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb364q/ran_into_a_crush_today_and_dont_know_what_to_do/

I shared my fears of abandonment as we moved into the next level just to be ghosted lol and he really did a good job of exemplifying the qualities of a good honest man looking for a serious relationship. I'm usually good at seeing red flags and love bombing, but I guess I was blinding by feelings. I've wasted my time on being a woman of high morals, belonging to the streets is starting to look more tantalizing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb3fhi/got_ghosted_by_someone_i_have_been_dating_for/
97,pb3fy6,1629863740,I [26F] was asked to go see a broadway show with a guy [3?] I'm not attracted to...,"I met this guy at a community meetup I usually go to once a week to spend time with friends and network with business projects we are involved in. I hardly ever talked to this man (let's call him John), we have exchanged pleasantries but nothing more beyond that. Last week, John approached me and asked if I were willing to help him work on a project that he's working on over the weekend, he needed some extra hands to get his project moving and I happily said yes. He asked other friends in our community if they were willing to pitch in, so I was expecting a small group of people coming together over the weekend to help out, but when I arrived, I ended up being the only person there. 

I felt a little awkward being there, but I already drove a long way to help and he said others would arrive later in the day, so I decided to stay until other people came by. Throughout the day, the conversation felt pretty one-sided, I could tell he had the jitters, he was all over the place and didn't really stick to a plan on what we could finish, so I did what I went there to do and just talked for a while. It wasn't until two other people arrived hours later with raised eyebrows, wondering why it was just the two of us there, I just figured everybody else stood us up. I left shortly after the other two arrived, he thanked me for the help and said he would help me with the project I'm doing this weekend. I'm honestly thinking this is just a business exchange, nothing else beyond that.

The next day, John called me and said he had two tickets to this broadway show this weekend and wondered if I was interested in going (our mutual friend is in the play) so without a second thought I said sure because it sounds like fun. I figured after he helped me out with my project, we would meet up later that day to see the show and support our friend in the play. I talked about this scenario with a friend and she said I was lured into this ""plan"" to eventually go on a date with this guy. She even asked me why I said yes, and to be honest, I've never been to a Broadway show and I thought it would be cool to support our friend in the play. Thinking that this was a date was literally the LAST thing on my mind, I honestly feel so dumb after saying it out loud. 

I'm really not attracted to this guy at all, he's usually not the person I would go on a date with. I just got out of a bad break-up the week before and I'm not really interested in getting to know John as a romantic interest. I already said yes to the show this weekend and I would hate to be *that guy* and cancel plans shortly after (or worse, *the day of*). I don't want to send mixed signals about the situation and neither do I want to hurt him in the long run if I were to simply run with it, but now I'm not sure what to do or how to explain my point of view. 

What can I do or say to John about this ""date"" this weekend and explain I'm not interested? Should I cancel these plans? 

tldr; I was asked to go to a Broadway show with a guy at my local community group without thinking that this was actually a date. I already said yes after figuring this out, I don't want to send him mixed signals about the situation because I'm actually not interested in him at all.

98,pb3k3i,1629864187,Dating a healthcare worker,"Honestly just looking for others who are currently dating/married/partnership etc a healthcare worker. How has the experience been for you? I’m dating an EMT, we met right before the pandemic, and the guy I started dating precovid is not the guy he is today. Don’t get me wrong I love him and he tries his best to be a good partner for me throughout all of this, but in conjunction with the hours for work and the crazy amount of PTSD he now has from the job it’s taking a major toll on our relationship and my own mental health. Is anyone else experiencing this? How are you getting through it? What helps? I love him and I’ve been more than okay with being there and listening to everything that he goes through on the daily. It’s just he’s never really back, he’s never really out of the work mindset. What do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb3k3i/dating_a_healthcare_worker/
99,pb3p69,1629864748,Is having no friends or family a turn off?,"I've (M,23) thought about dating, but honestly this has been a thing I've been afraid of being brought up.

I mean, I'm estranged from my family.

Friends just kinda dispersed after I graduate from undergrad and I don't bother making any since I've just kinda gotten used to not having them. I'm pretty reserved, so I just never talk about myself enough for anyone to really know anything about me. Basically your standard fear of rejection and people leaving. I probably picked it up after my brother died, but hey it is what it is.

About the only friend I've got is my cat.
