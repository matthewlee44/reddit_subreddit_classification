It was our 2nd date, politics and values started being discussed, and she said that she supports children being placed on puberty blockers and HRT. I was hearing none of it, pulled $50 out of my wallet to cover my half for dinner, left it on the table and walked out without saying a word. She of course, started getting a bit hysterical, and kept saying ""what are you doing, where are you going?""

i have a friend that i like. we're chatting often and i love her, she is great, shes a feeler, not a thinker. the thing is that he has depression, and basically, to ""cure her sadness"", she found a classmate for herself to date with. the thing is, that the guy doesn't really understand her feelings, although she needs a guy that understands her and is there for her.

now, i told her that i like her in the past, but she said no. then of course, she found a dude to feel better. she picked like this: OH I NEED SOMEONE, ANYONE, THE CLOSEST PERSON!! OH, MARK YOU'RE ALRIGHT! 

the girl likes me (im his best boy friend after his boyfriend, the difference is there), and knows that i am always there for her, but she forgot that i like her. i want to tell her again someday, but i don't know when or where. i figured i should just wait until they break up.

when i asked her about their relationship (like 2 days ago), she said that they they're good.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muxg8a/telling_your_crush_that_you_love_her_when_she_has/

3,muxxba,1618945922,NSFW- When is a good time to have sex?,"I (26F) recently got back into dating. The last person I was with was my bf of one year and we broke up about 6 months ago in October. I got over him pretty quickly in the sense that I didn’t miss him or want him back, but I struggled with the betrayals for a long time. Honestly, I still struggle with his betrayals. Some days are better than others. 

Anyway, I went on Hinge and met one guy on April 2. We’ve had 4 dates and today will be our 5th date. We’ve only ever kissed and he put his hand on my boob once but I swiped it off and we laughed about it. I honestly used to sleep with men almost immediately and don’t want to do that anymore. I’ve been really good about it with this guy and thankfully he hasn’t made me feel pressured at all. 

I don’t really know when I should feel ready. I haven’t felt ready in the past but still slept with men and then felt comfortable with it afterwards. I know a lot of people will say “do it when you’re ready” but I just don’t know when ready is. Are we ever really ready for anything? 

So do you have rules for yourself when it comes to sex? Do you have to see them for X amount of dates, X amount of months, or X amount of hours? For some reason I know I’ll feel guilty when I do it whether it’s today or 3 months from now. I’ve set this hard boundary on myself to NOT have sex right away but for some reason in my mind, whenever I decide to do it, I’ll feel like I’m not respecting my own boundary.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muxxba/nsfw_when_is_a_good_time_to_have_sex/

8,muykyb,1618947744,We met for the first time and instantly had a connection (it was mutual) - scared of the unknown.,"I’ve recently met someone through a social dating app. We met for the first time and instantly had a connection (it was mutual), which felt surreal because I have never experienced anything like it. 

I am turning 28 (M) and she is turning 30 (F). 

I’ve come out of a 6 year relationship (been single for approximately 2 years) and been with others via dating or just for a good time.

On the other hand, she has had a multitude of relationships - 4 of which were serious such as:

20 for a year

23 for 6 months .. first love

24 for 1.5yrs.. he cheated, secret relationship

28 for 6 months, uni friends of 10yrs

Then she mentions, ‘The rest were dating or a good time’. Which is fine because we have needs I guess.

It’s been approximately 5 days since we met in person and close to a month when we started talking on social platforms. She is compassionate, caring, empathic and really in touch with her emotions.

 She has already introduced me to her close friends     on the 3rd date, especially one who she considers as her second mother (not biologically) - I don’t know if this means anything? She has also invited me to social gatherings.

Concerns:

Because of my abandonment issues, I am concerned that I will be let down.

I tend to sabotage my own happiness as I am reflective within looking  forward (I live inside my head if that makes sense)

I have suffered from anxiety &amp; depression my entire life (caused by the toxic environment that  I grew up in). And I am aware that this may affect decisions or how I conceptualise things but have been undergoing progressive treatment for the last  2 years to day to help combat in order to live a better life for myself

She has been in multiple relationships where I have been in just one

 She had a 3 some in her past life but was upfront about it from the start (did not go into detail because did not feel the need to - I feel like I can look past this)

I can see that her profile in the social dating app we met is still exists (so does mine) but unsure if she is still using. I did not want to ask because to avoid coming off as being a jealous person.

Please help me out and ask questions if there are gaps in the information provide.

In summary because how fast things are progressing I am scared of the unknown consider concerns noted above.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muykyb/we_met_for_the_first_time_and_instantly_had_a/

10,muyq8a,1618948146,Suddenly can't get a second date,"I had nice luck with the women just before the corona pandemic. Student culture in my country is pretty much partying so I met a lot of girls. I didn't even need to hit on the girls. I just had fun with my friends and girls always came talking to me, told me that I'm good looking, asked number or some even asked me to leave the party and go with them. So yeah, my self confidence was sky high and I was doing fine in Tinder too. Girls seemed to like me and always wanted to go on a second date. But then the corona pandemic started.

I downloaded Tinder again last September when the situation with the corona was better here. I started dating and actually met very nice girls. However, non of them wanted to go on a second date which was strange for me since we had a lot of in common and had fun. I decided to delete Tinder and focused on my studies, hobbies and also worked out a lot. I think I got my confidence back during the winter. This month I decided to download Tinder again and I've been on a couple first dates now. But non of them wanted to meet me again either! Two of them didn't even reply my messages after the first date which has never happened before. I have no problems getting Tinder matches or dates but getting a second date seems incredibly hard now. Also, getting rejected by girls isn't doing wonder for my self confidence. 

Any ideas what could be wrong? I took 5 new pictures for this Tinder profile. Two selfies and three pictures are taken by my friend who was using my DSLR. I also still have similar clothes, haircut and beard style so no big differences in my look. I've met girls in cafeterias, bars or just outside and we usually go for a walk. I hug when we meet and hug when we are heading our separate ways. Just like before the corona pandemic.

I could also tell something about myself. I'm 24 years old male university student. I have a lot of friends, good relationship with my family and nice part-time and summer job. I play the guitar and bass, go to the gym and I also enjoy reading and walking outdoors in the nature. So all in all, I'm doing fine (apart from bad luck in dating) and my future seems bright.

Some of these modern resources provide some unique insight into the dating ritual. But for the most part, they all seem to be pulling from the same playbook; at least the books geared toward men are. I've never read any material that was written specifically for women. 

I truly do hate to sound like some old curmudgeons grunting about the good ole days whilst caught in a nostalgia trap. At the same time, however, I have recently become fascinated with wondering what dating really was 50, 60, or 70 years ago. I recently helped my folks move, and I ran across an old copy of ""Etiquette"" by Emily Post. There was a time when pretty much all social interactions had some form of agreed upon, ***and documented***, framework.  A lot of that stuff was about mundane things like, *which fork is for salad, and where should your water glass be placed in relation to your dinner plate, etc.*   I can't help but wonder though... if there were ever these kind of ""text books"" written for dating.

We quickly learned, as we talked, that we are VERY similar in almost every way...The way that we look at life, our sensitive natures, how we analyze and vibe to music, politics, intelligence, introspection, empathy, humor, mental and physical health...It's uncanny. Neither of us thought that anyone existed that could REALLY understand us.

When we met, we hung out for 15 straight hours, and it was one of the best days of my life.

Sounds great, right? Well. It is. Except, the deal breakers mentioned in the title. First, she is morbidly obese. I am not superficial, in general, but I do have some standards. That said, I think that I can look past this.

Second, because of her hard life, she didn't have the best dental hygiene, and now has no teeth. Dentures hurt too bad for her to wear. This one is a little harder to overlook.

Third, her house is in pretty awful shape. Growing up poor, I have seen worse, but this is a pretty worrisome.

We connect on a cosmic level. It really is something that I have never experienced before. I want to be able to overlook these other things, but if I press on, it will only hurt her more if I suddenly decide I can't handle them.

Once that was planned I then decide what I'm going to bring on the date. At first I was going to just go with coffee, or the usual, take a walk with nothing. Then, it sprung to mind that I should bring 2 bottles of beer, so I did.

We eventually met up I chat with her about things, she then asks what is inside my jacket. I then whip out the two beer bottles and say ""Well, I thought you might need a drink"" she then laughs and asks me if I'm being serious. I said ""yeah"" she then didn't really talk much to me all after that, like she kept ignoring half of what I was saying. I tried offering her a drink, but she kept refusing. So, I figured at that point my beer surprise plan wasn't working out. 

I then asked her if she wanted to sit in the park with me, but again she refused. With all the attempts I had made to get more out of her, and her politely rejecting I finally decided it was time to just depart.

In parting ways he was supportive, then added, ""I bet he's sweet, isn't he?"" in a very contemptuous way and went on about sweet men negatively. I replied that my new guy was in fact, very sweet, but his snide comment really pissed me off. 

It implied there was something wrong with sweet men. 

I fought dating sweet, kind, emotionally available men for years because I struggled to feel comfortable with it. I saw sweetness in partners as a weakness for a long time and only after I confronted my own fear of vulnerability was I able to feel comfortable dating people that were emotionally available and expressive. I think there's also a horrible societal perception that sweet men are less masculine somehow or boring, when really, they're mature and stable. Grown ass men.

I'm just on here to say I fucking want and deserve a sweet man!!!!!!! I deserve a man that's emotionally present, aware, mature, intelligent, fun, has been to therapy and has worked on himself.

23,mv0h5o,1618952953,You don’t deserve to be treated better just because you are better looking,"M(22).  (TLDR): People take being good looking for granted. Being pretty is a privilege. Just because you experience different pain form ugly people does not mean you experience the same pain.

*Disclaimer. This is my experience. I am describing what I have personally experienced when it comes to dating and conversing with women. I am not trying to direct my hate towards *all* women; I am not trying to initiate misogyny, I am not trying to behave in an entitled way. I am simply, expressing my experience and how this has affected me and my outcomes on my life.* 

Good looking people have it easy in life. Let’s not pretend. You get the job you want, the partner you want, the future family prospect you want, the social circle you want, the attention you want, the admiration, the respect, the recognition, reap all the joys of life.

Being an ugly person like me I find you get ignored, people want to keep away from you, people give you less opportunities, you get less success in dating (that was obvious), people are generally rude, arrogant and spiteful towards you. I have literally noticed good looking people speak to me with so much hostility, and then approach a pretty person with respect and politeness immediately afterwards.

When it comes to dating, I have had my fair share of insults from women. Women have called me disgusting, ugly, men have said “he’s so ugly ain’t he” just after walking out of the room I was in with them. Women have called me ugly (to my face). Women have pretended to throw up around me and make retching noises. So do not come at me with the personality and loving yourself bullshit because I will get arrested for punching someone if i hear it.

On tinder I’ve had no better luck. Women ghost me, it’s *exhausting* trying to force an unwanted conversation (why the fuck would you match in the first place??) women have used the vomit emoji to describe my pictures.

So like I said. If you think you don’t have an easier life being pretty; you are extremely mistaken and I honestly believe more awareness on this subject needs to be raised to promote change. How can you tell somebody it’s what’s inside that counts when people avoid you like the plague because you look so ugly to them? If you can’t even get your foot in the door! Oh “looks matter to an extent” yeah, to the extent I can’t even get past!!

I know of women who experience this behaviour from men too. I feel more sorry for them because they are at more risk of potential abuse, rape etc. It’s really a disgusting society we live in.

We live in a world where people say it’s what’s inside that matters; thrown back into a real world where people are treated like shit through beauty standards and living in a transactional society where everything has a price.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv0h5o/you_dont_deserve_to_be_treated_better_just/

25,mv0hru,1618952999,M(24) And sometimes my loneliness is overwhelming,"I'm sure this gets posted here a lot, but I just feel the need to vent and maybe get some input.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24yo heterosexual man, and the fact that I haven't ever dated anyone just weighs on me so much; I don't know where to turn to with a lot of these feelings of inadequacy and emasculation. I have never had sex or kissed anybody, and I am excruciatingly touch-starved. It's not an exaggeration to say that nobody in my life has shown me love, and there have never been many people in my life that I can rely on to be emotionally supportive with these issues. I've had to overcome great hardship, and face most of it on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try so hard in everything I do, and I'm so close to understanding what it means to love somebody, but without actually living it, love is still just like a color I've never really seen before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Online dating has been a total bust, even when I put my best foot forward. I've had girl friends of mine help with setting up my profile, on multiple apps, to really limited success. No amount of thoughtful messages, carefully chosen pictures, or change of locale has improved my experience. I consider myself to be a pretty good looking guy, but it's hard to hold onto that belief when I only get a handful of matches every *year*.

I know I'm not alone in that. I'm painfully aware that sad, lonely guys like me are a dime a dozen nowadays, especially on dating apps. My problems aren't special, and there's plenty of other dudes, even in my own life, that I see in similar situations. And it's not totally about sex, either. Don't get me wrong, I'd be more than excited to explore my sexuality and learn what it means to be a good partner, but the emotional connection with someone else is truly what I've come to care most about. Given the choice, I'd much rather just cuddle up and be near to someone for a few hours. I think that would be nicer for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I work on myself. So hard. Hundreds of hours in therapy, constant self-correcting and trying to improve the way I socialize, losing over 20kg of weight, and I have a great job in a well-respected field. I'm proud of myself, my character, and all the obstacles that I've overcome. I strive to find great friends, hobbies, and culture; in most ways, I feel like I'm very lucky and very successful. I try to love who I am, and I'm alright with that on most days.

And yeah, I do actually shower on a regular basis.

&amp;#x200B;

But every time I hear ""you just need to put yourself out there"" or some similar platitude, it keeps making me feel that all the effort I've put in up to this point hasn't mattered, and that I'm still *missing something. That I'm still not good enough.* The deluge of half-hearted advice from people who don't take the time to understand me just becomes increasingly demeaning. More and more often I just feel... drained, knowing that there is a massive facet of human life that is still completely *alien* to me. Sometimes I'm reminded that I've never held anyone in my arms, or woken up next to someone by my side, or gotten truly lost in passion and love. Sometimes I have to grit my teeth and sit through conversations with friends who reminisce about what it's like to be passionate with a woman. Sometimes, I feel so emotionally rattled that I feel *physical pain* in my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

To think that there are people 10 years younger and more romantically experienced than me, who know what it's like to have somebody hold them and tell them that things are going to be okay... I have no issues admitting that I am deeply jealous. I am a fully grown adult with a good grasp on how to live my life, yet who feels wholly immature next to these children. I know it's young love that's probably bound to include heartbreak, and isn't all sunshine and roses. But I'd take loving and losing over never having loved at all; that's a part of life, and I want a part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure with all of this complaining, you may think it's no wonder that I'm single. Honestly, I try to stay hopeful and contented so as to not seem too desperate or damaged when I meet new people; I don't expect a potential partner to fix my trauma and self-worth issues. My depression is my own, and while I'm sure it would help having someone walk through it with, I take responsibility for it. And although I continually feel defeated, I count my blessings as much as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I've just come to understand that it's all luck. Just pure dumb luck. You can follow all the rules, you can be the best *you* that you can be, and still not be happy with life. That's kind of how life is. Of course, I'm deeply worried that the longer I go without finding someone, the harder it is going to be to continue to try to do so. As people my age start getting older, there will (on average) be more expectations placed on *experience* when searching for a relationship. Not to mention that given my sensitive emotions surrounding my self-worth, I have to be careful to find someone who's nurturing and patient enough to support a guy who doesn't know what it's like to date at 24.

&amp;#x200B;

But without anyone else showing you guidance or compassion or empathy, I've found it's nearly impossible to do this on your own. I guess it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy: nobody wants to show you love when you don't know how to love people, but you can't really know how to love someone without first being loved yourself. It's a tough position to be in, and I've gotten a lot of advice over the years, but nothing's brought me much peace when I think about all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I'd love to hear what you think.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv0hru/m24_and_sometimes_my_loneliness_is_overwhelming/
26,mv0jcu,1618953116,Getting rejected constantly in the first 5-10 minutes.,"Hello,

I'm a gay male. There is something that has happened quite often in the last few months. I'd agree to meet up with a guy, after he arrives he rejects me in person from the very start.

I know what you may think, that I'm probably using flattering pictures that make me look much better than in person. No. All my pics are unprofessional, taken at home with bad lightening and a bad iphone 8 camera, using selfies or a broken tripod. I don't filter or try to smooth anything, not on the pictures I use on dating apps at least. In addition to that, I open video call. We all look much worse on these video calls. Yet they liked how I looked on them, and agreed to invite me over for a hookup. I do the video call thing to make sure they and I are interested, also for safety.

Yet for some reason, it happened 3 times already. And I left absolutely crushed. Getting blocked on a dating app or ghosted is much better than being humiliated at someone's place like that. And having to waste all that time and possibly money to hear something like that.

I'm also pretty honest about everything really, looks-wise. I showed them my upper body on these video calls. And used the frontal and back camera with a mirror to make sure. They also know my height, weight etc.. since they are on my profile.

Two guys said it wasn't how I looked, but how I acted in real life. Mind you, I'm autistic, but I don't look the way people expect autistic people to look like. I appear shy, cold and aloof because of it. I have to remind myself to make eye contact. But otherwise I just look bored and keep swapping my fingers, touching my arms. My voice is monotonous and appears flat and funny, and it is kinda feminine as well.

I really wonder if it is my autism that is the boner killer. Do they see that something is ""abnormal"" or uncommon with me and lose interest? I just highly doubt that someone you think is hot enough on a freaking video call yet in real life he apparently disgusts you so much.

I'm not taking it personal and don't feel entitled to anything. I'd do the same if I didn't feel it with a guy. Just want to understand it and hopefully prevent it in the future.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv0jcu/getting_rejected_constantly_in_the_first_510/
27,mv0lbz,1618953267,Anyone else wish they had a yandere/obsessive girl go after them,"I always hear about these guys who have girls who totally get fixated on them and are always showing up to places they are at. Then they act like this is a bad thing. Hell no those guys are so lucky and I wish I could have a girl like that go after me. They're crazy for turning down something like that. I'd make her my girlfriend in a heartbeat. Like if a girl randomly showed up to my house the first thing I'd do is let her in and we'd go to my bed and you guys could figure out the rest. I just wish a girl was obsessed with me. I would know she is loyal and wouldn't cheat. She would also be protective of me and keep me safe from anyone else trying to hurt me.

Maybe I got this all wrong since in my 20 years of life I've never been in a relationship so I have no clue how they work. (Before you comment I'm not fat and I take fucking showers ok.) But tbh having a yandere type gf sounds amazing. I guess why that anime trope is so popular. People who are deprived of love like me would be happy with the thought of a girl being completely fixated on me. I've never had so much as a girl that wasn't already my friend come up to me to start a conversation. So needless to say I have been quite unlucky throughout my life with girls. Maybe I would think different if it were actually happen to me.

Although it was Covid lockdown period, we decided to meet up and have dinner. Which went swimmingly. /s

She was under the weather from the start which made me panic and fuck up lot of notes in my head. I even drove to her house and forgot that I had a car and so we took taxi.

During dinner we chatted about me and her, still not really connecting with each other. One thing I remember discussing is her choice of nail polish color ( Dark brown matte) and told me about her first experience in salon. 

After we went back to her house, her ex was waiting at the gate. Unknowns to me, they seperated not long ago and still had matters to discuss. 


Two days later, I got blocked with no explanation. I don't know why I was still obsessed with finding out what went wrong and was hell bent on discovering that answer from myself. And then our mutual friend told me that she found me terrifying cause I was ""Constlanty asking if she was ok, touching her hand out of nowhere"".

38,mv2bce,1618958249,Are we friends or am I a backup option?,"Last April, I (31F) matched with X (33M) online and after months of chatting (lockdown, could not meet up), he told me that life was all over the place so he was not in a position to go into a relationship, and would like to continue chatting as friends. I appreciated the honesty and was happy to stay friends. Over the next couple of months, we continued chatting and met up in person for walks a couple of times (as friends). 

I continued on with my life as is (matched, dated and broke up with somebody else late last year). Earlier in January, X told me he’ll be busy with work for the next 6 weeks so he’ll be even worse with replying to texts than he already was (usually takes him a week or two to reply). I told him that’s fine cause I was gonna be busy too and wished him luck with his work. Six weeks passed, presumed he was either still busy or bored with the chat and decided to ghost (it would be almost a year since we first matched). 

I was a little disappointed (if he had actually ghosted me) but decided that I didn’t have any expectations of him since I presumed we were just friends, and even then the fun chat sort of friend not deep dark secrets sort, so I didn’t think he owed me a reply if he didn’t want to chat anymore. Got on with my life and then got a text today from him saying sorry for not keeping in touch for ages (no explanation why, but I suppose he doesn’t owe me an explanation or does he?) and said he hopes I’m well. 

I’m unsure what to make of this: (1) does he see me as an actual friend and is just terrible at keeping in touch with friends? I’d think 6 weeks is a long time to go without checking in with a friend that you were regularly chatting with before that. Especially since during that period, I came across his OLD profile and noticed it was updated. So this made me wonder, (2) is he keeping me around as a backup option and is back for attention when things didn’t work out with somebody else cause I was always up for a chat before?

He only used me, I drove 4 hours to see him, and he was talking to other females, I didn't find that out until I got home. That was over with quick, other dates....I never got passed the first date with guys, they either were abusers, looking for one thing, or block me after taking me out on a date. 2020, I finally got my first boyfriend, which lasted 6 months, 3 of those months he never showed up, he was an abuser...calling me names, saying rude remarks, bringing me down, always negative about my appearance, telling me what I can and cannot do....he eventually broke up with me, because of my mental health. Anyways, this year...I've went out with some guys, never went pass the first date, before they block me without a reason....and today I got ditched on again. My heart is tired of being betrayed and lied too, so I blocked from liking someone...or letting anyone in, because they all leave and never giving me a chance.

She did not reply to that message, so we haven't spoken since. I know most of the time in a situation like this people would say to cut my losses, but I really feel like we would be good together.

57,mv3fi9,1618961710,"He's just not that into me, right?","I've been single for a couple of months and have gone back on 'the apps'. It's been pretty fun for the most part considering I am now super selective about the character of the men I see. All have been excellent men. Some have been terrible potential partners.

HOWEVER...

I met this guy. He's a professional creative (not going to give away identifying details) and we seemed to get along pretty well on the first date. We kissed at the end and I was weak in the knees (when I usually feel nothing when I kiss someone). So naturally I was keen. He texted me the same day to thank me and arrange the next date.

The second date was great, he texted to organise a third time to see me in a couple of weeks after, and I asked him on a date for that weekend.

So the date count is up to 4. By the fourth date, I had a crush on him and was starting to develop feelings. Over text we'd spoken about what we were looking for which basically ended in him saying that he likes hanging out with me too much to be fwb, and he'd like to 'see where things go'. I told him that I not looking for fwb or casual and that I'd also like to see where things go. Also that I'm not ready to be exclusive but I'd like it to head that way. So we agreed we weren't exclusive.

But so far, they haven't gone anywhere. He texted me later that week to talk. I invited him over and we had sex. After sex we lay down and cuddled for a bit, maybe 30 mins, and then he left. The sex was great. I shot him a message the next day to say it was great and wish him well. He replied and the comvo continued in a basic way for the rest of the day. That was 1 day ago.

Now, nothing. He hasn't asked me out again or reached out since my last message (it was kinda a closing message).

When we text, he puts in a lot of effort to reply, ask questions etc. But he is REALLY slow with his replies, I'm talking hours (6+) if not days. This frustrates me to no end.

I wonder whether he's not that into me, or whether I need to make my feelings more known? I really do like this guy, he's smart, funny, talented and attractive and makes me feel things, but this communication and uncertainty is killing me.

I'm seeing some of the same men I saw on there months ago too, but that aside, it's interesting so far. I'm not devoting tons of time to these apps as I have personal projects and all that, but my goal is to have respectful conversations. My intentions are serious, obviously, I don't date for casual/to just converse.  

This one guy I matched with asked me, within about 5 mins, ""how is the app going for you?"" and I simply said I was brand new (true) and I didn't have much to report. His next question is ""so what are you looking for on here?"". I told him that I was looking for a serious thing. Another guy (31m) had asked me before (but after some actual conversation) and I said the same and he was happy to hear it, so I figured I'd be honest with this other person (29m). This guy (29m) goes ""well I'm looking for new friends mainly, not looking to rush it. I want a partner eventually some day too but I'm not looking to rush but I definitely miss having a partner who cares about me""... lol. ok? So I took him at his word, and respectfully said I understand and it sounds like we aren't on the same page (as I don't have endless amounts of time for conversations with men who are just looking to take it super slow), so no problem at all, but that basically I'm investing in serious-minded folks. Then he goes ""well I am looking for a relationship. Wait. I just said not tomorrow. I need to know someone for 3 months before it gets to that.""... I'm about to go, ""yeah of course not tomorrow, it takes time. People here are total strangers so I understand needing time as do I.""

I'm in my 30's and work, and I usually like to see the person again if I can the following week. So I hit them up later next week and ask to see what their availability is to get together again. 

But more so than usual I've found that most matches are not keen on meeting up again, right away (next week). They would rather wait 2 or 3 weeks, or they're busy for a month and meet up again, and that's cool and all but I feel like as weeks go by and maybe a month or so, the momentum is lost, the connection of wanting to know each other any further. 

So for someone like me, who is looking for a relationship, if things go well on a first date, am I rushing it by wanting to see them next week or so, and seeing if they're available by following up the next week?

Do I need to play it cool and just not follow up as much anymore? Sort of if it happens, it happens? But if so, how do people make connections, or build anything if we're always occupying our time?

I am worried that our career/lifestyle goals are pulling us in two different directions.,"My girlfriend and I matched on Tinder and she lives 1.5 hours away. We primarily see each other on weekends which hasn't been an issue so far since we both don't mind driving.

We have many things in common, and both feel a very strong/unique connection that we have not experienced before. That being said, the only barrier we face is that we are 1.5 hours apart. She lives in a big city, and I live in a small town. Career-wise it makes more sense for me to move closer to her, but I'm super attached to my hometown.

I get strong vibes that she expects me to leave all of my intangible assets that have taken a lifetime to build (friends, family, sense of community, lifestyle, etc.) and eventually move closer to her permanently. If we both have strong feelings for each other though, we both need to make sacrifices to make things work. I think living somewhere in the middle is a reasonable solution.

I don’t feel the need to bring it up just yet, but I think it’s something we should eventually talk about.

72,mv4uta,1618966638,my (19m) and girlfriend (19f) broke up...is our idea of the future possible?,"
hello fellow humans of reddit!! well there is no easy or right way to start this off so i guess ill try to give the most unbiased story about the situation i am in. i apologize in advance for jumpiness or holes in the story so feel free to ask for clarifications because this happened fairly recently.  to start, been with a girl for about 3 years. been friends since 11 and started dating at 16. i know this sounds cringe and cliche, but we were much closer than most couples are at our age. although we always had feelings for each other, we fell hard for eachother junior year. a lot of this background information is insignificant so ill try to keep it short. we did absolutely everything together and she always told me how “im the love of her life and how she sees a future of marriage and family down the road” etc. etc. although this is fairly childish to be thinking about at a young age, we both very deeply believed in it. we did absolutely everything together. 

i have had a very rough childhood and the majority of my peers and friends know this. she was there and helped me out of many holes i found myself in due to my dad being diagnosed with a fatal disease, my mother cheating, my parents getting divorced, and many family members dying. at the time we started dating i may or may not have been part of some illegal activities and ultimately cleaned my act up and got out of that life mainly for her. if it wasn’t for her, i could very well be in prison like a close friend of mine. not to mention near death experiences such as getting a gun stuffed in my face and robbed or horrible car accidents. i have had close friends die due to drug overdoses, car accidents, and even murder. she is the reason i stopped breaking the law and the reason i got clean and began succeeding in academics such as presidents list and getting accepted into a great university. her family treated me like a son and i actually worked for her brothers company for a long time. during this time her brother and i grew close. my family adored her as much as they adored me. my mother expressed to me many times how this girl seemed like the one for me in the long run even though we are very young, and she expressed how she has seen no other girl look at me the way this one does. she said we were meant to be together. my mother isnt one to sugar coat jack shit either she always tells me things how she sees them.


during our honeymoon phase our friendships with others suffered but we ultimately fixed this after we realized what was going on. she had to cut off some friends due to them either flirting with me or causing issues. we trust each other on a very real level and even share locations and would always post each other on social media like all couples do. at about the two year mark, we were at a wedding and got into multiple fights over stupid things. i was extremely intoxicated like everyone else there and it led me to making the worst decision or my life by dumping her at her brother’s wedding. there was no screaming match or anything dramatic, but by the next morning everyone had a gist that we were on a rough patch. i made this known to her how much i regretted it and how i didnt mean it etc. etc. and her family understood that this rough patch clearly wasn’t intended for the wedding and knew i had some personal problems going on so they never held a grudge against me for it. however, her oldest brother (not the one i used to work for) never looked at me the same way again and i don’t blame him for it. i broke his little sisters heart the night of his little brother’s wedding. 

even though we fixed things up quickly after, the damage had been done. i did not go over her house unless no one was home because she was uncomfortable about the whole thing until i finally spoke with her dad in person at a job site which for sure eased some stress. he honestly seemed happy to speak with me after such a long time. although i didn’t see her family nearly as much as i used to. she continued to come over my house all the time but wasn’t sleeping over like she used to due to us being casual. we used to sleep over each others houses all the time. we ultimately got back together but decided to keep things slow and steady but still continued to do everything we normally did. i apologize for the jumpiness but i also forgot to mention we graduated high school together and are attending the same college. during this entire time including the “temporary break up” we always showered each other in expensive gifts and always attended each other’s family events and bought gifts for each other’s families.  out of all my friends and hers combined, we were seen as an ever lasting couple and no one ever thought we would break up. it was surprising enough we began dating in the first place due to me being a “wild guy” and her the “innocent school girl”. 

we both agreed to go into college together with realistic expectations despite our past discussions of our entire future together and having a family of our own. recently after my 19th birthday i noticed her delving into sadness that i have never seen her succumb to before. after many attempts at trying to talk (which 9/10 times she always opens up to me) she finally admitted how she was depressed about the thought of me finding another girl in college even though we go to the same college, and that she is never happy unless i am with her. this was heartbreaking for me to hear and she admitted how she always thought her problems were so insignificant to the issues i have had to face in my own life. i stressed to her that anything she cares about, i do too.

 after multiple long and heart throbbing conversations, we decided that it would be best for both of us to go into college single. i believe she needs to be more independent and become happy with herself instead of only being happy with me. this conversation wouldn’t have come as soon as it did if i hadn’t addressed it but it was pretty much a mutual agreement. we have since taken each other off most social media although i am still tagged in some instagram stories and we both posted each other on snapchat just a week ago. we still send photos to friends when we find ourselves meeting up. we still talk via multiple social media platforms and facetime, but we are officially single. unlike the usual “30 day no contact period” we went a few days without speaking to allow us to calm down and focus on what happens next. this hurts me just as much as it hurts her. we ended things with saying “if you love something set it free, if it comes back to you its yours, if it doesn’t, it never was” 

the other day i dropped off a nice basket of flowers and gifts including a very heartfelt letter. we still meetup every now and then which usually leads to sex, but we still deeply care for one another regardless of that. although this happened fairly recently, we both say how the thought of each other with a different partner is gut wrenching and horrible to think about. neither of us are pursuing a new partner anytime soon, but we all can agree how college is... we also still share locations although im unsure of how long this will last. i am not trying to ramble more than i already have, but we both share the same ambitions, values, and hobbies. i am basically asking for advice, opinions, and brutal honesty about whether or not you personally believe we will get back together in the future. just last night we went to sleep on face time together. we still continue to help each other with school work (some of the same classes) as well.  i understand we are young and nothing is set in stone, but we have never fought over anything major besides the wedding bullshit and are always stronger and better than ever after any conflict.

 i am for sure forgetting some vital points so feel free to ask for more specifics and i will make edits as i go. it hurts to know we will most likely meet other people at our college, but thats a thought we will both have to get used to. i just want to know about what others think about us possibly getting back together in the near future after we focus on ourselves independently. thank you for reading this holy bible of text and i appreciate your time giving me opinions and feedback.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv4uta/my_19m_and_girlfriend_19f_broke_upis_our_idea_of/

I ""had"" to walk passed her to get produce and thought to myself how cool it would be if she noticed me and we started up a convo. That doesn't happen.

I get my mushrooms and just go on about my shopping right passed her. I need salmon so I go to get it. As I open the door, I notice the same girl in the glass and she is headed my way. I get what I need and then I notice the fresh salmon at the butcher. I start looking at it, but can't help but notice the girl buying salmon too. She then comes over and starts talking to the butcher about it.

She and I then start talking about different kinds/brands of salmon and she mentions about her uncle liking fishing and I mention about liking fishing. The butcher hands her salmon to her and she backs away from the counter. 

My dumb brain couldn't think of anything else to say and I blew it by saying, ""HaVe a GoOd NiGhT"" like a goober. She said ""you too"" and then stood there for a second before walking off.

I felt like I missed an opportunity to have real genuine conversation with a pretty girl that I shared something in common with. I partially blame COVID and Online Dating for my lack of in person social skills when it comes to women, but at the same time, do women want to be asked out at the grocery store? 

To give further context, she had airpods in, which I always take as a ""buzz off"" sign. I don't want to feel like I'm bothering someone by approaching them and normally there isn't that organic (no grocery store pun intended) conversation started just by walking up and saying ""hi"".

But it doesn’t really mean anything by itself. What’s more important, I think, is each person periodically letting off that they **respect you.** If there’s a periodic “I love you” gesture with no periodic communication of “I respect you” from either person, it sounds a lot like the relationship is dysfunctional and possibly lopsided.

So maybe this should be the thing that becomes a little habit people in relationships remember to do. Periodically remember to communicate to your partner in some fashion that you do in fact fully respect them for who they are",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv5x8b/i_just_realized_periodically_showing_someone/

83,mv62hh,1618971045,Is he interested in a second date?,"Hi all,

I \[23F\] went on a date about a week and half ago with this guy \[24M\] that I'd be talking to for a while on Instagram, and the date went really well. We went to coffee and talked for about 3/4 hours with no awkwardness at all, and we had a lot in common. I wasn't sure if it was just friend vibes or not so I'm interested in going on a second date to see. Since then we've messaged a fair bit, usually he initiates the conversations, but I have too, and the chat is pretty basic and not too interesting- we definitely had more to talk about in person. It's not very flirty at all, but I would put that down to us two trying to figure it out and I would say he is somewhat shy. 

I asked him out the first time, and he has not asked me out again - yet he does message me so seems interested.

Is he really interested? and what should I do? I obviously would prefer if he asked me out this time so I know that he is interested too, and because I feel like I've taken my 'turn', but I'm not sure if he will. I also think he might think I'm not interested romantically, which is somewhat true as I'm not sure yet and I'm hoping a second meeting will help with that. 

Advice is much appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv62hh/is_he_interested_in_a_second_date/

What makes it ambiguous is this.

 On one hand,  she actually initiates texting conversations,  she asks me lots of personal questions (including some pretty intimate ones)  and (this could just be my perception)  she seems to tailor her responses to be more in line with my beliefs and values.  

On the other hand,  she doesn't flirt at all.  When I made a flirtatious statement she did kind of reciprocate,  but it was pretty neutral.  

The reason I'm asking this on reddit like a teenager and not just asking her directly,  is because we live about 10 hours away,  and I'm afraid if anything does come of this its going to suck because long distance relationships don't work.  I also don't want to ruin this because I do genuinely enjoy talking to her.

90,mv6xyw,1618974305,Help me figure out what's going on,"Hi everyone! This is going to be a longer post, but I'll try and get the point quickly and keep my word count at a minimum.

I was visiting with my mom back in January and while I was there she became very insistent that I message one of her coworkers, a girl about my age. I was hesitant at first, but eventually I gave in and did so. We hit it off pretty well and began messaging semi-frequently. Sometimes there'd be an hour between messages, usually there would be a day or so, and on a couple occasions there was a whole week. The pace worked well for us both since we were/are both active college students working full time.

The convo was fairly light and casual during this time. We made plans to eventually meet up and go hiking, but we were both short on free time and mutually understood that it would probably have to happen sometime in March/April.

After one of these week-long delays, I received a message from her. I read it and thought I responded without realizing that I'd only thought of a response without actually sending it. This was in early March or so. 

Three weeks of no communication followed. Then, at the end of March, she got ahold of me by sending two duplicate messages via text and one on Messenger. I realized then that I had been the one who failed to respond last time. I was also kind of taken aback at the effort to get ahold of me on her end. It seemed like she really, genuinely wanted to keep talking to me. 

Our conversations vastly intensifies afterwards. We began sending each other extremely long messages everyday, without fail. Neither of us are very flirty, but we both also expressed a strong mutual fondness for one another. We were comfortable communicating and the convos were very fluid and easy. We set a date to meet and go hiking in stone.

There were other signs, too. One weekend she went backpacking with a couple friends and afterwards she told me that they had invited me to come along next time they were in town, which told me she was telling her friends about me. She was suggesting activities for date #2 and beyond, such as pizza night and wanting to do some board game/tabletop stuff. My mom, who works with her, told me that another coworker of hers had told my mom that the girl had said that I ""Made her smile inside."" This told me she was also telling her coworkers about me.

The day of the hike came and it went incredibly. I felt it did, at least. We had a picnic and were out and about for roughly five hours or so. It was wonderful. I was super nervous beforehand but as soon as she got in my car I was comfortable and judging by how much we were laughing, I think she felt the same.

 Towards the end of the date, as I was driving her home, she went out of her way to invite me to a family campout of hers all the way in June. At one point, as we were hiking back down to my car, we were talking about friendships and I mentioned that I didn't really feel like I truly had a ""Rock"" in my life. She was quiet for a moment before saying, ""I volunteer as tribute.""

Eventually I dropped her off and we shared a hug, which she initiated. I drove home and about two hours later I sent her a text thanking her for spending the day with me and letting her know I was looking forward to the next date, which we had already decided would be a pizza/movie night. She got back to me the next day, letting me know she had a blast with me and expressing excitement for pizza/movie night. She also let me know that I wouldn't be able to get ahold of her the next day because she had a final but afterwards she would be on spring break. I wished her luck and told her I totally understood.

I didn't hear from her the next two days. Two days after her final, my schedule got changed around, so I thought I'd text her and let her know I was available over the following weekend if she wanted to do pizza night. Previously, we hadn't decided on when the next date would be, only that it would happen. She got back to me a couple hours later apologizing for not texting me the day before as she was really worn out by the final and spent a lot of the day resting. She told me she would check her schedule and see if she had any time during the weekend, but wasn't sure since she made plans to spend time with her cousin at some point during the week. 

I replied it was all good, no pressure either way and that I hoped she felt better. She replied later that evening expressing great fatigue and issues at work, to which I replied asking her if she wanted to vent and by also sending a M E M E to hopefully cheer her up. It's been radio silence since then, about a week ago.

So one half of me is telling me that she seemed exhausted and super busy and that she may be dealing with other personal issues, hence the silence. The other half is desperately worried that I may have done something wrong or come off as too clingy after the date. I've spoken to a couple of friends about it and they've all said I was overanalyzing the situation and that I should just chill, maybe send a text in another few days or so. Part of me fully believes that, but another is worried that I'm missing something and that I've messed up somehow.

It just feels jarring with the complete drop off in communication since the date. I'm nervous I put her off, but then I also wonder why she would invite me to an activity with her family in June and offer to be my ""rock,"" all towards the end of the date, if that was the case. I kind of want to reach out again just to see how she is doing, but I also really don't want to come off as too clingy. If she isn't texting me then I feel like she must need her space or otherwise doesn't feel inclined to talk to me. There have been times in the past where we didn't talk for a week or two, but things have been so different since we picked up at the end of March that it seems strange for it to happen again. One of my friends said something interesting; that maybe she feels comfortable enough with me that she can stop talking to me for a while and know I won't take it personally. I dunno.

I'm not trying to be high maintenance or be demanding of her attention and I hope I'm not coming across that way here. I'm just trying to figure out what exactly is happening. Should I be worried? Should I check in on her? Should I just sit tight and let her come to me, if she comes to me? I really like this girl and I truly don't want to blow it here.

Also I hope I've worded this okay. I'm very tired and just finished class so I'm doing my best to be comprehensive 😅

93,mv74ze,1618975063,Breakup Epiphany,"First things first:

* I am 21 and he is 19. We'll call him J. We met at college almost a year and a half ago. He's my best friend in the whole world, and I am his first relationship. (I do have other friends, too: currently living with my high school best friend of 17 years and a college friend.)
* My first real relationship ended with me being manipulated and physically bruised. My second was my high school crush and we dated for 4 years before breaking up. J is my third real relationship, and we started dating in January of 2020. 

We broke up. The absolute love of my life, yet it ended up making me the happiest I've been in years.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, depression, and PTSD when I went off to college about 4 years ago, and I was just learning how to cope when I had to hold my grandfather's hand as he took his last breath after a quadruple-bypass open heart surgery and 2-week-long coma. My life was on a downward spiral from there until I met him. 

When I met him, it was like everything fell into place. I fell *hard.* I know everyone says this, but I loved him like he would be the last one I would ever love. My family loved him so much that my 8-year-old sister would run to hug him first whenever we would come home from college to visit my hometown together. My dad even **hugged him once.** (This doesn't seem like a big deal to you, but my dad is exactly like Ron Swanson from Parks &amp; Rec, if that puts things in perspective.) He and I are opposites that compliment each other perfectly and grow mentally and emotionally as a result of this, but he's also the only person in my life that likes the nerdy things I like and will talk about controversy and space and parallel universes and other deep stuff with me. 

He told me he loved me within the first two weeks of dating. We talked about getting married and building a life together, and we worked out a plan for the future so that we won't have to do long distance (since I'm 3 years older and will graduate before he does). 

As some of you may know, mental health issues come with ugly symptoms like ""depression room"". Mine was so bad that after I couldn't see any more of my floor due to all the clothes and garbage, it took over every inch of my entire living space. I literally had not cleaned my room, bathroom, closet, or desk area in two years. Eventually, he would ask me to go out to eat with him or to go bowling or do some other kind of date, and I would say no nearly every time. I just never felt like I could get up and go anywhere. This was for months. I never gave him any reason to think things would change. He started to think about what our future would look like with me being like this, what kind of wife and mother I would be in this state. He also realized that he would often blow off studying for tests or doing assignments because he would rather hang out with me, and he is failing one of his classes as a result. He decided he wanted to break it off before things got any harder. 

I was devastated. Blindsided, though I should've seen it coming. I knew why he did it the moment it happened. I got up from my desk, sobbing, and crawled into my bed. I looked at the mountain of clothes at the foot of the bed so high that I couldn't see my bathroom door around it. And then... Something inside me just... clicked. I normally would've spent the day crying and trying to find some kind of numbness at the bottom of a bottle of vodka, but I just got up and started putting clothes away. I washed at least 15 loads of clothes. I cleaned my entire bathroom. I organized my closet, top to bottom. I spent **2 whole hours** on my hands and knees vacuuming every inch of my small living space in my apartment. I'm still working on my bedroom floor. 

And yeah, part of me was doing it in hopes of getting back together with him. I definitely thought that was the dominant reason at first. I sent him pictures of my room after I had gotten the very thick layer of clothes off of every inch of my bedroom floor. When he said he was proud of me, I didn't feel that surge of pride and intense desire to hear him say it again like I thought I would. I realized that I wasn't doing this for him. I was doing it because of me. I've been cleaning and organizing, working on my area for at least a couple of hours per day, every day, for a week. I even started going to the pool to get some sun, exercising, spending more time with friends, and turning in assignments early. 

Maybe it was because I subconsciously realized it was overdue. Someone like me should know how to take care of themselves, after all. Maybe it was because I needed to prove to myself that I could survive without him. Maybe I started just to make my brain be quiet. Either way, I see a huge difference in my happiness after taking that initiative, and my roommates told me that they've never seen me thriving like this the whole time we've lived together. 

J and I have been hanging out and texting because we determined that we can't go without each other's friendship. 4 days ago, he told me he still loves me and kissed me in his car. He said that he needs to study really hard for finals which are in 2 weeks so I've been giving him advice on how to learn time management, and he's already seen results himself. We plan to regroup on May 3 when finals are over and possibly get back together then. I'm finally someone deserving of him-- and with or without him, I'm who I was meant to be all along. I'm so proud of myself and love myself so much more now.

It absolutely blows my mind how I went from being so controlled by my issues that I neglected myself, my surroundings, and my relationship, and being the one that needed help so badly, to pulling a complete 180, getting literally every area of my life together for the first time in over 2 years, and being on top of my \*\*\*\* enough to be able to help *him.* 

I still don't know what happened in my brain that prompted this. And even though I'm really happy that we might get back together, I'm even happier knowing that I'll be ~~okay~~ thriving either way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv74ze/breakup_epiphany/

95,mv7eek,1618976065,Why do people go to the beach? Please let me know your gender (however you identify) also. :),"I was told by my boyfriend that at least 25% of the reason why men go to the beach is typically to look at the women. If the women weren't there, then the men wouldn't be as incentivized to go. He also said that women must like to have the sexual freedom to be permitted to show their nearly naked selves off to the world and many likely go to show off. Is any of that true?

Personally, I go to swim, be with friends, and get sunlight/views. Maybe it would be different if I had friends who liked prowling for men on our outings?

Why I'm asking:
Anyway, for 27 years now, I have been going to the beach in my little bathing suit thinking that the world dresses in skimpy, tight clothing already, so getting glanced at at the beach should be just as negligable as anywhere else. If somebody looks at my body in a cafe, they're still only there for the coffee, usually.  Not the same at the beach? My bf said it was because of the bare skin and buttcheeks and because the girls want to show off.

To clarify, I don't want to show off or check anybody out. I want to splash around and get some sun lol.

I was so amazed though! What was I not noticing?? Lol. I don't see man buttcheeks at the beach, so maybe that's why I don't go there to take DL pics and check people out?? 👙👀

Personally, no part of me goes there to show off to people other than my boyfriend. If anything though, I dress nicely for him and for myself, so I don't feel like I look less attractive to my bf than the other women. Also, if I was single, I usually wouldn't try to find a man at the beach at all, and I really don't check them out. Maybe if I was with a thirsty friend. Men sense my eyes, so I've learned to not be looking. If I heard a guy getting roasted or picked on, I'd probably look at him to make his friends jealous though. All minor details. 

Side note: A tip for getting a girl at the beach:

Also, just my take on this, if you go to the beach to try to find a girl, I suggest just looking like you're clean and have nice stuff. My boyfriend has like yeti brand stuff and name brand glasses but doesn't have his own apartment etc, and I think theses things are a waste of money, BUT it is attractive to me. Like, it indicates obvious attractiveness, like when a girl wears a very obviously pretty dress. You just recognize it as a symbol of attractiveness. Not about the bodies that much to me. Try focusing more on social cues like that about your reliability as a person and about how much you fit into a respectable/stable social group. If that sounds shallow, well, so is a pretty girl wearing a bunch of nice dresses then. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv7eek/why_do_people_go_to_the_beach_please_let_me_know/
