At our school, we have a winter dance. A guy (18M) with a large crush on me asked me to go. I wasn’t sure how I felt about him at the time (I’m not good with feelings), so I said yes. But over the last week, it’s become clear to me that I don’t like him back. He’s a kind person and his romantic interest in me is clear— we’ve only known each other for a little over a month, but he showers me with compliments and gifts and he wants to hang out with me every day— but he just isn’t my type. I don’t feel the same connection with him that he seems to feel with me, and there are some aspects of his personality that, as much as I hate this and know this sounds cruel, annoy me. Secretly, I’m beginning find myself constantly criticizing him when we spend time together. It also feels like there’s a slight maturity difference between us in some ways. I’m realizing I’m not physically attracted to him either, and it’s occurring to me that I really do not want to kiss him. 

If it weren’t for me having accepted his invitation to the dance, I’d simply tell him I don’t have feelings. But because I already committed to the dance— which is taking place in 7 days, right before Valentine’s Day— I have no idea what to do. 

I would feel like an absolute asshole for telling him I’ve changed my mind. It’s been several days, and he’s clearly very excited. Not only that, a few days ago when I wasn’t sure of my lack of feelings, I spontaneously told him I was glad he asked me and that I was really looking forward to going. To shift so quickly would feel even worse— I’d feel like I was playing with his emotions. But at the same time,  going to the dance with him and doing everything that would entail— dressing up, holding hands, dancing together, having a date night, possibly kissing— when I don’t actually crush on him back, knowing that within days of it being over I plan to break up with him, would be a cruel way of leading him on. It doesn’t feel like there’s any right thing to do. I know I shouldn’t have said yes when I wasn’t fully committed in the first place, and I regret it. 

So my question is, which of these two options is less unkind? Which is likely to hurt him least? Is there a third option I haven’t considered? Should I try and give him a chance? How badly did I mess up? Most importantly, is there anything I can do that doesn’t result in me being an asshole and losing integrity? I don’t want to hurt him and I don’t want to break a commitment I made. But frankly, I really don’t want to date him, and temporarily lying about it feels wrong, too.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157253,public,self,"Is there any way I can resolve this awkward situation with integrity?

He asked me out, but I wasn’t looking to date at the time. We stayed cool, and he even started volunteering with kids at the same place as me (but on different days so we rarely see each other). 6ish months later (in 2020) he asked me out and I rejected him cause I wasn’t romantically attracted to him. I knew he was an amazing guy but It wouldn’t be fair to him to date him if I wasn’t attracted to him. We stopped texting and we would only talk the rare times we saw each other in person.

I saw him last week to help serve food at one of the volunteering events, and I went over to see how he was doing. Let me just say that this man is amazing.  We talked to catch up with each other, and turns out he got a promotion at his job and he’s going to school part time. And, all the kids in his group LOVE him. It was so cute, all the kids would run up and interrupt us trying to talk to him, and one of the middle school boys shouted “we love you (name)!” when he saw him. I couldn’t help but keep saying “aww” lol the way the kids love him was adorable. 

After talking for a while I realized that he is practically everything I could ever want in a guy. Amazing heart, great guy, genuine, great with kids, makes me laugh, everything… except I’m not attracted to him. It sucks because he’s not ugly at all, most would say attractive. But for whatever reason, not to me. I hate it because I’ve never met anyone like him. It also sucks because a married couple where we volunteer kept telling me how nice he is and they hinted to me that we should date. But I told them I’m not interested in dating, cause I don’t want to be rude and say I’m not attracted to him. Apparently he mentioned to them that he was looking to date but no one was interested in him. How?!? He’s so amazing, and like I said, he’s attractive so I’m surprised that he is single. I kinda feel bad for him too since I rejected him.

Sometimes I hate the way attraction works. I’m sure that one day I’ll meet the perfect guy, and he’ll meet the perfect girl. But until then I’ll be sad knowing how close he is to being a good match.

I tried to be friendly. But she admitted she thought I was scary looking and that I 'look like an aryan gang member.'

But it had been going for a while, this girl just stopped texting me like normal and didn't want to hang out but wouldn't say she didn't want to date. But wouldn't say why she didn't want to hang out. So obviously I'm gonna assume she doesn't want to date anymore and she doesn't want to tell me. So I asked if that was the case and she would just ignore it. 

So things were different for a while and she obviously didn't like me as much as I liked her. I still think she is a lovely and nice person but she did not seem as passionate or interested in me as she was so I think it was bound to happen. I still wish I could still be good friends with her but understand this may not be the case. I just feel stinky not seeing that she texted me anymore.

he (21m at the time) was my (20f at the time) first boyfriend and we weren't even together for an entire year. we met at a party of a mutual friend - we had similar personalities, we were majoring in the same thing, and i was about to transfer to the same college as him. everything fell into place pretty well; not to mention we were each other's first everything.

he was a great guy, but he had a lot of problems. ones that i couldn't properly offer support for because i had a lot of my own problems too. not only that, but he was in denial. he was a huge hypochondriac, he thought something was really wrong with him like every other day (celiac, a brain issue, a soy allergy, just to name the top ones i can remember). in my opinion he also had undiagnosed depression, but like i said, he was kind of in denial about this stuff so when he was venting or complaining to me all i could do was listen instead of telling him to get help. it's not like i could just tell him i thought it was all in his head when he was crying and pouring his heart out to me about his health. but i loved him a lot; he was smart and eccentric and i always thought he was really cool even as a huge nerd. and he was always so soft, romantic, and sweet with me, he was a really sensitive guy and i know he loved me too. but we broke up in march of 2020. partly fueled by COVID, partly because of his weird trust issues and the awful way in which he handled us having problems which i won't entirely get into here. the catalyst for our final fight was when i asked to see a study guide he made for a class we were both in and he said no because he worked really hard on it and basically didn't want me to ""use him"". even though i helped him make the study guide and showed him all of my notes. the ensuing interactions we had were entirely negative and i hate how he smug he was and how he handled the situation.

anyway, i'm in a relationship now. i love my current boyfriend more than anything; we've been together for 9 months. i wanted to get back together with my ex for so long after we broke up, and i was even hesitant to start dating my current boyfriend because i didn't want to jump into a new relationship if i was still thinking about my ex even though by then those feelings subsided. i'm glad i did because we just get each other. i can be myself around him, which i never felt comfortable enough to do with my ex. he makes me laugh and he's been there for me through an extremely hard period of my life (i attempted suicide in december and he was more supportive than i could have ever asked for). he's kind of the opposite of my ex in a lot of ways, which is a good thing.

so why do i keep thinking about my ex? i have no idea. sometimes it's still even me missing him and wanting us to be together again. but mostly, i just wonder what he's up to and if he's moved on yet. for some reason, the thought of him finding someone else breaks my heart and i have no idea why. he unfollowed me on all social media, but i still look him up occasionally on spotify, and the playlists he makes are all based on things happening in his life so i feel like in some way i'm still keeping up with him. i know i shouldn't look but i guess i just don't care enough to stop myself lol. writing this made me feel a lot better though. i guess i’d like to know if anyone else is in a similar boat.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157281,public,self,i still think about my ex daily,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/skz9xb/i_still_think_about_my_ex_daily/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,

She said her friends told her to ghost me because I guess poor table manners (Haven't been on many lunch dates) but in her world it was ok to go on a 30 minute rant about her ex husband's poor communication and unwillingness to work on her marriage, but she did the exact same thing with me.

All of our plans have been the day of. He always initiates and we usually go somewhere for drinks or food, and he always pays, but It’s starting to get to me. Last time I saw him we just were at his house watching a movie. 

When I left, I asked if I could see him on Friday night, which is today. He told me “I’m not really sure what I’m doing this weekend yet.” I asked “well would you want to meet up on Friday?” He responded “probably, I’ll let you know.”. He texted me in the days in between but then no mention of meeting up today. When It got close to the time we usually meet, I texted him asking if we were still meeting. He then responded to me “he can’t because he’s meeting up with friends tonight for a birthday party.” To me, it seems like he should’ve told me this the other day as I’m sure he would’ve known in advance? I’m starting to get irritated. 

Should I continue to see this man? After coming up with this excuse he didn’t even make other plans or suggest a different date. Just completely flaked out. And he didn’t even tell me ahead of time, like I mentioned, I had to ask. Every time he has asked me to meet except for our first date it has been within an hour or two before, asking if I can meet for drinks or to grab a bite. I’m the kind of person that I really need to have a plan. I want a serious relationship and I think I’m deserving of someone that schedules time to see me. He’s very sweet when we are together, talking about love languages and cuddling with me and having deep convos. I truly felt a connection. And I really saw this potentially going somewhere. But when we are not together, he barely texts me and answers every few hours. It’s all so confusing. Oh, and he’s 31. He’s clearly capable of making plans with other people as he just went on a trip with some friends last week and he had plans with his friends tonight apparently, and tomorrow he told me he’s going over to a friend’s for dinner. So why am I any different? Am I asking for too much? I was getting so excited about how often he wanted to see me, I didn’t even think about how maybe he was just bored. He couldn’t even commit to getting *drinks* today, not to mention anytime this weekend. And like I said, he flaked out on me tonight but never gave me a date to reschedule. It’s a bit hurtful.

She also revealed they met late (10:30 pm-12:30), she was drinking while he was eating dinner, and she didnt mention me until after the meet.  She confidently said they had no physical touch (”didnt even hug”).  

She said, ”you met with your ex recently”.  She may have assumed it was ok because I met with my ex recently, though it was literally to give her an important piece of mail for 5 minutes outside the neighborhood convenience store.  She seemed surprised when I explained this, possibly thinking it was more friendly.  She has also always been encouraging about me remaining friends with my ex, leading me to see a possibility that she's just the kind of person who doesn't have an issue with it.

She's been acting a tad strange since that night.  She didnt mention it until now, in person, not when we spoke on the phone a couple days ago.  She also acted accusatory and skeptical of me when we did, after I explained why I was unreachable that evening with a valid reason.

Just to make things clear, I mean no ill-will to my gay bros out there. Honestly, I don’t really care if another dude thinks that I’m gay and it doesn’t bother me. It does seem to me, however, that appearing gay can turn off a lot of women, in the sense that they might think “oh why should I even talk to him he’s clearly gay and won’t be interested”. Here are a couple of situations that make me think this is the case.

I’ve been hit on by guys multiple times in public. One time I waiting to get in to a nightclub, in line along with a bunch of other normal looking dudes when some guy singles me out and tells me I’m cute and blows an air kiss? I was really confused here because he could’ve done this to any of the good-looking guys in line, so clearly he picked me specifically because he assumed it would be well received.

Another time, a (actually gay) friend of mine invited me to a party along with 3-4 other straight guys he knew. I had a fun time with everyone, but felt like people there treated me a bit… weird? I’m not sure how to put it but even though they seemed friendly enough I thought they seemed a bit distant and didn’t want to talk to me (I might be reading too much into this). I later heard through my friend that everyone there assumed that he invited me there as a date. None of them knew me before and had no reason to assume I was gay other than my appearance, I guess.

In the past 3 years I’ve been on dates with a total of 4 women, 2 from apps and 2 from irl (not from lack of trying, I get very few matches on Tinder). All of them later told me they were bisexual. Like I said I have no problem with this personally, but surely this can’t be a coincidence?! I assume that bi women are primarily interested in bi men so it would make sense to me that they would try to go for a guy that looks gay.

I’m not sure why this is happening or how I can fix it. I don’t wear or do anything that I generally think of as being stereotypically “gay”  I have a short-ish undercut hairstyle. I don’t wear jewelry besides necklaces &amp; watches. I do have a good skincare routine but I don’t wear makeup or anything besides a bit of concealer for blemishes and such. My wardrobe is pretty basic. Once I graduated college and got a real job (I’m 24) I upgraded my wardrobe to be a bit more sophisticated and mature and by that I mean throwing out my old graphic tees, buying lots of sweaters, and getting nice fitting pants instead of jeans.

He's not my boyfriend and we live a bit far away, so we can't meet all the time but we talk everyday on the phone. We know we are into each other and have a strong bond. 

A month and a half ago he went on vacations to a big city. He would text me in the day to show me what he was doing and talk in the night until we both fall asleep. He told me a few times how much he wanted me to be there with him and a lot of nice things. 
We had this silly joke where I would pretend to be toxic and jealous over him (it started when he made a joke about how would he feel loved if I wasn't toxic to him). 
It was funny and everything. One day he told me an European girl approached him in the pool and kinda flirted with him. He felt good about himself and the way he looks (he's kinda insecure). All good with that. 

The next day I say good morning to him and he answers with a selfie of him and this European girl, saying ""this doesn't means I'm cheating on you"". He pretended it to be a joke, and I think he wanted to make me jealous for real. Well, I was jealous, and a little angry. I didn't say anything but he realized how I was feeling, he apologized, explained he maybe took our joke too far, said he was unrespectful to me and said it won't happen again. 

I still was a little angry, but I understood. In the afternoon he posted an Instagram story of this girl taking a drink with him and I felt so bad about it.

In the night he was taking his flight to come back home and he was so sad. He's in crisis with his life and job, so coming back to everyday life was hard for him. We started talking about it, and he told me something like he thinks he has a crush on this girl (not his exact words, it was something impossible to translate into English, but it has a very similar meaning), and that they kissed. 
He said sorry before saying all this things. And in the end he said he was being so disrespectful to me. 
Told me this girl cried when he left (they met at least 36 hours before that...) and saying it felt like a kick in the head. And that he hopes this doesn't last forever. 
I don't know why, but I saw he was suffering and I was supportive to him. 

I can't explain how brokenhearted I felt. The next days I felt so sad, I even lost my appetite and I cried a lot.
 
A few days later he texted me saying he loves me (Te quiero in Spanish, wich is less romantic than Te amo). I didn't answer. 
He explained he knew he hurt me and even feeling so bad about what he did I was supporting him, so he feels that he loves me. 
We had a long conversation and I explained exactly how he made me feel. 
He accepted everything, and told me he doesn't know what happened to him that night. And things like he was so sorry, that he doesn't wanna lose me, that he has feelings for me and want so hard to make it up to me. 

So, now some time has goes by and he has been so nice to me. We click and connect even more than before. But this stills hurts so much... 
I don't know what to do. I wanna be with him, but when I remember about this situation I become so angry and sad. 

The other day he had a toxic behavior towards me out of jealously (for no reason). I got upset, set up my boundaries and I couldn't help to bring up the situation with the European girl... I told him I still feel hurt about it. He accepted everything. 
But I'm not sure how healthy can be to bring up this thing now and then everytime I get angry.

my mom shouted and slapped me saying me and my sister now have to work side jobs to raise money for an abortion and i agreed.
I know I have to have an abortion because my parents cannot afford to raise another child. my dad lost his job because pandemic here in the philippines is so bad.
some of my friends gave me some money for the abortion and i love them so much but its just not enough. abortion in the philippines is illegal so the clinic im going to is asking alot.

ive been calling the guy who got me pregnant to atleast help in paying the clinic but hes blocked me on all social media accounts. im so stupid and feel so angry towards myself for letting this happen. ive been having random break downs in my room and im always panicking and dont know what to do. im also scared to have an abortion because ive never done it.

They’re attentive in other ways but because they get soft frequently… over time it’s really affecting my libido and confidence. I’ve asked if there’s something I’m doing wrong/could do better and they assure me that everything is ok, that they can’t focus.

I honestly feel a little suffocated. Probably because I’m trying to conceal my feelings.

I dated this guy from Tinder. On the first date we went out, second date I ended up going his place for a movie, we had sex and I stayed for the night. 

He made it very clear that he wants to have sex with me again and I was fine with it being like that - I liked the sex we had and wouldn’t have minded to meet him again.

However, a few red flags were there: he was lazy with getting me to his apartment by his car even though I asked him (the neighborhood he lived in was 1hr bus drive away from me, he didn’t show much enthusiasm to pick me up even from the city centre.). He also had promised at night that he could drop me off in the morning, but didn’t mention it in the morning and texted me only 3 days after we had sex. Usually he texted me daily.

I didn’t think too much of it at this point.

Later on he contacts me and asks if I wanna meet again more, later on we agree on meeting, I offered him times when I’d be free. He agreed we should meet then but he basically left me hanging and never texted. I assume I was just an option from many others.

Now, a month later he comes back and texts me just “what’s up”. 🤨

**I’m kinda sad cause I would’ve wanted to hookup more with him, but the lack of respect from his side really turns me off.**

**Am I allowed to feel like this?** I still assume casual dating should include good communication and respect towards one another. 

**I’m sad cause I would’ve wanted to explore sex more with him together, but he kind of ruined his chances.** He seemed like a nice guy overall and matched my physical criteria at least.

Now it’s weird to even think of replying back to him… It’s dumb but I’m angry/sad that this didn’t work out and now out of principle I shouldn’t respond to him so he wouldn’t think he can treat me like sh*t. 🤔

This week the guy I'd been seeing suddenly decided to end things out of the blue, and I've been struggling to process the situation. Thought maybe I could find some insights/ comfort here. 

We hadn't been seeing each other for a great deal of time - only a couple of weeks - but it was INTENSE. We hit it off immediately on the first date, we had so much in common and so many shared interests, and the conversation never grew dull. He invited me to his flat on the second date (where it also went really well and things got intimate). 

Over the next week I stayed over at his another two times, went on a brunch date and played tennis with him, and he repeatedly kept making plans for future dates and things we could do together. He wanted to introduce me to his friends, teach me golf, go on adventures together. I was surprised at how keen he was and how fast he wanted to take things: he had two days off work and said he wanted to spend one of them on a day trip with me. We also made further plans to watch football together, and go to the cinema.

I said goodbye to him on the morning before the day trip, and he told me to send over ideas for the next day so we could plan the trip that evening. However, he didn't reply that evening, and on the morning of the day trip said he needed to cancel, explaining he needed some time to himself to produce his music. This was the first (and only) warning that things weren't right.

The day after, he messaged to say he felt that while we had loads in common and I was really nice, he felt we 'didn't click' and he didn't want to take things further. He said he'd spent a whole day thinking it over. He admitted it was out of the blue and that he had come on too strong. 

This totally blindsided me because he'd been so enthusiastic about the whole thing - pushing the pace of things way faster than I would normally take them - and I felt we definitely \*had\* clicked really well. Every single signal he gave off was that he liked me and wanted to keep seeing me. He couldn't keep his hands off me and was so affectionate. It had started to feel like we were already in a relationship. 

I messaged him to say that how much I enjoyed hanging out with him and that I'd fallen pretty hard for him, but it was his call, to which he replied that he was sorry and needs to learn 'not to take things too fast and get too excited'. Communications ended on a friendly note, and he said he would still help produce one of my music tracks if I wanted. 

Basically, I don't really understand why he changed his mind literally overnight. Was he on a rebound? Did an ex come back into the picture? Does he have unrealistic expectations of what a relationship should be? Did he scare himself at how fast he was taking things? I guess I'll never know. My friends are telling me I should be mad at him, but I just feel sad, and (although it's messed up) I still want him back. I feel devastated at the loss of something that was really good, and could have developed into a long-term thing. I opened myself up to him faster than I normally would, because he made me feel so secure.

Perhaps the lesson here is to try to slow the pace of things down, but I didn't want to put the brakes on something that was going so well. I find that I'm very rarely attracted to people, and at the moment I'm wondering if I'm going to find a connection like that again. 

I'm also not sure how I'm going to be able to trust people again when dating... this has messed me up pretty badly. I also feel stupid for being so emotional over such a short-term thing.

From there I didn't know if I should've chatted with her on the daily or not. I noticed she wouldn't really engage in a conversation and only answer with hahahahaha* or sentences not leading to open conversations. I still sent her a couple more messages but felt ghosted. Didn't invite her on a second date yet as I had a family weekend planned.
We met at work cause she's doing a internship before finishing another class for her career. We also did match on tinder. I went to check the all this morning cause I'm getting uncertain and she unmatched me.

Can I interpret that she might not be interested? I was planning on asking her out just so we can see each other again next weekend, letting her know to feel completely comfortable with her answer because I value communication and honesty but maybe it's already too late? What can I do? This also makes me feel as I'm gonna have an harder time next time I try to date again. She was really joyful and interesting the way I love...

 What she doesn't know is that she was the first girl I've had sex with ( I lost my virginity to her). We are dating for too little of a time for me to tell her that and I really don't want to say it any time soon. 

She had been FWB-ing with another dude right before she met me. (Like a week or so)  They have had uprotected sex since she was on the pill. 

At first we were having protested sex but a week or so later she told me she went for a routine check up and that she is on the pill. So we continued without a condom. (That was almost 2 and even more months ago).

As soon as we started having sex unprotected little itches started appearing, but they were gone in a day or two. 

She said that the docs told her it was probably me who transmitted it, and I ofc said to her that it's really unlikely. 

She spoke to her FWB to tell him what she is got, so he will take a test and the results will come soon. 

Could have I been the cause of this STD. If the guy has a negative test could he be still the cause of the STD. Or is it certain that it didn't come from him if he is negative after almost 3 months. I really would appreciate some input ty for your attention.

Is there a way to get back to my old self and just be happy seeing where things go with him? 


Ok, I hope this doesn’t come off as just a vent session for myself because I really would like feedback and advice but anyways, here goes. 

I met a cute guy on a dating app. So I immediately think there’s mutual interest. We both swiped right. We start talking and things seemed to be going very well. He decided he wanted to video chat before our first date. I agreed to that even though I wasn’t very comfortable doing so. I don’t really like the way I look on camera and feel like I look better in person. We video chatted and I felt like I had made it through some sort of test. We both decided we should go out on a date. We met in person and things went well. We got kinda deep and talked about a lot of things including our past. He ended up coming back to my place and some “heavy petting” happened. 

I have ALWAYS been pretty self confident but for some reason… i’m not completely myself in this aspect with him. I think the issue is I can’t exactly pinpoint WHAT im feeling. There are a few factors here…. I feel myself kind of self sabotaging and in my head I think I can feel him pulling away already because of it.. 

The worrying factors are…
* I may feel that he is out of my league… 
(I am a plus sized dark skinned woman. I swear I don’t say this to insinuate that im not attractive because of this… I only say this because society views plus sized dark skinned women as bottom of the barrel) 
* Maybe this shouldn’t matter but I also have never been so quickly into someone outside of my race… He is Korean and white. And he’s really fit and attractive. I think there may be a part of me that wonders if he just has a fetish and that’s the only thing there for him. I would like to bring up race and see how he truly feels but I know it shouldn’t matter and I don’t want to offend him. 
* He cancelled our last date and I think it made me doubt our connection even more. 

I feel that I am overthinking and self sabotaging and no matter what I haven’t been able to shake this weird feeling. I would like to say that this really is more about me than him.. but it doesn’t help that he is a very quiet, soft spoken man… he’s gentle and at times I feel like he isn’t completely open with exactly how he’s feeling. As silly as it sounds.. even though we were on a first date.. until he pulled me in for a kiss I still wasn’t sure if he was into me or not in that way. I get so nervous around him and i’m never like this with men. Usually i’m more forward… but I like him more than i’ve liked anyone in a long time. I’m so afraid to mess this up in the early stages because I feel something so real and strong already… if only I could get rid of this doubt and negative feelings. 

Is there a way I can get my mind to stop overthinking and dwelling on negative outcomes? Or could it be my intuition telling me something is amiss…",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157369,public,self,I have never been confused and nervous like this before.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sl7qwd/i_have_never_been_confused_and_nervous_like_this/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,

Before I get to the general backstory, the following is more about me, so you can get an idea of who I am.  I’m simply setting the stage.

M/35, lives near NYC and childfree.  Physically, I’m of slim build (142lbs), 5’7”, brown hair, brown eyes, have a stubble/beard that’s maintained daily, hair medium length (w/gel) with sides faded/buzzed.  I’d post a picture if I could of myself.

When going out to meet people, I tend to wear charles tyhrwitt button down shirts, black jeans, gold citizen watch, Cole Haan or Allen Edmond shoes.  I shower daily, wear dove deodorant and Versace cologne.

Upbringing was a happy one.  Parents together for 40+ years and going strong, was taught healthy habits (“no” means “no”, importance of consent, good manners, etc.). No trauma and no mental illnesses.

Career wise, things are going very well.  I run my own law office.  I netted around 250k in 2021.  While I don’t think I’m going to accept it, there’s another firm that wants me to start and head a department for them and pay me triple what I make, but I simply don’t want to give up my autonomy.  I also make investments and earn passive income on them (index funds, real estate, etc).  I take 3 or 4 domestic/foreign trips a year.

So, when people often learn this, they naturally ask, “you’re married, right?”

Not quite.

For me, dating has been the complete opposite of my career, an incredibly frustrating and punishing process.  A lot of convos that went nowhere.  A lot of ghosting.  A lot of mixed signals—saying they want to be friends then reaching for my hand when we see each other and then wanting to be friends again after it, taking 3-4 days to reply to a text—and lack of chemistry.  

I’ve tried almost every dating app, read every advice column, etc.  I’ve been on many first, second or third dates, but I’ve never had a long term girlfriend.  It’s been a whole lot of work with very little return. 

Some personality characteristics of mine: in real life, I’m modest.  I don’t boast about any of my accomplishments. I can also be a little shy.  For instance, if I see an attractive girl in a public place—and it’s not at a meetup or friend’s party—I won’t go up and talk to her.  I personally hate the dating apps.

I do enjoy being single; it’s what I’m used to, but it can get lonely at times.

I’ve taken breaks in the past, but now I’m thinking it should be permanent.  I know though if I give up, the chances of finding someone will pretty much go down to near zero, and I’ll just have to accept the fact that I’ll be single and never find a life partner. Women don’t approach me in real life.  Maybe every 7-8 years, one gives me sustained eye contact and smiles at me.
