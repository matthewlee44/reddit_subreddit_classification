My GF of 3Y broke up w/ me about 5 weeks ago - Important to mention she was my first long term relationship (I'm 28) so needless to say, the breakup hit me hard, and still has me in shambles. A bit of background story to understand a bit better my situation, I'm not a guy that actively date, the way I got this girl was because we work the same job as me for the same company but in different buildings, and one day I had to go do a big project in her building and she was my ""partner"" for that week since we do the same job. We had talked before but nothing more. Organically, we started talking, she started texting me after work then during the evening, I didn't think any of it at first but one thing led to the other, we started getting into each other, we started asking deeper questions, we started meeting up and hanging out, and one day I made the move and kissed her. I never thought I would've ended up with her (F38) but it clicked, there was chemistry. I was fairly overweight then (even more now since covid) and was surprised a girl as fit and in shape as her was interested in me in the first place... not to add she knew I was a gamer and loved gaming... which really sounds like a loser and non attracting thing now that I'm able to reflect on it. Nonetheless it was seriously the best 3Y of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Here, so now you understand it all happened without me really actively looking or trying. I live in a fairly small town, I'm no guy to be on tinder and stuff like that, it's not my style. I'm not the kind of guy to go out in bars and such... I don't drink. I was a gamer, generally home, though now since the breakup I've been a workout fiend... I can't see how I'll ever find someone again, like it happened w/ my ex. It was so natural, it fit instantly and we both knew it...nothing was forced, to the point that I can even say the first time we had sex, me the person that's really shy about being naked in front of someone was more than comfortable with her the first time. Now that we're no longer together I know what I want and don't want from a girl, so not only is it going to be hard for me to even find someone since I don't really go out, but I have all those ""Criteria"" in my head now that I know I need in a relationship. I'm scared of comparing other girls to her. It feels like I'll never find someone again and it scares me. Like I said, right now I wouldn't be a good person to date, I'm still healing and working on myself, I'm undergoing a big weight loss journey that will probably take me around 8-9 months. I know by then my confidence level and self esteem will probably be through the roof. My weight has never been an issue, but now that I've had a girl of this ""caliber"" and got lucky imo to have her ""pick"" me, I'm getting in shape to be able to attract girl of that ""caliber"" per say.

Background info (not saying his name): this guy is workout and work-oriented, ex military, and very independent. His last relationship ended with his girlfriend cheating on him while he was still active duty, and he hasn't dated since.

I am a bubbly, tall, fun personality girl that is SUPER shy meeting people for the first time, but I am genuinely sweet and love being sarcastic and playful. The reason I give this information is so it helps piece the story together visually.

I moved to MN recently and we added each other on Snapchat (met him on Tinder or Bumble?). Anyways, we would snap each other at least every other day and talk here and there about what the other person was doing (simple stuff, like his workouts or him hunting or what I was doing that day). It got to a point that he would snap me first and I would not respond half the time cause I didn't think he would be interested in a girl like me (I'm not the skinniest but im also not the biggest. Imagine Amazonian level of tallness and curviness). But, regardless, he still messaged me almost everyday about what he was doing and even started asking me how my days were going. So after about 2 months of talking on Snapchat, he suggested we hangout at some point, to which I got shy and kindly rejected it due to my self confidence issue and just being shy. Also, I didn't want to meet up with him if it was just for a fling because I want something serious and didn't want to get hurt...Well, about a week ago, I ended up driving to his hotel room for our ""first visit"" while he was doing work outside of the state (don't judge me, this isn't how I wanted it to go üòÖ). Long story short, I spent the night and stayed with him till the afternoon of the next day when we both left to go back home. I thought it went great! I didn't see anything bad happen at all. He even walked me to my car, gave me a big hug, told me to drive safe, and drove along side me on the highway for a bit on the way home since we both had a 4 hour drive. That's freaking cute, right?? 

The next day, he starts acting weird. Snapchat was down and acting bad, so I gave him my number so we could do regular texting throughout the day, but he never did anything with it. It was confused at first, but brushed it off. We still talked for the next 2 days, but then on the 3rd day, he sends me a paragraph about how he ""believed"" we wouldn't work out. We share the same interests (he even said I meet his interests) and we both had a liking for each other until I met up with him. I even asked him if he's willing to do a 2nd chance and we do something more welcoming like go for a hike or check out a brewery. He said he's super picky and just didn't think my personality matched up with his, even though he knows I get super shy and nervous the first time I meet someone. Is this normal for a guy to be into a girl and then just tap out the first time he meets her? Is he not ready to commit? Too nervous? The only reason I ask is because THIS is where I get confused 

He still talks to me. Everyday. Or at least sends a snap of him doing something that day. Even as I'm typing this, he's sending me snaps of him hunting with his nephew. So obviously he still wants to be friends with me, but am I missing something? It's not my appearance that's making him say no, because he's mentioned how cute I look and how he wants a curvy girl, but how does 1 night change it all?? I really like him and want to try again but idk if it's worth it.

I think it's really important. At this stage if I missed a day I would think I screwed up something important. Like I would never go a day without brushing my teeth.

I drink veggie shakes. I weigh myself regularly to track. I mix up cardio and weights. But I just look like a normal regular slim/fit guy. I don't have body builder genetics and I don't use steroids. Working out and eating healthy should hopefully keep my heart strong, my endurance good, my body fat down, and my body as healthy as it can be. But it didn't turn me into a steroided Hollywood movie star like Thor.

So it hasn't really changed anything in terms of my attractiveness to women. And now after so many years of this, I don't relate to anyone who doesn't share the same basic values.

I have tried dating women who overeat and don't exercise and it is no different than when I have tried dating women who smoke. I sit there watching them do their bad habits and it's like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck in my mind. I want to say ""Why are you killing yourself? Put the cigarette/whatever down."" It makes me uncomfortable.

But all the slim/fit women I know have always dated men who look nothing like me. They usually date guys who are built like NFL players, guys who are insanely tall, guys with Tom Brady or movie star perfect model faces, and white guys. 

Of course women can date whoever they want, but I don't know what to do. The only women I match to online tend to have nothing in common with me and I don't find them attractive at all. I tried and it doesn't work.

I looked at the stats and apparently in America it's around 90% of adults who are now ""overfat"" (fat enough to impair health which is &gt;17% body fat for men and &gt;32% body fat for women).

I have no idea how to date someone in that last 10%. So far I have only very rarely in my life gotten any interest from someone who is also in that 10%.

I can't imagine sending some ""clever"" pickup line, or something about their profile unless it has something that I know about it (if they have a cat, maybe I'll say ""that's a cute fucking cat""). 

I get messages back doing this. I'll talk for a bit, then if its going smoothly I'll ask for their snap, then ask em on a date.

My view on first messages is if they don't even want to start a convo about what they, themselves, enjoy doing, what the hell *do* they want to talk about? 

I honestly think its the best thing to say apart from asking about something I know in their profile.

I seriously do not remember this being much of a problem when I was younger. I've been in three relationships before but they were never from online dating. Anyways, the problem I'm currently experiencing (if it's even a problem) is that I've gone on dates with roughly 10 people and when they find out I still live with family, they start acting cold with me. I take it that there may be better alternatives and guys out there who do have their own place.

For context, I am an individual who comes from a lower socioeconomic class but I currently make $75K, I own a car and I've completed a Bachelor's degree in commerce. I have plans to move out and buy my own condo in the future, but as it's still COVID, I do not see a need to move out until I find a relationship and a girl worth staying with. I'm often met with expressions like ""how come you still live with family?"" or ""when will you move out"" with which I'll answer with the aforementioned - COVID and there is no ""need"" to move out yet. I work from home and so having a nicer condo would not add any material benefit for me.

3. Do the relationships last and if so why don't they? If they do why do they?
4. How do they usually meet each other?
5. On attractiveness how do they usually look?
6. What jobs or fields do the South Asian partner and their white partner usually work in?
7. How does the relationship usually play out in your community between the couple?
8. How do they raise kids if they raise them at all?
9. How Do they deal with racism within and outside the relationship?
10. How does the South Asian and white community react to such a couple?
11. Is there anything that the South Asian has to usually give up when marry a white person?
12. Is there anything that the white person usually gives up when marrying a South Asian person?
13. What do you notice about their friend circle?
14. Is cheating as common as people say it is in these relationships?
15. Are there a lot of martial problems that come with such a relationship (i.e. cultural differences, domestic abuse, toxic behaviour and etc)?
16. How do the parents usually react to the marriage or the couple itself?
17. If divorce happens what are the usual reasons for it?
18. What are some of their attitudes to sex and how is the couple's sex life?

Also, please let me know what you think about the following situation. 

Being a demisexual, its hard for me to physically connect with someone without forming an emotional connection first. Anyway, so I met this guy on a dating app. We hit it off really well and he asked me out for a second and a third date. We connected so well on our first and the second date that at the end of the second date we made out and all. By the third date, I figured since he was vulnerable enough to kiss me, it was okay for me to share something incredibly personal with him. This was me trying to establish an emotional connection and maybe trying to see if he can be a safe space for me to discuss my past trauma/issues etc (which is incredibly important for me if we were to continue dating).

I was literally in his arms when I told him that I was molested as a child and that had left me pretty scarred. His response was, ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù. Yes, he just blurted that out. Immediately afterwards he was like, too soon but I am sorry that happened. I was so embarrassed about the whole thing. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I decided to share something so incredibly personal with him and he just brushed it off like that. It seemed incredibly insensitive. Needless to say, I was quiet throughout the rest of the date and left as soon as it ended. He obviously understood that his reaction affected me, however he did not bring it up/did not apologize for being so insensitive. 

I have not heard from him ever since. At first I felt like I might have overreacted, so I sent him a meme over text to initiate communication. He just left a one word response lol. Clearly, I scared him away. 

I was wondering if I was over-sharing considering it was our third date? Or was he just emotionally unavailable and just wanted to hook up? The way he spoke about things made it seem like he genuinely wanted something more than a hookup. Anyway, that was me ranting. Why the heck on earth does dating have to be so complicated?

Ah! Hello everyone, my name is Niji, and I'm seventeen years old and in my senior year of high school. I'm curious as to how I should go about  maintaining a relationship. I've read articles where most of them mention meeting others in public places, but I wouldn't consider myself a social butterfly, and that might be harder to do with the virus in the picture. 

Not to mention the fact that I don't have that many friends in school, so I don't think what I say or do would make a difference even if I tried putting myself out there. 

It may seem like something out of a teen movie, but there are those of us who spend our free time playing video games, the gorgeous girls who gossip, apply their makeup, or browse tiktok, and the students who are just plain crazy who scream bizarre things in the hallway as we walk to our next class xD

I don't see myself becoming apart of any of these groups. 

When the kids in my class talk about their boyfriends /girlfriends and how happy they are with them, I can't help but feel like something is missing for myself. So precious. And I want that as well, but I always seem to mess up. Relationships only lasting for a few days, and when we've had enough of each other, we pretend that the other doesn't exist, passing by wherever we are without even saying ""Hello"" or ""Goodbye."" 

It's very frustrating, and it makes me feel like I'm not deserving of love because I'm not as attractive as the girls in magazines; I'm short, pudgy, and not very bright, and to top it off, the boys who message me on social media start their messages with ""You're cute, but you'd look even better if...""

So yesterday, he randomly blocked me on Facebook and stopped texting me back in the middle of the day.

MOVE ON!! I get it, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to why women do this. So‚Ä¶

Known her since high school but we almost never talked. I never desired her but something happened this week when I ran into her and she totally ignored me, I didn‚Äôt care cause she‚Äôs basically a Snapchat friend and nothing else, later she hit me up saying she was stoned out of her mind and she was sorry for being rude, I said it was all good and she should slide me some (just to make convo). And she texted back saying that we should smoke together someday. I said I was down, and so that same day we had a mutual friend send out an invite to each of us (how convenient) to a house party and I said I‚Äôd see her there. So we‚Äôre both there but we‚Äôre hanging with different circles and I leave without making a move since I‚Äôm not really intrested and also was pretty buzzed, But she hmu later saying that I left her hanging and I told her she should‚Äôve left her friends and come to talk to me. She responded and said we should really get together sometime and smoke, but also says how she prefers to drink and how she‚Äôs game for both and that I don‚Äôt know her when she‚Äôs drunk ( she includes all types of flirty emojis) 
And so now I‚Äôm intrigued and I‚Äôm thinking all I gotta do is give her a date and it‚Äôs a sure thing since she‚Äôs being very straight forward on seeing me. So I text her saying saying i sure don‚Äôt know who she is when she‚Äôs drunk and that we should link next Friday and find out. Well it‚Äôs been 2 days and she hasn‚Äôt responded. Any reason why?

So i have many female friends that are in a relationship or still looking.

But the thing is i noticed that (i live in asia btw so here being light/white skin is always associated with beauty and higher social status) these girls believe being pretty and beautiful is to have whiter skin and they would sometime put on make up that make thier skin look lighter than normal, taking supplement like collagen and avoiding/blocking the sun so they don't get sunburn.

However, when it comes to thier partner these girls like thier partner to be dark skinned and are not into lighter skinned/white skin guy as much or at all. And they confirmed it to me when i asked them about it and they said "" yes we prefer darker skin person more"" and others said "" we only want dark skinned person"". Funny thing is when we were looking at pictures on the internet we saw a picture of an African couple and they said the African dude look attractive but the female not so much despite the model in the picture being fit girl and lighter skinned than her male counterparts. (Forgive them please i try to promote skin colour acceptance and positivity to them)

This shocked me because white worshipping is very prevalent in asia and yet i found girls like these and recently i have seen increase in it even among many girls i know in the past who are racist/colourist against dark skinned person have changed thier taste and mindset.

Maybe I was naive, maybe the psychological stereotype of daddy issues are just random jargon, but she asked me out and made quite a few moves in the relationship.

She's never been in a relationship before, nor even kissed a guy. Yet before we even started dating, she told me about fantasies of kissing me.

Anyway, over time, as I got to know her, I couldn't help but tick the boxes of common traits girls with daddy issues have. She was overly attached and put me on a pedestal initially (still does but not at the same level). She has never had any sexual experience but probably makes more moves than me. She enjoys getting attention from men, and likes if they flirt with them (though she never flirts back).

The biggest sign would be ""She started telling me about her dad and I've met her parents and I can see she doesn't like her dad"".

Anyway, while I'm not heads over hells in love, but I would still want to put in the effort to make it work if there's hope, specially since for now, things between us are good.

However, I've noticed that once I started showing affection or stop being indifferent to her, she has reduced the efforts on her end. While I don't want to be put on a pedestal, but being made feel appreciative by your SO is nice sepcially since they made you used to it by doing it at the start.

Her mother told her once ""Your boyfriend is too nice. He must be hiding something""

I wondered if being nice (not a pushover), just a romantic is actually a turn off for girls with daddy issues. Whether I should be worried about infidelity owing to constant need of seeking attention from men.

She's talked a lot about our future, I'm the first guy she's had most of her firsts with (kiss, sex, nightout, long trips, meeting parents etc)

She asked me if her alter could date this person. A couple things made me uncomfortable about this. 

When we started the relationship, she didn't have DID, she just roleplayed online a lot. She did develop a crush on and broke up with me once for someone else, before we decided to continue the relationship. Then later on she developed fictive alters based on ficitonal characters she liked and did a lot of reading about DID. She actively looked around for people who had fictive alters she liked and found one person with DID who had a fictive alter for Loki, who she is a fangirl of. She then told me that some DID people date multiple people. Her alter then developed a crush on Loki and she asked me if they could date.

 I did hear her out and explain to her that I would be comfortable stepping back and taking a break to let her explore this relationship her alter is interested in. But I would not be comfortable with her alter dating someone else at the same time she is dating me. She didn't understand my perspective and tried to persuade me/guilt trip me that it shouldn't affect us. The thing that bothered me was that she herself (not her alter) was very emotionally invested in her alter having a relationship this loki. She said she was hurt that the two relationships couldn't happen at the same time, but also said she didn't want to break up.

So it was pretty clear it was affecting us.  I felt like she liked the loki too to an extent. I feel weird about the whole thing, like I'm not enough but she doesn't know what she wants.

However, we've been moving very fast, meeting every 2 days or so (mostly because she'd ask me to meet). We definitely have a strong connection and like each other a lot. We've been physical with each other pretty much every time we've met up (might not have been the best thing to do?) and recently I went over to her house to watch a movie and met her parents in the process (meeting her parents and having dinner with her family wasn't part of the original movie plan, more like a last minute thing).

Anyways, she definitely likes me a lot and wants me, but she told me that she's unsure if she wants a relationship and be tied down, but at the same time she wants a relationship and give her love to one person. She says it could be her anxiety affecting her (her doc recently increased her medication a little). She also said that she's afraid of guys leaving her because of her anxiety, or scaring me away, or that she'll be single forever. I told her not to compare past relationships or thoughts to what is real and in front of her. I am me and I want to show her who I am. (I realise that telling someone not think of a pink elephant will not help them not picture a pink elephant: could I approach her insecure thoughts differently to reassure her better?). I told her to take some time to think about things and get back to me.

I‚Äôm gonna preface this simply. I‚Äôve never been in anything close to a relationship and I‚Äôve never had any kind of sexual encounter before. 
This is not due to a lack of not wanting these things, I honestly don‚Äôt know what my problem is. Bad luck maybe? 

For everyone out there, I genuinely feel like I have no game whatsoever. When I was younger my Dad was often busy at work so I spent most of my time in the house with my Mum and older sister. 
I can‚Äôt help but feel like this has caused me to be almost like too respectful of women, which sounds absurd, but its the only way I can describe how I feel. 

I feel like I grew up believing that sex was something very special for everyone involved and that there is no rush to for it to happen. I was taught that love and relationships, are difficult but worth it with the right person. Put both of these together, and I‚Äôm basically a hopeless romantic.  

As I said before this is not for a lack of not wanting these things, I‚Äôm not just waiting and doing nothing. Everyday around Uni, I‚Äôm always trying to talk to people, using a cold approach isn‚Äôt easy, but I always try to let the conversation happen naturally. I do the same thing in bars and clubs too. 

I know that OLD is an option I could take but I really don‚Äôt want to use apps. Tbh a lot of my friends, men and women, have congratulated me on not resorting to apps as they can be really toxic and often do more harm than good. 

I‚Äôve worked pretty hard on improving myself as a person and have some things going for me, aside from studying Economics. I‚Äôm a rapper, I‚Äôm learning Guitar, I go gym, I don‚Äôt drink or do any drugs, I love movies and I like gaming. 

It‚Äôs taken me a while to reach a point where I have enough confidence to even attempt talking to someone I find attractive. I‚Äôve been through tough times myself as I was diagnosed with a chronic condition at age 16, I lost a lot of confidence then. 
But still I think that being resilient and bouncing back from something like that is an admirable quality about myself. 

The problem is, I have a really difficult time reading the signs, I can never differentiate between whether a woman is just being friendly or flirty, and I usually I just assume the former for two reasons. It‚Äôs less risky to assume friendly behaviour and attempt to become friends first before anything else happens and second because I have no idea how to respond to a someone flittering with me, like how do I flirt back without just seeming creepy if this is a woman I‚Äôve only just met!? 

I‚Äôve spoken to a lot of my friends and family (older cousins) and they say I‚Äôm doing the right thing, and that when it happens it happens. 
But as everyday goes by and I‚Äôm still a virgin and still without partner, it does damage my confidence a little and causes some really bad thoughts. Eg. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just unattractive‚Äù 

I really feel like I‚Äôm just waiting for someone fo ‚ÄúTake a chance on me‚Äù, like the song from ABBA. But so far, I haven‚Äôt met anyone willing to get to know me as more than a friend!

&amp;#x200B;

I matched with this other lady (28F) at about the same time but due to COVID limitations within my city it was impossible for us to meet, but our conversation was something great. We were finally able to meet last month and we have immediately formed a connection, it's something intangible. I never trust pre-date texting will be carried over into actual seeing each other hence I was expecting her to not live up to the hype and it to just resolve itself then and there 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that it's a month down the track I think I've had enough time to feel like the latter is who I have feelings for, she's the one I think about late at night or when love based songs come on.

Previous times I've had to have these conversations there's always been a reason related to the person, something ""wrong"" in the dating scenario.

I've tried to convince myself that it's reasonable for me to keep dating both of them as things open up because it's a more real experience of dating but deep down I know I'd be doing that hoping for the situation to resolve itself rather than from a position of sincerity

I (F/20) hooked up with a guy a couple of weeks ago who goes to the same faculty as me in uni. I've found him interesting since the first time I saw him and at a party one thing led to another and we hooked up. After that I felt a bit off because I would really want to get to know him, so one week after we hooked up I added him on snap and just asked him out (with no expectations) and he said yes, very happily also. Last week and this upcoming week we are both busy with a lot of other stuff so we just decided that we have to do it when we can later on. Good to know is that I was very very anxious about asking him out, because rejection is something I very much fear and I'm just an anxious person when it comes to dating, so I was really really happy when he said yes and i felt proud over myself that I did ask him out. Fast forward one week, we have barely spoken on snap (I'm not really an active snapchat-user in the sense of keeping contact everyday with someone) and he yesterday randomly asked if i'm going out partying, and I said yes and he started asking where we're going (because I was with some mutual friends we have). Finally when he and his friends come and join the bar where a lot of people from our faculty is, he barely speaks to me. I have to give him attention to even look at me and it all felt very weird. We had a nice five minute chat, but that was it throughout the whole evening (that I initiated). I guess he's playing hard-to-get but it just felt so ridiculous? Like why did he not talk to me or seem like he wanted to talk to me, when he two hours earlier eagerly asked when and where I was gonna be. I don't require anything from anyone but it just surprised me how little he seemed to care that I was there. Then he just disappeared to another bar with some other people and I felt a little awkward the whole evening after that.

We‚Äôre kissing, (with him occasionally choking me, which was a red flag as stuff like this is usually discussed prior) but I repeatedly tell him that tonight is really not the night for anything more and that I don‚Äôt want to ruin anything more serious that could potentially develop between us. 

My drunk horny brain is torn between sabotaging a potential relationship and wanting physical affection. We ended up spooning (no sex) in my bed.

Right now, I can‚Äôt remember everything I said to him or everything he said to me and whether he understood my reasons for not wanting sex.

He has a porn addiction but no sex drive. I guess I don't want to delve to far into the topic, but our sex life is a fiasco.
He tunes me out when I talk, doesn't remember most of what I say to him. Yet he insists on explaining things I already know and telling me the same old stories. And PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD don't ask him about politics.
