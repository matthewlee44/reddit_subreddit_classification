I’d be very happy to date a single dad as long as he didn’t want any more children. If you’re a father of children:

1,o1gflt,1623879946,How do i know if he's genuinely interested in me?,"I (30sF) made a friend (30sM) online last year but due to pandemic, I couldn't meet him. We have been texting quite frequently - sometimes we text multiple times a day, sometimes once in couple of days. The frequency varies. Have spoken to him once. We text on various issues, some highlights of our life, some problems in family and work. 

I came to know recently through a mutual friend that he had been dating a girl for 1-2 months (and then they broke up) but he had never mentioned it even though we usually exchange other details of our lives. He had only said that he's been on few dates through OLD but they all end after the first date or in the texting stage. 

His responses vary too - sometimes he needs emotional support, sometimes he extends emotional support to me but sometimes he has just not responded when I needed the support. His initial messages used to feel genuine, as if interested to know more about me. Now, it seems like we are in a direction less flow - no more questions about me or wanting to hear about my troubles but wanting to talk about himself and his life.

Recently it feels as if he is texting only to fill his female attention quota for the day! I don't know if the guy is just showing mixed emotions or is texting me out of boredom (pandemic can create boredom, loneliness due to lack of human contact). How do I know he's genuinely interested or not? If he isn't interested, then how do I politely stop texting him? I would like to retain him as a friend, but not so close anymore as I don't want to get too much emotionally involved.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o1gflt/how_do_i_know_if_hes_genuinely_interested_in_me/
2,o1gjtp,1623880262,30M Profile Review,"I'm completely new to online dating after my four year relationship came to a sudden end. While I have been getting a few matches every day, the overall experience has been extremely frustrating (as expected). I only have tried Bumble so far as I'd like to gain a little more experience before making profiles on the other apps.

I would appreciate some honest feedback: 

* Are these pictures appropriate, or could I be doing significantly better with better photographs? Photofeeler seems to place me at around 7.9.
* The bio and prompts feel very tricky. I want it to be authentic and honest, but they should also stand out a little. The difference between a witty and a cringy text feels like a very thin line. Anything I can improve?

3,o1gpz1,1623880717,Would you give someone another chance after all this?,"I (29f) met a guy (32m) on an app 6 months ago. We videochatted for 3 weeks before meeting. 

The first time we met, he drove to my place (he lives 5h away). We spent the weekend together. He was polite, charming, smart and handsome. I then spent the next weekend with him. Also perfect. Sex was 10/10.

A month in I get this panicky feeling that I should break it off. I'm in the final year of my PhD and I sensed he would not be flexible for me when things got stressful. I broke it off. He convinced me not to.

Around 6 weeks in is when the issues started.

1. Our conversations were eclipsed by sex and mundane chit chat. I wanted more depth/closeness. He said I was trying to manipulate him and he wasn't looking for commitment.

2. He snapped at me three times in 2 days for 1. Interrupting him 2. Putting on the kettle while he was in a online meeting 3. For playfully pulling his hand when he was on his phone. I admitted it was annoying, but his tone was very sharp.

3. About three months in, it was discovered he didn't know how to pronounce my actual name. He would just call me by a nickname I go by even though we chat on fb where I use my full name.

4. I send affectionate texts maybe 1-2x day. He would like my messages but wouldn't reciprocate. I told him that that his lack of affection made me feel like we weren't a good fit unless adjustments were made. He took this as an ultimatum (it was, but this was after telling him 3 times) and he basically told me to take a hike for 'holding a gun' to his head. I accepted it. Five days later he apologises. I accept his apology. 

Here's why I'm confused. He has held my hand/kissed me in public since day 1. We had movie nights, nice restaurant dinners, and went shopping. In bed he is very attentive and just wants me to have the best time.  Things are going well and I ask (4 months later) if he would consider a relationship. He said yes-ish but he doesn't like the prospect of me moving away after I finish my doctorate.

Then came the final straw. I was studying for an exam. I was planning to visit him the coming weekend which was a day after my exam but my friends asked if I want to hang out on the weekend and I thought I'd just ask him to come to me so I could both spend time with him and my friends together. He said I was manipulating him again by pretending I never had any plans of coming to his place at all. I sent him a text saying you don't have to meet my friends if you're not ready. He then accused me of guilt tripping him. Now I'm fed up. I sleep on it and am still furious in the morning and send him a long text saying it's over. He didn't reply. 

A month later i texted to say my paper was published (I group texted several people at once). Oddly, he said he wanted to try again. I was skeptical. He's been trying harder than ever the last month. His behaviour towards me has changed 180 degrees and I don't know what caused it. No snapping, no judging, instant wordy replies, he hinted at how I would get along with his family. He hinted that he would consider moving with me if we became serious (I have a potential open ended offer for a postdoc in the US). He calls me darling and sweetie all the time. He comforts me when I'm stressed. He also said he didn't sleep with anyone while we were broken up. 

I'm just confused. After all that has happened, I feel less trusting. I want to continue our sexual relationship but I don't know if I want more. 

If you were me, would you give him another chance?

I’ve been in a couple of LTRs prior to this- in both relationships I told them I loved them first and they immediately said it back.  

With my current gf, I’ve told her a bunch of times I really like her, I miss her, and on a recent vacation that I’m falling for her.  She’s really affectionate, proactive about setting up dates/time for us to meet (we’re both really busy), and has said/shown in a lot of ways that she likes me and likes spending time with me.  But when I told her that I was falling for her she didn’t reciprocate and now I’m in my head about it.  Like I’m feeling rejected and not good enough, and a little worried that it might end anytime, even though our communication is amazing and I know she’s interested in me and seeing where our relationship goes.

8,o1i44x,1623884498,Can this be salvaged?,"I've come to realize that I(30f)  might not only have no experience dating, but also no experience talking/interacting with other humans! And I don't know what to do about it.


My approach to dating has been  pretty much doing whatever felt ""right"", and no playing games (I'm really bad at games, plus I'm not sure what the rules are): making the first move,  initiating talks/carrying conversations, asking for video chats, asking lots of questions (maybe some of them not appropriate)

I recently matched with this guy, and we got talking for a while. The chats were a bit dry, mostly ""how was you day?"", ""what are you up to?""...you can imagine how quickly boring that got! 
So, I proposed a 20 questions game to get to know eachother, and it was fantastic and left us wanting more! 
But my stupid curiosity ruined  things (I think). During the game, I came to know that he had been in love before! A couple days later I thought it would be a good idea to ask what made him fall out of love (I'm very curious about the inner workings of love),  since he had mentioned being an open book (do people actually mean it? Or is it like: I'm an open book, you can ask what my favorite color is?) I really thought it was okay to ask.

Anyways, he answered the questions, but he seems to have withdrawn, the few attempts I made at starting communication were met with dry but polite answers. I've ask him if he would be interested in video chat but he hasn't confirmed.
It turned out that he was cheated on(4 yrs ago). I now feel terrible for proding and I plan to apologize in the end. Could my questions have brought on some bad memories? And if it did, could this be a sign that maybe I should just leave him be? 

I would really like to know how to move forward and see where this goes. He's one of the kind and cute people I've had the opportunity to talk to, plus he has a really cute name....but please don't hold back, I love to hear your unbiased opinion!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o1i44x/can_this_be_salvaged/
9,o1i4yq,1623884566,Am I being a prude?,"I (30F) have recently started back up on Tinder and Bumble. It's been a week and I keep running into the same scenarios of guys looking for a FWB or hookup. The few that bring up wanting a relationship are so consumed in prioritizing getting physically intimate because they're attracted to me. 

I've reached a point where I'm interested in genuinely getting to know someone first before even entertaining the idea of bedroom activities, and the guys are made aware of this as soon as they ask what I'm looking for. Despite this, the same guys continue to be persistent about wanting to get involved physically with me and they try to sway the conversation back to something sexual. 

I'm a very nonchalant person and get we all have those needs, but am I being a prude for persistently turning down all these men when they can't accept I don't want to get physically intimate off the gate? Are my boundaries too high? Should I allow myself to get intimate with them despite not truly knowing them? I'm looking to build a friendship with someone and have it turn to more, if it's mutual. I'm questioning whether or not I'm passing up an opportunity at something real when I turn down these offers.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o1i4yq/am_i_being_a_prude/
10,o1i8ob,1623884850,Is “too good to be true” a red flag?,"I (33f) matched with this guy (31) last week. The chatting conversation was a bit boring and I didn’t really feel it but he was consistent in asking kind questions so we set up a phone call which lasted almost 3 hours. 

After that we met (each time spontaneously and initiated by me) three days in a row. We’d just talk and talk talk until 4am (and I’m sure he could have talked some more). Because of the spontaneous circumstances of our dates he also let my mom and two good friends, who left after a while. 

After the first date he ordered me a pair of earrings I had shown him, I wanted (they’re not expensive like 30$ - but still). And after the second date we kissed a little. Full butterflies. 

So far - so bueno. 

From his stories, this guy is … I can’t even find the words - he’s outworldly. Said he’s set up several companies, sold them, set up charities, set up a company for his ex fiancée who now makes 6digits, has played every sport on the face of this Earth, is really sweet to my dog, very observing, reflected... Not sure if that’s important but i’m not a car person at all - but even I realized that I was sitting in a damn fancy car when he picked me up. 

Before our 3rd date I decided to check him out online. Low and behold - nothing. There’s nothing! I asked him about it and he’d say he had everything deleted because of his old job (setting up companies while working wasn’t allowed), and sent me his LinkedIn ans IG. Former has no pic and the absolute minimum on it - the latter is just 1 year old and has less than 100 followers. The pictures correspond with the adventures he told me about. So I ask him abt that too and he said that his ex didn’t want pictures of them online together and since he always makes collections he figured he’d set up a new account altogether.  

The thing abt this guy is that each of his stories could be real - but the fact that it’s supposed to be one person makes it all really incredulous  - I didn’t know people like this existed (and I’m usually surrounded and dating overachievers). 

So this is all the technical stuff. Here comes the emotional part: we’ve been on three dates and talk through the day but now he just told me that he feels he’s known me forever and that he feels super comfortable with me and it’s honestly like a dream come true. But my reaction (which he didn’t see because it’s on voice message he said that) - was a bit of  panic. 

Am i being avoidant? Am i sabotaging something that could last ? Is is this a red flag ?

So far he never seemed defensive nor annoyed at my hundred questions. I’m just so confused and overwhelmed. Send help.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o1i8ob/is_too_good_to_be_true_a_red_flag/

12,o1k2nn,1623890395,Should I reach out to him again or is he 'slow fading' me?,"I (28F) met a guy (32M) on a dating app, we went on two dates. Both dates went well. Second date, we really connected. It was light and fun. He then left on a 2 month vacation after our second date, which I knew about beforehand. He asked that we keep in touch and said he hoped I don't forget him. He even asked in passing if I'd come visit him. Obviously not, I just met the guy. It was clearly wishful thinking on his part.

We have kept in touch, although I do find I have initiated conversations more often than he has. He's always been very engaged in the conversations and has set up a third date for when he comes back. He called me once and we spoke on the phone, he video called but I was already in bed and so my video wasn't on. I told him next time I'll have my video on. He said he looked forward to it.

I texted him last week and he answered but wasn't pushing the conversation forward. Understandable, he might have been in the middle of something. We both said goodnight and I haven't heard from him since. It's been 1-week now. I'm not stalking him but just for context, Whatsapp shows that he's online throughout the day.

I'd like to talk to him but I'm afraid he has lost interest or met someone new and that's why he's not texting? Is he 'slow fading/ghosting' me? Should I initiate another conversation even though I initiated one last week? He's not coming back for another month... I'm out of town again and was thinking of sending him a picture of my view with a ""Hello from (the city I'm in)"". When he got to his destination, it had been a few days since our last conversation and he had sent me a picture from his location with a ""Hello from (the city he was in)."" So there's precedent for this.

He's said several times he wants to see me when he comes back and has also set a third date. He's said before he wishes we saw each other more before he left. I normally respond and let him know I feel the same.

I know he's on vacation but he's the one who asked that we keep in touch. The sudden change in frequency, is puzzling.

32,o1qiqh,1623911640,Suspicious Catfish,"I’ve had my Hinge profile active for several years now, but in the last 9  months or so I’ve sent zero likes and rejected all likes I’ve received. Ergo zero matches.

Today I decided to send a like to an intriguing profile. We match and message for a few hours before moving to text. Within an hour, I received a “Rose” (Hinge equivalent of Superlike) from a suspiciously attractive woman — of course subsequent reverse image searching reveals the photos to be stock images from across the Internet.

I am suspicious that the first woman may have set up this fake profile and intentionally sought me out with it. My reasoning is as follows:

(1) The timing is extremely suspicious, especially given my low activity on Hinge leading up to today. I’ve never received a like (much less a Rose) from such a profile in all my time on Hinge, until today;

(2) Roses are given to non-paying users only once/week. This makes me believe that this fake profile sought me out in particular, as it doesn’t make sense to me that an indiscriminate scammer would pay for Roses as a part of their scam;

(3) Hinge allows one to filter by age, race, and location for free. As such it is easy and free to find a desired person’s Hinge profile with intentional filtering, once this information is known. My match would certainly this info from my profile;

(4) I deleted all my social media accounts about 6 months ago (though my profile on my employer’s website remains easily Google-able). I think this behavior might be rationalized as an attempt by her or her friends to “vet” me, since I have a scarce online presence.

Am I going crazy or is it very likely that my above theory is correct?

38,o1sdz7,1623919269,Do you give a chance to someone with whom something may be missing (but their other qualities are great)... or is this a recipe for disaster?,"Been dating this man (33). He is a lot of what I am looking for after years of flakiness and just outright BS and disrespect online. I actually forgot about our first date and put it in the wrong day (totally out of character, probably a sign I am over OLD) and he was so kind he waited for me to get ready - I think he waited over an hour besides me telling him to please go home! 

What I like about him is besides from being very attractive hehe... he is kind, patient, responsible, ambitious, stable, has a good sense of humour and we seem to have similar life goals e.g. both want to get married and spend a few years travelling and having fun until we have kids. 

I also feel like our life experiences have been similar in the sense that we both had a difficult time in our 20s with grief, loss and career. Not that bonding over shared trauma is a good thing, but there is a mutual understanding and wisdom to our interactions.

Despite that, we have our differences. I find the intellectual/mental connection is missing for me a bit, despite trying to foster it. The other day he said he learns a lot from me, which made me realise I dont really learn much from him. I guess if you want to stereotype, we are the quintessential intellectual nerd / hands on practical match. 

In my prior relationships, this intellectual and mental piece was present, but of course some other glaring dealbreaker was present (abuse, low EQ, financial irresponsibility etc).

41,o1tn2u,1623924335,How do I meet “indoorsy” women in my 30s?,"Hi all, I’m approaching my mid 30s and want to get things going a bit. To put it in perspective, I spent a lot of time indoors before the pandemic. I do enjoy going to an occasional restaurant, movie, or other various activity. However, what I’m getting at is I’m not into hiking, camping, or other similar things. Basically by “indoorsy” I mean comfortable spending a fair amount of time inside and can be happy doing so.

I don’t go to bars and one time I went to a club and left right away because I was miserable. Crowds are not usually in my wheelhouse. I would say I’m charming, witty, and a genuinely funny guy but the problem is I’m *not* meeting woman, like at all. I’m attributing that to the whole indoorsy thing and now that I’m vaccinated I’m a bit more open to stepping outside, within reason.

The obvious answer to me was Online Dating which I did extensively for 15 years, so much in fact I learned all the ends and outs. I had multiple long-term relationships from it and at some points semi-frequent dates. It was okay for my 20s, but these days it’s dryer than the Arizona desert, and not for a lack of effort, *trust me*. I haven’t been on a date in literally years.

I’m wanting to make connections and I’d like to be in a long-term relationship, but it’s been quite an elusive concept as of late. If online is a no-go where should I be meeting these “indoorsy” women, since they won’t be out and about much? I’m a bit flabbergasted at this point, thus making this thread.

43,o1xoid,1623937713,They live further out inside a big city and don't have a car -- too complicated/too much work?,"I've been talking to someone off Bumble who is really interested in meeting. We've had a few virtual dates that went well, but the downside is that she lives inside the city (a bigger city) about 50 minutes away and she doesn't have a car to get around because she relies on public transit. We're both in our 30s, and the reason I'm considering this situation is because while I live in a densely populated area, I tend to find women who live in the city are more my type.

I'm wondering if the distance and amount of effort that keeping up a relationship would require would be more disruptive to its success, though. Meeting up for a date or two at first might seem exciting, but I'm not sure how it's going to work if I have to drive out to her every week on a regular basis, or pick her up to come visit me. She doesn't plan on moving away from the city and currently, I have no plans to move closer in either, but we've both been open to exploring the potential.

Has anyone had a similar experience where they live outside a bigger city and dated someone who lived inside of it and didn't have their own regular transportation to get around?

I have definitely identified myself as an anxious attachment style .. he is well, mostly secure but w some avoidant traits. 

I do sometimes wonder if I might do better w a fellow anxious attachment person, if we both need each other to the same degree and are both aware of our needs and working towards the goal of secure attachment,would this work better than trying to make it work with an avoidant partner? I mostly identify things in myself I could fix- but this could anyway be the anxious me speaking. 

My anxious attachment traits- I am more needy than he is, I do find myself engaging in 'protest' behaviours when I find that he is not meeting my need for connection. Working on myself but it will take time.

His secure traits- introduced me to friends and family v early on, not afraid to be close and intimate me. His avoidant traits - seems to pull back once we are about to move to the next stage in our relationship, not expressing his feelings but suppressing them and then pulling back unexpectedly. 

And yet we enjoy spending time w each other. Still do all manner of things together from cooking to laundry to groceries and daily jogs to keep fit. I don't know what is keeping him from taking the next step except perhaps the fear that we are not completely compatible and he would feel the need to pull away again. I don't know if this was what happened w his ex wife. But it sounded like she was the one who pulled away first. Am not sure what I will get out of posting this.

I’m OLDing and I’m looking for a relationship. So I only start/keep talking to people who express they also are looking for a relationship.

If you have no space in your life for a partner, what is your motivation for being in a dating app?

Then today he told me a lie. I'm not sure if it was purposeful or if he really believes it. On Sunday he asked me if I wanted to get together Thursday at my place again. I said sure, so long as I wouldn't be cooking (I made a huge feast that night). He said we could order in. We also made plans for the weekend.

Then last night he asks me about ordering in on the weekend- a day I had suggested an outing. I asked ""sorry, I thought we were daytripping then and tomorrow ordering in?"" He tells me no, he had told me that night that Thursday wouldn't work for him. I replied I didn't remember, but if that's the case sorry for my misunderstanding.

I know I didn't bring up Thursday because I had mentioned the weekend thing. I already went down the gaslighting path so I'm kind of concerned here. Also that he only wants to see me a week after we last hung out seems a bit strange too.

50,o208kn,1623944460,UPDATE: Advice on dating a convicted felon.,"Thought I’d provide a brief update since there was a small resurgence of recent comments. 

[original post here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/lvhr15/advice_for_dating_a_convicted_felon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

We ended up parting ways, for reasoning completely unrelated to his felony and otherwise considered normal reasons for ending a relationship. We don’t share the same passion for self-development and emotional intimacy. I do think this is in part due to five years in the federal prison system and poor re-acclamation services for formerly incarcerated persons. 

While some of the comments on the original post were helpful, many were highly judgmental and reinforced the stigma around formerly incarcerated persons. Some people even suggested that formerly incarcerated persons were unworthy of love and human decency. I hope those commenters never have to live a life where their entire worth and acceptance is based solely off of their worst mistakes. 

This relationship may not have worked out but I have a much better understanding of how the system works and inherently disadvantages an entire demographic of humans and profits off demonizing them. Thank you to those of you who pointed out legitimate concerns around mental health, finances, and slipping back into old habits. I absolutely see how those factors are more prevalent in formerly incarcerated people, and appreciated the heads up. Some of those comments helped me tune in more quickly to the emotional depth issue. 

TLDR: dating a felon didn’t work for me for reasons totally unrelated to his being a felon, and the world is highly judgmental and cruel to people they deem lesser than themselves.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o208kn/update_advice_on_dating_a_convicted_felon/

However reading here and speaking on OLD, it seems the spectrum an inverted bell curve; ie: most people are at one extreme or another. 

I am having a hard time meeting people who like going to wine tastings, drives listening to music, movies, cooking, and all that bf/gf stuff but also are fine going to their own home after. No I don’t want to see anyone 3-4 times a week. Once, maybe twice. 

Texting throughout is fine, communication is fine, talking is fine, and when I’m their company, my full attention is with them and we have a fantastic time together. 

But inevitably it seems more is wanted, or less. (Relationship vs FWB transactional)

60,o2478v,1623954757,What To Do When Your 20s Felt Like Your 30s and Your 30s Feel Like Your 20?,"I've always been something of a homebody. In my 20s I didn't like going out because I was too tired between graduate school, work, and taking care of a disabled parent. Add in depression that lasted nearly 20 years from my upbringing for good measure. That created a situation where in my 20s I was desperate to find somebody for a long term relationship and I just didn't have the strength to go out and socialize. I ended up not meeting anybody and I found myself in my 30s much faster than I thought I would.

Now I'm 34 and I'm in a completely different place. I don't want to settle down, I'm free from all the parent care and have my graduate degree, and my work is all right with decent pay. I'm also in a much healthier mental place and I have so much confidence I didn't have ten years ago. So my question is this, how do I balance living the life I've always wanted in an environment where most potential partners are in a completely different life stage?

I've done all the hard stuff with losing family and I struggled to get myself out a hole where I actively considered ending my life and now I just want to live a somewhat carefree life for a few years. My only issue is finding people to date who are in a similar place. The women I've gone on dates with who are around my age are all in the want to settle down stage or already have 2 or 3 kids, don't want more, and want to settle down. I, on the other hand, want to go to clubs, take spontaneous trips out of state, and plan to do a few international trips once it's a little more safe to do so.

I feel like finding partners who want to do all that will be hard and OLD hasn't yielded many results. I've had a few dates that were wonderful, but things didn't work out because they either wanted to settle or the distance was too much for them to consider a relationship.

Normally, when I’m ghosted (I see true ghosting as anything after 2-3 dates), I forget about it and just accept it. The person didn’t have the decency to send a simple text, so I move on. 

But after being ghosted most recently, I’m a bit torn. He doesn’t want to see or talk to me again, cool, but he’d rather avoid telling me that and instead just vanish?? Not cool. Very immature. I’m compelled to reach out to him and kinda call him out on his behavior (not expecting a response, not asking for an explanation, not trying to “win him back” or anything) because I feel like not saying anything is...letting him off the hook, I guess? I feel like as a grown ass man, he should know that ghosting after multiple dates doesn’t show much integrity.
