Edit

Our mutual friend Wesley died years ago 
I found him 14 years ago I saved him the first time and then Wes died , the next week in my absence, I have ptsd for it , and o struggle . 
He was there saw me nearly end my life when. We lost Wesley. 

He (new boyfriend) starts doing heroin and overdosed , I find him just like our friend who died. 

He then tells me to get over it , belittles me and I can’t help some
Of my anxiety stems from this traumatic event. 
He then tells me it’s not his fault I’m in a pity party over Wesley dying.

This might be a little bit of a long post. 

I’ve met this girl on Facebook dating and very quickly we found a connection. We liked pretty much the same stuff and started to learn about each other.  I’m 24 and she’s 23. 
About a few weeks later after exchanging messages on messenger I was in the area where she lived and she decided to meet up, so we did. It was fantastic, I gave her a lift back home then decided to make an arrangement to meet up again. I ended up staying the night at hers, again it was absolutely fantastic, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she agreed! 

So now I’m in a relationship with her. Since early to mid October this year. (might I add that this is my first proper relationship), we continue to exchange messages on Facebook messenger. 

Now the issue starts. I know she’s going through a hard time with 4 of her past exes being cheaters and lie to her and one is sending her very harassing texts! She also has other really hard issues to deal with, which I know is rather hard and stressful. She has anxiety and depression also. 

I’ve noticed her texting habits changed. With my Asperger’s I do tend to overthink things, hence why I’m here asking for advice and thoughts etc! 

She used to message me good mornings, and sometimes I was the one messaging her good morning. But now I’m the only one doing it. I didn’t message her good morning once and she wasn’t particularly happy and said :”You didn’t message me”. 

We did have two arguments where her trust issues were playing up. And I had to convince her that I’m not like her exes. Although I did speak to her about that face to face. 

So here are the texting habits that’s changed! In my mind seemingly after the two arguments (although I could possibly be misremembering) 

1. She doesn’t message me good morning anymore.
2. She leaves me on seen more often now, (which she never did before). And sometimes she’s on Instagram or Facebook posting a few meme quote type posts. 

3. When I tell her I’m feeling depressed she doesn’t seem to offer a supportive text or a simple, I’m always here for you (Which I do to her). 

Other unusual things I’ve noticed which is extremely odd as I know her texting habits etc.  Once she left me on seen for 5 hours (rather unusual) yet she was posting on Instagram of her new tablet, her singing, a selfie, a meme or two. She didn’t seem busy. I then asked her how her new tablet was, no reply, just left on seen. Then I messaged her a few hours later again no reply, just seen. Then in the middle of the night a random “I’m going to get some sleep” 
Which she normally says “I’m going to get some sleep now babe I love you xxxx” 
Yet during that same day I decided to post a new photo on Facebook, she liked it, and then a few days later she changed her reaction to love (which you can do on Facebook) which I though was rather odd. She even like a post I put on Instagram but didn’t bother to message me a quick “I’m busy I’ll have to message you later”

Another is very recent. It started with her messaging me later than usual, sometimes I send voice messages and she said “Don’t send voice messages as my phone is playing up” I thought nothing of it. Yet her grammar was slightly off which again is probably nothing. (Her grammar is ok now) she again left me on seen later that day. Comes the day after she woke up rather late again (as she’s normally an early bird) replied to a few of my messages then wasn’t active on either messenger or Instagram as much as she normally is throughout the day. For some reason I felt like she was depressed so I sent her a loving warm heartfelt message only to be seen and replied with a heart emoji. Then 4 hours past I sent her a cute love poem and a funny love meme. She again seen it and only reacted to it with a heart. She didn’t even say goodnight to me that night. Only to find out she posted a post on Instagram where she was with a friend (who is male) and her mum. 

Yet in person she’s talkative and we do have some rather romantic moments. 

So what is everyone’s thoughts on this? How shall I combat this situation?

So I have been dating this amazing man for a few months now. We clicked exceptionally well from the first moment on, I feel safe, appreciated and seen with him. He let's me know how much he appreciates me, reciprocates my energy, texts back fast, initiates dates, etc... He also is very intelligent, and we can share our love for knowledge, often spending hours discussing current issues. From that I know we have a lot of shared values. 
What is especially exceptional is how he really LISTENS to me, is interested in my experiences and opinion. I can talk about anything that moves me, and he will listen with empathy.  Especially in groups he always hears me, even though my voice was overshadowed by others. Even if no one heard me, or I get interrupted, he notices. 
He respects me a lot during sex, he waited until I was ready, telling me he didn't mind to wait until I was comfortable, and one time when I changed my mind DURING Sex he smiled, said it's perfectly fine, and didn't make a bid deal out of it. Never mentioned it again.

Now the only thing """"lacking"""" (god this sounds horrible, please don't judge me just now) is that sometimes I find him... boring or plain. He isn't super ""hot"" or tall, or masculine, he's always in plain jeans and tshirts, a little awkward around women, admits to fear stepping out of his comfort zone... In short: not a player.

Now I just got out of a extremely toxic relationship before I met him. My Ex treated me pretty much the opposite way. He breadcrumbed me, made me beg for time and attention, cheated on, and even ghosted me. I always took him back because I was so ""in love"" (=trauma bonded). He was a huge narcissist, charming, charismatic, successful, tall, he exactly knew how to talk to women. I was so proud having him by my side, and so emotionally dependent on him, made myself so small, that just know I realise how abusive the relationship really was. Now I'm glad I got out.

The new guy even has supported me taking my ex to court for sexual abuse.


Now the question is:

Do I just doubt my feelings for new guy because I am used to and hooked on toxicity? 

Or do I just like him because he feels ""safe"" unlike my ex? 

I don't know if I can trust my feeling anymore and he deserves better than a girl that is with him to feel 'safe', not because of the amazing person he is.

Well, no exciting update in terms of that, however, I decided to delete my dating apps yesterday! 

I realized how content and happy I am from support from close friends. I realized that while I do feel a little lonely and would love to have that secure romantic relationship, I am also okay with being alone and that things will come together when the time is right. Plus, dating apps were making me feel very sad and burnt out, so I feel like a pause from them will be beneficial. 

I do have some worry that I’m missing out on “opportunities” by deleting them, but I’m just trying to take things step by step. It’s scary to be alone and that maybe I will be alone for a long time, but I feel hopeful that things will work out in the near future! In the meantime, I’m going to try and do more things by myself to become more comfortable with being alone.

Tldr at the end

So I (26m) have been single my whole adult life. In my late teens and early 20s while most of the people my age, friends included, went out and did the party scene and hooked up with people, i opted to stay at home playing video games. I wasnt too bothered by this because i wasnt looking for a relationship at the time. Got on tinder about 2 years ago and would look at it every once in a while but never really got any success. 

About 2 months ago, i met a nice girl on tinder and after about 2 weeks agreed to meet up for lunch and hang out. That went great! Had a good time and ended up inviting her over to smoke weed (her idea to smoke, my place had weed so it worked out). We hung out the rest of the night bonding over music and just getting to know each other. After a while we noticed it was raining pretty hard and she didnt feel comfortable driving home in the rain. She lived kinda far away and it was dark and storming so I offered that shes welcome to spend the night if she didnt want to risk driving all the way home. Said i can sleep on the couch and she can have my bed, just trying to give her options and not seem like a pushy guy that wants to share a bed with her. Her instant response was asking if we could cuddle. So we did and woke up in the morning and had great morning sex. Overall amazing experience for me because I hadnt ever had a night like that before. 

Couple days later after still talking to her everyday, I just simply asked her what her intentions were. Were we a couple now? What did she want to, continue this or what? I think I said something along the lines of I liked her and would like to see where this goes.  She was honest with me and told me that she thought i was a great guy and would like to stay friends if at all possible but that she had another guy she met around the same time as me that she was more invested in and wanted to see where that went. Now im a pretty level headed guy and said that i can respect that. Let her know that I was a little upset about that but since she was upfront with me when i asked, that i would be happy to stay friends. Then we just kept sleeping together, multiple times a week, showering together and everything. So after a couple weeks i brought up the question again of if we are still just friends, cuz i dont know this many friends that fuck this much. She said that she was still seeing this other guy and even told me his name once right after taking a shower together, saying stuff like “I cant wait to go see him, i really like him”. I couldnt handle that and messaged her the next day saying that I would prefer if she didnt come over anymore and that we should not have sex with each other anymore but im down to stay in touch if she wants to do that. 

Two weeks later she informs me that she started hanging out with her ex again, so i asked what happened to the other guy she was talking to, and she very plainly said “nah that just wasnt what i was looking for”. That made me feel like a piece of shit. Unwanted and not good enough and used. I really didnt like that, so I decide to cut things off completely and sent her a message saying that her saying the other guy wasnt what she was looking for made me feel bad and that i was sorry for getting more attached that what we agreed but this is goodbye and goodluck in life. Havnt talked to her since, thought about her alot, but thats my own struggles I guess. 

Now though, im just left empty and lonely and quickly realizing most of my friends are either busy with work or kids to go out. The little venture i had with the girl just left realizing i want an actual relationship. But ive never dated before and i dont really know how to go about finding a potential girlfriend. Im not a super attractive guy, but i dont think im bad looking either. I just dont really know how to talk to people or meet new people. Im one year away from the age my dad was when i was born and that weighs on my mind. Not like i want to rush into anything, but it kinda bugs me that im almost to the same age and havnt had even a girlfriend since highschool. So any advice on getting out there would help. 

TLDR; been single for a long time and had a tinder experience that left me with low confidence.

So I went with the intention of just having a few drinks and making the old Irish exit. I met a girl there who had the exact same plan. 

We hit it off and ended up hanging out at my place till like 2am watching netflix and eating snacks. She made all the initial first moves showing interest. In the morning I made breakfast and we hung out for a bit before I drove her home. I thought we really hit it off and were vibing. In the morning it wasn't awkward and we were shooting the shit/joking.  When I dropped her off we exchanged numbers, there were zero signs that it was a bad experience. A couple hours later she texted me saying thanks for breakfast. I texted her back, essentially saying I'm looking forward to seeing her soon.

But idk how to further approach lol. Maybe I’m being too hard on the entire situation. Like what if he really was sick? Maybe he was just being responsible and staying home. But it still gives off a weird first impression.

I (24f) agreed to meet up with an old fling (26m) to hangout last weekend since we've both moved to the same city and wanted to meet a familiar face. We met in college earlier this year but I moved out of state and so we would just chat occasionally. 

A few months ago, I got news that he's moving to the state and city I'm in for a job. Since he moved here, I've only met him once until last weekend. I told him that I'm dating around now but it would be fun to hangout with a friend. We started planning meeting up since last month because our schedules only allow us to meet up on weekends and he lived more than an hour away from me. The first time we set up a date to meet, he had to cancel a couple days before because his other friend is having a party and insisted ""he's the life of the party"". I understood so I let it pass. The second time we planned a weekend meeting, I was wary if he's still down to meet so I asked him if we're still going. 

The problem started here. We agreed to meet halfway since I didn't have a car and he does but I didn't want him to worry about the heavy traffic. We agreed to meet halfway so I told him the location. It's about a 45 mins bus and train ride for me and about 30 mins car ride for him. He went and asked me if I could go to an even closer train station near him which I would have to ride a different line and takes another 30 mins. This annoyed me and said that we should just reschedule then. He called me to apologize and agreed to pick me up at the first location I mentioned. 

Saturday rolled around and he picked me up at the station. He asked if I wanted to check out his new apartment first before we go get food, I agreed and so we went. During the car ride, he was so caught up in getting score updates of a football game from our old college's team, I even had to repeat myself sometimes since he would get distracted by his phone. It got worse when we got to his place though. It was the 4th quarter and a few minutes left in the game so he wanted to stream it live. I thought to myself fine, its just 3 mins left anyways. But I should have known better that football doesn't work that way and it probably took 15 mins or more before our team ended up loosing. The whole time he was watching the game, I tried to entertain myself around his place, play around with his long board, or fiddle around with my phone. I already felt put off from being ignored, and whenever I ask him some stuff I had to repeat because he didn't hear. 

He was upset with the result of the game that I half-heartedly consoled him and tried to change the subject. I could hear his phone blowing up with texts from his friends who watched game, and I gave him the free pass to check his phone to see how long until he pays attention to me again and actually start a conversation with me without being distracted. We went and drive around for something to eat after he showed me his place but I wasn't feeling the day anymore so when my friend called my phone which turned out not to be that big of an emergency, I stayed on the line for a good 10 minutes or so just to be petty.

He ended up having to drop me off back at the station instead of the agreed ""driving me back to my place"" after getting food because his boss called asking to meet with him virtually at 5. I was low-key grateful for his boss that our day together was cut short. I asked my gal pals for their take on this and the verdict was to cut ties.",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1133209,public,self,Date with a man child,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rakki8/date_with_a_man_child/,no_ads,0,,,

He is an avoidant, so it's not unusual for him to go 10 days here and there off the grid. But...this was long, even for him.

Between life issues I was having and the Thanksgiving holiday, I wasn't really in a good position to be actively dating anyway. I was busy myself. I wouldn't really have been able to get together for dates even if it was an option. Not to give him an excuse or a pass on just disappearing.

Anyway, I had something come up in my life that I thought he would have some expertise/insight on, so yesterday I messaged him. He replied almost immediately. Seemed talkative. The conversation remained pretty neutral and focused on my issue at hand, but...he was talking at least.

So, I brought up an early Christmas present I was getting, and his reply was: ""Not sure but I saw the perfect one for you today."" (I had told him to guess what I was getting) He never elaborated on what he saw.

So, we continued on in the conversation; he sent me a few books that he had bought. And then, he throws this into the conversation: ""I am going to ask for the murder one back when shes done with it.""

Now...bear in mind that no one had been mentioned prior in this conversation to give any sort of reference point to the ""she's."" Would you say this is intentional? My thought is...best case scenario, he was trying to get a reaction out of me. But, the way I am leaning (due to the fact he fell off the face of the earth) is that there is ""someone else"" and he was trying to hint that to me, without wanting to come right out and say it---because men are cowards.

Would you say that's the likely interpretation?

I mean...there's not really even a reason to word it that way at all. He could have said ""That murder one looks really interesting."" or ""I look forward to reading the murder one."" Which leads me back to the idea that it was intentional.

I didn't react, just continued on with the conversation. Some people might say I should have asked him about it. But...it's a little too late to do that now.

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn’t pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1133210,public,self,Is she attracted to me?

Nothing crazy, about 10 people. One girl there (my cousin's friend) I had met before once, but didn't really know that well. I was definitely the most outgoing and best conversationalist there, so naturally I talk to this girl over the course of the weekend. I ask her questions about herself, and we're getting along pretty well. I didn't even consider her to be a romantic interest, although I do think she is very attractive. Over the weekend our conversation is pretty flirty at times. She was doing things like pretending to hit me with objects, and would give the occasional touch on the arm. When we were drunk she asked if I would go hiking with her at some place where she lives. At one point she walked up to me and asked me what my zodiac sign is, and my cousin who was standing behind me gave me a big smile, like she was hinting that this girl was into me. When I told her she said that I had the same zodiac sign as all her boyfriends. When we were leaving, she gave me a hug goodbye.

So while I'm not sure she was interested in me, I do think she was clearly flirting with me. Which brings me to my next question. I have 0 issues getting very hot girls to show interest and flirt with me, yet I'm not that experienced. I've only slept with one person. To my defense, I don't really ask out a lot of women.

I'll explain:

My roommate's sister is an objectively attractive girl and the other day she showed me her Hinge profile. I'm sure most of you know but for those who don't on Hinge you can see everyone who has liked you but you can only go through them one at a time (unless you pay?). So I go to her likes tab and I start scrolling....and scrolling...and scrolling. I swear it felt like I scrolled for a solid minute before I hit the end of the list. Hundreds of guys had liked her and dozens of them were roses (Hinge's version of super like). And it got me thinking that this girl's soulmate could be somewhere in this stack and she would never find him because of the sheer amount of time it would take to go through all these guys' profiles.

For my own anecdote, I have actually successfully hooked up with a girl from tinder. We matched and she came over that same night. While talking I asked her how long she had been on tinder and she said she made her profile 20 MINUTES BEFORE WE MATCHED. 20 minutes and she was already talking to someone with plans of meeting up. This also got me thinking that if you aren't one of the first matches a girl gets you're gonna get buried in the stack of likes (or even matches) and she'll never see your profile.

 I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and have been living in the United States for about 8 years now. One thing I have noticed is how much exposure to certain pop culture elements affect a woman's racial preference when it comes to dating. It is my belief that women mostly go for what they have been exposed to. Either who they grew up around, or what they have been exposed to in the media.  On dating apps, most of the women that like my profile are Hispanic, this makes sense, since most women date within their race. However, if a non-Latina woman likes me, there's a high chance that she either was exposed to Latin music, such as reggaeton, was adopted by a Hispanic family, or just grew up around a predominate Latino area, such as Miami. Comments that I often get whenever I date women outside of my race range from; ""I only date Hispanic men"", ""I love Bad Bunny"", ""My best friend growing up is Hispanic"", ""My adopted parents are Hispanic"", and/or ""My ex is from Puerto Rico"". My black friends seem to have a similar experience when it comes to dating. Whenever they date outside of their race, they noticed that the women either mostly listen to Hip-Hop/Rap, have a Black Lives Matter link on their profile, and/or mostly have black friends. One thing that I found interesting is that most Asian women that liked my profile were Filipino. This makes perfect sense to me, since the Philippines used to be a Spanish colony, and therefore have been exposed to Hispanic culture.  

 Okcupid did a study back in 2014 were they compare the interactions between men and women based on race. Apart from black women, men in general seemed to like most women across the board. My guess for this might be because black women are generally depicted as being bossy, stuck up, and exhibiting masculine traits, which most men do not find particularly attractive. The women however exhibited a clear strong preference for men within their race with one exception, white men. In the study, they showed that most women across the board had a preference for white men. My best guess would be that white men have a huge influence on the world, particularly in a positive way. White men are typically portrayed as being successful, tall, and ambitious, all traits that women find attractive.  

In conclusion, it is my belief that people date based on what they have been exposed to growing up. They either shun a certain race because they grew up watching negative stereotypes about them or fetishize them if they were exposed to positive things about them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1133232,public,self,Does Media Exposure Affect Racial Dating Bias?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ramrsw/does_media_exposure_affect_racial_dating_bias/,no_ads,0,,,

I have a fat crush on this guy in my physics class. Since the first day I walked into class, I've always kinda been eyeing him, and recently, we were put into the same group for a lab project. The lab project gave us an excuse to see/talk to each other and not only is he physically attractive, his personalty is like a 10/10. I also really value being able to joke around and our humor is pretty similar, so I'm always giggling around him.

HOWEVER, as many college students know, it is nearing the end of the semester, which the number of opportunities I have to make a move are quickly dwindling. I go to a really big state school, so unless I make the effort to initiate something, I will probably not see him ever again! The idea of asking someone out romantically is absolutely terrifying and I don't know if I can work up the balls to do it before the end of the semester. It's kinda bad timing too, since everyone goes home for about a month for winter break, so even if I do ask him out, it's not like we will be in close proximity over break. 

Instead of directly asking him out, I think it would be a better idea to ask him to join a club with me next semester, that way, we will have an excuse to keep seeing each other.

I'm a 19F and I attend college.

I don't take rejection that seriously (whether it's me rejecting someone or them rejecting me) but I always feel super awkward bumping into someone after I've had some uncomfortable interactions with someone (such as me making a fool out of myself or them turning me down).

Even thinking about it is super embarrassing and I don't know why. I literally cringe thinking of bumping into someone who once rejected me, which has happened on some occasions.
