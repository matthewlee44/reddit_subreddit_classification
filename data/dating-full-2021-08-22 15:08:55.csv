I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for four months, talking for six. It feels like she is putting in so much work into our relationship and she is doing so much for me because she loves me, whether it be, being aware of the way she acts or what she says so that it doesn't bother me, doing things for me that I don't want to do so that I don't have to, the list goes on and on..

Don't get me wrong, I put in my fair share into the relationship, I care about her and I am there for her when she needs me. I have been trying hard to make it work, but something in me feels off. I feel guilty and I think to myself that she deserves someone better, someone, that doesn't make her feel stressed, someone that really loves her, because I have no idea if I truly do or not.

The first couple of months we were talking, I thought to myself that I will get to sleep with her and I will figure out my feelings for her eventually so I left it at that. Over time I would find something about her that I liked and my feelings for her would build up, but then I would see something that I didn't like or found annoying and I would think about it until my feelings for her would disappear. I would constantly switch from liking her to not liking her from week to week. I had periods of time where I thought about breaking up with her, and I would stop because I would think to myself that there is still more I can learn about myself being in this relationship.

Last week I was madly in love with her, I couldn't wait to see her and I loved spending every minute with her. This week we have been fighting and trying to come up with a solution every day and I told her why I wasn't sure if I truly liked her or not. She asked what is stopping me and I told her that because I am learning so much about myself and from her that I don't want it to end yet. She then asked if I was using her and I didn't know how to respond. I felt so guilty right then and there, it felt like the truth or that she was spot on. I looked back and thought to myself that I never really thought of it that way other than the few times that I thought to myself that I don't want to break up yet.

This has really hit home and is making me question whether or not I have been. I am starting to think and believe that I have been using her and I feel terrible about it. I think that I should break up with her because she doesn't deserve it.

TL;DR I think I have been using my gf, but I don't know for sure and if it's ok to keep on with the relationship. Don't know if I should end things with her or not.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,967918,public,self,"I think that I (26, M) have been using my girlfriend (22,F) What do I do?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9ejrz/i_think_that_i_26_m_have_been_using_my_girlfriend/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

I know too many men, mostly Hispanic but also white, dating very attractive American women. I also know a good amount who are short and blame all their issues on it.

Ironic enough, the ones who blame all their issues on it often don’t care about their health, have bad hygiene, low self-esteem, care nothing for self-improvement, are not well groomed, and care nothing of their physique. It saddens me because when I try to converse with them, it’s always if, ands, or buts, doing anything to point fingers, blame and victimize to cover the fact that they are the reason for the results they get.

It’s sad to see men this applies to spend hundreds of hours worrying, blaming, and getting frustrated to the point where they begin to resent women and even degrade them. Women have to suffer from these men’s incompetence and inability to better themselves and face their own problems.

The time most people spend blaming, victimizing, arguing their illogical positions could easily be used to become the person they need to date the person they want.

Too many men have many of these flaws, and the worst part about it is that these men, who honestly are probably a 3-5 on the dating scale at best, have this grandiose sense of self that they really think nothing of only willing to date 9 or 10s.

A lot of the time They don’t study, some don’t work, don’t even Pay bills have a mortgage or even apartment, drive a bucket, don’t have goals, no education, no direction or aspirations and want a smoking hot dime. Not that you need all of this but most Only want to take with no giving. Let’s get real here, some of you need to put down the pron and Hollywood culture expectations and take a look in the mirror and ask, what kind of woman would want this and why?

So our second date was Friday. And we decided to go to a bowling alley. We went to bowl and we trash talked and got drinks when we were there. Afterwards we went and got apps from the bar. The date lasted approximately 2 hours. I offered to call her an Uber from the alley, but she offered to walk me back to the train station. While walking I held her hand and tried to kiss her and she went in for the kiss (but because of our height difference I ended up getting her forehead) I laugh and say “I’m sorry I suck so bad.” While walking back I jokingly ask “Are you sick of me yet?” She replies that she’s not. And then I said that while I couldn’t do a date next weekend I’d be good for Labor Day weekend. She replies that she has work one day, but should be free another. We get to my station and she leans in to hug me and we kiss for a bit. I tell her to text me when she’s home and I promise to do the same. When I get home I text her and tell her I’m home and she replies she’s home too. I tell her I hope she had fun and she says she did. And then before bed tell her that over the past few weeks I really enjoyed hanging out with her and re-affirm that she’s the only one I’m talking to (she told me the same thing after Date 1) and that I was thankful she accepted my awkwardness. I don’t get a reply until the next morning where she apologizes that she fell asleep and re-affirms she likes talking and hanging out with me too.

So all of this points to good stuff just writing it, but does anyone else see any red flags here?

We haven't had an exclusivity talk and want to go slow. But I have a FWB who I'll be hooking up with for a couple more weeks.

I've (F) had a FWB (M) for two years while living across the country from my hometown. It's been really fun— I've loved having someone who respects me and I can have fun with no strings attached.

Over the summer, I went back to my hometown with no intention of hooking up with anyone and planned to live another year in the other state (continue school, sleep with my FWB, etc.). However, I ended up hooking up with an old friend and we've been going on a lot of dates for about a month now. During this time, I decided to move back home (unrelated to her). We had a conversation a week ago where I mentioned we weren't together, and she said she wants to go slow (which I want too). We didn't talk about exclusivity, but we're both interested in continuing to date/seeing where things go.

Recently, I just flew back to the other town to start moving and have made plans to hook up with my FWB. Though I'm not sure if this is okay. Technically speaking, it seems like it is but I'm not sure the etiquette. I don't think the girl I'm dating is sleeping/seeing other people and she doesn't know about my FWB. (I'm getting an STI/STD test before I see her again). Obviously, I'm going to stop sleeping with him when I move home.

Mostly I've been wondering because I once casually dated another girl (who said she only does open relationships), though when I asked how she'd feel about me seeing my FWB, we got into a fight where she said, ""why would [she] care? we [weren't] together."" And we ended things the next day. This is why I'm nervous about seeing my FWB or even if the girl I'm dating now needs to know.

How should I navigate this situation? Do I tell the girl I'm dating about my FWB? Is it okay to sleep with someone else if I'm dating someone before an exclusivity talk?

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked.

He told me he really liked me and was looking for something serious with me and he would try to communicate with me more. Then we kissed.



We were suppose to hang out Saturday and I asked him the day before if we were gonna hang out. He said yes let me just make sure tomorrow and I told him to just let me know ahead of time. Saturday comes and he doesn’t tell me so I ask him or else so I can make my plans. 

He tells me he really would want to but he has to pick up his aunt from lax later today and tomorrow would be better. I got mad and I told him that today was my only day off and i wanted to spend it with him but he’s always busy and it seems like he’s never gonna have time for me. I told him that I don’t want to do this anymore that I like him but I need someone who makes time for me and treats me like a priority and not an option and I wasn’t sure if he could do that. He answers back and tells me he 🥺I can and then I tell him your actions show otherwise every time we hang out it’s always something and he just send 🥺😢 after that I didn’t answer him.

This isn’t the first time he cancels last time we were suppose to hang out Friday. He was gonna come and see me after work but he told me his dad called him out of the blue for his help and that it was gonna take a while but I told him to forget it that I didn’t want to see him anymore and he said he would make it up to me Saturday but I decided not to go out with him and then we fixed stuff and this comes up.

I’ve been hooking up with a friend for the past three months. Since I ended a relationship right before, I wasn’t and am not looking for anything in that sense yet. He is also in a place where he simply enjoys a variety of people too much to be ready to commit. Both of us knew how the other viewed us hanging out, so we agreed we would tell, if anyone catches feelings. Long story short I told him this week that I am developing feelings for him and that it would be better to return to a friendship without the benefits.
What I’d like an opinion about - has he been giving me false hope/is he a fuckboy if we openly discussed none of us wanted a relationship, BUT the actions gave a bit of a different vibe? Everytime we we’re together, we spend hours chatting, going to dinner, we sleepover at eachother’s places and cuddle, he prepares lunch and breakfast in bed for me etc., we text daily, when I was abroad, he called me to talk for an hour, I even met his parents (ofc as a friend, but he took me to their house). 
On the other hand we have both been having sex with other people in the meantime; because he knows I am also attracted to women, he comments and wants to discuss women we see together, when we are with our mutual friends we don’t do anything physical but they still notice us flirting (so they know, but we don’t act lovey-dovey in front of them).
I am aware of the fact that he clearly stated he didn’t want anything romantic out of the relationship, but our friend is convinced he played me with the way he acted towards me and that I have given him an ego boost by telling him about my feelings, that I have given him a notion of “you are an alpha male” and have embarassed myself with not having enough self-respect.

During the second date, I questioned his intentions with me - about whether he only cared about the sexual chemistry or he wanted something more.  I tend to be quite blunt and honest on dates, and that was something that my date had said he appreciated about me.

We discussed how much anxiety can interfere with my dating and he opened up to me about his anxiety as well.  We ended the date somewhat early, and he did not want to come upstairs to my home (which was close by) though he did want to continue seeing where this went.

Hey,

I've had anxiety throughout my life but I was generally able to overcome it by simply facing my fears, but this time it's much different.

I was always slightly antisocial and introverted. I had trouble making new friends, but once I got relaxed I had no trouble with them.

I recently started dating this girl I've been friends with for over a year, through a mutual friend. I've never had trouble talking to her until I started liking her and actually dating her. This is the first time someone told me they actually liked me and they wanted to date me. (I've never been on a date before, and I don't think anyone has ever had a crush on me.) So, I got nervous hearing that as I thought she was way out of my league. Everything went well until we went on our first 2 dates. I had trouble concentrating and I felt like I was about to vomit before our dates. I couldn't seem to calm myself down, which I usually can.

I went to the first date thinking, I'll relax over time, I'll overcome that by simply doing it. (I didn't). We had a mediocre date as I was scared shitless, and I think she got a negative first impression. The second date was a tad bit better, as we went to a bar and I had a couple drinks, so the alcohol relaxed me a bit. But I was still feeling sick and I couldn't eat that whole day.

I'm looking for a way to overcome this extreme anxiety (I've never felt this scared, and anxiety never had such impact on me and my health). The answer is usually ""face it"", but I've faced it twice and I still don't feel any better.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,968239,public,self,Need help overcoming dating anxiety [M],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9j9kq/need_help_overcoming_dating_anxiety_m/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

With covid and everything, it's all been through apps, and I've had a few first dates that didn't ""spark"" for either side, and then 3 dates with this most recent girl.

The first two dates we got drinks, and for the third date on a Friday I invited her over to make some homemade pizza, drinks, and to play a board game or two. Each date the conversation had flowed well, the time flew by, laughs were had and I came away feeling really good about it every time. 

We kissed at the end of the second date, and we made out a good amount and were cozied up on the couch for a while on the third. I didn't take it any further than that because she said she moves really slowly and I wanted to respect those boundaries - she also didn't stay the night but was over for a good 6? hours or so. There was the occasional lull in the conversation, but it felt comfortable and not awkward.

The Saturday, I follow her on Instagram, she follows me back (yeah, kinda goofy to make this sound important I guess) - we text a bit through it all. Monday comes around, and I text to ask if she had a good weekend. She says yes, and thanks me for the food and that she had a nice time but that she was missing ""a romantic spark"" that she didn't think she was going to get.

My heads admittedly been spinning from this, because I felt like it was going super well and it was a bit of a blindside. She'd mentioned she hated dating before and that she'd had some bad experiences with it in the past, but I felt like all systems were a go leading up to that. It doubly sucks because she was the first person I'd clicked with and felt like I could open myself up to (and kissed) in over a year.

Is this common in dating?

I have never really experienced something like this, and I'm still kind of reeling about it. I can't tell if I did or said something that just totally turned her off from me, and I guess I never will? But why the Insta follow, why the sudden (to me) turnaround?

She isn’t on any anxiety or depression meds and honestly seems more confident than me so I can’t tell if she just writes “scared” and “nervous” on texts or if she has some issues. While I can deal with these of course, I dated a girl who was on anti-depressants and that was toxic for us both so looking to avoid.

At one point, he got on top of me without a condom and I was too scared to say no. I blocked Ash on everything the next day. The day after, I started talking to Chris. We met on Tinder. We talked about hooking up. 

I told him I wanted to use a condom. He said he was fine with it. I asked him to get tested. I was going to get tested too, because I had sex the day before I met him. He said he would. Then I got scared of being in the same situation again, (guy pressuring me to fuck without a condom) and I unfriended/unmatched with Chris. The next day, I get a text message. It was from Chris. He asked me if I was still interested in hooking up, he ordered a 10 panel STD test. I was still very hesitant. He asked me to hang out, and I said yes. The day we were supposed to hang out, I ghosted him.

He texted me the day after. ""Hey, I'm walking in to get my blood taken. Are you still interested?"" I said okay, but told him something had happened to me a few days before I started talking to him that ""wasn't so great"", and wasn't sure if I was comfortable having sex. He told me he ""figured"" and was ""Sorry that guys made you feel that way in the past. But I'm not that person. I want to show you I'm more than a horny guy. I think you're cool.""

I said okay. But I should have known he just wanted sex, because when I asked him questions, he would answer, but he showed absolutely no interest in getting to know me. I asked him to hang out that night. We hung out. He didn't pressure me. We made out and that led me to giving him a blowjob. Nothing else.

That night we agreed we should hang out again. We set up a day. We started sexting. I told him I wasn't comfortable having actual sex until I got my results back.

I'm 27 and I really started dating when I was 20.
Ive always been trying. But I average about one date a year.

I know a lot of guys have trouble, but I feel like this must be below average?

Like I try and women I meet just don't seem to want to give me a chance with a first date. It's not that I'm very picky. Im pretty patient and if I'm unsure about someone, I rather go on a few dates and see what I think, rather than turning them down outright, but I never get that far.

Last year, I seemed a bit lucky and met someone where it actually turned into a short relationship. And I lost my virginity then at age 26. And I know that isn't typical.

In person I generally don't meet anyone. I go out with friends and everyone else is out with their friends. The opportunity doesn't really seem like it's there.

On apps, I may get a match or two every month if I'm active on the app every day. But most of the time people don't answer messages. And if they do, after a message or two they ghost me.

So every once in a while this all really bothers me because I feel like at a rate of one date per year, I'm never going to find someone.



**My question:**
Are there any guys that are doing better than this? Be it online dating or meeting people in person?

What exactly do you do?
What works?
How can I get more women to simply consider going on a first date with me?

Im just not sure what I'm doing wrong. But I'm confident enough in myself these days that I don't think it's just that I'm that undesirable. 

I feel like it's probably just that I'm not approaching it right. And that seems likely because I've never been that socially savvy.

I'm open to taking a new approach and would love some advice.



**About me:**
I'm a guy. I'm 27. I'm straight. I'm introverted.
I think I'm pretty average looking. I'm 5'7

I think I'm pretty interesting - I'm a successful designer and I play music in my fee time; won many awards for art and I'm currently nominated for best instrumentalist in my part of the state and have an album releasing next week. And I can talk in detail on most subjects.

Everyone I know regards me as nice.

I know I'm pretty socially awkward - particularly in groups.

I'm also a feminist. And 100% of my friends are women. So I'm comfortable talking to women. Ive heard their side of the dating experience and I make a point to be completely fair and understanding to women.

Also when texting, I'm not a one word answer person. By this post you could probably tell I'm pretty wordy.

So I feel this might be the place where I can get some honest answers. I’m 26M. In High School I was the awkward kid who didn’t really pay attention to girls. In college I was too busy with school and work and afterwards I focused on just getting a stable job with my degree. 
Recently during the mess that was 2020 I moved to a new town. At the same time I made a goal to actually start dating (bad enough I’m 26 no experience and to wait for my 30s I think would be a personal disaster).
Anyways I was wondering if I can get any tips from people who are experience and also from those who maybe were/are in the same boat.

Real quick a few things:
-Online Dating is a no for me it’s the only thing I’ve tried recently and have had no luck. Unfortunately I’m not attractive looking enough to make it work. In the past I have been hit on but I have a strong feeling that it was more due to personality.
-I find it difficult to open up to strangers so a lot of what I tend to do at the very beginning when meeting people is boring small talk (Ik I have to work on that)
-Don’t really go out that much so my other goal is pushing myself.

I’m used to taking a girl out and getting a text thanking me for the time we spent so I’m a little loss and would like some input.

I got a phone number at a party last night from a girl, it was all going great. Her friend was really working hard to separate the two of us but we still stayed together. It was great, the girl was perfect in every single way and I could bet she liked me as well. We started texting this afternoon, just asked her out and she rejected me by saying that I am a really great guy but she already has a crush on someone else.

This is the third rejection in a row I got this week. Honestly I'm feeling really depressed and terrible. The usual advice I get from friends isn't cutting it this time so I decided to ask for advice here before I fall into complete depression and close myself in my room for the next 3 months (this happened before).

I (23M) have been dating my now fiancé (22F) for a little over 4 years now. We started dating at the end of high school and have been together all through college. 

She was a super athlete during her time in high school and super fit. During our time in college, both of us honestly got a little out of shape, but my metabolism saw that I didn’t really change. She put on some weight. I want to be perfectly clear here: I still think she’s smoking hot. I think she’s thicc, not fat. Can’t get enough of her. She’s still the same amazing friend I relied on and could be relaxed around when we first met. She works out often, she’s strong and healthy, and frankly gorgeous. 

But it seems like me telling her all this does little or nothing to convince her that she’s not fat and unattractive now. She keeps saying that she’s going to lose weight by eating right and working out so she can look like she used to, and I encourage her in her efforts because I know how much it means to her and it’s always a good thing to practice healthy living, but I can also see how taxing and disappointed she becomes if she puts weight she lost back on or stays the same (she’s studying to be a nurse, so she has almost no time for downtime). Telling her that I think she’s still beautiful only seems to help a little before she tells me that she still feels fat and ugly.
