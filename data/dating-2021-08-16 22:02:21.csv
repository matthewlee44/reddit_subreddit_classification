I don't think I look bad, probably average. I've been single for a few years now. I've tried Tinder, Bumble, Facebook, every possible dating app you can think of. Obviously going out in bars and stuff as been pretty impossible during the last year due to the pandemic (I live in Canada).
9/10 females I message don't even answer me. Just left on 'read'. The 1/10 that do answer is just to flip me off and tell me I'm an asshole.
I'm an engineer, make 120k a year, own my own place. My friends/family tell me I'm a good guy.
Honestly it gets pretty depressing. I would like to have a family one day, but no girl even wants to talk to me. Dating is out of the question. What should I do, give up?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5vi4c/girls_just_dont_want_to_talk_to_me/

I don’t know if my anxiety was holding me back from being my true self or if we just weren’t connecting but the date felt kind of boring. I ended up telling him in the end that I didn’t see this working out and it felt like we weren’t connecting. Now I’m having second thoughts and I don’t know if I made a rash decision. Should I have gone on a third date to see if we meshed better then? I don’t know how quickly people usually feel the sparks with each other.

5,p5w93g,1629172607,Too early and Best Friend,"I'm probably silly for asking this because I know the answer. How early is too early to say I love you to someone you are dating? Every single time I've dated someone they would tell me they love me really early in the relationship and at those times I thought I felt the same way so of course I would say it back. Then we'd break up a few days later because of them. The only time this didn't happen was when the guy i was dating told me he loved me and i explained to him that even though I deeply cared about him I felt like it was to early for me to say I loved him, he understood and we dated for six months. Everone else it was like a couple of weeks and months tops. I've only dated 4 people.

Next up is about my best friend... When we are in public and there is someone cute she always says they are flirting with me when in reality they are flirting with her.  She's prettier and more outgoing than me and multiple times she says she will try to set me up with someone. She either forgets, the person likes her, the person is not my type but she thinks they are, or the person thought she was flirting with them. I just don't know what to do because again with the in public thing I know who the people are flirting with, I can tell because they are always smiling at her and actually flirting. With me they just look bored or don't want to be there. Even though i know the truth she tries to keep saying they are flirting with me and when the truth comes out my self esteem goes down a lot. I already have low self esteem because I'm in the closet to most people i know as trans(ftm). 

I just don't know what to do because I want to date, and when I try to date people think I'm either just nice or they don't like me in that way and just see me as a friend. So what should I do? I'm working on my self esteem, but besides that i don't know what to do. Then again maybe this is just silly.

He lives about 1.5 hrs away. But I guess my non-issue is that I’m just not used to is that he’s the kind of guy who is very well liked and has his own life!  Which is awesome because I’m busy myself and value my independence but it’s a learning curve to be involved with a man who isn’t like desperate for my attention? So there are gaps in communication via texting that never last longer than 24 hours but I sit here waiting for his reply.  Then I get in my head thinking maybe he isn’t that into me.

7,p5wk2z,1629173853,Apps are stupid - so i'm rating them here,"Based on my limited experience, dating apps are just dumb. Here's how my picks stack up:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hinge - Easily the best, least  sketchy, and I've had 4 conversations on this in  4 weeks, 3/4 have ghosted though
2. Bumble - Quality people on Bumble as well, but less matching
3. Tinder - lots of matching, mixed quality, literally don't care about your vax status and don't want a hookup
4. Match - Seems cool until you realize that nobody cares about the paragraph you wrote. One match on here and it fizzled out
5. eHarmony - $$$$$$ pay me and then we talk lol - useless if free.
6. Coffee Meets Bagel - Seems cool but 0 matches, quality and pool varies
7. Facebook Dating - An actual cesspool of shit, where people go to die

&amp;#x200B;

I think there are other apps but they were all terrible too. As you can see I've had no luck, and with the pandemic 2.0 and being generally awkward and more of a muted personality type, getting out and meeting women is just a joke. How do people even casually start a conversation without going to a bar (I don't drink) and getting wasted? Not the kind of thing I'm looking for anyways.

1. Date went well, it felt pretty lively and fun.
2. Afterwards, they volunteer that they'd be down to meet up again.
3. I follow up to try and schedule a time for next week, but they say they're ""too busy this week"".
4. I get busy (or a little self-conscious I guess) and I don't follow up after that first no.

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that it probably doesn't make any sense to follow up at this point... But did I screw up by not persisting? Will a lot of women say they're too busy as a polite way of giving a straight-up no?  Instead of trying to get a time scheduled... should I be leaving the ball in their court, and say they can reach out if they want?

So we’ve been friends for almost two years now but at first it was just a FWB thing, however I’ve always had strong feelings for him since I met him. the beginning of this year, we finally hung out  aside from seeing each other at night. We’d go on dates and started to hang out weekly , going out of town and having a good time. 4 months later,  he was drunk one night and finally admitted to me that he’s in love with me but it kinda shook me because he’s the second guy I’ve ever fallen head over heels for and it seemed unreal. That night he confessed, we had a good time. We got drunk, sang our hearts out in the car and made love. 
The next day neither one of us texted each other, then later on that week, we hung out and I asked what we were doing and he went on about how he poured out his heart to me that one night and that I “completely ignored” him the whole week cause I never texted. (I just didn’t text cause I couldn’t believe it, I thought it was just drunk words.) I told him I wanted to talk about us but sober. He ended up called it off and said we just made it weird and that we should just go back to what we were before that night. So skip to like two weeks later, he decided to cut me off but ended up calling me a month later, to go over and have drinks. So we get drunk and he goes on about how he loves me and I ended up staying the night.

So basically back at the beginning of April I began talking to a girl who I met through a video game we play together. She started messaging me after she saw a picture of me and said I was cute, we hit it off really well and we would talk and text all day everyday. I began to build sort of a emotional connection to her after she really helped me get through the loss of a close friend of mine. 

Fast forward 3 months to July I finally went to go visit her because she lives 5 hours away(I know I know this is all very stupid), anyway we hung out every single day while I was there and we ended up making out one night after spending time with her after we went to a pool place with her friends. Anyway the next night we were talking as I was leaving her parents place and I tried kissing her and she pulled back apologizing. I asked her what she wanted between us and she said she wasn’t really into the long distance stuff and that when things get serious she freaks out. So I told her we could remain friends and I wouldn’t make the situation weird. At the end of the trip she said that was the most fun she’s had all summer. 

Now a month later we still are friends, but she seems a bit distant and doesn’t seem like she really wants to be my friend even if that makes sense. Along with that she seems to be trying to flirt with another guy who has started playing with us. This ofc bothers me a lot which is weird because I’m not the jealous type. 

Anyway I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to move on since even past breakups haven’t bothered me like this as well as any thoughts on why she doesn’t seem to want to be friends.

The problem, we have gotten physically intimate with each other on a few occasions. Sometimes in front of her friends and other times in private with each other. As things between us start to heat up, she keeps pulling out fetishes that completely turn me off.

23,p5xwdp,1629179830,Should lonely men hit on random women IRL?,"Like most men, I don't really get any dating options online. I've been on only one date from online dating. I've tried Photofeeler, posted my profile online, had female relatives remake my profile - nothing seems to make any difference.

Online dating is therefore extremely depressing and unproductive. My sister by contrast can get 50+ likes on any app within 24 hours and can set up as many dates per week as there are days. For her it's a one stop free shopping app where she can order around men easier than a pizza.

I have a few female friends but they've never gotten me a date. I've gone to meetups and they were all dudes. My gym is usually 8:1 or 10:1 male:female. So I basically have no options in my day to day life to get dates.

I don't really know what other option there is then except talking to random women on the street, in day to day life, or in bars/clubs. 

There are a couple perspectives I hear on this:

One is that women don't want to be hit on at the gym/bar/supermarket/mall - they go there to work out, drink, or shop - so you should never talk to women in any of those places. Okay, but that gives me again zero dating options.

Another is you never really know until you try so you just have to try at random over and over, be relaxed about it when they shoot you down, and wait until you get a success (if it eventually happens).

I'm leaning towards the second philosophy at this point because the first accomplishes nothing. I'm already drowning in nothing. More nothing is not going to help.

31,p5yyrq,1629185086,My dating screw up,"This was the second date I'd been on since seperating. The first, she was a nice girl but I just wasn't attracted to her. The second, which I'll talk about I was massively attracted too and I csn help feeling I screwed this up massively. Oh dear.

We met on tinder, circumstances and holidays meant we couldn't actually meet for about 5 weeks after first matching. As we chatted we realised we had so much in common, same favourite band, same food preferences, same sense of humour. Stuff that is probably superficial but felt important at the time.

I was warey before the date that she would be a lot different in real life as the first one was, she wasn't, she was even better. Charming, beautiful, funny, she was amazing.

The date itself seemed to go really well, we sat and talked and drank wine. She decided to book a later train home, she initiated the kiss half way through the date. We kissed a load, there was no indication that she didn't want to, she even (drunkenly admittedly) suggested we get a hotel, I couldn't cos if work and my daughter coming over in the morning.

So far so good, or so I thought. We text a bit to make sure we both got home OK. The first hint that I misread occurred here, she said she felt a bit embarrassed, I asked why and she said she felt like she acted silly. I'd fell asleep by the time I got this response and didn't want to push for an answer in the morning. I can only assume she got too drunk and got swept up in the date without actually being sure she liked me.

I didn't hear from her much that day. I asked if she wanted to go out again and she said she wanted to see how a date she had in a few days went. Strike 2. In order to save face I stupidly said I'd lost interest a bit cos now I felt like a backup. She assured me I wasn't and the other guy had said the same. I feel this was a major fuck up by me. We spoke again the day after other date.

She said she felt shitty so cancelled it and went out with her friend instead. I feel I believe her, I think, she sent me a pic her friend had sent at the restaurant. Taking a pic of your first date seemed like a weird thing to do right?

She so said that day she didn't think she wanted to date for a while and confirmed this later in the day. Again she assured me it wasn't because of me, she made a point about how much she had liked me, how funny, sexy etc etc I am but again this feels confusing to me.

We tried to stay friends, I always initiated convoys which were short. She would respond quickly tho and send selfies etc etc. I said I wanted to not speak for a bit because she was crushing a bit. Again she send a message about how much she liked me and even sent a ""missing you"" snap later that day. We kept chatting a bit, she asked when I said I was crushing if I was hoping for something serious. I sent a message saying I wasn't going into dating with that thought but if it happened organically I would probably go along with it. I asked why she asked and she said she was ""just curious""??? We text infrequently, she seemed jealous id been flirting with others in OLD. She mentioned she had closed her tinder etc etc

Another massive mistake from me, I went back the next day. I feel this made me seem even more unattracive. We chatted a bit longer then I really fucked things up. 

 I had been out with friends and text her that I felt she only replied out of politness (ugh bad move). I deleted the msg, she said the next morning she had saw it, she thought I was a great guy but I was going in circles getting annoyed she wouldn't give me what I wanted and we should leave the friendship there, and of course, a good luck on tinder final line.

Do you think she really didn't like me that much or really just didn't want to date anyone??

38,p5zyel,1629190401,I [23M] told the girl [21F] I like about my history of trauma,"I’m 23 and when I was a kid had some abusive experiences around touch that shattered my ability to enjoy intimacy. For all my life I’ve pushed away desire for others and any desire towards me.

After years of therapy things are getting better and in April I started dating someone for the first time. I care about her so deeply but she’s very sexually active and experienced, and I was facing enormous anxiety/pain around touch. I became very avoidant around touch after the first few dates (it got to the point where I couldn’t even kiss her) and I could tell this confused her / pushed her away. I was desperate to tell her about my history but I was too frozen and terrified. In June she ended things and I was completely devastated.

After she ended it I found she still talked to me quite often, and I wondered if her feelings were completely gone. A few weeks ago she invited me to a jazz night and it was the most fun, sweet romantic experience I’ve ever had. We got very drunk and kissed and it was amazing.

I saw her last week, though, and immediately things were wrong with me again. Massive anxiety, massive fear - specifically around the prospect of touch. That night when she fell asleep I had a full blown panic attack and very nearly just walked out of her bedroom and went home.

I’m not sure what happened or what did it - maybe it’s just that I trust her more now, but also probably that I have a much stronger understanding of the consequences of my abuse and the way they’ve affected my relationships. But in the morning, I was FINALLY able to tell her about my history. 

I told her that I’d been having a massive freakout the night before and that I was very grateful that I had her hand to hold onto while it was happening. I told her that there was a history of bad trauma (no specifics) and that I was desperately trying to find ways to make touch feel safer, but that I got very easily overwhelmed. I said that I was so glad that I had her with me, because she made me feel very safe. She didn’t say much in return, just that she was glad she made me feel safe, before holding my hand again and we cuddled for a bit.

Since I told her I’ve been wracked with anxiety that it’s too much for her, that she won’t want to be with me anymore. But things seem okay - she’s texted me a couple of times over the past few days. And I guess I’m just very happy that I had the strength and courage to tell her. I really want to work more actively WITH her to find ways to move the relationship into a more communicative and physically/sexually active place.

I hope this long as hell post is of worth and value to someone. Chiefly I’m still carrying a lot of regret that it took me this long to be honest and communicative, but I am just very pleased that I finally did it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5zyel/i_23m_told_the_girl_21f_i_like_about_my_history/

My fiancé cheated on me so I broke up with him. Now that I’m single after being in a relationship for over a year it was pretty saddening but instead of crying over my break up I went straight back into the dating scene and started talking to a guy I meet through a friend. We actually clicked instantly until a couple of weeks ago he asked for my opinion on something political and I told him my opinion. He got extremely pissed off at me and said he has no problem being friends with benefits but he doesn’t see himself being with someone with right leaning/ conservative values. I’m ok with this but still think it’s stupid because my ex was a liberal and our difference of opinions never was a problem in our relationship.  Anyways after that happened I stared looking for another guy and I rarely find men who are conservative. I live in a very liberal area unfortunately so it’s already hard and the conservative men I do find either fetishize me (I’m mixed),straight, or are old enough to be my father. I have nothing wrong with people who are liberals.Shit most of my friends are liberals and my entire family are Democrats,but I’m kind of tired of being surrounded by liberals and want more conservatives in my life.

50,p623t7,1629200637,My (29M) LDR GF (26) is spending a weekend getaway with an old friend who she has history with,"LDR for over a year now, and due to the pandemic meetings have been scarce. So basically, an LDR set up ever since it started. Lived together for over a week on two separate occasions, and then about 8-10 single day meetings.

Also her work involves alot of travel, and also a lot with her family. For an estimate, she's barely been ""home"" for 10 days, in the last 2 months(Travelling first with family, then for work). And she's also someone who's not very used to the LDR thing. She always told me, but we still always chose to stick with it and never end things.

Now she's had a bunch of past relationships, one of which she has had a tough time getting over. This has also been the reason of a few fights between us, but we worked thru them. She's also someone who feels lonely a lot, and wants constant love and attention and warmth in life. Then there was also this incident where she thought she fell for someone else for a brief period of time, ghosted me, but later we sorted things again after a couple weeks (twas last year, about 4 months into the relationship, when we had only met twice physically).

HOWEVER,ATM, I have no doubts on her love for me, and I also appreciate that she wants it to really work out despite not being a LDR person.

Now, this weekend, she came back from a week long work trip, rested for a day, n felt like travelling again. Reason - Feels alone, wants to watch sunrise in a nearby quaint town, possibly get some perspective in life. For this, she called n old friend, asked him to drive her down there, and come back the next day. (plan later got changed to an overnight 3hr long drive - sunset - spend next night - return) Now this ""old friend"" of hers is sum1 with a history. Both appeared on a famous reality show in my country where they were both touted as a couple between whom ""sparks were flying"" n shit. I've known about his existence, but not the deets. Altho, as per her, there was something but it never materialized and they stayed good friends.

So now, Mr old friend obliges and they are both out on this sunrise chase, and spending two nights together in ""2 separate luxury tents"" and my girl has barely even acknowledged my presence ever since. There's like a 90% drop in her texting/calling rates, and then when she calls me she behaves like everything is normal.

Last night, without explaining much, I just told her it's over in anger. She asked me to explain what she'd done but I refused and asked her to figure on her own. She later called me a ""bitter asshole"" for never understanding her, and how I'm the only one she loves but Im too blind to see.

TL:DR; LDR relationship. Girl went on a 2 night long ""short trip"" with an old friend she has a little history with. Barely stays in touch with me during the trip. And I end it without explaining what's wrong.

61,p63les,1629206230,You ever get down about not being in a relationship and just need to feel it so you move through it?,"Feeling a bit sad and feeling my feels, so I can move through it.

Someone who I liked spending time with a while back, but who liked me as more than a friend changed his status that he's dating someone and I'm happy for him. He deserves it. At the time he showed interest, I was closed off and didn't even realise I was until he showed interest. And it was only after him that I actually put myself out there. While he may not have been for me, he did mean something to me. Our connection, while lighthearted, was needed and I think that's why there's fondness because I felt comfortable with him.

I felt a bit sad though, probably because I'm ready for love. Maybe this just bought that up, as he was someone who genuinely liked me for me and pulled me out of my haze. And because he was a good guy and online dating can feel like a straight to bed thing.

I really liked a guy a couple months ago, went on a few promising dates and then he ghosted me, probably because we didn't have sex. But it still makes me feel a bit down sometimes. It would be easier if he was a complete ass, but I did get some genuineness there otherwise we wouldn't have made 3 dates. He was tired of waiting or maybe doubted my attraction for him, whatever. You live, you learn, I know.

It's weird, I'm early twenties, never been in a relationship and don't need one. But I'd like one. I have that self-awareness and I know I'm ready. I know, fill up your own cup and it's something I haven't been doing enough of late.

I am resonably attractive -- I am fit, I work out, got a real good job in finance and a masters degree AND several fun hobbies (like Reddit and data analysis lol).   
However, I am a racial minority (South Asian) in an European city -- conclude what you must from it.

**SO LET'S DIVE IN!!**

***(PS Raw umbers in the end)***

* **Swipe rate** :: So we start with the most interesting part -- how many folks I swiped right on. Here is the broad raw data,   
swipes\_likes Total: 592 Daily Max: 92 Dates with Maximum swipes\_likes: \[('2021-07-25', 92)\]   swipes\_passes Total: 4732 Daily Max: 1352 Dates with Maximum swipes\_passes: \[('2021-07-25', 1352)\]   
So the red line represents the swipe passes and the red one the swipe likes. And the black dots are the swipe percentages (so for the first day.. I had \~ 6% swipe rate which is how you TEACH tinder the kind of profiles you want to be shown.) [Graph](https://imgur.com/a/7CeQlYu)  
[https://imgur.com/a/7CeQlYu](https://imgur.com/a/7CeQlYu)  
Learning: do NOT blindly swipe, then you'll be shown the kind of folks you are into!!
* **Match rate** :: Now that I think about it, this might be the most interesting! TBH I am a bit shocked, I expected the match rate to be a bit higher (haha, it was humbling NGL). Again, the raw data,  
**matches** Total: 320 Daily Max: 40 Dates with Maximum matches: \[('2021-07-26', 40)\]   
So a 30% match rate for the first day is slightly humbling but I just think, many folks do not necessarily check Tinder everyday, as you can see there are days with &gt; 100% match rate, meaning many folks matched with me AFTER the day I liked them. [Graph](https://imgur.com/a/HBLzAC2):  
[https://imgur.com/a/HBLzAC2](https://imgur.com/a/HBLzAC2)  
Learning: Getting 40 matches each day is STUPID, I am not gonna be able to chat wth everyone. My future strategy would be to swipe less and hold like n conversations per day (n&lt;=3) out of m matches (m&gt;=n) and stop swiping once m and n have been realised.
* **Messages exchaged** :: Not sure if this will interest anyone, but let's look at how much I talked on the app. So, I am a CLASSIC INTROVERT, and my texting game is FIRE! I am very sarcastic/funny and usually pretty responsive -- though I have a demanding job so it's not that frequent either.   
As you can see, pretty fucking responsive! [Graph](https://imgur.com/a/yuJtCaS):

**FIRST DATES:**

I went on 1 dinner and 3 coffee dates (yes I am SUPER picky and SUPER introverted ). I did not find any one super exciting so I told them I was not interested in a second date. I am friends with them though, nice guys as they were.

**FINAL THOUGHTS!**

Tinder is fucking Brutal! I am tired of the small talks and I am planning on taking a break. Might try out Bumble, let's see.

Really need advice.,"Date started us hugging and we both said to eachother you look great. We waited to be seated at dinner, and we were there for like 1.5. hours just talking and talking we couldn't stop stareing at each other and none of us went on our phones once. She told me some personal stuff and just what she enjoys.

She wanted to pay I said no no I got it, then she said ""please let me pay for the popcorn cuz you paid for dinner and tickets"" I said ok. We went to the movies and she got 1 large popcorn so we shared. During the movie we both laughed and she looked happy.

But this is where I messed up shouldn't have done this and regreat it, I tried to get close to her like a cuddle and she rejected It felt really awkward and think I ruined it.

But then when went back to having fun and laughing with me, I asked we should hangout Sunday again she agreed and shel have to see cuz work. Her dad and mom could not pick her up she said ""il take an Uber"" I said ""maybe it's better if I brought you home"" because it was 12am.

68,p6475y,1629208287,Compassionate Dating,"Recently, I've seen some rather bizarre advice from people regarding approaches on day-to-day locations. These are my two cents, but yeah:

Approaching people during their regular lives is not only okay, it's also encouraged. As long as you remain respectful and kind to the other person, what is the problem here? Should people walk on eggshells all day just to avoid the most instinctual desire they have? Of course not, this is ridiculous! 

If you get rejected, just smile and walk away. End of story. It's not anyone's fault, neither yours nor the person you approached. It's just a part of life. There are no formulas for attraction.

Regarding the approach itself - just be a normal person about it; don't walk in on someone during a phonecall, don't be rude, sexist or willfully ignorant, and you're good. That's the only requirement to approach people: be compassionate. 

As long as you date with compassion and your intentions are good, you are just being a human being who wants to meet a partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6475y/compassionate_dating/
69,p649j5,1629208511,Stop putting your kinks and fetishes on your dating profiles.,"There’s plenty of KINK apps you can go on if you wanna flaunt your kinky side out in the open to find like minded kinky people right off the bat. Putting it in your profile on normal dating apps is just off putting. I say this as someone who’s non-vanilla myself. It’s hard to explain, but it just comes off the wrong way and feels weird. 

There’s always time to talk about sex and what you like and don’t like etc once you get to that point.

I’ve encountered profiles who openly explain how kinky they are, being kink positive, mentioning specific fetishes (both common and not as common), and just the other day I saw a very cute man, I looked through his pictures to see that he had a picture of ALL of his BDSM equipment… Then in his bio he says he’s a hopeless romantic. Yeah, nothing screams romantic more than chains, whips and ball gags right on your profile 🤣 

I’ve seen this on tinder, bumble, Hinge and OkCupid… 

Just go to a dating app that’s specifically for searching for kinks. Otherwise just keep it off your profile and gradually get into it once your start getting to know someone. If not then you’re gonna end up scaring off a good number of people, even if they’re kinky themselves. 

Btw, the guy who put the BDSM pics on his profile also mentioned his huge fascination with serial killers, and even tho I’m a fan of true crime myself, seeing those things together the way they were presented just gave me bad vibes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p649j5/stop_putting_your_kinks_and_fetishes_on_your/

77,p64rwk,1629210136,"Men’s advice. If you want to be more than just a friend, then stop acting like her friend on dates. Don’t be ashamed of being sexual","Have you ever gone on a date with someone, and you seemingly had great chemistry, the conversation flowed, you both laughed, she even mentioned during or after the date that’s he had a great time. Then inexplicably, a few days later, she becomes less responsive, and finally you get the “I have to be honest” text. She says she thinks you’re a great guy, but she didn’t feel any chemistry and she hopes you can be friends.

Most guys are utterly confused by this, but if they were grounded in reality and observant, they would have seen it coming.

Having a good time and getting along doesn’t translate into romantic feelings. She saw you as a friend because you acted like one. You were too agreeable, you didn’t look at her with desire, you didn’t playfully tease her, you didn’t use subtle touch around her. You muted your sexual energy around her for the sake of being polite.

This is a common theme of the Nice Guy. They are ashamed of their masculine sexuality, and believe that acting in an asexual manner is what will win a woman’s respect, that is what society has conditioned him to believe.

What he fails to understand is that being sexual and being respectful are mutually exclusive. Being lustful is where things become unbalanced, inappropriate comments are made, her personal space is invaded before you build comfort.

Even in the early stages of getting to know her, act more like her boyfriend than her friend. If you haven’t kissed, hooked up or had sex by the second or third date, unless she has a religious or spiritual reason to remain celibate, you are on a direct path to Friendville. Lack of touch or physical intimacy is the biggest indicator of lack of romantic interest or improper calibrated escalation.

A romantic relationship is friendship with the added element of sexuality and sexual attraction. Keep this in mind when you’re dating and feel a sense of shame for your desire.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p64rwk/mens_advice_if_you_want_to_be_more_than_just_a/
78,p64t4i,1629210242,I keep getting rejected for being ‘high maintenance’…help!,"I’m 29F trying to find the man I could marry and have a family with, and getting lots of dates from dating apps but none are working out. 

The feedback from the past two guys have been that they think I’m attractive and a good communicator, but that I’m too high maintenance when it comes to my appearance and it was a dealbreaker for them. I’ve heard this in the past too, but I honestly did not think this was an issue for so many men…I kind of thought that men like a woman who takes care of herself?

I am a bit meticulous with my appearance, and I always have my hair highlighted, nails done, workout every day, love to play around with makeup and dress up. I don’t always look so ‘done up’ but typically for dates I will dress to impress (typically designer clothes/bag/heels), hair curled, and more glam makeup. Is this the wrong approach? Maybe I should actually dress down on dates? I do own 30+ pairs of shoes, lots of designer clothes, have a lot of beauty products, and get subtle fillers to prevent aging so maybe I would get dumped once they found that out anyway…

I work in finance and make 140k a year, so I spend well within my means and I get all my designer clothes/shoes at sample sales. I think my dates are aware of this because they know what I do for a living, but maybe they don’t realize I earn as much as I do and think I’m spending beyond my means or that I’m an impractical person? Or that somehow it reflects on my character. 

I’m actually a huge homebody, grew up in an academic family, and have more traditional values, so the men I’m going for are more traditional, academic, and not like the ‘flashy’ types I used to go for. 

How can I compromise so that I can find a man like this? Does anyone have any advice?

I tried my best not to develop feelings but I did. However,  I would never let my feelings with her compromise our friendship and she has had plenty of opportunity to like me as we hang out alone a lot. So I am in a certain level of pain over it. I get super depressed after we hang out. She always mentions this one guy who straight up isnt interested in her and I have such a hard time hiding my disappointment. The worst part is, I also believe the only reason she isn't into me is looks alone as the other guys she is into are basically tan, hairless, fit dudes and I am more nerdy white guy with a  fuller frame. And that is ok. This post is not to shit on her, everyone deserves their preferences and she is hotter than most girls and deserves a guy who is the same. I'd never tell her my love for her because our friendship is too great but fuck it hurts.   


I just want to know how to get over her. Should I maybe take a break from talking to her and say I'm busy? Has anyone come out of this feeling better? I just need some advice I guess.

85,p65x56,1629213622,Is sex really that important?,This has probably been asked before. You probably thought going into this that I am female but I am M29. My ex and I broke up cuz she apparently couldn’t go more than a week or two without sex or her mental state started to deteriorate. She said as much many times but I suppose it was rather evident too. This was basically the central reason our relationship ended. Or so she said after cheating on me with several people and lying to me about it. My opinion on it is something like this: I absolutely love cheesecake. It’s probably my favorite dessert. But if I don’t need to have cheesecake or even dessert every day of the week. Or once a week. Or even once a month. I feel the same about sex. The way I see it if you truly love someone then sex is secondary or even tertiary in terms of priorities in the relationship. Yes it’s nice but it’s not so nice that I’d throw away a decade-long marriage-oriented relationship for it. To me that incessant need for sex translates to like insecurity and honestly when it’s overly-present it shows a lack of love to me because you’re putting your own desires above the desires of your partner. Yes it’s flattering to be wanted like that but to me it’s not necessary for long term love. If I’m secure in the relationship and I know I’m loved then sex is like dessert. If you’re building together then it’s really just a treat and the team-effort goals take precedent. Idk it’s just my thoughts. Interested to get input.

She is a French au pair and we met on Tinder. I first took her out to the national gallery, where we quickly got bored of it and jointly decided to skip ahead to the wine by the river thames. We then walked by the river and were headed towards Westminster bridge, that is where after a few successful jokes, I took her hand and asked with a jesting tone, if we should be extra romantic and cross the bridge whilst she held my arm. She grabbed my arm, but then half way across, jerked her arm away and aggressively asked for the wine. Later, on her own initiative, after a very intimate make out session and confiding, she then, walking back,  took my arm again, but after 5-8min, jerked it away again due to the reason that I am just not made for her holding my arm. I laughed somewhat awkwardly and tried to divert the conversation to another topic.

Surprisingly, we met again and had great sex for hours. After a few days, the night was repeated, but on this occasion she dressed accordingly: easy take off blouse, easy to take off skirt and all red lingerie. The sex was just as or even better than the first. I proposed, 3 days later, to go out clubbing, since she showed interest for it when I proposed a night as such to her, when met up for the 3rd time. She agreed and again, unexpectedly was willing to meet up and drink at my french friend's house - unexpectedly because (without committing treason to her) she used to be horrified of talking to strangers.

The club was amazing and we took some pictures together that would rival any highly acclaimed romance movie. We met up for the last time, the immediate day after, we had sex for the one last time as I leave for a 1 week trip to Germany for a family reason, and she will leave, on the weekend of my return, for France (her home). Again, the sex was incredible (incroyable). However, after I was done - she told me that she will leave, but that she wants to have a cigarette with me before she does so. I agreed but jestingly protested that I felt used because she will leave me so quick and coldly. Thereof, she was almost outraged and asked me what makes me think of such a thing. I replied with, that I had said a joke, which contained a tiny bit of truth in it. I reiterated the point after she prompted me by asking her question again. We had our cigarette and afterwards she started wearing her clothes.

So I left her at my house door and we kissed and said our au revoirs for the last one time.

Well, so here I am, 90min after she had left, writing this Reddit post.

Give me your opinions, and let me indulge in your entertaining replies.

UPDATE: repost from a another sub posted in last week. She is now back in France and replied to my good by message, which I sent her one day before she flew back. Her reply mentioned that I should inform her if I travel to France or Berlin anytime soon.

90,p66t41,1629216251,Is being pale off-putting?,"Hey all. I am a 23M guy, never had a gf and tried myself at dating. I am 6'2'' and have been going to the gym for 1.5 years 6 days a week now. I am not that huge, since my size disperses the muscle pretty evenly. But anyway, I notice that when I am on dates or even at the workplace that women there are feeling sort of weirded out or intimidated. Even if I try being nice. And I honestly don't know what it could be anymore. I work an office job, so I don't get much sun and don't have much time outside of work and gym and cooking. And since I work with a lot of computers I have slightly dark eye rings, which is natural and I can't get away completely. Or maybe I am just ugly :(. Anyway, would any of you gals feel offput when you dated a relatively big very pale guy?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p66t41/is_being_pale_offputting/

92,p67167,1629216902,Commitment issues,"I‘ve always dreamed of falling in love head over heels, experiencing that kind of love you read about in books or your friends or family members simply tell you about.

But, newsflash: I have commitment issues and I feel like my fear of commitment is keeping me from falling in love or ever entering a relationship.

(I‘m not a native english speaker, sorry for any spelling and grammar mistakes!) 

I‘m female, 18 years old and I‘ve never been in a relationship. I have tried tho. I had turned 16 when I started dating for the first time. It didn‘t end well, since I panicked as soon as it felt like we were leaving that casual stage and told him we weren‘t gonna work. 

Last year in October, when I turned 18, that‘s when I got asked out again. Honestly, personality-wise, he was amazing. We got perfectly along with eo and shared many different interests and hobbys. But I panicked as soon as he kissed me and wasn‘t able to show affection even tho I felt like there was more than just friendship from my side. (I didn‘t know back then about my commitment issues)
But I felt like I was being suffocated. In hindsight, I now know that I needed distance. 
We met up and even before he left, he’d already ask me about the next time he‘d see me again.
„Are you free tomorrow, on Friday?“ and If wasn‘t, he‘d ask about Saturday and then Sunday. Back then, If I had known about my commitment issues, I would have told him to give me some space and time. 
Long story short, at some point something triggered me and I broke down crying, telling him I can‘t do this and that I didn‘t think we would work. I desperately needed distance. I didn‘t want him to touch or kiss me and I felt absolutely no attraction towards him anymore. 

Now, almost a year later, I met a guy at a birtday. He asked me if I wanted to dance and was super sweet. I did even feel some butterflies in my stomach. 
We met up twice and I can already feel the panic rise inside of me. 
I feel comfortable around him and really enjoy spending time with him. He makes me laugh and is in general a really sweet guy. 
I wanna try it, I really wanna try to open myself up and not be afraid of getting hurt or of change. But how am I supposed to deal with my commitment issues? I have no idea how to overcome them.
Especially because I feel like those issues kinda „block me“, so as soon as something triggers my commitment issues, I loose all interest.
It feels like I‘m desperately trying to keep a door from shutting down. 

I honestly don‘t know what to do. I like him, kinda, but maybe not? Maybe I‘m simply trying to convince myself of liking him, so I can prove to myself that I am in fact capable of feeling romantic love. Maybe exactly that is another excuse for me to NOT like him.
I‘m a mess and totally clueless. I don‘t want to hurt him. 
Part of me wants to try and go ahead, face my fears and see what‘s coming. The other part of me though, just wants to delete his number and hide, so I don‘t have to deal with my chaotic brain and him.

I‘m sorry that post turned out so chaotic and long. I just wanted to get rid of a few things and maybe look out for some advice? Maybe there‘s someone out there who‘s been in a similar situation.

93,p67kb9,1629218457,Online,"Seems to me every post on social media/reddit I see referencing dating… people are meeting online thru apps. Maybe it’s partly generational (I’m 21), but has dating essentially moved entirely online? I don’t really hear of people meeting in other ways anymore. Funnily enough, some of the most common “dating advice” I hear given to men is to ditch online dating because it’s “not real” and bad for confidence, but seriously, seems like that’s the way it’s done nowadays. Kinda hard to go against the grain and stop using the most common method, especially if you’re gonna get labeled a creep otherwise.

94,p67nn2,1629218752,How do you make dating work when you have a schedule that requires you to get up at dawn?,"I have a tendency toward insomnia, and I find that keeping a regular sleep schedule helps me get adequate sleep. However, I have to get up at the crack of dawn due to school, and that means that to be well-rested I need to go to bed at about 9:30pm the latest. 

How can I keep insomnia at bay, get the sleep I need, attend school, and date?

My sense is that most people expect you to be available late at night when dating you. I honestly just can't do that with my current life circumstances.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p67nn2/how_do_you_make_dating_work_when_you_have_a/
95,p67r7d,1629219085,I have No idea where to meet women (19M),"So I finished school and I have no idea where to meet women. Ive never been in a proper relationship (almost feel like a bit of a virgin) I’m not active on either Instagram or tinder because I believe it isn’t an ideal platform to naturally find a relationship. I’m extremely active (going to military training soon) and I look decently good so I don’t think that’s the problem. I’ve never been worried about getting into a relationship since a lot of women compliments me about my sense of humor and friendly approach. but I feel like I have to pursue it soon since I’m almost 20 and i Think it’s a red flag not to have any experience at that age.

96,p67s9l,1629219183,Am i just too boring to be intresting?,"I (25m) have struggled really much with the dating apps(1-2 matched per month at most). I would try my luck irl but not only am i shy and self conscious about my appearance but i am also introverted and highly against alcohol. 
I prefer just being home on the evening just gaming or watching movies.
The problem is i feel like there is nothing you can do irl that doesnt revolve around alcohol and getting drunk, its like drinking is the only reason people go to parties or other activities. 
If i do happen to go out everyone will try to pressure me to drink and will tell me im ”boring” when i refuse. 
Later when the activities are over i will end up driving my drunk friends/family home since im the only one sober. 
Im just sick of it

99,p684x0,1629220439,How do you figure out what you're doing wrong?,"We've all heard this little bit of wisdom:

""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.""

I feel like that describes my dating life. I've been single for 2.5 years now and, while I have learned to be content with being single, I'm frustrated that I can't seem to get anyone to stick around for a long term relationship.

I get plenty of dates and don't have much trouble getting laid. Sometimes people will stick around for several dates (like a month or two) and I've ended up in a few FWB situations. But anytime I try to move things towards a relationship, women dip out. I just can't figure out why that keeps happening or what I'm doing wrong.

I'm a 32M and, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think I'm a pretty good catch.

* I have a great career and making pretty decent money.
* I've done some kind of impressive things, such has having published books.
* I'm not super handsome, but I think I'm pretty decent looking.
* I'm not ripped, but I'm not in bad shape either. I also have tons of tattoos, which the women I date say that they think are sexy.
* I have a clean, tidy, decorated apartment.
* I have a lovable dog.
* I have a newish, nice car.
* I have hobbies and friends (though I don't spend as much time with friends as I would like).
* I *think* I'm good-natured and have a good sense of humor.
* I *think* I treat women well.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong or why I'm not ""enough."" Am I attracting the wrong kinds of people? How do I figure out if I am? If there is something I should do differently, how do I figure out what that is?

Obviously nobody ever gives a real answer when they decide to call things quits. And I don't feel like my friends can provide any real wisdom.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p684x0/how_do_you_figure_out_what_youre_doing_wrong/
