So recently I(22M) have been trying to get more decent dates and more successful relationships than I have been doing before. Basically, I went on a date with someone I met on a dating app. The date was okay, we went to the cinema and kissed but there was simply no spark and no chemistry, especially on my end (mostly because she was so shy) but I enjoyed the date anyways!

So it was almost midnight and I took the metro and I noticed that girl in front of me had a piece of paper on the back of her jacket. I told her that, she smiled and said that she knows.

I switched lanes and took another metro and there she is again sitting. She told me by her hands to come to sit next to her and I did. Then I started thinking, hold on, she is around my age and we had this random funny story, why not ask her out. Even my headphones just turned off (battery died). I was like oki that's the ultimate sign but I ended up just sitting there until we reached my stop and she said bye.

Now 30 minutes later, I'm writing this post. I honestly don't know why I didn't ask her out or get her number, probably because of the mask or the headphones. I'm usually confident but this kinda caught me off guard.

Long time listener first time caller.

I (28M), like many of you on this forum, am having trouble dating. I've spent the last year single and the last two years in therapy. While this has been ultimately healthy, I love myself most days and am comfortable alone, I have a deep driving desire to experience profound and fully-expressed love again.

I am considered very successful among my friend groups and family. I know my value and worth. There are times where I'm approached and get dates and attention from women with little to no effort. But, there are times where I really struggle with self-confidence and mental presence.

I was sexually assaulted by another man recently. I'm totally fine and safe, and all things considered, I am lucky with how things played out. Now, I am hyper-sensitive to how I may come across to women I do not know personally. My fear is to be seen as a pushy creep. I'm jumpy around certain men. I think this can be especially apparent if I am not present in the moment or thought looping in my own head.

I don't know how to open up and meet people and come across as genuine in social situations - it often feels forced to talk to other people outside of my group. I feel I need a very obvious social cue or a friend with me before I can open up to a new woman or other individual. I feel I have a healthy view towards rejection ""on paper"", but I still fear it and would rather not face it.

Almost paradoxically, I am a musician and sometimes have the privilege of meeting and playing for hundreds of people at once, and exude confidence in these situations. While generally reserved, if I am comfortable I can ""run a room"". Today, I made the whole dentist office laugh and it felt incredible. The receptionist had earlier confided that she felt she had known me for years although we had only talked a few times on the phone. In stark contrast, not one hour earlier I narrowly escaped death by awkwardness holding the door open for an exceptionally pretty lady. I always hold the door open for anyone if I can. It's frustrating to feel awkward, and it doesn't feel good to unconsciously pedestalize someone even for a second.

I know it will take time, and I'm probably not in the best position to be meeting anyone before I work through some trauma, but I'm excited to meet someone special and begin the next stage of life with. I live in a large city with plenty of opportunity but I'm paralyzed by fear. I feel my best chance at love involves me taking chances, making friends out in the wild, and getting incredibly lucky with meeting someone special, and all of this requires a lot of work and energy.

My ultimate questions are - how can I get over my fears? Is it really as simple as letting go and facing them? How can I be present and manage overthinking or having anxious thought loops? Why am I like this?

TL;DR Conventionally successful and reasonably good-looking man has self-confidence issues with making the first social move due to fears of either being rejected or being seen as a creep. Looking for an action plan to improve this aspect of my life.

I've been working with a therapist to notice my anxious patterns, which include but are not limited to:

* becoming alarmed when my date doesn't immediately respond to a text
* feeling like I need to overcompensate to win the affection of my date
* finding reasons why the person might reject me or think I'm unworthy
* worried when we're apart that she will, inevitably, abandon me
* getting on dating apps even when I really like someone because I'm anticipating the abandonment

And, then, there's my 'meta-pattern': getting upset with myself when I notice myself falling back on these patterns, for wondering why I can't be 'secure' and cultivate healthy, generous thoughts about the other person.

Personally, I come from thinking abt an old flame of mine whom I dated briefly.  He was around 4 months out of a relationship when we met.  At the time he seemed to display a genuine attraction to me, was consistent in maintaining daily contact/touch with me, and was chatty when we met up.  Now I knew about his breakup at the time, and we both have a “go with the flow”/no expectations mindset towards dating in general.  Anyways I learned very recently (we are kind of on friendly terms) that he used to miss his ex sometimes.  And he described the feelings he had for her back then as “not messing with (him) too much but still lingered a bit” (especially when I mentioned him seeming like in an overall healthy headspace because he wasn’t emotionally unavailable) which makes me wonder what he was feeling towards me in terms  of baseline interest at the time back then.

In every single area, I fail no matter what advice I take. I never really find anyone who I really get along with to begin with or click with that much when I get to know them. It is already hard enough on that end due to the autism and me being transgender isn't helping either. I think for the time being, I am going to quit the whole dating thing to figure myself out some more and for friends, I am largely going to be more reserved. For the future, I am not sure. But, I am thinking of having a new type of relationship I can have for a person to meet that is closer than a friend the same way as romance, but also isn't romance. I am keeping my old friends for sure and might keep up with them sometime down the line, but I am also not going to exactly be entirely active in really getting to know new people and I don't know how long I will be doing this for or when I might reconnect with old friends. I am 22 years old and I know time isn't exactly on my side here. If I end up having a child down the line at some point and I absolutely cannot find a woman, then I am just going to pay a surrogate mother to have mine. I also realized that what I have been trying to do online when trying to do my female persona has also somewhat made me appear to act as a person different from the personality that I know myself for. I suddenly care about whether people hate me or not and it isn't something that I should be doing. Hence, also causing me to go down becoming a people pleaser and all these different personas that do not even represent myself.

In this way of thinking and my mention of a new type of relationship, I think that the types of friendships and relationships that we have today probably do not fit what is suitable for my type of lifestyle. Hence, causing me to rethink if dating and friendships are right for me at all. Maybe I am better off just being completely by myself. I just don't know.

This situation has caused a major shift in the way we look for relationships (Online vs IRL) , maintain/handle relationships and overall hunt. As someone who already struggled with the game (pre-pandemic), I was wondering what innovative strategies I can implement to improve my dating skills and odds in this current dating climate. What can I do to increase my current success rate of 12.5%

Some basic pieces of information so there is something for you guys to work off of.

(M) 20YR

Student (Psychology Major, Econ Minor)

Waiter (Part Time)

**Topics of interest:** Philosophy, Economics, Politics, Psychology, Investments, General trivia, Anime/Manga (There is more but this should be enough)

**Hobbies:** Gaming (Online or Board), Badminton, Skateboarding, Bike rides (Casual), Working out (infrequent)

**Pet Peeves:** Individuals who are not punctual, Close minded, Overly sensitive (Basically any ""KAREN"")

**Strength and weaknesses:**

Analytical: My current self, is one that quite adept at analyzing situations and words that it has become a double edge sword for myself. When having conversation I found myself looking to deeply into a casual conversation. Sometime that conversation only needs to be surface level. However, if you look at the other side of the coin, my analytical skills have granted me with the ability to provide a multi-perspective opinion and logical solution to both conversation and dilemmas.

Honest: Now when you see this you would think strength, nope. While honestly is inherently a strength, I find my self sometimes being to blunt, too honest. Sometime the situation calls for the blunt truth but other times it doesn't. Now this does not mean I have no self control, it just means there are times where my mouth is faster than my brain and the words aren't filtered properly. The reasoning for the blunt honesty is the fact that I (1) hate sugarcoating (when not necessary) and (2) it comes natural to me. 

Empathy: Again this one of those situational things. At times I can be extremely empathetic, but other times, when I feel like a situation or event is not really all that, the empathy disappears. To clarify its not like I can't empathize in those situations it just that my natural response is to slowly give less of shit. Again situational and somewhat mood dependent.

Logical: This one is similar to the empathy and analytical situation. There are times where emotion play a greater role and vice versa but for some reason my leans quite heavily in the logical thinking department and less with emotional logic. Again 2 sides to the coin, sometimes it works out for me, and sometimes I mess up.

**Catching signals and signs: Secondary question**

What to look for (Body language, Vocal tones, Eye movement, etc)?

But recently, some problems started between us and I am not sure what to do. 

When we started, she was really understanding, I could talk to her about anything. She was in some toxic relationships before that, so at first, she was confused and doubtful, whenever I answered her honestly or when I did anything nice, but she appreciated it. I liked how we communicated. 

Now I finished high school last year, I'm at uni this year, while she's still at high school. We are from different towns, so we can only see each other during the weekend. I don't have a lot of friends in the city where I study, one guy and one girl from my HS class. I once went for a walk with this girl at 11pm and once, she suggested if I wanted to go on a seminar about abortion.

My gf hates whenever I go out with the girl, she doesn't even know her, but when I try to explain to her that the ex schoolmate is really nice, she starts either crying or just acts like she doesn't care. I have another female friend, 3 years older than me, and her bf, who she also hates for some odd reason. She constantly says she missed me, and makes a big deal if I want a weekend on my own. Basically I haven't had a weekend on my own since october.

She also has toxic responses whenever I don't agree with her. For example, she suggested I go with her family on vacations next week, but I have some necessary classes, a training, and I'm supposed to see a friend. And she made a big deal about how I don't care about her and that I find a training more important than her.

 What do you suggest I do?

I am interested in a girl in my university, she is 19 or 18 and I am 18 (in a lot of advice forums like this, people ask me to tell them my age, something like ""context is everything""), we are both computer science students, we are not in the same class but we often meet. All we did in the past is saying hello to one another or have small talk about studies, nothing special.

But I really wanna get to know her and I don't know about what I should talk. So next time I see her, I decided to go and just talk about what blew my mind this weekend, it is kind of a scientific fact and it goes like this, in 2005, the developers of a video game, The world of warcraft, tried to make a hard level for experienced players; and this level had a boss that could inflict a disease on the players who fight him, but what made this special is that this disease could be transmitted among players, and because of a bug it spread amid all the players and the first virtual pandemic began, what makes this interesting is that the action of the players in the game was very similar to that of real people in real life and many researchers suggested to study pandemics through online video games. It is a truly fascinating story (and much more complicated that what I wrote here). 

I do not want to go and just invite her to a coffee or something like that, she is attractive and I've seen a lot of boys trying to talk to her, I do not want to be like them, I wanna make a good impression.

I've been dating this individual for not too big of a significant period of time to the extent that we are now in a relationship, since we'd known one another for a long time before this, and this matter at hand, has happened on three separate occasions.

What had happened is that, whenever I would ask this individual to do something, whether it be going out on a date or going to visit some place together, or even spending time together on a certain day/time, the SO's response would be something along the lines of: ""Yeah, let's do this on (the said proposed) date!"" or, ""Sure thing, we are doing this (the said proposed) date!"", ""I'm game, let's do this! on (the said proposed) date"".
And when the said date arrives - they're claiming that I was pressuring them into doing so... like... why would you agree to doing something without any hesitation or objections, and when it is time - claiming that I'm pressuring them? My instant response to them claiming I'm pressuring them - I'd show them the texts/messages to them agreeing to do so without any hesitation or objections, and then it would lead to them crying and I can't seem to getting through to them, or they no longer want to talk about it. Which led to me not being forceful or passive aggressive into making them talk about it the first time.

As in, I understand if they were to cancel a day before, or even an hour before the planned date/time, but that wasn't the case here at all. 

The first time I let it go, 
They seemed chill and didn't seem like they have anxiety or self consciousness about anything with regards to us spending so much time together and being in a relationship now,
So as soon as it happened again - I asked them as to whether it is because they have anxiety, or is it something I've done that makes them uncomfortable - and they said I haven't done anything wrong, nor do they have anxiety whilst going out with me... and my response to this was, that it's happened 2 times now, so please let me know if you're going to cancel or not be willing to do something after having agreed to do so with me - BEFORE the said day/timeperiod arrives, and they agreed to this. But same result, they're crying again and don't want to talk about it at the same time... Yet, this time (the 2nd time) - they agreed to at least let me know in advance if they're not gonna be able to make it on the said day/time.
But it happened for the third time now... and then I expressed my feelings about how I feel as though that I'm upset about this happening for the third time, without any seemingly rhyme or reason, other than not wanting to talk about this matter at hand properly and letting them know that I wouldn't take any offence to them saying 'no' or not wanting to go out on the said day/time, but they have to let me know first, or else I'm expecting them to be with me on the said time/day, and they just aren't letting me know that they're not gonna be able to do so at all.
And they started crying again, as soon as i brought this up, and i feel as though this is kind of problematic towards the communication skills... and no matter how badly I try, I can't seem to be getting through to them at all? Or they willingly don't want to talk about it or own up to it, which just feels like misleading to me in the sense that they let me hear exactly what I want, but when the said time arrives, they claim that I'm pressuring them into doing so, even though they've literally agreed to do so and I show them that, and then as usual - they start crying again.

Hey respective Redditors, I need your opinion on something.
I've been dating this individual for a significant period of time, and we just progressed into being in a committed relationship a month ago. I'd known them for years before we started dating, they and I have the same hobbies/common likeliness towards things such as anime/Metal music and things along the lines of that, so making conversation isn't difficult at all (for context) and this matter at hand that I'm about to discuss, has happened on three separate occasions.

At first I was quite adamant about my personal space and time, and he was definitely the one texting in the day, pursuing conversation and asking endless questions.

After our third date his texting got slightly spaced and he wasn't engaging in conversation as passionately as before. On occasion we still had long talks over text or via voice notes but this got rarer. I have been very clear with him that I like him and want to spend time with him.

He then took a 5-day trip to another city and essentially we spoke maybe once or twice during that entire week, him not responding to my messages and not really initiating conversation. I sort of called him out on this and said I'd appreciate some clarity. To which he replied that there is a possibility that he might be moving to England (we are based in Scotland) for a temporary job and doesn't want to be unfair towards me. As we are having this conversation he is telling me how incredible I am and how much he likes me and is acting and seeming very flustered. Then he starts kissing me and we eventually have sex (beside the point, but helpful to point out that he seems very much into me but acts distant when not physically together). I told him I understand he is busy at work and dont expect constant texting, but would appreciate communication and he said he will make an effort to better communicate expectations and availability. He then asked me out on another date this weekend.

It has been 4 days after we had this talk and I am getting spaced answers again or no answers. Very confused and not sure how to proceed.

He was obsessed with pornography and sending nudes between him and his friends which was very frustrating for me as I found this to be rude considering he's in a relationship and my previous relationship was destroyed by this same problem but worse in the past (he could not be intimate due to pornography issues). He was aware of this concern on my end and assured me that he would not watch porn or share nudes with his friends anymore, however after catching a glimpse of a few things here and there and catching him watching porn in our apartment together, I was pissed.

I’m a Christian, I’m 29F, Him 34M. Now I got sick last year and I met a Doctor and we became friends he supported me throughout my illness and we actually became close friends. I was not apart of a church at the time so he invited me to his church and I’ve been going ever since. I’m also contributing more to church life in terms of being called upon to do things. Now, I realize he liked me because his actions says it but he didn’t come out and say it in words. Now I went home back in December and I spoke to my sister about him and I told her that I like him and she said that “it’s ok to tell someone that you like them” just to know where u stand. Anyways, I sent him a simple text that says “I like u more than friends”. He was very polite about it and said he started dating someone a few days ago. We remained good friends and we kinda just both moved on. Anyways, there’s this girl at church who I suspected liked him also and I figured maybe she’s the one he’s dating because to me it was obvious. I never asked him because i don’t want to be intrusive. We all do Bible study together 2 times per week and I have been very cool with the girl also. We have plans to hang out for games at my house and outings in a couple of weeks. In total it’s a group of 4. Now, he still been giving me compliments here and there and we actually have become very very good friends now. Now like 2 weeks ago he said he wanted to tell me that he’s dating the young lady but he hasn’t told anyone as yet because he doesn’t wants to be scrutinized by the church (his family goes to the same church). Well I already knew this so it wasn’t surprising. So I gave him my wishes. The problem now is; I feel like the friendship has gone too far. He had disclosed to the young lady about what  I told him in dec. I told him I was disappointed in that regards because it was said in confidence. He said the only reason he disclosed it, it’s because she asked and he didn’t want to lie, fine, I moved past that. That was about 2 weeks ago, this week he invited me out to hang out with his sister that’s visiting and his mom. We had so much fun and I just don’t think I can maintain a friendship with him anymore. I just feel like cutting ties with everyone because I just don’t want to be in no drama. The person he is dating knew that I was on the trip with him. His family really likes me and because we went to my town where I grew up, I took him to meet my mom. I just don’t know how to continue this friendship, I feel like cutting ties because the line between friends and him liking me otherwise is so thin. What would u do 😪. Forgive my typos, but would love to hear ur feedback. Also he text the next day after the trip and asked how was I doing and he said “your presence made it more enjoyable “ like what!!

Back when I lived with my family in my hometown, I only got into long term committed relationships that never introduced me to this dark side of dating world. Now that I'm single for the past 6 months, every month had been occupied by a dude like this. I am very fed up and the post will be long and rambly. 

I don't say this to brag or anything like that, but I'm a young, attractive woman, I have no problem with having people attracted to me, receive compliments from people often, I believe I'm a good person, I don't judge, act clingy, jealous or controlling, but I have this curse of getting into situations with men who don't want to commit. They were all people who I knew irl, I don't use online dating nowadays. It's getting very frustrating and I don't know if I'm faulty in any of them.

First guy for example, was an acquaintance I met at a party, after crashing at his flat at an after-party, we got close, he would text me all the time, ask to see me, people knew we were seeing each other and were very supportive of that. He started calling me things like dear, babe etc. then after a couple of days started avoiding me. Only after I confronted him he told me that he didn't want to get into a relationship. He was the one who made a move on me first.

Second one was in my social circle and I still see him from time to time. He asked me on dates, we traveled and hitchhiked together, I would stay at his place a couple times a week, then suddenly he goes cold as well. Even to full on avoiding acknowledging my existence when we were at the same place. I confront him, he says it's too early to say anything. One morning he just leaves me on the bed without saying anything. This dissolved whatever feelings I had for him yet he still sends me a ""are you free after work?"" text like once a month.

Third guy was a friend. He starts asking me out, talks to me all the time, we get very emotional without anything sexual happening between us. After a month of gushing about each other over text, I officially confess my feelings and want to see if he wants to be in a relationship, because even at that point I am very over with dating people and they never commit to me. He says he is busy, asks me to wait, he wants to be in a relationship but not now. Another 2 months and a lot of overthinking and pain later, it never progresses to anything. I stop having the same interest as before, he comes to talk to me but after laying it all out, he says he doesn't see a point in acting romantic and can't give me what I need in a relationship. 3 months wasted.

The most recent one happened last night, which really fucked me up emotionally this time. He was a good friend of mine, we almost saw each other everyday. After a night of drinking with friends, we kiss each other for the first time and fall asleep cuddling. After that for 3 weeks, we continued seeing each other, act very affectionate and romantic. He confessed having feelings for me for some time but didn't think anything could ever happen with me. I say I don't just want a hookup and want more after he said that he had a crush on me. But surprise surprise he wants to stop what we are doing. Apologizes for making me feel like this and promises to talk to me later. We see each other everyday because he works nearby and I don't know how to proceed after this. I said that it was unfair to me that he made the move on me first just to drop me like this after I caught feelings for him, I hope whatever he got out of it was worth our friendship. Feeling very sad about this one.

I don't seem to understand why. Do they think like, hey, I know this girl, she is around all the time, she's kinda cute. Let me try my luck and see if she is willing to sleep with me?

I am a (23F) college student who started taking estrogen and living as a girl a year ago after living as a boy my whole life before this. I am lucky because at this point most strangers just see me as a normal girl so I don’t experience a lot of discrimination or anything from being trans. However more complex social situations can still be a little new to me and hard especially because I am autistic. I am new to dating since I got out of a almost 3 year relationship 6 months ago and this is my first time being single after coming out as trans. The last time I tried online dating I was 18 before transitioning and only got 2 matches and no real conversation. This time I get a lot more attention from men and matches come really cheap for me but I held out for a while until I got a message from a (21F) girl who is trans like me.

Both of us had lines about wanting someone to cuddle in our bio so she asked me if I wanted to and I obliged. We met up for coffee and talked about mainly school for a couple hours (we are in the same major) and then she asked me to come back to her apartment and we cuddled and watched tv for a while. At the end of the date we ended it with a kiss and started making plans for a second date. I was very happy after this since I really needed to cuddle with someone and it was my first experience after my last relationship ending.

After this date things started to get a little more complicated. When I was living as a guy it was rare to get attention and I never really seeked anyone out either. I have been in two long term relationships without going on dates with anyone else. In both cases I got clear indications from them that they wanted a relationship within one or two dates and they were both a little clingy and wanted me texting them constantly every day.

With this girl I didn’t really get a lot of contact in between and I am glad she is not clingy like my exes but I really hoped for some level of reciprocation. After a few days I told her I really liked her and wanted to spend some more time with her and asked her to dinner. I wanted to do something nice for her so the night before I baked cookies and packaged some of them up for her.

The next date is when I started to get disappointed. I came to the date prepared with questions to get her to open up a little more and she was not accepting the offer to. I started out by telling her I am autistic because she is going to find out at some point and she barely acknowledged what I said. She told me at one point she only knows 3 people from our school so I kind of got the feeling relationships are new to her. When I asked her about her relationship history she just said “not a lot” and didn’t take the chance to go into details. I asked her about online dating specifically and she said she has been on a few dates before me that were all disappointing. I am honestly not even sure she has had sexual experience because when we kissed she acted like it was something she wasn’t used to doing a lot. The last year has been really stressful for me because of coming out so I tried to get her to open up to me about transitioning and couldn’t get that many details from her. The main thing I know is that she hasn’t gotten hormones yet and is still living as a guy even though she is really pretty. I was disappointed because I thought these topics were going to lead to bigger conversations but because she didn’t take the chance to open up we ran out of things to talk about.

After dinner we went back to her apartment for a while and things went the same as before. We cuddled for a while then ended things with a kiss and ideas for a third date. I wasn’t sure what she wanted physically from me on the date so I gave her a chance to ask while we were cuddling by asking if there was anything else she wanted to do with me while I was there and she said no.

I tried to give her some time after this and after a few days asked for her availability again and haven’t heard back after a day. And since I am waiting there is nothing I can do except ask people for advice in this. I am worried I came on a little too strong and “girlfriend-y” by baking her cookies and stuff but like I said I am experienced in relationships but not casual dating. I really tried not to act clingy by messaging her all the time between dates but it was disappointing I was always the one having to reach out. When I tried to get her to open up she really came across as emotionally unavailable and overall it is just disappointing that it feels like I am the one putting most of the effort in for her. It feels to me like she is not used to this kind of situation and it is a bit overwhelming for her and she is shy so she is just withdrawing. In these kind of situations I think they could be resolved easily if we just talked but she is frankly closed off and not good at communicating. I am not sure what I should do from here but I want to keep trying with her mainly because I am so attracted to her and would rather date a trans girl like her than some random guy from tinder",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161645,public,self,stopped responding after two dates: transgender edition,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t16kfa/stopped_responding_after_two_dates_transgender/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Without fail, each time it has come up I have been immediately ghosted or blocked. Whether we have been talking/dating for four weeks or 5 months.

Last week we were supposed to meet. He suggested to meet on Wednesday for a coffee in a nearby cafe at 3.30 in the afternoon. He told me a couple of times that he was looking forward to talking irl and seeing each other.

On Wednesday I get this weird feeling, cause he has some trust issues (he told me). His tone in the message was different. But still he wanted to meet.
On Wednesday afternoon at 4pm, after waiting for half an hour, I get this text from him saying he’s busy horse riding and it got late. If I want to meet another day?
I responded very cool, ‘it’s ok, let me know when you want to meet’.
He never even read my message (WhatsApp) didn’t reply and blocked me on Instagram🤔

I noticed on that day she decided to not talk to me the entire night. 

Ever since we returned to classes she’s been sort of giving me the silent treatment. Never looking at me in the face. Only talking to me in the third person. Making it apparent that she’s going on first dates with other guys and making sure I know in a joking manner. 

Yet I never heard the words “no”. I even asked her if something was wrong and she told me no, and she got sort of defensive when I asked her. Whenever I reach out to her she ignores me though in person, and only talks to other friends around me. 

IMO the mature thing to do would be to just use our words and say we are not right for each other. I believe the silent treatment is sort of immature. 

Is there any other reason why a woman would do this? Should I keep trying to get closer to her, or does silent treatment mean a date is trying to say she is no longer interested?

It attracts me that someone can focus on what they want and pursue it.  Anyway the passionate men I attract end up having bad tempers.

Right now I am dating someone who puzzles me because apart from asking for dates they're not chasing me in any form i.e. dressing well, complimenting me, calling me, even kissing me.  I sometimes will double-text him i.e. he doesn't reply to a text with conversation so I'll text another with conversation later on.

So I'm thinking maybe he does want a relationship but doesn't want to chase me.  Can anyone tell me if they've dated a guy who is like this and if it works out?

She lives about 4 hours away and we see each other every couple of months or so. I have a couple of questions about this:

   1 - Should I wait to officially tell her how I feel in person, or stop procrastinating do it over the phone? I think it's more classy and impactful to do it in person, but I don't know when I'll see her next. I was actually hoping to do it yesterday when we were together, but there we too many people around and I didn't get my shot.  
   2 - **If** she feels the same way, how do you approach starting a mid-distance relationship? Is it possible to clearly transition from talking to dating to etc. over the phone? What counts as a ""date""? This just seems pretty blurry to me.
