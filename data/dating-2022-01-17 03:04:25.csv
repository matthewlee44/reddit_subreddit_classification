0,s5znjj,1642410303,Why do I seem to always attract the insecure ones.," So it seems I've had quite a few short term relationships lately and frankly I am tired of it. Why can't I find a normal woman who isn't insecure and jealous of every female I as much as say hi to.

  I really don't get it. I mean I'm about a 3 at best in looks and that's probably being too generous yet every woman I've dated lately gets extremely jealous of my female friends for no reason  it usually ends up in them demanding I either completely delete all my social media apps and give them unrestricted access to my e nail or them wanting my logins for e nail and social media .

Like before the holidays a good friend of over 49 years sent me a Facebook message wishing me a happy holiday season and ended. It with you know I love you and only want you to be happy my friend right?

A woman I was casually dating at the time blew up and demanded u immediately block this so called friend. Are you fucking serious? Cut off a friend I've known for over 40 years because you a woman I have been casually dating for only a couple of weeks at the time  can't handle that a long time friend ended her message with I love you .I'd rather spend my life single and alone than delete my accounts or give someone I barely know unrestricted access to all of them. If you can't trust me without all of that then there is no need for us to continue to attempt a relationship period",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5znjj/why_do_i_seem_to_always_attract_the_insecure_ones/

3,s5zvta,1642411216,Would it be inappropriate to go back and ask if he’s single?,"On a throwaway. I’m also not sure if this is the right sub but I don’t know the name of any others - sorry if I’m lost. 

So, I [32F] am currently single after my relationship ended a year ago. I recently took my new car to a garage because there was a light on the dash. The incredibly handsome mechanic was super sweet when explaining that I just needed to put air in my tires! A real damsel in distress moment ffs. Anyway, he insisted on doing all four tires for me and wouldn’t accept any payment. 

I had my friend in the car with me and when we left, she asked why I didn’t talk to him longer because he was “definitely flirting with you”. I didn’t see but apparently he lingered on in the bay to give a little wave as we drove off. 

Now, I do actually have a reason to go back there. I genuinely need help with my car. Would I be inappropriate to ask if he’s single? How the hell would I even go about that? Also, there are about 9 guys working there so I can hardly go in and ask for the handsome one lol 

There’s always the likely chance he was just doing his job and I’ll make an idiot out of myself but, honestly, I’m generally quite the clumsy dork so I don’t embarrass too easily anymore. 

Help a girl out please. Dating after 30 is brutal!

8,s60ly1,1642413970,Daily texting?,"Hey y’all! I (26F) have been seeing this guy (25M) since the beginning of 2022. We’ve been dating back in 2020 for a couple of months as well, but I ended it. After breaking it off, he used to have this very annoying behavior of disappearing, even though we still managed to see each other every now and then because we are neighbors. He lives in a different city now, but he came back home every weekend since we spent NYE together and we would meet whenever he’s at home. 

He’s very sweet towards me and we get along pretty well. He apologized for being a douchebag back in 2020-21 and ghosting me; he also told me he acted like that because he’s  “insane” (I can kinda confirm that considering his rather tumultuous past and weird relationship with his parents) and told me he doesn’t wanna make me suffer because he really likes me and told me I don’t deserve that kinda sh*t. 

He’s not a texter, but lately he was the one who kept contacting me. One time he stopped replying all of a sudden (again, just like back in 2021) and I jokingly told him I’ll get upset if he just disappears from the convo, like… just say you can’t talk anymore and say goodbye. I’m not the clingy type, but I felt awkward. He apologized again and told me he’ll try to stop this toxic behavior. He’s all sweet and then boom he’s out. 

He kept telling me to visit him in the city he now lives because he doesn’t like coming home and staying with his parents, but I can’t travel right now because I’m busy with my two Masters programs. Last time we chatted on Saturday and I told him I might have a city break next weekend if I am to finish all my projects. He seemed happy about me visiting him after all this time and continued being very lovey dovey. I recently got a cold and he constantly asked me if I felt better, looking like he he actually cared. Told him I was taking a bath and he (you know all that cringey stuff) asked me when we’re taking a bath together, yadda yadda. So I told him I’m eager to have a spa day with him. He then disappeared again. He probably left me on seen (I deactivated my read recipients, but it’s common sense he saw what I said). 
I haven’t  texted him anymore, as I don’t usually double text, but I just feel stupid for thinking about him not even saying goodbye after he initiated contact every day until yesterday. Since I started seeing him again I feel like a teenager who doesn’t know how to act. 

Am I overreacting? It’s not like I expect him to text me all day, all the time, but just say hi and bye instead of ghosting. I’d also feel awkward to literally tell him this, as I don’t wanna sound pushy or clingy. He’s a rather difficult person, but we have this awesome chemistry when we meet and I’d like to have him around, even if it’s once a week or every two weeks. Still, I can’t meet him every other week and act like everything’s cool if we haven’t even texted when we’re apart. Also, it’s not like we’re having quality online convos, it’s more like chit chatting and talking about our daily lives. But I think these count, too. My opinion is that talking daily to someone is bonding, it’s not supposed to be 10 hours convos, even short texts that take a few minutes add up. 

I have no idea how to cope with this, any advice would be welcome. Thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s60ly1/daily_texting/
9,s60miw,1642414032,"Oh, For Fuck Sake!","So, went on a date with a guy a few nights ago. He was kind, we had a good time. He kept in contact via text/voice note. We were having a back and forth texting/voice note conversation yesterday. He asked me out again. We were literally in the middle of a conversation and I responded to what he said last and then contributed something to discuss. He read the text and left me on read. Now, he has kids so I thought ""ok, probably has the kids or something came up"" etc. I was online a couple times throughout the rest of the evening and noticed that he too was online several times while I was, but never responded to me. Ok...fine. I'm sure there's a good explanation.


The next morning, still no response. So I genuinely thought maybe an emergency came up, so I just texted ""heya. Hope all is ok. 😊"" He responded immediately, saying everything is great and how was I. Now I know there is sometimes controversy around this whole texting thing, but I'm sorry, if you're in the middle of an actual conversation, even via text, there is a way to politely end the conversation without just disappearing, especially if you've taken the time to listen to their voice notes. It's just common courtesy. I would have accepted anything as a reason to end convo. But I'm sorry, I just can't accept that level of rudeness when there's not even a reason. And at the very least, acknowledge that you just bailed on the conversation and offer an apology and/or explanation.


So I told him this morning that we may be looking for different things and that I prefer to spend time chatting with someone who values my time and energy enough to politely end a conversation instead of just randomly disappearing. Then I wished him well in the dating world. I'm sorry, but I have allowed too many things in the past that made me feel wrong and I have paid the price for that. I really don't think that expecting common courtesy is asking too much from anyone, even someone you've only just met. If they're not gonna be courteous in the getting to know you stage, I doubt they'll be courteous once they get into your works more. Anyway, he's texted back but I haven't even opened the text yet.

10,s60qef,1642414443,What to do when he suddenly stops replying?,"I (22F) matched with a guy (23M) online a few months ago and we met for a couple of times, but because we are both busy, it was hard to meet or text all the time, especially with me applying to graduate school and he busy with work now. Our texts weren’t very elaborated but I tried to show my interest and even brought him treats for his birthday and groceries when he got covid around Christmas. He spent new years at his hometown and suggested to meet for something when he is back. Well, he came back and nothing else happened. We exchanged a few texts and I was ghosted when I asked him out last week. He also stopped replying/looking at my stories. 

At the same time I am genuinely hurt, I don’t want to draw conclusions or push him to answer me back. I am also unsure if it is his work taking up his time or if he just lost his interest in me (we live in a big city so there is plenty of options out there), and I am not into playing games like only texting him after he texts me back.

13,s612y4,1642415781,Looking for help. I’m beyond confused and can’t think straight. I don’t know what happened or what to do.,"27 y/o/m (Secure with occasional AP attachment tendencies) &amp; 26 y/o/f (Unknown attachment but believed to be a FA with AP attachment tendencies). We both had been single for 5+ years and gave ourself time to work on ourself after we were both cheated on.

We’ve been together for a total of 10 months including a 3 week breakup back in September. She avoids any bit of confrontation and refuses to talk about things that are bothering her or anything that is controversial. This ultimately made us break up the first time. We both held in some things instead of talking about them and she broke it off. We talked periodically during the 3 week span. When we got back together we both said we needed to communicate better and bring things up / talk about things instead of holding them in. Things have been amazing since we got back together or so I thought.

Fast forward to this past Wednesday she told me she; is unhappy and has been for a while, has been fighting a gut feeling that we aren’t a good “fit”, doesn’t feel like she truly makes me happy, said the passion isn’t there, and is worried abound the future due to having to tell me multiple times to drop the conversation when trying to talk about things. She held the things that were bothering her inside instead of talking about them and has now blown up. I believe she is a Fearful Avoidant but shows tendencies of Anxious Preoccupied. 

I have told her I was just trying to talk about things and she said she doesn’t want to argue. We haven’t had an argument or even raised our voices at each other because she avoids talking about things. 

I knew about the gut feeling when we first broke up but she has never mentioned it since. She said she was happy for a while when we got back together but somewhere that changed and she doesn’t know when. She said she put on a mask to hide her true feelings, she’s always done that and even hides them from herself. We were just booking a vacation to Florida from Illinois for next month over Valentine’s Day, making plans for the future, and had an amazing holiday season. 

I enjoy writing poetry but normally keep it all to myself. Well I wrote her some when we first broke up and gave it to her. She loved it. I had since been writing more and wrote one to give her on Valentine’s Day as well as having another in the works to hopefully give her with it. I still want to give it to her but can’t.

I haven’t talked to her since Thursday afternoon and I’m going crazy with all the questions running through my head. Everything could have been resolved if we brought things up and talked about them like we said we would. Why didn’t she? 

We have both said we don’t want to be one of those couples that breaks up and gets back together all the time. She has also said once she makes up her mind it is set. I’m so confused and don’t know what to think or do. I want to talk to her and resolve the issues that all stem from not communicating but know I need to give her space because we didn’t do that before. I absolutely hate not resolving things that can be talked about. Not everything is an argument when you are both capable of having a civil conversation, we have done it before, we sat and talked in person for an hour and a half the first time we broke up. This time she called me. 

I have narcolepsy and struggle with sleep enough as it is and this has made it worse. I’ve gotten maybe a total of 10 hours of sleep in the past 6 days, I have been forcing myself to eat but even then I don’t eat much because it makes me sick, and I’m constantly crying.

I’m divorced got 4 years ago, been on and off the dating apps for almost as long and was not very successful. 
Last October 24 I was on a second date at a vintage car show with a man that I met on online. As an Army Civilian I love to say “Go Army Beat Navy” to perfect strangers which always gets a laugh.
So I’m walking around….checking out the cool old cars, saw a man in front of his ‘32 Deuce Coupe and went into my Go Army Beat Navy routine. He laughed….we started talking and talking and then he asked if I have a clone. I asked why he’d ask that and he replied that he figured I was with the guy I’d been walking around with and if I had a clone he’d ask for her phone number.I told him I wasn’t really feeling it and (pulled up my big girl panties) and asked him to take my number. To make this long story shorter, last night we got engaged!!! After only 3 months you ask? Yep….when you know, you know.

There are two morals to this story, as I see it. First….dreams do come true and karma. I live my life by doing Random Acts of Kindness to friends, strangers, and the soldiers I support at my job on a regular basis. I asked the universe to repay my kindness with a wonderful man and the universe responded.

Some people will like that you're a virgin and some won't. Your lack of experience shouldn'tbe your focus when dating)

- if women care about height as much as they think (lots of them do, but not to the point lots of men think. Most women just want you to be taller than them. If someone rejects you for your height you will remember that much more than the amount of people who were ok with it. Also, some girls are ok with shorter men)

- if people care about ""body count""(some do and some don't. Just like with virginity, people have different desires and priorities and the people you'll encounter will have different opinions and dealbreakers)

- if x date is too soon or late to have sex(you should have sex when you think it is right, not when other people think it is the norm. That can be the first or the 10th date or whenever it is right for you. If someone rejects you for when you decide to have sex they were likely not right for you anyway)

- if someone giving you mixed signals actually likes you(most of the time they are not that into you.

It was supposed to be temporary as I take a break from my ""sport."" Anyway I, met a guy there. He's super nice to me as he saw me struggling with some of the equipment and he would give me tips and say hi to me every time he sees me and talk to me sometimes and he even complimented me on my deadlift lol. I even though his name because he introduced himself to me. That means it's okay, right?

The only thing that bothers me is, my past/present essentially. I'm almost 29 and have never have never had a boyfriend. I am not used to men liking me but some men are friendly to me but that doesn't mean that they like me as more than just a friend. I know people on Reddit say all the time for women to make the first move to boost men's egos but I don't want to boost someone's ego if I don't get anything out of it except rejection. And I expect rejection because my life hasn't taught me otherwise. I want to believe that he could possibly be interested in me, but at the same time, why didn't he take it any farther if he was actually interested? I'm not standoffish or closed off.

This reminds me of another guy who also did the same sport as me. We became buddies, but only at the gym. Never outside of it. I didn't like him romantically but I did want to hang out with him outside of the gym as friends. So I asked him what he was doing that weekend and he told me he was going to an amusement park with his girlfriend lmfao. He it's just like the other guy. He was the one who initiated talking to me first. He always said hi to me and always talks to me but at the end of the day he had a girlfriend.

41,s65naq,1642430834,How Much Communication??,"With online dating and the modern world of tech comes the ability to always be chatting if one wants to. At first, I notice most of us seem to talk quite a bit before the first date. So I'm curious, how much do you all talk with your romantic interest after the first date? I have a second date lined up, she says I'm really sweet and adorable (I like it, I'm not a very mysterious or lumberjack kind of guy). We still talk, but it's not super easy to have conversations other than ""how's work"" or what happened today. I know she wants to check in with each other throughout the day, wants good night and good morning communication (which I like as well). Our general chatting has slowed some. I'm ok with it, I don't think there's a point to forcing conversation. I also think that less talking throughout the week lends to better conversation on the actual dates. I haven't dated in a long time. I just had my divorce finalized and my ex wasn't a very emotionally healthy person. I'm aware that what I think might be needed or normal isn't. For example, I got used to having to compliment my ex on everything. So telling a date everything I like or appreciate about her isn't normal. Thankfully, she's understanding of all that. I thought I'd turn to Reddit to get advice as I learn to navigate the waters of a healthy relationship.

I ended up addressing this with him lack of conversation and confidence-he made some self-deprecating comments.

45,s660bu,1642431803,I don't know if I should get back to my ex... maybe I overreacted when I broke up,"Me (24f) and B (24m) were best friends for 6 years, like brothers but he started dating 7 months ago. One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother 

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him. Maybe I'm wrong and overreacting.. maybe the love comes back now that he is changed...

For instance today is MLK day and we were supposed to take a walk in the park and he completley blew me off. I understand giving people space and I have but its becoming just insulting at this point.

57,s66xk8,1642434199,Relationships aren’t about money,"I recently met this girl online, who at first seemed very compatible and I enjoyed our conversations. There was one thing that kind of bothered me but I didn’t think anything of it. She would be really concerned with my Finances (how many hours I work, the money I spend on my car and motorcycle, saying that I shouldn’t spend so much money on things when Im not making that much and how I should save money and sell my bike) anyways, On our third date,I notice she is talking to me a bit differently. So I ask what’s up and she tells me she doesn’t like how most of our dates, we both payed half and half. According to her, the man has to always pay or offer to pay. Said I was being “cheap”. I thought it was a bit ridiculous to have this as a criteria to date someone, especially after you say “hey I like you a lot you’re not like the other guys”. We were supposed to go to the beach and hangout one day , she suggested we go in one car, so I agree. Then she says , can we go in your car? Though she says it’s wrong I’m asking her to split things half and half when she literally suggested to go to beach in one car and then says flat out, hey let’s go in your car and you pay for gas and for everything else. She ended up cutting things off with me and I think I dodged a bullet. She recently got out of a 10 year relationship apparently as well. Said she wasn’t with me for my money, just wants someone who can support themselves , which I get.

I don't know if I have a chance on online dating. I have heard a lot of bad things, but I also found out recently that a family member of mind met their boyfriend on a dating app, and low and behind he was the first person she met, but I also know the experience is very different for woman than it is for guys. What should I expect?

She was avoiding discussion about it. She also does not text much. If it was not for all the time we spent together, I would think that she was not interested at all. Is it normal to someone to sleep in your bed, kiss but avoid any other touching?

65,s67ixv,1642435736,Me(18F) and my boyfriend(18) broke up. Is there anything I can do to get him back?,"Hi all, this is a throwaway account since my ex knows my main one. I'm not the best at wording things but I'd really appreciate any and all advice:

My boyfriend (18M) of 7 months and I (18F) have now broken up. The reason being is that I violated his trust. The first time, we got into an argument about a political issue and I didn't want to fight so I ended the call and hung up on him without saying anything. I have a terrible habit of saying things I really don't mean when I'm angry with anybody and I've found it's best if I remove myself from the premises. He let me know how this worried him and how bad it affected him. The second time, we were at his house and things were escalating so I just left his house without any warning. Again, he was torn that I did this and actually cried in front of me for the first time. I realized what I did wrong and for months after that, we never had an issue.

Then yesterday, we got in a stupid argument about politics again since I was talking about it with a friend of mine that is on the opposite side of the political spectrum and just joking around. I then thought it would be funny if I sent a screenshot to him and I thought he wouldn't agree with what my friend was saying but he did. I'm so stupid for what I did next and if I could take it back, I really would: I threatened to break up with him. I did not mean it. I did not realize the implications of my actions. He asked me if I really meant it and he said yes. But about 20 minutes later, I realized how stupid this was and I called him right back apologizing but he had made it clear that he was done with me.

This is the third time I have violated his trust and he doesn't want to get back in a relationship with me because he doesn't want to be hurt again. I completely understand that and I realize how toxic my actions were and how much I hurt him. At the time, I had things I needed to talk to him about that were bothering me: he would often make condescending comments at my conversation skills and at times, it did feel like he thought he was academically superior to me (we're in different math classes and he usually better grades than I do) but he's told me that we're not competition. And i talked to him about the condescending comments he made, and he apologized for hurting me.

All I've asked him is for one chance for me to prove myself to him. In the past, I've tried to get better at all the things I did that bothered him: I'm getting better at not procrastinating on assignments, and working on my social skills, and trying to stop some bad habits of mine like chewing my nails, etc. He's noticed improvement on these issues. I've realized what I lost and how badly I affected him. I just want one chance to make this relationship still work. As of now, I can't stop crying and I can't stop contacting him (I had to block him because I couldn't stop messaging him) and I know he's had it with me now. Is there anything at alll I can do to make this better?

This is also my first relationship. He was my first kiss and this was the first time i've ever truly felt like I like someone. I've never felt so torn and hurt before and all I want to do is go to his house and make it better somehow.

Edit: I just want to clarify that I really don't care about politics. There is just one issue that I am non-negotiable on with relationships and I won't mention it here but my bf and I usually don't talk about politics 99% of the time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s67ixv/me18f_and_my_boyfriend18_broke_up_is_there/

Saturday morning I matched a cute girl on bumble and started to chat with all throughout the afternoon, we exchanged a couple a picture of ourselves over whatsapp and she asked me what were my plans for tonight, I said I was just planning to chill at my place because I was tired from the week I had and she asked of she could come along. I said yes set a time then went doing so shit I had to do with a friend.

She came and we started to talk about everything what we were doing in our life what we liked, I tell her some funny stories I had and we started to eat and drink together. She came closer and closer to me and at one point she just came on my chest to put her head. I cuddle her a bit then I proceeded to kiss her and we kissed for a good amount of time then went in my room.
Obviously we started to get naked and do the starter but at one point I just realize I didn't had condoms 😅.

For the little story I got dumped by my ex of 5 years and yeah obviously we weren't using condoms anymore and I didn't knew she was going to want to hook up with me on first date so I didn't even consider checking if I had some.

So I just told to her that I didn't have condoms so I couldn't have sex, I started to feel a bit cringy and I laught about it, she seems a bit frustrated but you know she didn't wanted to have sex without neither (which I totally understand). She also was a bit surprised that I didn't have but I wasn't just expecting to hook up on first date, my mistake I guess 🤷🏻 + I didn't need them because I was in a long term committed relationship 4months before lol. 
So I tried to find a place to buy real quick but didn't find obviously, we kissed a bit and cuddle in the bed but then we decided to stop it for tonight, so we go dressed up and I escorted her back to her car, she kissed me on the mouth and we said goodbye 😅.

I was quite cringing and I expected that she block me but she just texted me that she got back home and a little joke about her flu (she had flu and said that she hope I didn't catch it at least), I just said it was still worth it and that despite my stupid mistake I had a great time and that she was beautiful. She thank me for the evening and we said goodnight.

Ysterday I didn't texted her because I was busy with the sports training and today with my job, I would like to see her again (and this time don't make that mistake) but I don't know what I should say because I feel like I screwed it up and maybe I should just walk away.

Without going into tons of detail we have a lot of similarities to a relationship without any physical intimacy. Everyone I have asked opinions on this matter say he really likes me but won’t admit it and just sticks his guns to friendship. 
Sometimes he gets really close to me that is obviously beyond friendship. I even spent Christmas with his family and him who all spoiled the hell out of me for the holiday. 
Then after Christmas I got the feeling he began to pull back again. He has done this before when we seem to be getting closer than we already are. Now I feel like he is doing it again. He calls me still but tells me it’s only gonna be like a 10 or 15 mins phone call. He was sick for a few days and lost his voice so that didn’t bother me at all. He even expressed his concern over me thinking he didn’t want to talk to me. Wanting me to tell him I didn’t think was the reason. But now he is better and he is continuing this so now I think that yes. He says he is trying to spend less time on the phone as a goal for the year (but still calls me almost every hour or two) or that he doesn’t want to take time away from my kids to talk to him. I have told him he doesn’t have to call at all if he doesn’t want to. Yet he does anyways saying well I can still talk for 10 mins. So is he going cold on me cause we got too close again?

71,s68mwk,1642438500,"Girl rejected me, but still keeps texting me. What should i do?","Hey everyone, I've been hanging out with this girl since late december last year. 

A little bit background:

We had a history together, i first got to know her in 2018, and we could've been a couple but i rejected her back then. Later that year she got together with her now ex-boyfriend. In 2019 she texted me bc it was so good talking to me back in 2018, or at least that was the answear she gave me. I ended up in the friendzone i think bc i hit her when she had a boyfriend. I'm not proud of what i did. After that we haven't spoken since 2021 december and i texted her bc i saw that she's not with her boyfriend anymore. Her response was great, said that we should meet up and talk about things. We did just that everything went well, nothing serious happened on the first date, but on the second date we kissed, she was all over me after the kiss, and i hold her hands too. She said she can feel something for me.

Everything was so good until after the night of the first kiss. She became somewhat cold to me through text, wasn't picking up any of my flirting attempts. It was weird but i thought that she's testing me or just playing mind games. We went to our third meeting. She hugged me, i was waiting for a kiss in the beggining nothing like that happened. When i tried to hold her hands she pulled away hers, even though i was smooth. But she had her arm cross my, she hold upper arm like that. At the end of the day she wasn't looking at me in the same way she did before, behaved completely different. Colder. I said to her that she should hold my hand, and she said it's too much to her rn. So we parted ways without setting up a next date, or even kissing. She just hugged me with one arm. 

I started to love this girl, and it hurts me a bit bc i don't know what went wrong. I wasn't needy, i was confident, i flirted with her, physically escalated. We kissed.

I know its probalby over for good, and i'm quite sad because of that, i felt like she's just like me, often times we said the same things at once.

After the third meeting i was quite heartbroken i decided i'll try to move on, she texted me after this meetup and i was sad but didn't wanted to become needy and helpless for her, so i pulled back almost all of my attention from her texts. But she texted me again. 

I feel like that she said to me that holding my hands is too much for her, but the week before she was all over me after kissing, is kind of like a rejection.

I met a guy five years ago at a friend’s party. I’ve replayed that night so many times in my head that I don’t even know what’s real anymore. I just know that I left that party feeling like he was the most amazing guy and that for the first time, I showed my truest self to a stranger and felt comfortable doing so. We flirted throughout the night, had good banter, and he even asked for my number. But nothing really came of it afterwards because well… I guess bottom line, he just wasn’t interested in me that way. Over the five years, we never saw each other again. Maybe once a year we’d exchange a few words over social media, nothing much really. At one point, I did ask him out, but he kindly let me down lol. This was obviously my queue to move on… but why can’t I?? Ive dated other men throughout these five years. I’ve gotten over every crush, rejection, failed talking stage, and breakup. But why does this guy have such a hold over me? I even went so far as to delete social media bc I realized I was just posting for him to see and only opening the app to get a glimpse of his life that apparently, I want so badly to be a part of. The worst part is, I barely know him. We had one conversation. I think my brain has just filled in the blanks as to who this guy really is and turned him into this dream man in my head.

78,s68y0m,1642439266,Should I text this guy my expectations for our 3rd date?,"This is a long one. I'm sorry but I feel the details are important. 

TL;DR -Have a 3rd date with a guy at his place. I have totally innocent intentions and I think he does too, but I feel I should text him beforehand and let him know my expectations for the date and that this will not end in us having sex.

I (late 20's F) met this (late 20's) guy on one of the apps. We've had 2 dates so far (first was a coffee date that lasted 2 hrs and 2nd was at a bar that lasted 3 hours, one date a week). I really like him, I think he's cute, we have stuff in common, we laugh, we flirt. We don't text very much (something else I find a little strange because I'd like to text more but I realize not everyone's a texter). He took the initiative and held my hand on the second date, and I'm pretty sure he wanted to kiss me at the end of that date, but I may have inadvertently blocked him by not reading the cues, which I didn't realize until the next day. I'm a little awkward because I don't have much dating experience. I've been on the app 2 yrs on and off, and this is the first guy that I can see myself progressing into something with. I'm looking for a serious relationship.
Anyway, I like to be honest and I don't like to be vague. I sent him the after date text after our second date and let him know I like him and that I'd like to see him again soon. He reciprocated and said we should hang out again and suggested this week. He and I have hobbies that we're interested in, but are awkward to do in public (I don't  want to be specific for the slim chance he sees this), so on the second date we said that I could come over to his place (I know where he lives, he doesn't know where I live) and do these things together. I saw no ""ill-intent"" in his words and I agreed that would be the best option for what we wanted to do. I took it as a completely innocent suggestion. So when he said to hang out, I asked what we should do (I threw out two suggestions, one being the hobbies) and he suggested we do our hobbies. I said ""at your place, I'm assuming"" and he responded that was fine. Now I'm worried that he might be expecting something else from this. I don't do hookups and this would only be the 3rd date, way too soon in my view to sleep together. I'm okay with kissing (honestly I want to and I'm kinda expecting it) but that's it. I've seen a lot of Reddit comments about how going over to someone's place suggests sex, which I don't agree with. I'm not going to be staying there for that long (I have a hard out by 10:00pm). I don't know if in my flirting I may have suggested I was DTF and I haven't noticed. 
So basically, the question is: should I text him and let him know my expectations for this meeting up?  That this is just a date and I'm NOT going to hook up with him? That I'm looking for something serious and for it to build slowly (we haven't talked about what we're looking for yet, but it's in my profile)? Or I go and see how it plays out, and see if he starts leading toward sex and then tell him what I want? Or should I just not go to his place at all, back track and suggest a different activity (and if I do that should I give him the reason for why I'm doing it)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s68y0m/should_i_text_this_guy_my_expectations_for_our/
79,s691rg,1642439510,2 months and sex is dying,"We started dating exclusively about two months ago. Everything was great. Initially, we had sex once or twice a week and it was good. Past two weeks, she has been saying due to stress, she is having low sex drive and abstains from sex or any sexual activity. She, however, wants to do everything else dating-wise (going out, movie night, spending nights together, etc). 

I never have felt this but I’m thinking maybe she is no longer physically attracted to me and it’s just an excuse. 

We are in late 20s. We both really like each other and there is a potential for future.

80,s693cb,1642439610,Dating in DC vs Texas,"(Had to repost since many didn’t know what DMV stood for in the post title)

Wanted to hear men’s experiences with dating in the DC area and/or Texas (specifically Houston or Dallas, but any part is fine). I’m [23M] from and have lived in the DMV area (DC-Maryland-Virginia) all my life, so I’ve got, while very limited (started going out to bars last year), some experience. From what I have experienced, women in the DC area can be pretty unapproachable and if I do muster up the nerve to approach them, they have a condescending attitude and/or can be cold. A lot of the women in the DC area are college educated and a good amount are pursuing post graduate degrees. However, it seems like because of this, they tend to turn their nose up to me until I reveal to them that I am a college graduate with a career in IT. Even then, despite having a seemingly good conversation (based o them breaking the physical touch barrier and other body language) the interaction never really goes past the bar and if I do manage to get the number, it rarely ever results in hanging out or the text exchange doesn’t last long enough (stop texting back) for me to get to the point where I can schedule a date. Ultimately, I think a lot of DMV (DC-Maryland-Virginia) women tend to have much higher standards than women in other areas of the US.

Disclaimer: 90% of my experience is with women at bars and clubs. I have never used dating apps nor am I in any extracurricular clubs",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s693cb/dating_in_dc_vs_texas/
81,s69bpp,1642440174,Does sexting make you respect someone less?,"Heyhey,

I (30F) am a sex-positive lady and I believe that you can have a solid relationship with someone even if you sext before meeting them, or if you hook up on the first date.  And so occasionally I'll exchange spicy texts with someone I like before I meet them if the mood strikes (not that this is important, but I've never instigated it). 

I don't respect men any less because of these interactions, but I'm worried that the same respect is not given to me. I think that these men often only view me as a hookup or sexting buddy afterwards, even if I view them as a potential date.

For context: the men I date are liberal, roughly my age, not religious and in London.

Here's the question: **does sexting make you less appealing to modern liberal men?** How do I get to have a fun sexy time, and not have anyone treat me like I'm less dateable afterwards?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s69bpp/does_sexting_make_you_respect_someone_less/

Tbvh I go on apps just to talk to new people, hang out and if i feel like we're really vibing I wouldn't mind taking things forward. However, a recurring pattern I've noticed is, people on apps just seem to be too impatient to even bother to get to know you. It's like I get a ""do you wanna book a room/ just hookup"" within the first conversation itself. And given the covid situation I thought meeting people on apps was chill but because of this pattern of behaviour I feel pressured to do more :/

And after talking to 10 people I seem to find one person who I can sort of connect with and that too mostly fizzles out, I dont know, i guess I'm just ranting about how tired I am of these apps lol.

We calculated and between the hotel and amusement parks, it should be around $300 per person. The Central America trip with a family is 1,200. So I was happy to be saving money, and those family trips are usually filled with partying and drinking… I don't do any of that.

I told my parents my idea and then my sister freaked out and said why are you letting her control you. Now the entire family thinks I'm whipped. And now to be honest, my family has been critical of her since they met her. I've never had a girlfriend before and they would tease me about being a virgin and being alone. Now that I found someone.

my job doesnt help me knowing some girls and my interests are mainly videogames,gym and cars so its very rare that i meet new person through them...
ive been obsessed with the fact that i would just try with online apps but so far ive only went out with 4 or 5 girls in like 4 years of apps , somehow i still dont get likes (must be for bad pictures) so im getting even more depressed..
last year i felt good for the first time because a girl I went out with ended kissing me and she was so much in love with me, I SADLY WASNT 😅🥺

97,s6b04m,1642444178,A cautionary tale with a bit of advice seeking.,"I'm a 31 year old man who is giving dating another go after years of being single. Before this run at the swipes and putting myself out there I was an active alcoholic. So not only have I been single for 8 years I also haven't had much dating experience past the age of 24. I've now been sober for 2 years and after working on myself mentally and physically I figured I was ready for a serious attempt at finding a partner. I've had the usual matches, shallow convos, ghostings, and robots. I've also had a few very nice adult dates where conversations flowed and there was a mutual respect.

Enter Sam(not her real name). We matched on bumble two weeks before Christmas. She pointed out a band I liked and we hit it off well from there. I find out that day while we are chatting that she is in another state for the holidays to visit family. No, biggy, I can wait to meet a person. Over the next two weeks after matching our conversation grows deeper. Sharing music we like, sharing hopes and dreams and I shared my intentions with dating after I saw she changed her profile from ""something casual"" to ""don't know yet."" I felt a connection with Sam and it seemed reciprocated. 

Then her car broke down and she needed it repaired. She took it to a family member and while fixing the vehicle discovered that they were exposed to Covid by a cousin. So, she decides the best course of action is to fly back to the state we live in and quarantine until a neg test. As a side note, I will say I thought this was irresponsible but I understand not wanting to pay for a hotel for more than a week on a students budget and staying with family wasn't an option.

When she is back in town I offer to make her a care package or grab groceries as I have offered to any other friend who has been through Covid/quarantine. When I drop it off we wave to each other through the window and my heart sinks. She looks nothing like her photos. I felt misled. I take time that evening to decide that I am going to continue with this because our seemingly strong connection through words typed and talked could outweigh physical appearances. I will say I'm a handsome guy with a goofy flair who gets compliments. Her profile was angled face photos and one old(I know now) full body picture. I should have paid more attention to that, I know. I guess I will also have to get over my dislike of video chatting so I can avoid similar situations in the future. 

After she tested negative we went on a date that was really fun. Good conversation, good food. we went back to her place to use the hot tub and she had intentions of me staying the night. While I really like this girl I also couldn't get over my lack of attraction to her. We stay up until 2am talking until I find reason to leave and I could tell this was not what she wanted. Since then our conversation has been blunt and shallow. Now I know I'm not without fault in this situation. I pursued this with vigor and skipped a few common steps to dating. We both did. 

So now the question of advice. Do I just send a text saying I don't think we should see each other? Or do I need to explain myself in depth while trying to find a way to say you misled me without hurting feelings?

TLDR: Chatted with a girl for a month before seeing her in person. She's not what her profile looks like. I try getting over lack of physical attraction only to realize I can't.

In 2011 I (M 30) studied together with a girl that I had a huge crush on. We haven't talked to each other in like 9 years. I added her to Instagram a few months ago and yesterday I talked to her.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how it went:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi Susan (F 28) (not the real name)! What were you doing? Do you feel studying psychology changed you as a person?

(left me on read)

(1 hour later)

Me: I wanted to tell you that, when we studied together long ago, I really liked you. I don't think I ever liked a woman that much. I remember we used to text a lot a you told me a lot about your job at (company). I wanted you to know that.

&amp;#x200B;

She: Hi! I was packing because tomorrow I'm going on a trip for 2 weeks with some friends. I saw what you wrote but I was planning to reply later when I'm not busy.

Me: lol, I rushed. That was my last shot.

She: I'm very surprised about what you said! We haven't talked for so long. I hope you're fine. I sincerely don't remember that we talked a lot, but I do remember you were a good friend and a good person. Sincerely so much time has passed and I don't remember much about that time of my life. I finished my course of studies (proceeds to tell me about her present).

But I can't talk much now because tomorrow I'm going on vacation with some friends. I have a flight to take early tomorrow. I hope you're fine and your things are fine!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I remember a lot about you, although time can make you forget things. I remember that you told me about (some personal stuff). I was very sensitive at that time and had a huge crush on you. I really liked you.

I would like to have a coffee with you some day. It would mean a lot to mean, because you are the woman that I liked the most in my life. At that time I imagined that I would confess my feelings to you when I turned 80 as something pending, but I decided I didn't want to wait so long.

(Today she left what I just wrote above on read. She then uploads a story on Instagram where she's in the airport with her friends about to board the plane)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How do you think it went? What do you think I should do next?

I didn't really expect her to reply so I said what I said without thinking. Honesty is appreciated.
