11,rn1ybb,1640284022,How did things go awry in just one week after a month of dates?,"Hi all,

I am an inexperienced 22M who was seeing a 19F in college for one month. We went on 3 official dates and hung out a few times outside of that after running into each other on campus. I was denied a kiss on date 2 because she was not comfortable yet, but she still invited me out on date 3, where she said her grandfather died. Thus, I did not try to be physically intimate so I wouldn't be viewed as taking advantage of her emotional vulnerability.

Well, ever since the grandfather died, she canceled a lunch date the night prior to see her professor and sort of became aloof. I gave her time to grieve while I focused on finals, and then we started texting again recently. I asked to FaceTime since we are home for break, but then she took a day to respond, only for her to say she was tired from her new job. Two days later, at the high point of a text convo, I suggested we hang out over our winter break, only for her to wait another day and say that text ""overwhelmed"" her given everything going on in her life: a new job, death in the family, moving home after her first semester in college. She said she's ""still figuring things out.""

I am lost. One week ago, after she did cancel lunch, we did run into each other and got dinner, which she said put her in a really good mood. Now, a week or so later, this happens. She said she sees a therapist for anxiety, and I don't think she's experienced in dating either because we both confided in each other that we struggle to make connections in college. So I am not sure where I went wrong. I think our connection was/still is real, but she does not seem ready right now. She did NOT say the classic ""I am not ready for a relationship,"" but she did say ""I'm still figuring things out. Everything going on in life has made me on edge. I sincerely apologize for how I have been acting.""

So there you have it. If life truly did get to her, then I got screwed over by terrible timing. Also, it does not help we just went home for winter break. If she was letting me down gently, I don't know how things went awry in just one week. Maybe she reaches back out or maybe she doesn't. I won't wait around, but I think she was being truthful about life getting to her considering everything started to fizzle out once the grandfather died like the flip of a switch. 

Request for advice: Did I do anything wrong here? Did her life situation and her anxiety truly get in the way? Any general thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn1ybb/how_did_things_go_awry_in_just_one_week_after_a/

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for almost a year (feb 2022 will be a year). I am with her, not because of necessarily how I felt, but more because I feel comfortable around her. I can share most things and I feel like she‚Äôs not super judgmental. In some ways she is, but other ways she compassionate. We don‚Äôt fight much and we‚Äôre good at resolving issues. She listens and is attentive. I‚Äôm not with her because of how I feel, it‚Äôs more because it just works and I can trust her. But I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôs not fair to her.

If i ever do consider pursuing a girl i like this leads to an endless cycle of  finding more reasons to convince myself that she would never be into me. If a girl seems like she likes me i‚Äôll convince myself that she is just bring nice or its platonic. Another issue is that i am way more comfortable with girls in relationships because i know they are taken and i can just be myself without them thinking i am hitting on them. I know that a lot of this is in my head but it is something that really bothers me. I want to be able to get over these insecurities. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm ugly but compared to the guys i see with girlfriends j feel average. I know looks aren‚Äôt the only thing that attracts girls but it def has a huge influence.

18,rn2rk2,1640286286,Dating a quick tempered woman (28M) Am I overreacting?,"I've been dating this woman (30F) for almost 11 months now. Love spending time with her, she's very sweet, caring and very smart. Have stayed over at each other's places for weeks on end. 

Although, there's been one aspect of hers which drives me nuts at times, it's that she's quick (and maybe bad?) tempered. Whenever someone cuts us off when driving, when things don't go as per plan, she's got this temper which, for lack of better words, freaks me out a bit. It just triggers something (childhood issues?) in me. Growing up, as a kid, my dad had a quick and bad temper, and I never really reached a stage where I'm completely open with him even now.

I keep thinking this isn't something serious, but when we fight, I really feel like I can't take her anger. Whenever we argue, I don't feel like I'm arguing with a girlfriend but with some random person. I'm a much more calm person in general, and don't get triggered that easily/often.

I want to try get out more but with covid is a bit of a sticky one.Some of my main games at the moment are dead by daylight, halo infinite and valorant. I enjoy watching tv. I usally go for a mythical/fantasy based show that has real life features like vampire diaries, the order, lucifier or more crime based shows like criminal minds and S.W.A.T.   
I listen to a lot of music. My taste differs i just mainly listen to the lyrics and i add a song to my playlist if i like the voice of the artist and the lyrics of the song. Some of the main artists i listen too are The Kid Laroi, Giveon, Lewis Capaldi and Finneas. My humour in my opinion is good. I tend to laugh at most things quite a dark humour. My coping method for things is to laugh and i like to joke about myself a lot.  
Kink wise im into most things im more of a try it before you judge it person but i can list some personal main interests of mine: Facesitting, pegging, humilation(SPH, etc), Degradition, Feminization, Body worship(Armpits, ass,feet,etc), Orgasm control, Ruined orgasm and more i just cant name them all as theres so many lmao. Limits are only really illegal things. My main thing is getting pleasure from my significants others pleasure so in them terms i would try any kink if its what gets them off.

29,rn3ph7,1640288920,Some things to keep in mind about rejection,"- Rejection happens to everyone. Sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre the only one getting rejected, while you‚Äôre looking in at others who are embraced by society. This simply isn‚Äôt true. Everyone has experienced harsh rejection in their lives.

- Those who imply or claim that they never get rejected are lying. Plain and simple.

- You have to embrace rejection if you want anything in life. It is the principle of seeking pleasure vs. avoiding pain. If you seek out things you desire, you will encounter frequent roadblocks

- Everybody has insecurities and shit they‚Äôre dealing with. Even the most attractive, seemingly socially desirable people are insecure about something. Someone‚Äôs public face doesn‚Äôt always align with their internal struggles.

- Those who are rude to others usually have internal strife, or other insecurity. If someone is rude to you, don‚Äôt take it personally. Those who are at peace with themselves and are happy treat others with respect.

- Remember the people who care about you. There are hopefully people out there who care about you for who you are, and love being around you. You only want to pursue those who feel the same way. If you feel like you need to constantly convince someone to like you, move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn3ph7/some_things_to_keep_in_mind_about_rejection/

51,rn5z86,1640295314,Did I ruin things between us or did he?,"Two years ago, I started talking to this guy on tinder. We had really good chemistry over text. He told me that I was really hot, and the cutest guy in town, and he was very attractive too, being a former model. We went on a first date after a week or so of texting, going out for lunch, and it went well. He lived an hour away from me and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd consider dating someone so soon after he got out of a two year relationship a few months before, but that there was something about me. We made out and he held my hand for a bit as he drove me home. 

We made a plan for a second date and kept texting each other. He started going through some stuff, him and his family having to move unexpectedly and him trying to take out a loan to get a new house for his family, and I'd be there for him, sending encouraging texts. He told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that no one else is as smart as me except for him, and that he might be my perfect match. I have difficulty socializing, so I've never been in a relationship before and only been on a few dates. No one's ever said stuff like that to me, and I was so happy to hear that this guy really likes me.

 He said that he wanted to have sex on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. He said it had to be in his car, since his family was having to leave their house and I lived at home too and wasn't allowed to have potential romantic partners stay the night . And it also had to be unprotected. I told him that I was nervous to be penetrated since I'm a virgin, and I wasn't sure how I felt about my first time being in a car, and he said that I just had to get over it. He eventually said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that is being in a relationship would be delayed until we had sex, because he wanted to know how good it would be. I was going to go through with it, but a few days later I thought that we wouldn't be sexually compatible, and we went our separate ways.

 I've been having trouble moving on from him since it happened, going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who saw a future with me. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked if he really did like me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he said that he did really like me at first but that I ruined it.

 I've been thinking about it recently and did I ruin it or did he? He liked me enough to see himself spending his life with me but was very insistent on having unprotected sex in his car on the second date, even though I was uncomfortable with that. And we'd only be boyfriends of the sex was good enough. That's a lot of pressure to put on a virgin, and he knew that I was one. If I liked someone as much as he liked me, I wouldn't pressure them into sex, especially if they were a virgin.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn5z86/did_i_ruin_things_between_us_or_did_he/

53,rn658c,1640295807,How and when to tell people you can only get off to kink?,"**TL;DR - When would be a good time to tell a woman you can only get aroused by your kinks?**

34M, never had a relationship last over a month, usually dies around the time sex happens. Main reason being I can only get turned on by kinks, namely being submissive in the BDSM sense which is a really shitty problem to have considering most women aren't very kinky and those who are are almost always only interested in subbing. It'd be nice if I could make do without it, but the cravings for it get extremely intense and I know it's an itch that needs to be scratched if I'm going to be content long term in a relationship.

FWIW I'm also willing to do vanilla sex acts with women too, it's not like I need (or want) all kink all the time, and I can get into vanilla stuff emotionally, but so far never sexually, at all. So fingers and mouth can happen, but PIV is off the table due to physics. *That said*, I suspect if I got really comfortable/close with someone things might change since I do find I get a lot more interested in vanilla sex if I'm starting to develop feelings, but that's hypothetical since, again, never gotten in bed with anyone I feel sexually comfortable around yet.

That raises another issue though, which is that I suck at creating sexual chemistry because I don't really care about having sex and tbh want to avoid bringing it up precisely because I can't have sex. But I also know you have to do that stuff if she's going to have any interest because she is, after all, dating not looking for friends. So I try to fake it as best as I can, which I guess works well enough judging from the results, but turns out you really can't fake sexual interest even if you are interested.

Now unfortunately I've tried the IRL BDSM community for years and they're just not my people, so that's never come close to panning out. There are kinky dating sites, but you're lucky if you meet even one real person on there much less someone you're actually interested in. So kink first doesn't seem viable. Which is fine, kink is just one of many aspects of a compatible partner so it can wait, but that leads to my dilemma: When and how to tell women I'm dating about this?

I don't want to bring it up before we've gotten sexual because it seems like putting the cart in front of the horse. OTOH I feel like waiting until after a shitty sexual experience to bring it up isn't much better. And it's not like I ever get a chance to wait out the shittiness, they're gone soon after. And because why should things be simple, I *also* have a history of trauma which I have gotten a lot of therapy for and made a ton of progress with but some of my intimacy issues stem from it too, so that's something else I feel like is probably best brought up before sex to provide an explanation for some of the awkwardness.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn658c/how_and_when_to_tell_people_you_can_only_get_off/

The last years wasnt the best for me. I realized that i have anxiety now. I would like to change that. In the past when i saw a couple kissing or in a party i didnt had problem with it. Sometimes i did that too. I felt the balance. But somehow times changes and now i have this feeling when i see a happy couple i instatntly feel that im a less person becouse i cant get anyone. I had several rejections but somehow i went through thoose. But now the last 2 rejections hurted more. And i dont know why maybe i was in love with them for real. But this brings up the problem that i fall in love easily. I just would like to know how should i change myself ? or which parts. Becouse the rejections without explonation doesnt help me that much. Or it can be that i found bad girls ? So yeah im between this situation where i try to find whats the problem with me and is there even a problem or its just unluck ? I would like to improve myself. And kill this anxiety about the dating. Becouse i know that its not serius abaout being angry for other couples. So can this be real that this 2 ""relationship"" totally broke me ?. Or there is something more behind it ? Before this i had nothing like that i was like okay next time i will be successfull. Why i lost that ? I think that i was so close with this to be a good couple and yet i failed that. And i think this is the hardest part for me. I felt like that i failed in the finish line. And i dont know the reason. Btw i went to a therapist severalt times becouse i thought it could help. So the question is where should i start ? I should rebuild my confidence somehow.

Women have all sorts of socially acceptable outfits that show a lot of skin. They can wear makeup and all sorts of clothing that accentuate their sexuality and make them look more sexually appealing.

Men on the other hand don't seem to have a lot of options in this regard. It's kind of frowned upon for men to show a lot of skin, especially in more formal settings like a nice restaurant, while women can wear very revealing dresses and still be considered classy.

Like, if I were a woman, I totally understand how I would dress to get a man sexually aroused. But as a man, I have no idea how I am supposed to dress to get a woman sexually aroused.

81,rn8283,1640301227,A little holiday heartbreak,"Want to get some thoughts on this, or maybe some encouragement.

I (31m) started seeing someone (27f) I met on Hinge in early September. Instant connection which continues to spark and get better as we continue to deepen things-moving slowly but surely, and always so excited to see each other again.

As things progress she tells me she has feelings and she‚Äôs trying to make me her boyfriend. She‚Äôs planning dates and even wants to know if I want to rent a cabin with her and have a romantic New Years together. I‚Äôm in!

We‚Äôre both from hometowns near each other and agree to drive back for thanksgiving. She‚Äôs all smiles the whole way, hours pass like minutes and we cap off the drive with dinner before going out separate ways.

We spent the weekend following the holiday together, dinner, drinks and meeting my friends while she‚Äôs telling them all how much she‚Äôs into me and hopes I am too. (Spoiler: I am smitten)

After a physical night together in a hotel i got us, We drive back together and she‚Äôs a bit quiet. I ask her why and she admits her friend (female) admitted her love for her and she‚Äôs sad she has to cut her out of her life because there‚Äôs no attraction. I console her and she holds my hand and all is well again.

Once back, we make plans to see each other before I head out of town. Don‚Äôt hear from her much which is odd but I don‚Äôt think much. I check in to see if we‚Äôre still on to hang out and‚Ä¶ silence. Nothing on a follow up the next day either. I give her the weekend and enjoy my weekend out of town.

Still not hearing from her, I call her out for ghosting and ask when I can get my stuff back. We arrange a time to meet and talk.

She explains she just needed time to think (I gave her a week without bothering her) and was planning on responding after a time. She thinks we‚Äôre not right for each other because I‚Äôm close with my family, love kids and celebrating the holidays, and she‚Äôs the opposite. (???) 

She also says she‚Äôs worried about dating long distance when she starts doing a work abroad in 6 mos (even tho we had already talked through me visiting during that time).

I explain that‚Äôs all understandable but I wished she‚Äôd been upfront instead of going ghost out of the blue. We end amicably, she kisses me and walks out the door. I take it on the chin and move on as best I can.

A couple weeks later, she blocks me on social. I immediately realize she hasn‚Äôt been honest, but what can i do?

But my friends aren‚Äôt so forgiving and she didn‚Äôt block them. Eventually they see what she‚Äôs hiding. Turns out, she‚Äôs posting make out photos of her and that very same female friend she was ‚Äúcutting out‚Äù of her life. They‚Äôve been in a relationship for at least a month. And they‚Äôre celebrating Xmas together. Thought she hated it?

I‚Äôve had a male friend for years and he‚Äôs always had a flirtatious personality. All of his friends are women. I confided in him during one of my breakups since my ex cheated on me, and we got closer. I started to find myself falling for him, even though he had a girlfriend. I never said anything to him that flirtatious but he was always the first one to lurk my social media or like my posts so I called him ‚Äúmy biggest fan‚Äù jokingly. That‚Äôs as far as it went from my end. Looking back, I feel guilty about this because I don‚Äôt think I should have flirted like that. While his girlfriend studied abroad, he always said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust myself around you that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt say hi anymore in class‚Äù or he would invite me over at night saying she won‚Äôt know. I denied every single advance he made and I told him that if we hangout, his girlfriend needs to be present so she knows I‚Äôm not attempting to try to take her boyfriend. During their relationship, he berated her and said she nagged him a lot. He had sleepovers with his girl best friends and said she wasnt okay with it, but his logic was he was an individual and can do what he wanted. I always argued with him for that. Told him it wasn‚Äôt cool what so ever. He called me hot while he was at work bartending so that was the final straw and I admitted my feelings to him and ended the friendship because I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable speaking to someone knowing they‚Äôre taken. I‚Äôve had guy friends in relationships before and was completely fine, but for some reason I felt creepy about this? Like I‚Äôm doing something extremely wrong? Anyways, he didn‚Äôt respect that and kept trying to message me. Very shortly after, they broke up for unknown reasons and a couple of months after that, we slept together once and he ghosted me forever. I want to know if I‚Äôm a home wrecker. For some reason, I never behave this way but I feel like I did something extremely wrong here. I have an incredibly large guilt complex.

She then posted a story about how her boyfriend broke up with her and blocked her on social media because he owes her money and wants to get out of it and that she doesn't really care about the money but just wants her bunny back and the stuff that's hers. She just wanted to warn everyone about him and warned other women to avoid men like him. I just responded hoping that things work out and saying that she's a good person and will come out stronger one day from all this. I would have asked her out if it wasn't for all the other stuff she's dealing with and I just don't know if it's insensitive to ask her out and when.

I have no idea if she just broke up with him or if it happened a while ago and I want to be respectful of her situation.

92,rn94ov,1640304445,Struggling with feelings for a taken guy,"For about a year now, I‚Äôve been developing feelings for a coworker. We are pretty friendly with each other and would hang out occasionally in our friend group outside of work. He is a cute and goofy bi guy and exactly my type. Unfortunately, the fact we were coworkers and that he has a partner and kids made me feel super guilty and anxious, leading me to conceal how I really felt about him. 
Despite this, throughout the time we worked together, at times it seemed like he was flirting with me, some examples being: calling me cute, a snack, and baby, joking about kissing me, touching my arm and thigh when laughing, and saying he wants me close to him while he was drunk. It wasn‚Äôt a constant thing but happened enough for me to notice. 
When it happened I would always just laugh it off instead of flirting back because of how nervous I got not knowing his intentions. The logical part of me figured it was all just a friendly joke to him and that I shouldn‚Äôt read too much into it, but the dumb hopeless romantic part kept clinging to any crumbs of affection I wanted so badly from him. 
As of now, we no longer work for the same company, but we still hang out sometimes and my feelings are just as strong. I think I‚Äôve done the right thing up until now by not flirting with him since he‚Äôs in a relationship. But going so long suppressing my feelings without telling anyone has led me to feeling very depressed and isolated. 
Do guys always flirt with intent or can it just be a sign of friendliness? Should I tell him how I feel and how?

99,rn9gzy,1640305499,Simple trick to display confidence without speaking to someone,"Time and time again no matter who you speak with, what YouTube video you watch or what you read on Reddit, the first piece of dating advice anyone will give you to attract women is to ‚Äúbe confident‚Äù or ‚Äúhave confidence‚Äù. 

Usually confidence implies that you are comfortable with yourself and in environment that you‚Äôre in, but also what kind of energy you put out.

For example, someone who just reached a new personal milestone at the gym, got a promotion at work or maybe just found out they they got a good grade on a school test, is probably going to be in a much better mood and give off a much better vibe than someone who‚Äôs feeling depressed or had a bad day at work. Even when you try to separate your personal alone time feelings from your public feelings, more often than not these are in unconscious and subtle changes that will never notice, especially tone of voice and mannerisms. So here‚Äôs the trick to practice displacing confidence. Ready for for it????

Walk with your head facing up and facing forward. 

I notice this a lot with people who are walking and I notice myself doing this a lot as well, which is to put your head down or look away when walking. This shows that you‚Äôre uncomfortable, you‚Äôre afraid to look at someone in the eyes as you head toward them or scared they‚Äôll made a bad comment for staring at them. 

Being a confident man is about being comfortable. When you approach a woman or a man, even if it‚Äôs a completely platonic manner, don‚Äôt talk to them as if they‚Äôre about to reject you before you even ask or say anything; women can pick up on that instantly. Keep your head up, smile and make consistent eye contact. Not so much that it‚Äôs creepy, but reciprocate their energy and watch for body language to determine if the person is interested in talking or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn9gzy/simple_trick_to_display_confidence_without/
