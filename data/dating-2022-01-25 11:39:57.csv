4,scjmzh,1643133434,Rejected because of religion,"I met this girl while out with some friends, got her number and took her out on a date. Things went really well on the first date. We had a great conversation and made out at the end of it. A couple days later, we went on a second date and everything was going well until she asked me if I'm religious. I responded to her question stating that I have a complicated relationship with religion but I consider myself a Christian even though I don't practice it. I asked her if she's religious and she said that she believes in hard science and has no concept of religion as she was not raised in a religious household. For the rest of the date, the energy between us seemed to be off.

She texted me the next day saying she had a good time and asked if I was free the following week. I agreed to go out with her again and we came up with a day to meet. The next day, I texted her with plans for the date and she didn't seem very enthusiastic about it. She texted me not long after that we should just be friends but I know she was just trying to let me know she was no longer interested.

It has been two weeks since that happened and I'm struggling to move on. We got along well, have similar personalities/values and were attracted to each other. I get the feeling that she was no longer interested due to me mentioning that I'm a Christian.

I've struggled with my stance on religion for a long time. I was raised in a Christian Baptist household and was heavily involved in the church growing up. However, throughout my life I've always questioned whether God was real or not because there doesn't seem to be any concrete evidence that anything stated in the Bible is true.

I've done some self-reflection on where I truly am with religion and came to the conclusion that I'm agnostic. I have always attached the word ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù to my identity so when people ask me if I'm religious, I tell them I'm Christian. But deep down, I know I'm not. I struggle with the fact that I‚Äôm not a Christian because the church has conditioned me to think that if I‚Äôm anything other than a Christian, I‚Äôm going to hell. It's a constant struggle but I'm learning how to be comfortable with being agnostic.

7,scjuxv,1643133980,Ex boyfriend broke up with me two months ago and now he wants me back,"Me and my ex (both 22) had been dating for a little over a year. We had our arguments like any other couple. The relationship started to turn sour once he left for the navy. Him leaving definitely put a strain on our relationship. For the first two months we couldn‚Äôt have any contact with each other( only through letters). Then after that, he could only talk to me after a certain time in the day (no text, no calls until then). We argued a lot mostly because I felt like he couldn‚Äôt be there for me like I needed. Let‚Äôs say, I was having a panic attack or I was having a bad day I couldn‚Äôt pick up and call him or even just text him to have him calm me down during the moment. So pretty much I was left to deal with it emotionally on my own. Which I know wasn‚Äôt even his fault but still it put a huge strain on us. We had other issues as well but I feel like the distance only magnified them and it got to a point where we were arguing almost every day

He ended up breaking up with me through a text, the day after thanksgiving. He basically sent me a long paragraph saying how he felt that we weren‚Äôt growing etc always arguing and he still wanted to be friends. I told him that I couldn‚Äôt be friends with him and that it‚Äôs best if we cut off all contact. I was hurt and took those feelings out on social media. I didn‚Äôt say anything bad about him but did retweet some tweets on Twitter which he took offense too. I admit it wasn‚Äôt the best way to handle things and I have already apologized to him about that. 

A week later I got into a minor accident which he heard about through his mom (I was on the way to drop off his things from my apartment to her when it happened). He reached out to check up on me, we were okay for a few days and then I basically broke down and told him that I missed him and wanted us back together etc. He basically rejected me all over again saying he wants to be single, we‚Äôre not meant for each other etc. I was heartbroken all over again and told him that we shouldn‚Äôt stay in contact. 

For backstory, every time we would argue I would tell him that I needed space to cool off and he would never listen. He would blow up my phone calling me 30+ plus times and constantly sending me messages. It got to the point where I would have to block him to stop the calls. All of my Apple devices are connected so every time he would call I would have all of my devices ringing at the same time and it would drive me crazy.  I would tell him over and over to give me space during our arguments but he would never listen. I started feeling suffocated and told him that we should take a break from each other to give each other space atleast until he gets back from the navy. When I would tell him that he‚Äôd start crying and saying how he can‚Äôt live without me and insinuating that he would kill himself. I ended up just giving in and making up.

A month passes and during that time he had been texting me trying to check up on me all of which I ignored. He would slide up on my snap chat stories and send me relationship videos on Tik Tok as if we were still together. One day he sends me a message basically saying that the reason he kept texting me was he still wanted us to be together and wanted to see if I would  fight to keep us together like he did when I told him I needed a break. 

When he tells me this, I just snapped. I couldn‚Äôt believe he would put me through all of this heartbreak as a test. I told him he was right we weren‚Äôt meant for each other and that I was done and didn‚Äôt want anything to do with him. I told him how manipulative he is and how I wasn‚Äôt playing his mind games anymore. He starts saying that he didn‚Äôt think I would move on so quickly and that he was hurt that I downloaded dating apps so soon after we broke up. He said he thought about what I said and that sometimes breaks are needed. I told him that asking for a break and actually choosing to break up with someone aren‚Äôt the same thing. If he just wanted a break why didn‚Äôt he just say that to begin with. I‚Äôd been the main one advocating for us to take a break and I would have agreed had he just came to me. Instead he let me believe for weeks that he was completely done with me and didn‚Äôt want me anymore. Not to mention he did it over a text. 

A couple days later I dropped off his things from my apartment along with all the gifts I received from him (Jewelry, letters he wrote me). I told myself that I was done and I needed to preserve what little self respect I still had. Three weeks later and now I‚Äôm starting to miss him and think maybe I made a mistake. He‚Äôll be coming back soon from the navy and I have a feeling he‚Äôll want us to have a conversation. I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll say when I see him or what I want to do moving forward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scjuxv/ex_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_two_months_ago_and/

Over time, I really got to know him and I started seeing him as someone I could trust and someone that genuinely liked me.

He would tell me all the time that I was special and that he wasn‚Äôt interested in anyone else, and because I was working on being open to trusting men again, I let myself believe it. I even hopped off of dating apps just because it was depressing me seeing it on my phone (I hadn‚Äôt swiped in months) and we seemed to have a good thing going.

Fast forward to now, and I was sensing that he was acting different. On a whim I downloaded the dating app where we had met and saw that he had updated his to say ‚Äújust want to see what‚Äôs out there.‚Äù On one hand, he never formally asked me to be his girlfriend, but on another he told me he didn‚Äôt want me talking to anyone else. I‚Äôm a little bit blindsided and definitely hurt. 

Now I don‚Äôt really want to talk to him anymore but I also want to break things off. He told me at the beginning that he never wants to waste my time and even reassured me recently that he really wanted to see me and if he had any desire to leave he‚Äôd let me know.

November 2021 I signed up with Match and met quite a few guys on it. However, after my experiences with ghosting and fake BS with a lot of guys on Match I decided to let my account expire and be done with it. With that, there were a couple of guys that seemed sincere that I wanted to continue talking to so I exchanged numbers with them before my account expired. They all eventually fell off the face of the earth except for one. He lives 200 miles away from me but I can handle that and so could he. He and I continued to text and it eventually became daily and sometimes we would talk on the phone. On Christmas Eve he asked me to be his exclusive gf so I agreed. It seemed promising so we decided to meet up. Since I have access to various timeshares I decided to go to him not to mention I needed to get away and go on a vacation away from home.  Leading up to the meeting we would continue to talk every day and he would be his usual sweet self and compliment me and I him, you know all that giddy BS. We were so happy to finally have a plan set in stone be able to meet each other. The night before we meet we are talking on the phone and he proceeds to tell me about his teeth and that he‚Äôs self conscious about them and some eczema spots and hoped I wouldn‚Äôt judge him. I‚Äôm not that type of person and explained that to him.  I told him that I have some acne scaring on my face that I feel the same way about and hoped he wouldn‚Äôt judge me negatively for it. Well when we meet for the first time I am so nervous about the way I look from the acne scars that at dinner I need a glass of wine to calm my nerves.  He has some alcohol as well to calm his nerves. After dinner we go back to the timeshare and watch some tv and I cuddle up next to him and he‚Äôs good with that. Then he starts gently feeling my side where my boob bulged out. Next thing I know things are getting, you know lol, and we are both ok with it. We are kissing and having fun etc. However, he‚Äôs having trouble staying hard and the condom won‚Äôt go on and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs me like am I repulsive, or awful or what?  He said it‚Äôs him bc he drank too much the night before. So we ended up not doing anything after all bc he had his troubles. I didn‚Äôt knock him for it. I was understanding and kind and suggested that we try it again sometime before I leave to go home from vacation. He decided to sleep on the sleeper sofa in the living room while I slept in the bed for the night bc he likes to sleep with tv on and I don‚Äôt. I felt sad but didn‚Äôt mention it. The next day and all the days after he acted very cold and distant towards me. We went out on one more date after that and the next day I went home. All the plans we made were not fulfilled and I went home 4 days early.  When I got home I finally had the guts to ask if were were still an exclusive couple and he said he wanted to just be friends. He said that the relationship was moving too fast for him. I told him that I kind of thought so too but still wanted to be exclusive with him. He made excises about how he probably wouldn‚Äôt be good for me. This is upsetting to me and I take that as I probably am repulsive and scared him off (didn‚Äôt tell him that lol). What else could it be, he was one person one week and a completely different person the next. I told him that if we were going to be friends that I would need time to separate myself from the situation and fully process it. He understood.

67,scq5uh,1643150891,"Guy I‚Äôm dating has depression and agreed to space, now what?","I have been dating a guy (42) for 2 months I‚Äôm (30) f but have known him for a year, in that year he had tried to date me but at that time I wasn't in the place to date. He then stopped trying and 8 months later came back and tried again and I agreed to date him.

Our first date was amazing we hit it off really well and was non stop laughing and talking, we would talk on the phone a lot everyday and was excited to keep dating and to see where it lead. After a few dates I then went to his house for the weekend, as soon as I got there he had brought me a big bouquet of flowers and my favourite chocolate and again we had the best weekend together. When I went home on the Monday I noticed he wasn't as talkative as he normally was and just put this down to me overthinking as I do have an anxious attachment as I'm so used to people running off. Over the next few days I kept noticing it even though we was still speaking it was a few messages a day whereas before I couldn't get him off the phone. I mentioned it to him and he opened up and told me he had been on anti depressants but was slowly coming off them as he doesn't want to be on tablets but is having down days and assured me I haven't done anything wrong. He has previously mentioned he was feeling anxious, sick, tired before I knew about depression but I didn't think too much of it.

I was supportive and we spoke about it and I opened up to him aswell how I had an ex bf lie he was depressed while he was out trying to pull other girls while I was grieving my grandad passing away so in a way it had triggered me the same thing was happening again. Things were fine and again we was getting on and he would start calling me randomly to keep communication going. I then surprised him by sending him his favourite donuts to his house to try make him smile while he was struggling.

A few weeks after this I went to his for the weekend and as I was there I noticed he wasn't really with it it was like he was physically there but not mentally. He was fidgeting really bad and being anxious and nearly crashed his car twice by not concentrating. He was quiet compared to how he usually is, anyway we had a date night of bowling and mc donalds and he seemed to be better as the date went on. The next day he cooked for us and we spent the afternoon chilling watching this netflix series we were glued to.

I tried calling him the day after as I was travelling to work which I always do, and it went straight to voicemail so I messaged him to say I had tried calling him but was now at work this was at 6pm and he didn't read my message until the next morning but had been online numerous times. I have told him if he is feeling crap to just tell me and communicate with him, as when he doesn't message me but is online it makes him wonder and makes me think who is now getting the attention that I used to have.

I told him I have told him how I've felt about sometimes his behaviour and how it makes me feel and he has always said he is sorry, has tried to sort things out with me, has reassured me. I know I have trust issues and need reassurance but all I ask for is consistency. Again I noticed it happen the next day so I told him I think we need space as he is now making me anxious and its not fair on me when I'm the one who is there for him and supports him no matter what.  He replied with ""he isn't out to cause me pain or anxiety or even upset me and he can see by him not being himself mentally he isn't giving me the attention I need which isn't fair. So maybe if we do give it a little space he can sort himself out and he is booked in to see a counsellor next week and how he wants me to know none of this is me that has caused this and he plans on getting back to normal ASAP and hopes we can pick up where we left off and can treat me how I deserve to be treated"".

I am scared he is using it as an excuse as I have been here before, do you think he is using it as an excuse? do you think he could come back?

68,scq976,1643151132,How can I (22f) stop feeling like my BF (23m) treats his friends better than me?,"I‚Äôm not asking to be treated better than his friends; I just sometimes feel like I‚Äôm not even treated as equal to his friends. 

These are examples in the relationship that I remember:

He went on an out of state trip with his friends to visit another friend. They stayed at their friend‚Äôs apartment. My bf cooked breakfast for all of them unprompted, while he‚Äôs never offered to make breakfast for me whenever I stayed over at his house. I never thought to ask him because it never crossed my mind to have him make breakfast for me. However, just the fact that he did it for his friends without asking, and not once for me when I didn‚Äôt ask either, raises my eyebrows. 

Another example is when his friend/manager called my bf to tell him that his (the manager‚Äôs) parents got into a car crash. I was a little shocked at how gently he consoled the friend because he‚Äôs never just told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù about my problems. He also told him that if he needed anything, my bf will be there. My bf has never offered to come over to me to ‚Äúbe there‚Äù during my low points. Granted, I haven‚Äôt recently faced anything as serious as a car crash or my family being injured, but I had low moments in my personal life too. 

I remember having a huge fight over money with my parents, and called my bf crying, but his reaction was very stern and impatient with me. He even chastised me for calling him at an inconvenient moment. (I don‚Äôt remember what exactly.) However, his manager/friend called him at an ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù moment too; my bf and I were out in a restaurant when he got the call. I can‚Äôt help but feel like if I called my bf about an emotional issue when he was with friends at a restaurant, he‚Äôd be very short with me. 

I‚Äôve talked to him about this, and he argues that he actually treats me better, a lot better even, than his friends. I know it‚Äôs not healthy to always take note of when my bf does something nice for a friend that he didn‚Äôt do for me, but I can‚Äôt help but feel sad, jealous, or left out when I do.

Am I in a relationship with someone who puts his friends on a pedestal? Or am I looking too much into it? I need advice on how to bounce back from all this, or if you have any suggestions on how I should bring this up to my bf, please tell me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scq976/how_can_i_22f_stop_feeling_like_my_bf_23m_treats/

How do you define ""casual"" dating?
When or with which actions would you define it as something more serious?



Background:
I am not looking for a dedicated relationship right now, because I don't feel ready as I am still in the divorce process. (Hopefully final by April.)
This is what I communicate(d) very clearly with the man I am currently dating. He said he is ok with that.
We had 5 dates in total by now and enjoy each others company.

Somewhat understandably he is asking a lot of questions also related to my ex husband and the past relationship. Fair questions, but also difficult for me because in the end my ex was emotional abusive: cheating, blameshifting, tickle thruthing, gaslighting, lying... I finally ended it.
 
I am not sure where to draw the line with the questions, and I kind of guess that maybe he (my date) is hoping for me to open up and to have a ""real"" relationship in the end?

Also of course I will talk to him directly about it, but just curious to hear your thoughts, as he is asking very detailed and private questions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scqfzf/casual_dating_your_definition_or_where_do_you/

75,scr36o,1643153398,Me and this girl I (still) like ‚Äúfizzled out‚Äù after initially seeming to hit it off.,"Long post warning‚Ä¶ 
So she first started showing interest in me years ago even back when I was 16/17 years old (I‚Äôm 23M now; she‚Äôs 25F). Back then we were young kids and she went to a school across town so we never really did anything or dated, but I remember her friend saying she was into me at that time.

Over the years she contacted me periodically and showed interest even going as far as to say things like ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôd marry you someday‚Äù which I thought was a lot, but it did make me feel good just hearing someone say that as I‚Äôve never dated anyone before. 
I‚Äôm fairly attractive, and she has said things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre hot; you‚Äôre so cute it‚Äôs disgusting etc.‚Äù, and I know I‚Äôm decent looking with a good head on my shoulders. I have had opportunities to date girls in the past, but I‚Äôve ultimately never initiated because I always focused heavily on finances over the last several years. I desire financial freedom and wealth; it‚Äôs something high on my priority list. 

Well me focusing on wealth turned out favorably because I amassed close to a million dollars earlier this year (bought cryptocurrencies years ago which really helped). 
So after years of her showing mild interest from time to time, and it not going anywhere, after she finds out I‚Äôve been successful monetarily she really becomes more forward and eager to hangout, flirt etc. says she‚Äôs been ‚Äúmanifesting me for months‚Äù
I‚Äôm comfortable financially now so I‚Äôm like ‚Äúsure why not? She‚Äôs cute. I think she‚Äôs cool, and I‚Äôm open to seeing where things go.‚Äù
We are going great in my mind. Getting to know each other and communicating well. I‚Äôm inexperienced dating, but she seems naturally forward and is wanting to see me after talking for some time on messaging apps. She sees my parent in town and tells me about it and I said jokingly ‚Äúyou should‚Äôve introduced yourself,‚Äù to which she replied ‚ÄúYeah I should‚Äôve told them I‚Äôm trying to fuck their son.‚Äù
Ok ball is clearly in my court now so i invite her to my house (I live alone), and she comes over. We talk about life and how school is going for her. Things seem well compatibility wise and we are clearly attracted to each other. We end up having sex and she stays two nights at my place. We eat out and mutually love breakfast food and many of the same movies, songs, culture things. When she goes to leave, she tells me what a great time she had and how I exceeded all expectations. Cool, I‚Äôm like this going great. She comes over a couple of more times over that summer and things continue going great with us just hanging out, having sex, watching movies, talking about life. 

Now I need to say over this time she‚Äôs struggling with drug usage to prescription medication (she‚Äôs not prescribed, but possibly could be) with the intention to go clean as soon as summer ends and her PhD program starts. I have not done drugs before this for years and only partook occasionally when she came over because she‚Äôd bring adderall and weed for me like a gift which I thought was kinda cool just like ‚Äúok this is what people that date do they give things.‚Äù I‚Äôve done both adderall and weed before and have nothing against either. I actually just got prescribed it for ADHD. I never once judged her for her usage, and I supported her going clean. 
She said I was the first guy to ask her if she was ok with this before we started doing any substance and was the first to show compassion towards it.
She did have almost this ‚Äúsave me mentality‚Äù which I‚Äôve recently started learning about codependency after this situation. She has issues with her dad we scratched the surface on but bottom line, he‚Äôs in prison.
After things were going great for much of the summer we had a falling out one of the last days of summer over what seemed to me miscommunication. She really overreacted over something that seemed small, and wouldn‚Äôt talk it out like I feel like people seeing each other should do. We were hanging out at a fair with rides etc. and she had gotten messed up with alcohol and drugs but I said we could go to my friends place and just cuddle and chill out which we did. Well my friend ends up coming back with some other guy and they have a threesome with this girl a few beds over while we‚Äôre in the room which was weird for me. I‚Äôm sex shy I guess but she seemed cool about it at the time and was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it it‚Äôs no big deal‚Äù. But that next morning she was a different person. She ultimately blamed it on ‚Äúoh the drug I took made me rebound and act weird the next morning‚Äù. But it felt different after that. We kept texting and talking but it still felt different, like she respected me less. She also blew off a few times we were supposed to hangout which hurt me because we were set to hangout and her excuses were vague and odd. I give her the benefit of doubt.

We keep talking for a while and she starts the recovery process which I support. We seem to be going back to good terms and things are going well and so we set up a date. I drive a few hours to go see her where she goes to school but I‚Äôm so anxious about seeing her the next day I don‚Äôt sleep at all the night before. 

I somewhat jokingly say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night. This might be bad to ask but I could use some adderall so I‚Äôm not a total zombie seeing you.‚Äù 
I IMMEDIATELY realize that‚Äôs NOT what you say to someone in recovery so I say it‚Äôs really no big deal at all I‚Äôm just joking but I really didn‚Äôt sleep last night.

Well she‚Äôs off at this point. Says ‚ÄúWe are done here. Don‚Äôt talk to me anymore etc.‚Äù Just will not listen to me at all. Blocks me which she reverses like a few hours later once she calms down. 
I‚Äôm desperately trying to patch things and let her know how I feel about her and how it was just some very dumb impulsive thing I said because I didn‚Äôt want to be a zombie on our date but I should‚Äôve thought about how it came across.

She still just isn‚Äôt having it and so I give her some space as I should.

Well about a week and a half later she sends me a message saying ‚ÄúI think I have a boyfriend now‚Äù 

Why would she tell me that? I told her that hurt me her saying that because she knows I still like her. But I try to play it cool to and so I say after I make my feelings known ‚Äúif that‚Äôs what you want out of life it‚Äôs your choice.‚Äù

She goes to a wedding with him and makes sure to take pictures hanging out with him which just upsets me but I try to ignore and live my life.
I feel down know they were nothing more than her trying to make me jealous (which I was ultimately right about) because they ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù like a few weeks later. 

She sends me the occasional Snapchat and we had even talked about hanging out again which she seemed enthusiastic about. Cool. So I plan a date with her and the day comes around and her friend from out of town just happens to surprise visit that day so she‚Äôs with them all day. I ask her ‚Äú what‚Äôs up?‚Äù And she doesn‚Äôt respond. Ok. I go on living my life.

Fast forward another couple of weeks she sends me another Snapchat saying ‚ÄúI would literally suck dick to pay my rent.‚Äù
I‚Äôm like are you serious? And she says yes.
I think on that for a day and decide I‚Äôm just going to pay her rent with no strings attached because like I said I‚Äôm financially great right now and her family is not really with her also working towards a PhD so I see it as just a good deed for me to do and I let her know she does not have to pay it back just to see it as a gift. I‚Äôm not interested in making someone suck my dick for rent if they don‚Äôt want to..

She seems really grateful for that and says I should come see her when she gets moved into her knew place. A part of me feels like she‚Äôs saying that out of obligation, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt still into her and would love to see her.
But she is no where near the level she was at even at the beginning of her ‚Äúlove bombing phase‚Äù and I feel like I get little affection from her now. Someone may say: move on, but I don‚Äôt care to. I really like her. I couldn‚Äôt see myself with another girl right now and I want to try to fix this. I would love outside advice though. 

P.s. For reference she brought up the movie ‚Äú500 days of Summer‚Äù often which we both liked, but if you‚Äôve seen the movie you know it‚Äôs take on dating and love isn‚Äôt a fairy tale.

79,scrnun,1643154973,"I didn't love my ex anymore, but still feel sad about how I left him","We were together on and off for five years. We were vastly different people when we first met. It was both of our first serious relationship. We lost our virginity together.

I had been frustrated and unhappy for a long time - I wanted to get married, yes, but more than anything else, I wanted to have a baby. Five years I waited, though, and nothing changed. COVID striking the world was where the tides began to turn. It was a real eye opener in many ways, and things began to sour. Among other things, he was living with his Mother at the time, and she would not permit me to visit for a very long time. 

We always spent time together there, because he has severe cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, and my house was not accessible. I was hurting a lot, we spent a lot of time apart, and our relationship suffered. My heart was breaking.

Christmas Day of last year was pretty much where things fell apart completely. I had come over to stay and when I walked in the door he would barely say hello to me or give me a hug. I was in tears most of the night, and left heartbroken early the next morning.

However, I tried to continue a wary sort of friendship with him, because his Father was terminally ill with cancer. I felt so sorry for him, and wanted to be supportive.

His Father passed away at the end of January. I tried my best to be there for him through the whole process of grieving. I went with him on several visits to the cemetery afterwards to help him get to the grave and lay flowers. I only wanted to help. I cared, but I really didn't consider us a couple anymore.

I met another man in May and was swept off my feet. He gave me a ring on our second date. We are perfect for each other, we understand each other, and above all, are on the same page with our priorities and what we want in life.

My ex knew about all of this. I told him everything.

Then, at the end of July... he suddenly appears with an engagement ring and proposes to me, says I'm the love of his life and desperately wants to be with me again. White gold set with emeralds. He even promised we could finally have a baby. I accepted because there were other people present and  I felt pressured... but, my heart was not in it. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.

I was suffering from severe depression, and was even hospitalized from a drug overdose. He supported me through that.

I do believe he loved me, but I did not love him anymore. My heart had suffered and been broken too many times. I do not believe there was anything either of us could have done that would have made the other truly happy.

A couple weeks later, in August... I left his ring behind for my Mother to return. I packed up and left town without a word to anyone, to be with the man I had fallen in love with.

We had a mutual desire to have a child, and I found out I was pregnant a month and a half later in September. We are expecting a baby boy in June.

I'm deeply in love with my partner and couldn't be happier that we will be parents soon. Yet... I still feel sad that I broke things off with my ex the way I did.

He was in contact with my Mother at least once after I left; she returned the ring. Apparently, he said he would always love me, even though, again, he knew about everything.

He did text me once, I can't remember when because I didn't keep it (and deleted+blocked his number). His last words to me were, ""I don't believe you would just walk away from everything you love, and the people who love you"".

I know it was wrong. Everything I did... I should have done it differently. I was in such a bad place at the time, mentally... I was abusing drugs and alcohol (something I have thankfully since been able to stop), on a steep downward spiral and would have been dead soon, one way or another (the drug overdose was a suicide attempt, though of course I refused to admit that to anyone).

I didn't believe for two seconds that anyone could help me, or really cared what was happening to me. Something had to change. I needed to just... break free, or else, I knew death was coming for me.

I am haunted by it all. I never wanted to hurt him... never... but I know that I did through my actions, more than words can say. I no longer loved him, but I did care. I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for that.

Can I ever in any way, make this any better? I will not contact him directly of course, because I genuinely do not wish cause him any more hurt... yet... I don't know. I want to do something, yet is there anything I can do?...

...Perhaps, there is no redemption for me. I will eternally suffer for the anguish I have caused multiple people... and it is well deserved.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scrnun/i_didnt_love_my_ex_anymore_but_still_feel_sad/
80,scrw8a,1643155586,I think I am likely getting ghosted by a girl I went on 8-9 dates with over about 6 weeks. Venting and need some advice.,"Title.

I went on about 8-9 dates with a girl I met from Hinge since December. Things between her and I were going great; dates were always fun, she told me how she was really into me and liked me, and we had a great sex life. On Saturday she asked me what she thought about us and I said that I was really into her and really want to see where things go. She expressed the same and how she thinks I'm great/wonderful.

About midway through the day Sunday she starts to get very short when texting me. This continues on into Monday and I ask her if everything is okay and she says ""Yes"" and how sometimes she ""can't put in as much effort as she likes"" sometimes. We texted a little bit more throughout the day before she hit me with a ""K."" I texted her this morning with ""Good morning"" with no responses and another text at around 2ish (i.e., ""I hope your day has been going well so far""). It has now been about 24 hours since I've heard from her. She has checked my IG story that I posted today.

Although we both stated that we were not seeing other people, there was definitely a ""male friend"" that she had that seemed really sus. There was a time when she called off a date with me then mention that she was ""with a friend and he"" on that day we were suppose to see each other. I would think that she is likely more into that guy than me. She has also lied to me about other information like when her last relationship ended (i.e., said in February but has a romantic video with some guy on her Tik Tok from May). All of that put a sour taste in my mouth even if things would have worked out. None of my friends like/liked her and they wanted me to end it with her as they thought she was toxic/playing me. A few of my friends thought that I was likely her ""back up"" for this other guy.

I don't expect a full explanation from her, but I wish she would just send me a quick ""Hey I don't see this working out I wish you the best"" or whatever text especially given the amount of time we spent together on dates and texting.  Although I know it's for the best I still feel a little bummed about it.

87,sct02v,1643158677,Please offer your opinion,"I have been close friends with a coworker of mine for close to five years now. I have always been secretely in love with her but she was dating this guy the whole time so I kinda had to stuff it. I quit the job for a half a year and had to go back to find out they broke up. We closed the store together the other night and we went home she was snapping me. I won't describe the whole conversation but to summarize we finally talked about us and she said she isn't in a place right now where she wants a romantic relationship or anything physical and she just wants to figure out herself right now, and I told her that's fine and if stay friends I'm here for that and if we get to being more than that in the future I'm here for that too but I'm here either way... and then she sent me a nude and said that's all she can do right now. Basically my question for y'all is do you think I would be pushing things if I asked her to just hang out and watch a movie or something, I really just wanna spend time with her but I don't want to come across like I'm just asking in hope of something physical. I really like this girl alot and I don't wanna fuck things up. Please help me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sct02v/please_offer_your_opinion/

91,sctwvz,1643161267,Let's say you don't have confidence. What's your plan B?,"I mean, I'm confident in several areas of my life. I'm great working with people who have dementia. I'm good at teaching. I don't tremble at the thought of folding a fitted sheet. 

I mean, I'm even fairly confident with women when it comes to small talk or having a casual conversation. What I have absolutely no confidence in is my ability to tell a woman that I would like to see more of her (both in frequency and quantity) in a manner that would both in a way that would either result in success, or at least not be awkward if it didn't. 

I have had a few girlfriends over the years, but those were kind of...weird circumstances. More of a failure to recognize red flags rather than being successful.

So...what do I do? Be single forever? Or is there a way to develop confidence despite all of the evidence pointing towards that confidence being unwarranted?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sctwvz/lets_say_you_dont_have_confidence_whats_your_plan/

There was a 30-40 year age gap between the guy and I. Thus, I wasn‚Äôt putting out any hints of being interested at all whatsoever. Had a good night, we all went out separate ways after adding each other on fb. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since that night. But, I have received a bunch of vulgar messages suggesting I was interested and this was communicated some how‚Ä¶. I am not interested for the record and ignores these messages and then the phone calls began.. which I also ignored. About 8 in total. I was also added to a random group chat with other women I didn‚Äôt know and that man. Well today‚Ä¶. I received a screenshot from my friend that apparently he has put that he‚Äôs in a relationship with me on fb‚Ä¶. During a year I didn‚Äôt exist (1972).

What do i say to this? I don‚Äôt know how to handle it properly. Clearly, this is a delicate situation‚Ä¶ forgot to mention he was also high on speed , or so he stated‚Ä¶

Yes I recognize that for many, this is taking it slow. But I want to focus on building an emotional relationship instead of rushing into the physical part. He took it pretty well at the time. We‚Äôve been texting since the talk, but it‚Äôs awkward and his tone sounds more aloof. I don‚Äôt blame him but also saw that he posted a story without texting me back (even though I‚Äôm not following his account). We do have an upcoming date scheduled but I worry that it‚Äôll just keep getting more awkward, especially because we still have to wait a few more days. He prefers texting, but should I call him? Was I wrong to speak up, and is he wrong to post without texting me? Is it better for me to cool off or try to be warmer to him?
