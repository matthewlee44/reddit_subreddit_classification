I have been playfully flirting with someone for about a month and it lead up to us hooking up on Sunday. It was the first time we hung out 1:1 and it was so‚Ä¶ great. 

He‚Äôs amazing and satisfying my sexual needs and it was just a fun, stress free time. I was only there for a couple of hours but it was perfect. 

He‚Äôs been messaging me daily inquiring about how my day is going/what I‚Äôm doing. Both of us aren‚Äôt HUGE into small talk but he‚Äôs been initiating it.

I really want to see him once this weekend. Would it be bad if I casually texted him saying I want to see him again?

As I was leaving he said he wants to see me again so I feel like it‚Äôs ok but I just haven‚Äôt done this in so long!! Should I text him today? Tomorrow?

This is just modern day natural selection . It‚Äôs always been like this, but now that the internet connects us all we can see it so much more clearly. In the past less than half of all men reproduced while nearly all women did. This hasn‚Äôt changed. I‚Äôm just a genetic failure. That explains why all of my male relative have had girlfriends and relationships and I‚Äôm 22 and I haven‚Äôt even had my first kiss. It‚Äôs just not possible for me and it‚Äôs no ones fault but my genetics.

This is why more than half of men my age are virgins and less than a third of women are. It‚Äôs uncontrollable. It‚Äôs just human nature. I‚Äôm not fit to reproduce, experience physical intimacy or find love simply because I‚Äôm not a top tier man.

So I just decided to give up. I‚Äôm not handsome enough, I‚Äôm too short, I‚Äôm a minority in my country and I have depression and aspergers.

Personally i am not good looking, but i do have a great personality so i‚Äôm successful with dating and it‚Äôs the same for guys. 
yes, looks matter a little bit, but personality is so much more important, the ratio is probably 25:75 or around that for most people. 
yes, you will get some women and people who value appearance over personality ( but i highly recommend you don‚Äôt date people like that anyway) 
If you think the reason your unsuccessful with dating because of your appearance, more likely than not, it‚Äôs not because of your appearance, it‚Äôs most likely because of your personality, vibe, interest, etc.

I eventually broke up with her and after the hurt from the break up was over we‚Äôve texted each other occasionally ‚Äì like, ‚ÄúI found X of yours, do you want it?‚Äù and sometimes just to say hi.

16,oy7nmp,1628128545,This stuff gets confusing something,"Kinda long but a little context needed to get some of an idea.

I think I‚Äôve never been ghosted (I‚Äôm 30), at least not by anyone I knew to this extent. Not gonna lie, it does suck at first cause you don‚Äôt know why it went from hot to ice cold so quick. Just be straight. We‚Äôre not strangers. I know I‚Äôm dodging a bullet here, but it sucks cause she is a cool ass girl.

So I worked with this girl for a few months. I never made a move cause she was in a LDR. Little to no contact over next year, but I‚Äôm into her and I know she digs me to a certain extent based on a couple things I won‚Äôt say to not make this any longer. Couple months ago, invites me and old coworkers to her bday party. We fall asleep on couch together. Nothing happened.

Hit her up a month later, invite her out for my bday. We go out night before and night of. We have a blast. Bunch of her friends meet up, they all love me according to her. Sleeps over both nights, but barely hookup (too drunk/hungover for sex). Morning after, watch movies, cuddle, caressing, she initiates make out with me. SHE kisses me on lips goodbye. Her texts later, very into me, complimenting. So I‚Äôm like ok this is different.

Next week, invites me to her friend‚Äôs party a couple weeks out. After two failed meetups that weekend, in my head I‚Äôm like forget it.

We text few days later, reminds me that I‚Äôm going to the party with her, asks if I want to watch a movie. Comes over. Watch a movie, foreplay, have sex, but I can‚Äôt finish lol. Don‚Äôt think it was bad for either us, but I know I‚Äôm better. I‚Äôm a confident dude. Was just overthinking. After, she cuddles, lays head on my chest, caressing my chest, initiates make out with me. Asks me if I want her to stay or leave. I say stay. Sleeps over. She kisses me on lips goodbye in the morning while I‚Äôm sleeping.

Text her almost a week later, no response till next day. Says she‚Äôs been busy. That party comes a few days later. She never hits me up. I knew she was ghosting, but a couple days later, like an idiot, I ask if she‚Äôs free later in the week. Apologizes for being so busy, asks what day, I give a couple options, she picks Saturday. I say cool Sat night and she hearts my text. Ghosted on saturday. Never hit her up again.

A week later, my friend sees her out and tells her that she‚Äôs ‚Äúkinda‚Äù ghosting me and is working shit out with her LDR. Don‚Äôt even know if she was ever single, on a break or whatever. Her working it out doesn‚Äôt bother me. We weren‚Äôt dating and I was fine with just a NSA hookup whether it was one time or more.

It‚Äôs when SHE started showing lots of affection, intimacy and inviting me out where I was like ok, i‚Äôll ride this wave. But since she ghosted after a night of sex, I‚Äôm like was it the sex? It would SUCK to get ghosted cause of that. But why stay, be intimate, kiss me on the lips goodbye in the AM? Was she just using me for some sex cause she needed it? Fine, I like sex, but why all the intimacy, why hang out with me and be all over me in front of your friends and invite me out to hang with them?

Long story short, we started texting. It was slow at first but then eventually he asked me to hang out. We did and he just showed me a house he had built. He then asked me if I wanted to go to a show he had tickets for in September. A few weeks later, he‚Äôs texting me while I‚Äôm on vacation and it‚Äôs going well.

21,oy8193,1628129898,(25F/21M) My date just stood me up and ghosted on my Birthday.,"*Before telling my story I think it'd be appropriate to clarify that I have been in long relationships before (which lasted a while) and I'm pretty much aware of how dating works. Not an Expert but I can navigate the scene. I have been ghosted before this situationship too*

I am 25F and I had 6 dates with this guy, this ""no labels thing-y"" lasted 1 month. I know, I know: it's such a short period of time but time is not the point here.

He added me on FB in March and liked all my daily posts until June came and that's when he sent the first message my way. After talking for a couple of days he asked me out, so:

* First date: he came to see me, we talked a lot and didn't kiss, just hugged goodnight. It was ok.

* Second date should have happened after a few days, he made plans to see each other after work just to  disappear later that night. The next day he told me he was so so sorry, I got mad but then wanted to act cool cause ye, it's just the /Biggest Red Flag/, what could go wrong, right? But I wanted to act cool (as much as it sounds nonsense) and I restarted texting back. He asked again and that Second date ""finally"" happened.
That was INTENSE. We kissed, he massaged my feet, we took a walk. It was romantic and sensual without getting awkward or ""too fishy"". 
It's when he started showing more interest via text too.
He also asked if I wanted to spend my Birthday with him.

**3RD/4TH/5TH happened one after the other**

* Third date: he works in a hotel, there's a pool too so yeah, I went to see him after work. We chilled, kissed etc but nothing super intimate. He pushed for sex a bit but told me he could wait, just not wanted to. It was sweet. We talked a lot.
Just right after the date he he literally sent me 
""I have never felt like this, maybe when I was a kid. This is unique. Looking in your eyes makes me feel free to be myself. I can not explain it, it's only been 3 weeks and here we are. It seems like we have been doing this for so long but it was the first time I could keep eye contact w/ someone for so long""
Yeah. Enough said.

* Fourth-Fifth Dates: that's when we started getting intimate. Messed around on the 4TH, had sex on the 5TH. 
The night we started getting somewhat intimate he took me to a bar and had a drink, he revealed he accepted a job out of region and he was going to move there. He asked me if I was willing to go see him sometime. 
Also, I am currently looking for a job and my CV matches with his so he said he might ask if there was still an open position. I took that lightly and said we shall see. (no, he was not drunk LOL)

Sex was great with him, we also had fun several times that night. When I got home he texted: see, I am still here (????) I was never willing to walk away. 

That's when things started going downhill though. I didn't realize at first but now it's clear.

* Sixth date was 2 days ago. I told him I'd like to see him. Yeah, I am straightforward. He said: then come see me.
I went, we had fun you know but there was something missing. He was distant in a way, distracted. 
While having sex I told him that for me that... Uhm, type of activity... Was exclusive to him only. He responded ""Same here. We got to this point, seeing others would make no sense"" . During that night I tried to get to know him better but also realized he didn't make that much of an effort to do the same with me.
We kissed goodnight and he promised me he would come and take me somewhere on my Birthday (which is today) and... That's the last time I saw him.

Texts started becoming drier than usual, he also made a comment/joke about how my sister is almost hotter than me and that turned me off completely. How dare you tbh.
That's when he turned me off but since my friends are either out of town or worked I decided to stick to the plan and see if he'd either surprise me or be an A$$hOle. Sometimes I'm just curious/masochist to see how red the Red Flag can get.

Today he started pulling away, I had to ask him for tonight and he said yes, I wanna see you of course...... Just to straight up come back with a big excuse I saw coming ""since I'm leaving my work position here my colleagues threw me a party, we'll have some wine and a slice of cake""
How dare you pt2. He didn't apologize, he didn't feel bad about the thought of doing this on my Birthday (which was planned seeing his texts from today and yesterday) .
He could have just said ""Hey, do something else. / I am not ready. / I have something else going on. / Don't wait for me. / I do not like you go out and enjoy your time"" 
He didn't LOL. I confronted him and he ghosted, just to hide his IG stories from me.

One of my best friends follows one of his friends and saw him reposting a story with my Ex-date or whatever.
I went to check this boy IG and he hid his IG stories from me as well... He doesn't even know me wtf how lame is that. 
Why is confrontation so hard for some people?

I do not care about losing the possibility to bond with this person, I care about the lack of respect. He didn't owe me anything and I'm ok about that but two days ago he told me we were exclusive, ""since we got to that point it was obvious"". I am not the type to go sleep with anyone, especially during the pandemic, but still!
Why isn't ok to inform me of the BS you just said? That you are not ready or whatever. Why make me feel miserable? I care about my Bday, this was supposed to be a Great Day.
It was not.
If it happened on any other day I wouldn't have cared much and moved on with my routine but reserving a spot for yourself just to make fun of me is mean. 
I might sound dramatic to some but he might have just told me earlier (and not at 9pm) . I got ready too, had my hair, make up and all. He didn't intend to show up anyway.
It was sad.

This was not just to rant but also to get your two cents on this situation. I like analyzing situations to get better and to catch on my mistakes/things overlooked/Red flags - no experience should be useless.

22,oy82fo,1628130015,Why do Men ghost?,"Last Friday I went to a bar/nightclub with a girl friend. All the bartenders were men &amp; extremely attractive.  One  began to flirt with me. He was absolutely gorgeous.  I'm attractive but there were definitely more attractive women there. I really didn't think much of it as it's part of the job. Then, he asked for my phone #  I was extremely flattered. I was on cloud 9. I got out of a relationship 6mths ago &amp; he made me feel unattractive. It really took a toll on my self esteem. I really haven't made much of an attempt to date. I'm more focused on making more friends &amp; just enjoying the summer after being locked in the house for 13mths. (I live in a very transient city where people come &amp; go quickly. I also don't have any family here.) I felt this chemistry &amp; spark I don't feel towards very many people. I'd been saying I'm not ready to date again but he made me feel differently. I was excited.  We texted over the weekend here &amp; there. We had tenative plans for one of his days off on Tue/Wed. Tuesday morning when he got off work (5am) he asked if I had plans that night or if I was free. I responded that I didn't have anything going on about 930am. I knew we was likely sleeping all day but when I hadn't heard anything by 530p I texted him again asking if he slept late &amp; are we getting together.  I haven't heard a word from him since. I'm so disappointed. I hadn't been on a ""date"" in a few years so I went &amp; bought a new outfit, dyed my hair, painted my nails....I wanted to feel beautiful.  Now, I'm hurt more than I probay should be. The last time I gave a guy my # at his job after he was being flirtatious, he lied about having a GF &amp; a baby. So I'm just kinda over it. Why do people do this? I just don't get it. It's just so hurtful.

29,oy8n0i,1628132095,Women need to stop crapping on short guys,"I see it all the time when women comment that they've been with a short guy, you seem to generalize us off 1 short guy or a few. Its like as if one short guy thats an ass basically means short guys as a whole are assholes, at least thats  the vibe I get from women. I've seen a lot of comments, **especially from short women who love bad-mouthing short guys** that we're basically hot-headed assholes that try to cover up our insecurities and that we aren't basically allowed to feel what we feel. Our feelings are abnormal. We can't feel upset, sad, depressed, w/e at any point and if we do it seems like we are a bad candidate for women. At all times its like we have to put on a fake image for women to see. It might not even be about height and we might have other shit going on in our lives that we're just not in the right mood and for w/e reason some jackass seems to play that out that its our own fault for feeling like that.  


 Its like if we have someone in our lives that we lost or w/e we aren't allowed to feel that way and it somehow comes across as ""insecurity"" but god forbid we feel pissed off and upset at the treatment we get. We're just supposed to dance around in glee and pretend that we are happy as fuck, but in reality we aren't based on the shit we get from other people especially women. To the women that actually say good shit about us, god bless you, but the negativity is rampant based off certain short men that are assholes so I guess we all are.   


The bullshit we get is irritating from other people. Just realize one thing, as short men we are allowed to feel what we want to feel. No one can tell us how to feel and our feelings are valid. Don't fucking play it out as us being our own enemies because in most cases its not, other people are. You don't live our lives, you aren't in our own shoes. The only ones that can understand us is short men themselves and women have no idea what its like to be a short man at all nor will they ever. Every feeling that a short man gets is completely acceptable for a tall guy. A short man thats an asshole gets ridiculed, a tall man thats an asshole gets women and its perfectly fine.

31,oy8tzx,1628132783,Love doesnt die a natural death,"

Love doesn't die a natural death.


It dies because we grow in different directions and we no longer want or are willing to strive towards the same things


It dies because of lies and cover up. When we inflict jealousies and inappropriate behaviors. The explosive confessions after a fog of suspicion.


It dies because its impossible to divide the heart over multiple partnerships. That feeds indifference. And its a testament of character.


It dies due to starvation from crumbs of affection and attention. Crumbs of smiles. Crumbs of happiness.


It dies due to stagnation. Love is dynamic and alive ever growing and developing. When you no longer wish to explore new interest together, love will coil around someone who will.


It dies from abuse, cruel words, non pleasing acts and from over possessiveness. All these states invite resentment.


It takes more than love to keep love alive. Midnight never strikes two hearts at the same time. One will always love more than the other. The one who loves less stops protecting the one who loves more. Remember my reddit reader. Love is not words. You can proclaim love and treat that person badly. Love is not a feeling. Your feelings can change over the course of breakfast, plus love comes with a drop of pain and fear. Love is behavior. What you do. What you show.


We have become sexually frivolous and confuse desire with love. Sex and desire are elements of love just as hot water is not soup.


Remember the vow. Remember the reason for the vow. The wisdom behind the vow.


To honor and cherish my mate in good times and bad. Please grasp the wisdom. Good times destroys sometimes faster than bad times. Look at the mess celebrities create. In sickness and in health. A vain man always working out or woman looking for a boob job has a drop of poison. Health can destroy. In want and in plenty. Wealth becomes tools of dominance, and that is anti love. Love is an equalizer in that it can reduces a king to kneel and marry a peasant. To forsake all others. This one really confused people and I will not get into this.. All others. All ,not except...


But love does not die naturally. When you allow yourself to get familiar and boring. When you allow your passion to wane. When you reach the point when you believe your mate isn't worth fighting for.. You murder your love.


Love alone is religion. Get to know it. Revere it.¬†",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oy8tzx/love_doesnt_die_a_natural_death/

36,oy93cv,1628133744,You don't have to do this alone,"tl;dr Instead of trying to find dates by swiping alone, try engaging with your friends, family, and those around you to meet people without specifically looking for dates.

This is some simple advice that's meant to be encouraging. There are a lot of people who post here who have trouble getting matches (whether quality matches or any matches at all) through OLD. There are a lot of guys, and women, too, who find it extremely awkward to approach someone of their preferred sex in public. I'm going to suggest, rather than doing what you've been doing (and not being successful at) in a different way, to do something completely different.

If you look across human history and around the world, you might notice that the way we do courtship in this time, in industrialized societies, is really weird. We treat it, for the most part, like a solo endeavor, hoping to bump into a compatible atom in a sea of them. That works for some people, but if it isn't working for you, why not try what humans have done throughout history and meet people through friends, family, and social gatherings that you simply get to know, enjoy some conversations, without being on the hunt for a mate.

The phrase ""getting back out there"" is literal. Hanging out with friends, going to concerts, joining barbecues, going to weddings and funerals and baby showers and birthday parties, joining a kickball team, joining a rock climbing gym -- all of these are the kinds of activities where you may or may not meet people you'd like to date, but you'll certainly meet a lot more people who know someone you might be a good match with. If your efforts so far at doing this solo have been a waste of time, this can't be any worse, right?

Look: I'm an introvert and ADHD besides. I don't like crowds and I am terrible at parties. But some of the best dating experiences I've ever had started when I was around friends who think I'm awesome and around whom I'm relaxed and confident. Getting to know someone new, or even an acquaintance, in an environment like that lets potential dates see you in your best light. Allow the people around you hype you up, not in an artificial way, but by simply enjoying your company. If they happen to invite a few eligible singles as well, all the better. It takes time and energy, but so does swiping for nothing.

It's possible you're thinking that you don't have friends like that, that you don't get invited to things, or that you're estranged from family. I get it. But with all love and respect, if your life is that devoid of human connection, maybe that's something you should work on before expecting to find the one person who will be your ""everything.""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oy93cv/you_dont_have_to_do_this_alone/

However there is so much toxic behaviour on dating apps now  that I had enough and uninstalled all dating apps from my phone 6 months ago. It was a great choice tbh.

42,oy9sge,1628136418,(24M) Women never seem to feel chemistry/sparks/connection with me and it makes me feel sad,"So despite being quite successful about being able to get dates (exclusively from tinder though), I can only seem to make it maybe 2-3 dates in before getting the ""no chemistry"" line. I understand I'm not entitled to their interest and respect their feelings but after getting this tons of times it's starting to really get me down.

I hear advice the meet as many people as you can as the more people you meet the more you increase your odds on a sheer probability basis but that's never really worked out for me. I've been on least 100+ tinder dates/meetups over the last few years and they've never really panned out. I've met plenty of women IRL through things like uni and mutual friends and they're almost always not interested at all; they barely engage with me. 

Often times there's cases where I did feel a strong connection with them (especially after a few dates) but they never seem to with me; which especially gets me down as they're often super lovey dovey and affectionate with me which makes me think things are going well only to find out it's not. 

I don't know what it's like to have a woman flirt with me, drop hints, crush on me whether from a woman I've got to meet and know IRL or met up with from Tinder because these things honestly never happen. 

I believe I'm physically attractive, look like my photos, and aren't going for women above my league. I've asked female friends and former dates (now friends) if there's anything blatantly off about my personality/vibe and honestly couldn't find anything. 

I look at some guys in relationships and/or that my female acquaintances have expressed interest in and am confused as to what quality I lack that's holding me back. 

I've done all the things that are suggested in threads like these. 

I'm in great shape and dress well/take care of hygiene etc. I have lots of passions that I can talk in depth about and have had a lot of interesting experiences in my life. I'm a confident and friendly person with quite a lot of male and female friends. I ask them questions about themselves and am an active listener. I flirt with them directly and gradually escalate if receptive. I have my shit together and make quite a bit of money and have a sizable (for my age) net worth.  I'm not needy or overinvested. I'm not a ""nice guy"" and don't talk badly about women on dates.

These things don't entitle me to anything of course but I would figure having so many positive qualities and green flags combined with lots of interactions would see me doing at least a little better than I've been doing just on sheer probability alone.

I just don't seem to be someone that women feel worthy of investing in or putting effort towards to try and keep around and I'm not sure as to where I'm going wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oy9sge/24m_women_never_seem_to_feel/

My friend who didn't even speak a single word to him, next day kept asking me who he was cause he's very attractive and then went on my Instagram to find him in my followers and slide into his DMs. I told him I was interested in the guy so he shouldn't really try anything as we are talking daily and I think it's going well.

My guy sent me a screenshot where the friend popped up out of nowhere after not speaking other than the 2 days when my friend slid into his DMs telling him how he's horny and they should ""watch a movie and cuddle"".

55,oybof8,1628144475,Understanding mood swings from new interest,"Ok so follow with me here, this one is a doozy. Met a girl on Hinge who I like a pretty good deal. We‚Äôve hung out three times so far:

First date 7/28 - got drinks, came back to my apartment, vibes out to music cuddled, hooked up, great overall evening with no considerable difference in behavior.

Second hangout 8/3 - went to her place and was greeted by a jovial, almost drunk-like mood. ordered pizza, watched a scary movie, and by the time the movie was over she‚Äôd fallen asleep. I tried to cuddle as we had previously and was greeted by sharp rejection. She asked me if I could scoot over as she mumbled her words (and got mad when I mentioned her mumbling) and completely shut off from me for the night. The next morning, however I was greeted by a much warmer, more familiar mood as we proceeded to hook up. We then cuddled for a few hours until we had to both leave for work and left on good terms. 

Third hangout 8/4 - Got a message as I was leaving work about hanging out the very following evening from hangout number 2 (same day). Showed up about two hours after making arrangements to her in a very good and welcoming mood. She wanted to be cuddled instantly and seemed genuinely happy to be in my company. She fell asleep while we watched a movie and later woke up in a pretty foul mood. Rejected my cuddle attempt and went as far as to lay on the other side of the bed claiming (while mumbling) that she just needed space and that the bed was making her back feel horrible. Granted, her bed sucks and should be replaced but it‚Äôs not nearly that bad to where I would take that type of action with someone who I‚Äôd been seeing only for a week now.

After the 2nd dates events I just thought maybe she was drunk and was better in the morning because she sobered up. But after the reoccurrence tonight I started speculating that maybe she has some sort of mental illness. Some of her actions reflect someone who may have bipolar disorder, but I am not in position to diagnose anyone with anything. I, myself have legitimate anxiety issues and have been doing well lately but this shit here is triggering to say the least. This girl is very attractive and fun so I‚Äôm willing to deal with her mood swings if she does have some underlying condition, but I‚Äôm not sure how to support her if I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs going through.

Verbal, Physical abuse and Cheating. I recently found out he has a Fiance and a Babygirl. You're probably wondering why i still care. He was one of the first guys I'd ever really fell in love with even tho our relationship was bad at times but there were some great times pure love. I'm somewhat over it but I still have love for him. We moved on mutually knowing that we were bad for eachother. And it hurts even more that me and him were Engaged and wanted kids. Well atleast i wanted them. He was always unsure with me but gave her a Baby and a ring so fast. Sucks enough that my own Mother told me about it once she found out. There was another guy i had feelings for but after him playing with my feelings and basically giving me hope just to use me for my body and his therapy sessions for his Ex girlfriend who he's still madly in love with even tho she use to beat him. (I met him after they broke up btw).
I caught feelings for him we'd talked for like 8 months by that time had sex amazing sex. He made me believe we'd be something led me on.
Did the whole dating thing- he became my Bf. Then out of the blue he got her Pregnant... After i found out he told me he just liked me for my Body. Now Marriage and Having children is so unappealing to me. I have a hard time getting close with men even more so now. Fwb is just so easy and fast and i don't have to deal with sh*tty ass men drowning me in their problems that i could give two fucks hearing about. And getting Pregnant now is scary. Even thinking about kids is unappealing. I've been in so many bad relationships at a young age and I'm so done. I'm just fine dying alone. But, i know I'm still young and there could be hope?.

That's when i met someone who I instantly clicked with. We got to talking, hanging out (outside the shelter) and eventually started officially dating. Before we actually started dating though she told me she had a 1y/o baby and if that was a dealbreaker she'd understand but would like to keep me as a friend. I grew up with a single mother so i of all people had no problem with it. And so we moved on with the dating, started going out together the 3 of us like a little family, my mom loved her baby because it was her first grandchild and would even babysit on date nights. She had told me her babydaddy was her h.s. sweetheart, that he was toxic, abusive and MOST of his family hated her AND the baby (except his sister's mostly). They believed the baby wasn't his but it's not like his family was sunshine and sprinkles where she would voluntarily stay unless she needed to üòÖ. Once she finally decided enough was enough, they didn't even hesitate to run her off and her ex was a deadbeat and never once gave a dime for the baby. Me? i loved this kid, i stepped in when i didn't have, helped care for them, raise the baby and watched her grow, my family received them with open arms, all sunshine and rainbows right. Come to find out about a couple months ago she started talking to the babydaddy and bada-bing bada-boom, back to him she went. She ugly cried to me, apologized a million times and kept saying ""I'm sorry, but it seems as he's changed and wants to be there for the baby now"".

I‚Äôm jealous of my boyfriend. He‚Äôs born into a rich family of doctors and a big house while I‚Äôm born into a family with middle SES and a normal apartment.

Both of us wanted to get into medical school. He got in super easily, with adequate grades and just enough medical experience because his parents will always share stories from their clinic with him.

2021 was the most unlucky year as of now. While he was enjoying his holidays before entering medical school and complaining about trivial stuff like the nerds in his class and joking about dropping out, I was under so much pressure. Recently, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and that added on to my stress. I am super close to my mother and this news devastated me. Since I often went to his house for dinners, I was envious of his complete life - healthy parents, being able to get into his dream course, totally not worried about his finances and being able to game all day. I was indignant at the fact that my life became the total opposite of his, ever since we started dating.

I‚Äôm so jealous. I yearn to be in his position. I wish he knew how fortunate he is to have everything going smoothly and to stop complaining about every single trivial matter. But I can‚Äôt tell him about my feelings. It‚Äôs not his fault that he is successful and thriving. 

I hate my current position. Believe it or not, I‚Äôve been actively considering breaking up with him because I really feel that he is sucking my good luck away.

I am SO sick of this. I put myself out there and am constantly disappointed. My profession doesn't include any men so meeting them through work is not a possibility, so like a lot of people, I've resorted to OLD. 

Its not at all the first time, but I'm always, always, always disappointed. I don't want to die alone. I want to be happy with someone. I started seeing a guy 2 months ago, but I'm always the one who reaches out to him. He's hard to nail down for plans, but has never canceled when they're made. 

He checks all the right boxes too so I thought it was gold. He's attractive, close to my age, owns a home, doesn't live with his parents, has a stable job, a pet, not a smoker or alcoholic. I mean, when the hell does that happen? 

But when I text him (our form of communication) it takes a very long time (we're talking a day or 2) for him to get back to me. But when we are together, we get along great. Conversations are good, we enjoy each other's company. And he waited several dates before making a move telling me he wanted to wait till we knew each other better. 

I reached out 1 more time because I need to know, once and for all, what he wants. We've been sleeping together so I've given up sleeping with others and want to talk about that in the respect of is he sleeping with other women.

87,oyh39h,1628168583,Ghosted by the girl I've been dating the past 3 months,"I'm 35, met the girl of my dreams, 25, a while back. Started talking daily and got pretty close. She lived 2 hrs away and I drove to see her 3 times. Spent about 12 hours together each time and we both had an absolute blast. As an introvert it is rare that I find someone I genuinely enjoy being with, most people I get involved with I feel like I'm just being polite but don't truly enjoy their company, but she was different. We actually had shit in common and seemed like we were on the same page and clicked so well.

I invited her to come stay with me for the weekend recently. She doesn't have a car and would have to take a train, but I figured it was fair since I'd traveled so much for her already. She rejected my offer saying the trip was too much hassle for just 1 night. That hurt me and I knew we probably weren't on the same page at that point. But I don't have many people to talk to, and just being friends and having her in my life was so good for my poor mental health, so I swallowed the pain and pretended things were okay. 

She began acting more and more distant over the weeks. We spoke last weekend and things seemed okay, then we didn't talk for 3 days. I texted her saying hi stranger and she didn't reply for 24 hrs, so I tried again and said to please at least say goodbye, that being ghosted doesn't feel very nice. I haven't heard back yet and feel I never will. 

I was never anything but good and decent to her and didn't deserve this. I feel so terrible and mentally broken. I need a partner and a friend and I try so hard to be a good person, but time and time again find myself alone and disappointed.

It is not everyday, but it is often. He just recently told me that he wants to wait for sex until marriage. When I asked him why he wanted to wait, he explained it‚Äôs because the Bible said so and that it is a sin to have sex outside of marriage. I used to be religious but decided to step away because I felt pressured and like I had to follow their rules or else I was a disgrace. I really don‚Äôt want to break up with my boyfriend but I have no idea what to do because I enjoy sex. I feel guilty and I don‚Äôt know how to go about it, he‚Äôs the last person I‚Äôd want to lose.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyh6me/my_boyfriend_and_i_have_had_sex_before_but_now_he/

94,oyhuyo,1628171106,Can we please have more empathy to problems of the opposite sex?,"This is coming from a 20 year old virgin who has been struggling with dating. Even with being pretty much unable to find a hookup or romantic interest, I‚Äôm not going to lash out angry at women.

Women do have problems regarding dating. I know a lot of guys here refuse to believe dating as a woman is anything but sunshine and rainbows. Now I can‚Äôt speak on behalf of all women but it seems like dating isn‚Äôt that at all. My girl friends have shown me their Tinder convos and it‚Äôs just not great talking to some dudes. Then when you meet up they have to worry about if the fuse will literally kill them or not if the date doesn‚Äôt go well. They also have to navigate whether or not guys are being true to their word and aren‚Äôt lying to them just to fuck. Guys don‚Äôt have to think about these things. 

Ladies, y‚Äôall can be just as cold as the guys here can too. Dating as a average normal guy fucking sucks. We barely get any matches online, we get rejected and labeled creepy in person, and we can‚Äôt just wait for women to come to us because we‚Äôre expected to make all the first moves. Guys especially in my age bracket often have little to no success with women and it‚Äôs grating. It‚Äôs depressing. Also the few of us that do get dates, if we want a relationship we invest significantly more time, effort, and money because we are expected to if we ever want to find love.

But I digress, dating isn‚Äôt easy for anyone. It‚Äôs hard to find love for all of us and it makes it a whole lot harder when you have people telling you that you have it easy while you‚Äôre struggling. Let‚Äôs just try to be a little more compassionate to each other. Trying to invalidate others experiences does nothing but make everyone‚Äôs dating more of a struggle.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyhuyo/can_we_please_have_more_empathy_to_problems_of/
95,oyi2oj,1628171782,Crushing on someone doesn't mean you should pursue them,"So for as long as I can remember I always developed crushes on people relatively easy. It seemed like if someone gave me the slightest bit of attention or made me laugh, I would start developing a crush on them. But I have learned to take a step back and look at it from another angle when I get too caught up in my crushes. 

For example, I got a crush relatively recently on someone, and then I thought about it. He has no job, he sleeps during the day and is awake all night, it would be long distance so I wouldn't be able to see him often, and it would be very hard to maintain in those conditions. The guy might be funny and nice, but when it comes down to actually pursuing a relationship he isn't fit for me. And it has helped me get over it in a way that doesn't hurt my feelings.

I used to get hurt a lot getting crushes that just never worked out. I started dating someone way to quickly because of this and realized at under a year we just weren't compatible. I let my crush on them get the best of me. I did it out of a desperate attempt for love, not because they were actually someone who i loved. 

So when you get crushes, please make sure you are looking at it from all different angles before you decide to move ahead with pursing them. Think about their lifestyle, their goals/aspirations, etc and make sure to put the whole picture together before you start trying to date them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyi2oj/crushing_on_someone_doesnt_mean_you_should_pursue/
96,oyif8t,1628172566,Girl I was seeing suddenly changed her mind after so many great dates,"I've been dating a girl(my lifetime crush) for more than a month now, things were going great. We just clicked from our very first date, then from the second one we did almost everything, we kissed on the second, got back home at sunrise, she was clearly into me. Every time she clearly said how good she feels with me. We had sex, it was great. We had dinners, romantic stuff, I could just see her letting her go, we could spend hours together talking. Then suddenly she came out saying she was seeing me too ahead and that she feels great when she's with me but doesn't feel that spark when she is at home. But we talked about it and she instantly changed her mind. Then we went out twice, did a half day ""trip"" together, where she clearly showed how she was into me, she told her friends and colleagues about me. 

But then again this time she suddenly came out with this thing that she doesn't feel that spark, those butterflies that you want to see the person, I don't understand. She kept saying she feels good with me, could spend hours together, but she can't continue like this. And I'd say she's absolutely right about this, but I hardly believe this, she was clearly into me, as she kept telling me by herself, and I can see it in her eyes, but then she randomly comes out with these doubts. So last time I tried to save it but didn't happen so I didn't push too much. 

I know it's only been a month, but she was my lifetime crush, and I had the courage to ask her out and it fucking went great for all this time. What should I do? Let her go? Even if she clearly showed interest in me although she had some doubts, I saw her really confused about this, she said all these things crying about bad she felt in this situation. If she would have said that from the beginning I would have believed but now it seems hard, it's almost impossible she didn't feel anything all this time. 

What you guys think I should do? I didn't contact her from last time, hoping she would text(bad btw, I really don't wanna deceive myself and I don't wanna feel like shit).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyif8t/girl_i_was_seeing_suddenly_changed_her_mind_after/
