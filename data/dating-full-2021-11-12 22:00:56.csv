We chat sometimes and hang out etc. She acts like she doesn't think about me as a potential partner. And I really don't want to give up. I think it is too early to state unequivocally that she is not interested in me. I believe there is a way to make her likes me more and change her look at me. Ya know... I'm worth to give a try? Something like that. Or more likely ""she wasn't looked at me this way before, but now she does"". You know what I mean. 

  Why I think she isn't interested? Our conversations are irregular (sometimes we chat more, sometimes less), she has kinda closed/bad body language? (I need to hang out with her few times more to be sure), she can respond after longer time (up to hour, so maybe I shouldn't worrying about that) and her responds sometimes are... I don't know how to say that. They are short and it's only a response, I hope you know what I mean. But on other hand if our chat goes well we can talk for hours, without longer pauses. When we see ourselves at school I got mixed thoughts about it. She may look at me normally (as we usually look at our friends), and sometimes she has cold eyesight(?). Like she was looking at unknown person. I feel like it was balancing between ""good signs"" and ""you don't have any chances"". 

  I understand if she has high expectations, she isn't seems to be easy, and it's not bad thing cuz it makes me... motivated? I mean, if she is actually hard one it rather because she's worth to put effort in it. But at this point I'm don't sure what I should do. I really hope there is a way to change her look at me, have any ideas how can I reach my goal?

&amp;#x200B;

I (25F) might this guy (29M) off of hinge 6 weeks ago. We immediately hit it off and have so far gone on 5 dates (yes, I have slept with him after the 3rd date). After our 3 or 4th date, I can't remember... he had to go visit home for a week - he didn't reach out to me once, 7 days zero contact. I reached out to check-in and we had a great conversation, turns out he had to extend the trip slightly and would be back that weekend. I waited... and nothing for 8 days until he reached on the following Tuesday and asked to make a plan to see me that week. We made a plan and again had a great date. I made a passing joke I thought he was ghosting me since I didn't hear from him for so long and he apologized and told me he would never. When we are together he is extremely engaging, has vocalized his interest in me, we share a lot in common and frankly I have nothing negative to say about him. I really saw this going somewhere and having a lot of potential.  

&amp;#x200B;

When he left the next morning, Friday, he told me that he'd love to see me again after Halloween weekend and we would make a plan. We spoke briefly on Sunday when I texted him about a show he recommended I watched but other than that nothing. Then Wednesday he proceeds to send me this ([See Convo HERE](https://imgur.com/a/QDpNWKr)) and I felt it was a good time to vocalize the fact I don't like his long spans of non-communication and the weird disconnect in his behavior when we are together vs. when we aren't. He seemed receptive to it and told me we would talk when he's back...

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it is now 9 days later and I have heard absolutely NOTHING from him after this exchange and I'm almost positive he's back home from his trip. Did he really ghost me? Should I have not spoken up about communication? Should I try reaching out?

Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on Reddit hence the new account. I would really like some advice on my current situation because I find it very confusing.

I am a 21-year-old guy from Norway, and I recently went to Australia for a month for a university exchange program. There I met this group of friends and I became part of them almost immediately. I noticed this one super cute girl 19 who seemed very shy and reserved and she seemed okay to talk to me only in group settings. Once we were one-on-one, she always had trouble maintaining eye contact and went from a rather loud voice tone to almost whispering. I didn't think much about it at first and assumed she didn't really like me and I was annoying her,

Over the next two weeks, I started liking her a lot though, and I started having trouble holding eye contact with her because of this. I noticed that she was laughing at all my jokes and was overhearing conversations even if I wasn't talking to her, but she was still more outgoing to other guys she didn't know than she was with me so I still assumed she didn't want to get to know me.

I also noticed her staring at me a couple of times when she thought I couldn't see her. Her friends told me that she never had a boyfriend but never seems interested in dating anyone.

During the last two weeks, I realized that I was crushing on her hard and that we had a lot of things in common, so I gathered up the courage and asked her out. She said yes and that was the first time talking one on one that she held eye contact with me, her voice was super loud and she couldn't stop talking haha. We exchanged contacts and went to dinner a week later because of busy schedules. She was super talkative and we had a lot of fun. She is basically the girl version of me, I am not lying when I say we have A LOT in common. I could definitely tell we had good chemistry.

However, at the end of the date, the fact that I had to go back home in a couple of days was brought up, and after that, she changed. We said goodbye with a hug, I didn't kiss her because I thought we would have seen each other at least one more time but it didn't happen.

When I asked her to hang out once more she said she was terribly sorry but she couldn't because of a university project she had to submit. Which I know is true but I still think this was a bit of an excuse. I told her not to worry about it and we exchanged a couple of text messages.

The next day was my last day and I met everybody from the friend group except her. I saw her in the hallway and raised my hand with a smile. I know she noticed me too but quickly turned to her friend and walked away.

I met her later while walking past her that she was talking to somebody else and said ""Hi (girl's name) "" with a smile. She very shyly smiled looked at me for a second before looking down while whispering ""Hi"". This was the last time we talked.

I tried texting her ever since I left but she doesn't answer and if she replies she does that in a way that ends the conversation. I still talk to everybody in the friends group but her completely avoiding me like this really hurts and I don't know why she is doing this. I don't necessarily want a relationship because I understand that we don't really know each other and the distance is very big, she said we could be friends but this isn't how friends interact with each other.

Seeing the attention she gives to other guys on social media while she completely ghosts me really hurts a lot too... I would just like to know why she is treating me like this, it's like she hates me or something, any help is very appreciated.

But I will rapidly explain you my story:
I thought that a guy who was really nice and caring secretly liked me and was too shy to step up, but after I've confessed the feelings that I have developed for him being that nice, He replied that He only sees me as friend. He also let me know He is (closeted) gay. It turned out I was just deluding myself based on some clues and facts, as the date He planned in a restaurant for only the 2 of us. Besides feeling ridiculous now, I am convinced that his bestfriend (who is openly gay) was very jealous and I've been thinking that they might be more than just friends and in an actual relationship (they share a flat!), so maybe that's the reason why He had to return to his track and set a boundary and in the end I wasn't just seeing things... 

Was the dream trying to tell me that He is taken? Would you agree that the girl is the representation of his boyfriend (I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT ROLES IN GAY COUPLES)?
Was it an invitation to drop everything, start considering how uncomfortable my attentions made his partner feel and therefore pull away as a sign of respect?

Anyway, apart from him being closeted gay and not wanting his coworkers know about his private life, I don't know why He should be lying to me about his relationships status and how all this can make sense.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125813,public,self,"I dreamed about a girl who was competing for my crush, always showing up around him and acting extremely jealous and possessive, so that every time I met her eyes, She would give me a long death stare.

Hahah now this sounds ridiculous I know but let me explain. We’ll be talking, of course we’ll be talking and smiling talking about pretty much any/everything (the most generic topics to the deepest, mainly deep ones I have no idea why) then they’ll compliment either my looks or personality. In the next few minutes they have to make it known that they’re unavailable somehow.

I never noticed this when I was younger but I have always attracted people towards me. I’m on the more optimistic side so maybe they feel comfortable telling me about things freely without being judged. To me it’s just a great conversation from an acquaintance, one of many which I do enjoy nonetheless but to them it’s meaningful and memorable.

Of course I explained well my situation to her but here is why I have these habits: I work and go to school and I hardly have time between rushing from work to school to eat, and I especially dont have time typically to cook for myself, I do cook when I can because I know it is the healthiest option but it is probably only once or twice a week. And I order salads from fast food restaurants not out of laziness but necessity. Otherwise I dont eat.

Hello!

My boyfriend(32M) and I (24F)are in a long-distance relationship for one year. We haven't been able to see each other because he lives in Mexico and I was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. I had brain surgery and because of this, I haven't been able to travel. The last time we saw each other was in August. I have been feeling extremely insecure because I lost my hair and have lost a lot of weight in treatment. I feel and look sick. I opened up to my boyfriend about how I was feeling and he reassured me and told me he loves me as I am. He didn't have social media when we began our relationship, but the other day in my suggested accounts his new account popped up. He hasn't tried to follow me and basically only follows beautiful Instagram models or very sexual accounts. Seeing this made me feel very insecure because those women are so perfect and I especially don't feel perfect right now. Even when I was not sick my body was never as perfect as those women. Seeing that made me a little sad and made me feel like I am not enough for him. I don't really know how to go about his. It did hurt my feelings that after the emotional conversation I had with him about my insecurities he made an account and followed all these accounts. I had even expressed to him that I get insecure comparing myself to the women I see on Instagram. Should I tell him how I feel or is it normal for guys to follow these kinds of accounts?

The first few months of us like knowing each other were good I didn’t see anything bad really but the way we started dating was off.

Basically the first week of October she invited me to go with her and bother guy to a hay ride and haunted house. I went with them then after that the other guy already got a hotel for him and her she asked me to stay. So I asked at first he was taken back but he agreed after I gave him 40$.

That night I stayed on a pull out couch when the other guy took the bed which was the king size I was so out of shape 11-12 o’clock at night usually I’m asleep by 9. I was trying to get to sleep when he passed out she came and stayed with me she snuggled up and we cuddled it was very very nice. We kissed cuddled. Then I woke up around 9 or 10 and got ready to go when he got up I left. That day he took her to a concert where she called me and told me to come get her I did cause he tried to rape her. As I took her home she wanted to ask me to date her and I didn’t know what to say.

About a week later she asked if we were like officially a couple. I haven’t been in a relationship for years so I did not thinking about it twice. As we were dating the first two weeks were really good but red flags kept coming up. Which hurt me alot but I didn’t say a whole lot. The last two weeks were terrible she took me off her location on snap sent me videos of her drinking and drunk her asking to fuck guys. That made me so upset. I told her to be careful and I soon found out she was really only with one guy drinking and he was sleeping with her… so I dropped a whole 5 paragraph of reasons why shit isn’t working. I told her we can work on it or we can be done. 

A few days past she messages me hey. I responded with hey are you wanting to talk? She said you didn’t talk to me the past few days! I was like well what are we she said you said we were done so if that’s the answer from you. I said well what do you want she said idk. At that point I said bye. Now her sister sent me a video of that same guy she was sleeping with at her moms house and the guy is 20 times uglier then me and I sometimes call myslef ugly.

Maybe it’s just beginning? Just when I feel like I hit rock bottom I burst through and find a new low I never saw coming. I want to do the right thing and be that right person for someone but it seems to elude me at each passing turn. I tell myself that I’m a good person but maybe I’m not. This isn’t me throwing myself a pity party trying to play the “nice guy” card in hopes that some desperate woman will fall in love with me. 

I’ve made a thousand wrong decisions in my life and I expect to make a thousand more. Because here I am, 29, jobless, broke, and unloved. Not by my family, they love me and do what they can but it’s a different type of love that I am seeking, someone to share a life with, someone who is trustworthy and honest. At 26 I thought I found that person, finally someone who was infatuated with me and hung on my every word. I guess at that point in time that was all that I needed to fill that vacant space in my soul. I truly had never cared about someone the way I did her and I had no other thought in my mind than spending the rest of my life with her. But that came to a screeching halt this past summer. She left me for another man, I was shocked, hurt, every emotion you could imagine. I did things I’m not proud of to get back at her and I lost myself for a while. 

Last week I met with an old friend who I had known for a long time and always been close with. I thought that me and her were really hitting it off and that everything that happened was leading me to this. Someone I trusted, confided in, cared for. Me and her talked about the possibility of dating and both expressed an interest. Unfortunately I let my voice get the best of me and said a little too much about all the things I went through in the wake of my ex destroying my soul. She ultimately rejected me and I can’t really blame her for that. But the pain of that rejection is so unbearably painful, I thought for a moment that life after my ex could be better than ever. So now here I am, alone again and lost without a purpose. Every day is a new chapter in this living nightmare I find myself in. Most recently I was laid off from my job, the only thing I had going for me and now I am destitute. I’m adrift with pain and suffering, an endless stream of misery that surrounds the entirety of my existence. Is there any hope of a normal existence after this traumatic time in life? I understand that life goes on, but am I too broken to ever be happy again?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125844,public,self,Quiet desperation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsqrnk/quiet_desperation/,no_ads,0.0,no_ads,0.0,,

So i (21M) got rejected from this girl i was talking to just today and im pretty sure i know where i went wromg but would appreciate some pointers anyway.

I actually met her i was her server and she was in my section and i just really had a massibe crush on her lol so i asked her out and she said yes. She said she wanted to get coffee but everytime i suggested a day she just kept saying she couldnt make it even thlugh i told her you can come to the restaurant at night where i work for a drink after my shift and we could talk or we could meet in the mornings. Basically i was willing to move mountains to see her since she said she was going back home on sunday for 10 days to see her family and i just thought she would forget about me if i didnt get to spend even an hour with her before.

I asked her if she wanted to meet tomorrow at 10 but she said no and was like i dont we are a good match at all im sorry. Im ngl i had to fight back the tears at work it hit me kind of hard since i liked her so much and was so happy whenever she messaged me.

I just think in future maybe just ask the girl out on a date once and dont bother trying to keep asking her after she says no i think. If someone is interested in you theyll make time for you no matter how busy they are and i think my naiive ass just thought that she liked me but genuinely couldnt find the time which im very sure she could have if she wanted to.

I think this was more of a rant than anything but im happy i went through this experience, i learnt so much from it and i know ill bounce back and fond someone even better im sure!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125845,public,self,Would appreciate some pointers as to where i went wrong,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsquk7/would_appreciate_some_pointers_as_to_where_i_went/,no_ads,0.0,no_ads,0.0,,

Background: we had a few short lives flings in high school that ended badly. Has been trying to reach out all summer I wasn’t super interested at first and then finally I was convinced. First month went great, second month got a little volatile. He was still reaching out everyday but we weren’t seeing each other. I saw a noticeable change in him. I don’t think it had anything to do with us, but he wasn’t being very communicative about it. 

Current situation:
We got into a fight 2 weeks ago about not seeing each other and lack of communication. I didn’t answer him for a few days and he did the same to me when he finally texted. A week after I initially reach out, he told me he was injured and thats why he hasn’t answered. We had a normal conversation that whole night and a little into the next day (this was Tuesday-Wednesday) and nothing since. Last thing we talked about was me having a break from work so nothing heavy that would make him not answer. 

Should I reach out or wait it out? I’m honestly really conflicted.

To be honest, I (M24) never thought I’d be in a place like this (not that being on r/dating is bad). I mean moreso like being in a place that I’m reaching for support. 

Recently I met a girl (F25), someone who was sweet, and kind and I got a good sense for her. I worked up the courage to ask her on a date. It was in front of her co-workers and to my shock she showed so much enthusiasm and proclaimed “yes!”. 

That felt like a step in the right direction. And she told me how she was looking forward to it! Fast forward a bit, it’s Saturday morning and our date. It was nice. What was immediately us being a little bit nervous turned into us easing into a conversation where I learned so much about her and she learned about me and we had shared experiences and also so engaging differences. 

Something I considered special happened, and she opened up to me from a place of vulnerability. I happen to be an artist, and I’m wildly passionate about it. Having only started two years ago it’s become an outlet and something that I’ve turned into a business that is becoming sustainable as I learn and push myself. Vulnerability is something that I grapple with often. With her having a background in art she shared with me some of the energy from THAT place. 

Afterwards, she asked me about my personality (we both have a similar background in mental health and neuroscience) said she characterized me by openness, creativity, and depth. Told me we could paint together. And at the end of the date gave me an affectionate smile and said “I’ll see you soon.” 

Later that evening I told her that I enjoyed the time and it had been well worth looking forward to. And I haven’t heard from her since. It’s been close to a week and I was completely ghosted. I sent her a follow up text saying that “not hearing from her was a bummer and I hoped her week wasn’t overwhelming. I had gotten two tickets for a painting with a twist in case she was looking for a fun outlet. 

Nothing. Completely ghosted. It’s just so incongruent and inconsistent. There’s no closure to what felt like something that was such a joy to look forward to.

I decided to give her space because I didn’t wanna be clingy or eager even though I was really into her, but then she would text me first just to see how I’m doing and what she was up to

At that point in time I was completely lost. I went to school for exercise science and all of the gyms where closed making it super difficult to pursue my career. I went back and forth with the idea of going for my master's. I was also studying for the exercise physiologist exam as the time.  It was during the height of covid and we were both super afraid of catching it since our parents where both older. We were super cautions with masks and social distancing. However, we both seemed to have a very strong connection. We both admitted that we had strong feelings for each other. 

After a ton of soul searching, I got a job as personal training manager. In the being it was fucking awful. At that time the vp of the company was training me and he was extremely difficult to work with. He had a reputation with all of the personal trainers that he had zero social skills. I strongly disliked his abusive way of coaching. I was depressed and it showed. I did my best to try to hide it but it was clearly not enough. Thankfully the vp left my territory for another new hire and then I met my boss. As soon as we met me became best friends. He was a super interesting gentlemen and he had the purest of hearts. He told me how much potential I had and really had an effect on me. I looked up to him, he was an older brother to me. 

Unfortunately around this time I broke up with the girl I was seeing. She was being very distant and I texted her to see what was going on. She said that dating me started to remind her of a guy she used to date and she needed to be single for a while. We left on really good terms and she was really kind about it. I was feeling really down for while though. I can honestly say she was the first girl that  that I actually loved in a romantic setting. Things were weird for a while. I had recently moved to a much slower territory and my sales were awful. I had way too much free time at my desk to just think about pointless sad things. She kept looking at my snap stories and this made me crazy. I saw her on tinder a few months later and I texted her. She opened and didn't respond. I remember feeling like such worthless piece of shit. About a week later, I got into a car accident too. Thank god I was okay. I had a bit of mental break and I cried and screamed in the fetal position on the floor that night.

Then things got better. I started to get the hang of everything. I gave work everything I fucking had. I started to improve like crazy. My sales where climbing and I was only getting better. I was an absolute killer when it came to sales. I eventfully reached 1st place in sales 3 times in a row within the entire company. Mind you, we were nation wide. 

Around this time my boss quit, it was sad but he wanted me to take his position. It took him 4 years to get this position but he felt I was the best candidate.  He made a recommendation to cooperate and they had their eye on me. VP flew over to my territory and he watched me like a hawk. He was taking my leads and he wanted me to train 3 other new hires. I was a fucking mess but I still ended up being 1st in sales. Everyone was so surprised they said they would give me position, they just wanted to see how I could handle the added responsibility.  I was basically the regional manager without the pay or title. It grew really old overtime and they eventually gave the position to someone else outside of the company. I was livid. I ended up getting alcohol poisonings that night. I was throwing up the entire weekend. Which was even worse was that when I looked at my phone on Monday morning, I had drunk texted my ex that weekend.....multiple times and I had zero recollection of it. I blocked her from everything. This could not happen again. 

I went for a job search craze for about 3 months, doing a shit load of interviews. I finally found one that fit my needs. I had to do about 4 interviews for this one job and I got it. I only gave my company a weeks notice out of spite and left. This job has nothing to do with my degree but it pays much, much more with amazing benefits. Infarct I just got a 10k rise within the first month.

I have thought about how much I have changed since the last year and wonder what if she met me now?

To summarize:

\-This hot guy of my dreams moved in 6 months ago.

\-He's had a GF for the past 2 years, I suspected he did when he first moved in, but he told me no and I stupidly believed him.

\-He took me out for drinks/cuddled with me a few times when they were fighting (he tried to have sex once but I wasn't ready yet). I got emotionally attached. Unfortunately they reconciled and I was left behind like an abandoned doll.

\-One night his GF was in the hospital and I was watching a movie with him. He asked me to cuddle, I shouted NO and we awkwardly sat next to each other.

\-Now he doesn't talk to me at all anymore and he spends 1-2 hours on the phone each day talking to his girlfriend...despite him literally living in the ROOM next door to mine, in the same house. He also took her to his sister's wedding.

He never hangs in the living room or the kitchen and I feel creepy knocking on his door. 

I feel like the clock is ticking. Pretty soon he will move out and I will never see him again. Should I tell him how I feel? I miss him so much. I also wonder if I had sex with him or just ""gave in"" and cuddled with him while he was in the hospital...would he have liked me better?

What can I do? I think about him all day everyday, have dreams about him, and have already dated dozens of other guys from dating apps but none of them compare to how I feel about this guy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125872,public,self,"I Have a Crush on My Roommate, but He Has a Girlfriend.
