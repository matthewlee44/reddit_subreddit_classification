I've been single for a really long time. While it's great and feels like my normal, I wonder if my life would be different if I wanted to pursue a relationship and were in one?

My last ""serious"" relationship was when I was a freshman in college (ages 18-19), and that didn't work out. Obviously at that age, both parties were relatively immature. 

I'm in graduate school now, and I've worked really hard for the things that I have in my life. 

I used to date casually a LOT when I was younger (which is a story unto itself). The experience had a lot of ups and downs. (I will not tolerate any misogynistic judgement for this). I've been in my fair share of really unhealthy situation-ships, and I really have learned how to stand up for myself and let go of what isn't good for me. I've changed a lot in the past year, and my life is still changing a lot now. Now, I'm really trying to put the work in for real personal growth. 

In the future future, I want to have the committed relationship and have a family, but that is a long way away. 

It would just feel really awkward going into a dating situation now saying, ""I don't know what I'm looking for."" I feel like I should know what I'm looking for, but that question sounds very daunting. I feel like a deer in the headlights trying to answer that question. 

I just want to add, and I know this might sound dense, I intentionally didn't pursue a relationship during the period of time (around 3 years) between college and grad school for some very personal but understandable reasons.  My parents are still married but they argued a lot when I was growing up, so I didn't have a great example for relationships. I've definitely told myself, ""I don't want a relationship that looks like theirs."" Now that I'm on my own and in grad school, I feel like I'm moving onto my next phase of life. I've always been very focused on my career and education, so dating and relationships always felt frivolous to me. 

In short, I'm 26 and I feel like I should know what I'm looking for.

A little background on me might help paint this picture a little better in your head: I’m pretty thick-headed when it comes to romance so I’ve only had two relationships in my life, the first being a month after I turned twenty. I was in a rush to know what love was so I became infatuated with one of the first guys to show an interest. It only lasted 4 weeks, ending abruptly when he revealed he had a wife and kid. As you can guess, It left me with quite a bit of trust issues and resentment. 

It was almost a year later (about a month ago) that I would meet my current partner (20M). We met through friends and, thinking he was smoking hot and sensing that he might be into me, I made the first move. He had already confessed that he was single and lonely so after hanging out for two weeks, one night while watching movies I asked if he wanted to fuck, to which he agreed. Now before you jump, I only did so because he’s going on a 3 month long business trip in less than three weeks (now just one week) and I wanted to know if there was something there before I started long-term-crushing. The sex was great and we meet up at least once ever weekend since but there is a problem brewing:

I really like this dude, but I don’t think he actually likes me. I always initiate sex, and it’s a lot. I interpret sex as the ultimate form of affection so I rarely seek out those sorts of connections, but when I do I full-send that shit. To the point where we fucked 4 times in one day and he had to tell me he couldn’t go again. I always mention how he’s hot and sexy and that I like him but I never hear it back. He has not once told me I’m pretty, that he likes me, or that I’m hot. He has mentioned that he didn’t want to tell any of our friends yet and to give it time. He also doesn’t like any of the pet names I give him nor does he call me anything. I texted him the other day about how I’m going to miss him when he leaves and he only texted me “IK”. 

I just don’t feel appreciated or liked and I don’t know how to deal with it because of my lack of experience. I start internally steaming when he texts nonchalantly or doesn’t say anything beyond hi. I don’t even know what I am to him and its hard to ask. I’d really appreciate any advice that anyone could give me on this matter.

We drank a lot, stayed up until 5am and just had a great time.
At some point her stepmother talked to me and told me that her daughter really likes me and that she just came around to see me.
Moreover her stepmother told me that she and her dad really wish that i would put more efford in the „relationship“ with her daughter, because they consider me a „good guy“ and her recent boyfriend is an asshole and her daughter wouldnt even like him anymore, but stayes with him because she needs emotional support after her real mother passed away last year.

So i cuddled a lot with her that evening and we just had a great connection.
The next two weeks we texted everyday and talked almost every evening for 1-2 hours on our phones.
Celebrated her birthday together (giftet her a giant Teddybär, which she really likes and keeps in her bed even tho her boyfriend told her that „he will burn that thing“😂)

But now about 2 weeks later i asked her out to a dinner, to finaly settle things and be in a relationship with her and she wasnt really that excited about it.

She also got ill a few days before our date and had to go in quarantine (dont worry it is true and iam not naive)
So i wanted to bring her a few candys and dvds at home because she was always telling me that quarantine is really boring and that she is always hungry, but she just answered with texts like „ok, but make it short“ or „maybe you can come by tomorrow“.

So after she didnt write me the next day i logically didnt visit her and stopped texting first to check if she is really interested.

Long story short, we havent been in contact for the last 4 days and iam just really confused, because everyone keeps telling me that she really liked/likes me and wants all this romantic stuff but that she is complicated because her mother died a few months ago and therefore i should keep fighting.

But iam just really confused and dont know if that is the case.
How should i handle this?

Been talking to this woman for the past 4 months now. We’ve gotten close and really like eachother. We both want to be together, but she’s going through a divorce now ( the guy is with someone else and lives in a different state ). She also has a son who has autism, whom needs a lot of her attention ( doctor appointments and stuff like that )

Since the beginning, she’s always told me that she feels like the universe is telling her that she needs to be alone. Every time she gets into these funks, she always repeats it. That’s the biggest reason we aren’t together. She said she’s not prepared to give me what I want out of her. 

About 10 times by now, she’s tried to initiate sex from me. Most of the time it’s when she’s drunk and feels lonley. I’ve made myself clear from the beginning that I can’t sleep with her unless I can see things going somewhere. She’s very understanding of that and she’ll start to agree and say that she doesn’t do friends with benefits anyway. She’ll say she initiated it out of a moment with weakness. We’ve had phone sex several times tho ( haven’t done that since I was a teenager lmao ).

So, like a month ago I told her that we should take some space, so we can both get it together and see if we can pick up where we left off sometime in the future, when she’s in a better place. She’s jobless, takes care of her grandmother, and is having a rough time with her son at the moment. With that said, I can definitely understand that she’s not ready to date. I feel like if we don’t take this space, we’re just gonna keep butting heads and end up hating eachother before anything pops off between us. 

So for the past month, she’s gotten in touch with me like 3 or 4 times. She always has a reason to hit me up, but really; it’s just her way in. It didn’t start to irritate me til she did it again Thursday this week ( after going 2 weeks without NC ). The message wasn’t anything bad. Just that she drives through my city a couple times a week to take her son to the doctors and that she always thinks of me when she does. I didn’t say anything negative to her, but after the conversation ended, I said “alright well let’s talk again when you’re in a better place, that way we can start fresh and I’ll take you out somewhere nice ). She agrees, but then says “or until I annoy you again”. 



I don’t have any doubt that she has feelings for me. I’m trying to be careful with all of this; because I don’t want to ruin what we have so far. I want things in her life to get better for her, and I’d really like a future with her. Sometimes though, it’s hard to tell what she’s thinking. I’m not sure what she’s trying to accomplish with me. Every time she reaches out, I feel the pain all over again. It’s hard talking to someone That I can’t be with right now, and I don’t think she cares how this makes me feel. She even says that she doesn’t want to hurt me because she can’t give me what I want right now, and will still do these things at the same time. She has said that 50 times by now and yet, she continues to reach out. I wish she would just take this seriously and wait. 


We made a deal to talk again in July. At this rate, she’ll break NC 50 times by then. I’m not sure what to do or what her thought process even is. Someone please help me. My mind is running in circles trying to make sense of all this.

I've known this woman for 3 years in college but for some reason I have never asked her out, probably due to depression and feeling like she may not be attracted to me. Our encounters during these years have been mostly casual. Like very casual. We just say hi to each other, and sometimes talk. When we do talk, our chemistry is really amazing. She laughs at my jokes (most of the time). She doesn't seem to be the type of girl to care a lot about guys in general, so I'm guessing she might not be focusing on relationships atm. I think she likes me to some degree, but perhaps not in a way that I want. She seems happy when she sees me, smiles every time we say hello to each other. Talks to her friends about me.That's it. I don't really have the time to talk to her more because she is always with her group of friends. And I can honestly say that I am with my group.

My only fear right now is that she might have liked me before. But since 3 years have passed. Her interest has declined. I might have fucked it all up.

Do you have any advice on how I should go forward with this?

I (22F) broke up with my fiancé (22M) because he lied about his financial situation so bad, and wanted me to sign a lease he couldn’t afford which would drain my trust fund. 

This started 3 years ago when I met him on a dating app. We hit it off and everything just moved extremely quickly. However, basically to set himself off from the crowd, he lied about having money, being from money and about his background. He didn’t need to, I would’ve dated him regardless, but he did. 

Throughout the relationship I gave him multiple opportunities to come clean, because his story was quite.. crazy. But he insisted that the job he had paid the way that it did, and that he was basically a millionaire. Even the night he proposed, I asked him to just come clean and we can start fresh and he insisted it was true. 

Fast forward a year from that date, I got into a serious accident with a crazy injury while I was visiting him and got stuck there. He took care of me despite me being completely incoherent, signed all my medical documents for me and took me to doctors appointments. I am extremely grateful to him for that. It took me about 4 or 5 months to be able to recover enough to go home. 

In November of 2021 we decided it was time to move in together, which we discussed on a Disney trip in October. We looked at apartments that were around 4,000 a month, and I told him I didn’t want an apartment that expensive and I wouldn’t pay for it. But he insisted that was his budget and that he would take care of the whole thing. Again, thinking he made 200+k a year, I didn’t think twice. Two days into my apartment search trip, his mother asks me if I am paying for the apartment. I said no, and that her son said that he will take care of the apartment costs if I basically be a stay at home fiancé and do all the chores because I went to school online. It turns out that everything was false, and that he had driven himself into debt to keep his lie up. He was not a millionaire, his salary was maybe 1/3 of what he claimed, and he just wasn’t who he said he was. He even lied about finding my biological parents. 

Absolutely fuming, knowing he was about to enter a lease he couldn’t afford with MY name on it, knowing full well my trust would be used to pay for the apartment, I stormed out and left his house and flew home. I would’ve been fine splitting the rent, but the lies are what completely pissed me off. So I left the engagement ring and went home. 

Now, a few months later, I feel like a complete asshole. He was my best friend, and he never cheated or did anything like that, and he has apologized up and down, and even promised to help me win my car accident case by providing witness testimony. When I left he was a complete mess and still is. His family became my family, and it’s just a mess all around. He was there when I needed him, and helped me through all my mental turmoil (I had a psychotic episode) and my TBI. I just don’t know if I can trust him again with my finances.

Back in high school four years ago i met this guy, I really like at the time. He was nice and good looking. We didn’t talk much the first year but I had a small crush on him. The second year we had some classes together, we talked a lot about mundane boring things and I thought he was flirting with me. He would say things like we should hang out some time. And he even asked for my number. Next semester we did not have any classes together yet still continue to talk and would run into each other and we’re always friendly. We also had small text conversation and would just send memes back-and-forth. Over summer break I continue to try to text him a couple times and never heard back. Finally right as school was starting up I had enough of waiting for him to ask me out and decided to take the plunge. A few days went by without a response and I thought you just didn’t see it or was just going to try to ignore me. I wish that it in the case. He wrote back saying that I got this bad idea, that my feelings were wrong, that he’d been where I was but I should not have done it. He said he know who is being harsh but he had to tell me how he felt. I was crushed, this person who I consider my friend and liked and thought like me back broke me. I actually moved on in about eight months later after us not talking at all and having some awkward eye contact in the halls he wrote me and apologize for the way he acted. i felt this was a sincere apology and he asked me to coffee. At the time I did not have anything better going on so I agreed to it. I was honestly just hoping things would go back to the way they were and we could just be friendly again. It went great and even walked me to my car i but didn’t make a move. He asked me out again and this time we had an awesome hike for a few hours lots of conversations and he ended up kissing me in the end. I tried to schedule three more dates with him over the course of the next month yeah each one he canceled on me within an hour to two of our scheduled meeting time. The third one he wrote me and said it was not gonna work out he said that I was too busy and that we could not do this at this time. I was both shocked, sad, and angry. I asked if we could keep talking or if we can try again in the future. He said that he would think about it and that we could keep texting and see if we were both interested. I honestly just wanted closure. I asked him out one last time and didn’t hear back. A few more weeks went buy and I asked him out one more time and he wrote back and told me to stop texting him and to never talk to him again. Summer went by without a word. The first day of our classes in the fall I realized he was on the roster. I was really scared to see him again and scared how he would act towards me. However he pretended everything was normal. Things just went back to how they were with him when we were friends. We talk each day a little bit mostly some banter back-and-forth everything seemed ok. He even texted me about random class questions as well. I honestly wasn’t sure what to make this but I was gonna be graduated in three months so decided to just put up with it. When I graduated he apologized for how he react towards me and said he should’ve not said those things. He acknowledge that he definitely hurt me and he was apologetic. I took his apology thinking that would be the last time I would ever see them. A few months after graduating high school me and my friend decided to grab lunch. She’s quite close with him, and ended up bringing him along unannounced to me. I’d be lying if I said that I had no feelings towards him anymore. Seeing him was definitely a shock. It was really awkward between us. Me and her ended up going outside to talk just the two of us. We mostly talked about life and everything else. She did mention to me how her and my best friend we’re going to try to set us up on a date again yet he said he didn’t need help with that and was going to do it on his own. We went back in and sat with him. She got up to go to the bathroom and left us for about 10 minutes. With some awkward conversation he apologized again and then asked me if I’d like to hang out sometime. I was caught completely off guard and didn’t really know what to say. I mumble out a yes. The rest of that day went fine. We didn’t really talk much more after that. She did up coming back we said goodbye and he said he would call me. It’s been almost a week now and I haven’t heard from him. I don’t know what I should do. I still have feelings for him somewhere. But I’m afraid of putting out myself again and getting hurt one more time. I’m also moving in a few months and will never see him again. Part of me wants to do it, and see where things go. Best case scenario we would have a great relationship until I ended up moving. But I also don’t wanna get hurt again.

We are both student workers at a restaurant on our college campus. He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. For the first several months, we would talk frequently. At first, I was the one always having to initiate the conversation, so I stopped. I only stopped for a day, though. That day, I said good morning to him when I came in, goodbye when I left, and I'd talk to him for work related stuff, but I didn't go out of my way to speak to him about trivial things. The next day, he came right up to me and started talking to me. 

There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. I never knew what I was going to get with him. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager.

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been acting somewhat back to normal again. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly like before the party. One day, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. It was Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers.

Well the cat is probably no older than a year so he’s really rowdy, has gotten into the trash, bothers the dog (well, as cats and pets do in general, really) 
       My boyfriend said if he came home one day and the cat had torn apart the place, he would kill it. So at first I thought he was joking of course. And then suddenly he starts going on this whole rant about how he’s “actually not a cat person” and really hates cats. Which ok, that’s fine. But then he said basically if the cat pissed him off enough he “would go right to the gun cabinet” “would shoot it” or “throw it out the window.”
       So at this point I’m like ?????? And he tries to justify it saying “well for every one cat there’s like ten more, they’re constantly having kittens. If we can kill deer to control the population, why can’t we do it with cats? We should be able to trap cats and kill them or eat them. They do that in China, right?” 
      Part of me feels like he has a point, although controversial. And then part of me is like wait, what the fuck? Because he was dead serious when he said it wouldn’t be a big deal for him to kill his own cat. I asked him why he even got one if he hates cats so much and he literally just said “I don’t know.” 
      I’ve been thinking about the whole conversation ever since and it just left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I’m overreacting but to me it seems like he’s ok with animal cruelty. What he said kind of changed my perspective on him and I’m not sure how to feel. So basically, would this be a dealbreaker or a red flag in your opinion or am I making it a bigger deal than it is? I don’t want to be with someone who acts like killing their own pets is such a causal thing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162873,public,self,Is this a dealbreaker/red flag?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t7nikv/is_this_a_dealbreakerred_flag/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,

Im posting this on several subreddits because I need to vent. Now let me just say some people will just say lower your standards and ill explain why that wont work . Also i understand others might judge me which is fair enough. Now that said onto my issue.

My standards are too high and its driving me suicidal.  I love fit athletic muscular women. The problem is im out of shape, depressed as fuck and have learning disabilities.   Im also 38 so time is not on my side.

Now you say lower your standards! I hear. And i get it. But that wont work. Ive missed out on my youth and physical relationships so much that at this point i feel id rather be alone than not have the fun of that relationship attraction. Like i imagined meeting a woman strong so we could play wrestle, arm wrestle etc and it would be close . To me thats so sexy, a strong woman.  And im not really attracted to average women. Hell even women most consider beautiful like movie stars. I just love athletes.

My big love was a red head called jennifer. She didnt want me. Ive loved her for 15 years. It was an obsession. I couldnt let go. And we havent talked in years. But she was perfect for my taste. A buff redhead woman for me is amazing, perfection. But more importantly she was sweet. Kind and graceful. This is a problem  because anyone since has never measured up to her.

And even if i lowered my standards, i would always resent that the partner, no matter how nice or kind, would not be as good as her. And i refuse to do that to anyone. Nobody deserves second best and i would not do that to someone, to be with someone yet wish they were someone else. Id rather die alone than do that to someone. 

I really do feel like id do anything to meet someone like jen. But ive tried and none are interested. I try self improvement but depression kills it. And it makes me think even if i change at 38 im so far behind other guys what can i do? I have no career because of my mental illness. I have nothing to offer except love and i have so much of it in my heart it kills me to not have a partner to share it with. I imagined meeting someoen fit who could help me with my fitness goals while sharing life.

I know i could lower my standards, and i know im not anyone special. But then id still be miserable, the only difference is id be accepting someone else who i didnt truly feel passionate about and thats not fair to them.  I feel too many people just get with someone because of lonliness.

Ive tried dating sites.  Dms, etc. Ive tried getting fit but i always end up feeling hopeless and giving up. My heart truly is in so much pain im considering , truly, ending my life.  I know it sounds ridiculous and i get that. I just am struggling to cope.

Im no one special or high standard myself so im aware im a hypocrite and understand any judgement.

so, about six months ago, i started talking to this guy at a college party. we were in a few classes together and had some mutual friends but had never properly hung out. i asked him if he wanted to get coffee and we set up a time to get together.

i only considered this a completely platonic relationship until we met up after the party. we ended up talking for two and a half hours in the cafe on campus. he was so easy to talk to and we surprisingly had a lot in common. we talked about everything, our families and our college experiences and lots of shared interests. i was worried he'd want to leave at some point but he was happy to stay and talk until we had to go to class.

it was then i realized i was developing a crush on this guy. i got butterflies in my stomach every time i thought about him and seeing him was always the best part of my day. in the course of these six months, he went from being someone i barely knew to one of the closest friends i've ever had. the thing is... he has been in a committed relationship with someone else for two years, the kind of couple that acts like they're going to be together forever. however, i also know she pays for a lot of his expenses and gives him money all the time since she comes from a much wealthier family than he does. so idk if that has anything to do with it.

i just can't shake the feeling that he likes me as more than a friend. we hang out at least once a week, usually for about four hours at a time. he always finds excuses to keep each get-together going, like shopping after we get coffee and bringing me on errands. he's super willing to do favors for me, like proofread my essays and help me look for jobs. once, he even volunteered to give me a ride to the train station at 7 in the morning before i even thought to ask. he's always giving me compliments and his friends (and girlfriend) tell me about how highly he thinks of me. whenever i talk about what he and i do together with other friends, they always say that it's cute and that they're glad we found each other.

thus far, there had been a lot of plausible deniability but something happened recently that made me question how he really felt. basically, he invited me to the symphony. his idea was to get super stoned and take the bus there and just have that experience together. if i was actually dating him, i would find it super romantic that he asked me but i don't know if he realizes that's how it comes off. i just find it odd since his girlfriend complains he doesn't take her on dates and i never hear about what they do together. i question why he didn't invite her to the symphony instead.

So I went out with a girl recently. We had been talking for a few months and finally went out on the first date. She was great at first, and we talked for hours but let's just say the conversation didn't end too well. At some point, she only kept talking about herself and barely asked me questions about my own life. We did talk a lot about our philosophies, and other points of interest but I couldn't tell if she was confident or just egotistic. The conservation got awkward when it came to dating and our different takes on it. She just had a lot of dislikes as a person including most animals and didn't find physical affection too attractive. She also described herself as independent and not liking certain other things. It was more of incompatible ideas at this point but she tripped a red flag of mine when she said she slept with her ex's friend after a breakup and didn't regret it. But she stopped talking to her other friend because she slept with her ex-boyfriend. I found this funny and pointed out the hypocrisy ever so slightly but I think despite her denial she didn't like that I was judging her. Now I don't want to claim the moral high ground or anything as I'm far from perfect myself. But I opened up about some shitty stuff I did to make the judgment even on both sides. She was perfectly honest and opinionated regarding a lot of things and I dint feel like I should judge her/ punish her for opening up to me.

 Anyway, the date ended awkwardly and I'm just chalking it up to an issue of incompatibility as we had too many different views on things. She's really cute but I somehow got turned off midway, somewhere in my head some flags got tripped.  She was pretty decent overall, just different people I guess.

We go meet at a club and it’s very busy but she told me beforehand that she’s going there with her girls and I said I had some of my boys to go with.. I was way behind the queue and the club closed because it was full.. I go with like 2 friends to a bar and told the girl to tell me when’s she’s out of the club.

After like 1:30h she’s out and I told her to come upstairs to the pool tables. We were like 15 people after a short while.
I only knew her and the 2 friends. But her bestie would keep taking pics of us two and saying she liked us a couple. And was also teasing me if I liked her. 

So her the Problem Starts (in my opinion): her friends kept pushing me to be more touchy and put my arm around her. And I’m a more quiet chill guy and I wasn’t doing the arm thing for long tho. We went outside as 4 people to smoke(I don’t haha) and her bestie met this guy like 2h ago and they started making out after a short time.. and then they started pushing me again to put my arm around her .. but It felt random to me while them 3 were smoking. 
We went back inside and played more pool. After a while we went outside, they smoked and the girl I was talking to and her bestie got picked up by the dad… the bestie and her guy made out a lot to say goodbye .. I only hugged her and told her we should meet on Sunday again.. which she agreed.. she kinda hurried to the car then. 

So now she’s barely texting me and giving kinda dry responses and kinda canceled the plans on Sunday because she’s now meeting her bestie.. so I’m thinking she got jealous of her friend for having a guy who’s more touchy and kissing her already??

I'm in 46 days no contact. My ex boyfriend broke up with me in April (I know that's awhile ago but hear me out) because he said we need to work on ourselves but then he said he has a different vision of the type of woman he wants despite his feelings for me in May, when I broke no contact. I end up removing him from instagram and he breadcrumbs me later in June by liking my posts from other apps and then requesting me again on Instagram and even liking my picture. I made the mistake of contacting him after this and then went the vicious cycle for months of him breadcrumbing me, texting me whenever he feels like it and only reaching out when he felt like he was losing me (I tagged two guys on instagram and he contacted me the next day). Finally, he admitted he will always care for me but doesn't want a relationship because he is focused on work and self improvement and that I'm free to go and find a different guy. I responded by telling him I feel like his convenience or backup option because I saw he made a tinder so clearly this is true he just won't openly admit it. I expressed I care about him too but feel taken for granted and that he gives me false hope with his texts , popping in and out of my life. Finally after this I went no contact from there and also removed him again for my the sake of my own mental health. Did I make the right decision and am I on the right track?

I feel masculine being 5’9” [26 F]

I am a 26 y/o 5’9” female and I am thin like a ruler  with big breasts and narrow hips and I feel masculine like a boy. When I am around men 6’2” and up, I feel more feminine and protected. But when I’m around shorter men and females, I feel like I’m the masculine one and it’s my job to protect since I’m the taller and bigger one. Today I met with a lawyer who is maybe 5’7” and I think he was taken aback by my height. Sometimes I can tell when men feel insecure and intimidated by my height and it makes me feel masculine and not cute and dainty. Sometimes I try to make up for feeling this way bY acting more submissive and feminine. It makes me feel like I am less worth being taken care of and given attention to because I am not as vulnerable and feminine as petite women. I know there are a lot of models my height which men find attractive and feminine but the most popular porn videos often have “petite” women in them—which shows you who men find the most sexually attractive. Shorter women also have a higher selection of men to choose from because there are more men taller than them.
Yes, I notice men tend to respect me more and take my more seriously than shorter women in a workplace when first getting to know me.. but once again, that makes me feel more masculine. I also never wear heals because I feel even worse like that. It also doesn’t help that I’m naturally assertive and a go-getter as I’ve had to stand up for myself most of my life due to childhood trauma.

He was super sweet and treated me really well (driving 30 mins and back to pick me up and take me to his house, constantly taking me out to dinner, taking me shopping, so forth). Definitely could tell that he liked me but he talked about not wanting to jump into things too fast because he had done that before and it ended up never working out. I also met his family pretty early on and really got along with his dad to the point where he started calling me his daughter-in-law lol. I guess the point is - it was very very relationshippy just without the title. He would also often reassure me that I was the only one who he was talking to so overoall I trusted him and things were going well.

THEN. some shady shit started happening. I guess the first thing was that one night, while I was working late, he texted me saying that he was going to his best friend's house (let's call him Todd) to just chill and watch TV. The next day Mike and I decided to go out and while we were drinking he hit me with the ""I want to be honest with you but I kind of lied to you last night. We did go to a bar and I didn't want to tell you because I thought you would worry."" He had been going to bars with Todd pretty frequently already so I was really confused as to why he withheld that information from me.

The next weird thing that happened was that one time he got a dm from this girl and I teased him like oh who's that. He shows me their convo and it's him messaging her first. He claimed that she was Todd's Tinder girl/friend and that he met her a week ago at his house and she talked about failing her driver's test or something. So he dmed her first saying good luck retaking it and then said some shit like ""I can help you practice if you want :)"" like HUH. He said he was just being nice (even though what he said to her about helping practice was borderline flirty in my opinion) because he thought she was cool. Obviously, it was still pretty sus to me (why are you messaging your friend's Tinder match ??) and after some snooping, I found out that the girl and Todd didn't even follow each other on Instagram (but Mike followed her). So that didn't add up whatsoever and I confronted him but he really had nothing to say besides there was nothing going on between him and this girl. Then the next day, he randomly explains that he messaged her because she works for this golf place (he's getting into golf) and he wants the hook up for free shit or whatever. #1 if that was the case why didn't you say that right after I confronted you. #2 how exactly did you plan on getting the free stuff anyway if you just met her a week ago. BUT WHATEVER, I just dropped it. He was still insisting that I was the only one he wanted and was talking to.

So the next thing that occurred was this thing with condoms. At the beginning of February, we were at Target and he was like ""Oh should I get some? I don't have any."" And I was like nah, I'm on birth control and we don’t even use them so why. But he kept insisting which was really weird but I just left it alone. The next week I was on my period and he randomly is like ""Oh I have a condom if you still wanna do the deed or whatever"" and I was like whut where did you get condoms I thought you didn't have any. And he's like oh they're from a really long time ago I just found them in my backpack. Weird, but again, I left it alone. The next week after that I was at his house and he left to go to the gym. I went to get a tissue out of his backpack and I find the condoms that he was talking about. Except there are like 10 of them! - I check his bedside drawer and he has a few in there as well. So this was super weird to me because how do you just not know that there are like 10 condoms in your bag. SO AGAIN I DO SOME SNOOPING, and find out that they were manufactured on December 31st, 2021. So these ""really old condoms"" were not really that old. And that shit was so suspicious to me. I literally do not understand how you can just forget that you have those, especially if you've only bought them in the past few months. So I'm plotting my confrontation speech and when he gets home I bring it up and ask him about it. I tell him that I honestly just want the truth and that I don’t care what he has done at this point I just want to know if he is with other people (1. for my own safety in terms of STDs and all that and 2. so I can adjust my expectations for what this is). But same shit, he claims that he isn't seeing any other girls or entertaining any girls and that I'm the only one. Again, no explanation really for the condoms and it honestly really seemed to me like he was lying because of his hesitation and he kept just going silent. So I broke it off because shit just wasn't adding up and his explanations made absolutely NO sense. 

ALSO for the past few months, he kept disrespecting my time (he would make plans for a certain day like a week in advance and then the day of, change them around or cancel them or completely forget). I confronted him every single time it happened and he claimed he was just really really bad at planning and would try to fix it but it really didn't seem like he was changing anything.

AND SO HERE WE ARE. The condom thing happened a week ago so I hadn't spoken to him since Monday. He called me yesterday (Friday) saying how he was thinking about me all week and how he wanted to call me the next day after I broke things off, but he wanted to give me time to think. He was like ""I've been thinking myself as well and I realized that I really want you in my life and you're so special to me and have a place in my heart"" and all that shit. I asked him about the lies again but literally got nothing but the same answers as before. He was saying that he would change (in relation to the plans and disrespecting my time thing) and that he was just really bad at planning and does this to everyone. But honestly, I'm more concerned about the potential lying. The stuff that happened is very very suspicious to me and the fact that he didn't have a reasonable explanation (or had explanations that didn't add up WHATSOEVER) just makes me feel like he is lying straight to my face. But I genuinely cannot tell.

He said that if I wanted him to leave me alone for good that he would, but asked me to get at least one more dinner with him or let him see me at least once more. I told him I would think about it. 

So now I'm confused as fuck because I don't know if this dude is just stupid as FUCK and isn't lying about that stuff (I honestly wouldn't put it past him he is not very emotionally intelligent), or if he is lying straight to my face even after I gave him the space to tell the truth and told him I wouldn't get mad or anything. But obviously, there is no way for me to tell if he is or isn't. I haven't spoken to him since that phone call (it was yesterday night, it's Saturday evening now) and I've just been stressing thinking about what to do. 

I guess I'm just really confused because he genuinely does treat me well and spoils me and makes me feel special when I'm with him. I can tell he really really cares about me. The disrespecting my time thing is annoying as fuck and sucks but honestly, it's not a dealbreaker. The lying thing, however, definitely is. I genuinely care about him and I really wanted this to work out and wanted to have a future with him, but at this point, I feel like my trust in him is gone. It's not like I don't want a relationship or anything but I don't want to be with someone I can't trust. Luckily in the past few days, I've been able to distance myself emotionally a LOT. 

It might be dumb but I still have thing twinge of hope in me that we could work this out, and I wouldn't be opposed to trying, but obviously, it isn't in my hands at all. He's the one that has to change and come clean (if he's lying). The past month has been pretty emotionally exhausting and I would not like to repeat that at all. Part of me wants to give him a chance because I really do like him and like spending time with him but the other part of me is terrified that it will just happen again. If I do decide to keep seeing him it definitely would not be to the same extent as before (homie is losing all girlfriend privileges until he proves himself worthy) and hopefully, I would be a lot more detached and indifferent if he were to do some weird shit again. If I don't, I know ill be fine but I feel like I would regret not giving him a chance. 

So yeah I have no idea what the fuck to do because I really like him and care about him and he really does make me happy (a majority of the time) when he's not being sus or a dick. At the same time though this lying thing is really really bothering me but I don't know how to go about figuring out the truth. I have therapy on Monday so I probably won't respond to his dinner / seeing me thing until after that. But yeah. If anyone has any advice or ANYTHING that would be great. 

p.s. sorry for the novel i just wanted to be specific with the context

TLDR: Dating this boy who treats me really well and spoils me but I had a suspicion that he lied to me on multiple occasions so I broke it off. He's now begging for me back but I still have no idea if he lied or not. I still like him and really care about him and could possibly want a future with him, but I hate being lied to and it is definitely a deal-breaker for me. He said he would leave me alone if that's really what I wanted but asked to see me one last time. I wouldn't mind that but I don't just want to run back into his arms obviously.

If you have advice please read the whole thing. I really need help. 

I don’t even know how to write this. Basically, the second I actually start developing feelings for a man, like real genuine feelings I turn into a completely different person and I HATE it. 

I go from a normal, independent person living my life to someone who’s clinging to their phone waiting for him to respond and then literally sobbing when it’s been several hours with no response. 

I have been closed off for most of my life, I don’t open myself up to men, I go on dates, things fizzle out, I move on. No harm no foul. I have yet to be in a real relationship because I just don’t want to open myself up. Well that changed this passed summer. I met someone who I really connected with, we had a good several months together but his replies took hours and it ruined my mood. I’d literally be SO upset and then the second he texted me my mood would improve 10 fold…then I’d reply and it would take him ages to respond making me upset again. It was a vicious cycle. I never told him any of this. Eventually, I noticed he started pulling away, long story short I called him on it and we ended things. I also just realized I wouldn’t be happy with him had we gotten into a relationship anyways (he wasn’t affectionate, I am, stuff like that). 

Fast forward to now, I’m seeing another guy, we clicked, he’s affectionate and I’m starting to really like him and develop some feelings and all of the sudden I went from “we’re both adults who have lives, answer when you can” to now I’m back where I was in the summer crying because he hasn’t answered me all day when we used to talk multiple times a day here and there. I don’t know if he’s pulling away too or if he’s just busy. Things have been going super well so far but I hate who I’ve become. I’ve cried 3 days straight because of this cycle and I genuinely don’t know if I’m the problem or if it’s him. 

Is this normal??? Does anyone have literally any advice? Please be brutally honest, this is torture and it’s this exact reason why I’ve just closed myself off and stayed away from developing feelings for men because it just hurts honestly.

I also have a session scheduled with my therapist next week, but would like some other opinions as well.

My friends and family say I just need to break up with him but I haven't felt like this in 10 years so I'd like to consider another solution as well.

I (33F) started dating a guy (35M) 5 months ago. At the time he was still going through a friendly divorce and still living with his ex. They still shared the same bed and he kept saying she is still his best friends after them being together for 7 years. They broke up a few months prior. She was now dating someone else and he started dating me. It's bothered me from the beginning that they were still that close but the connection we had was so great that I wanted to see if I could learn to live with it. I then found out they were still cuddling in bed up until the point we saw each other in real life (I met him on a dating app), but that stopped as soon as we started seeing each other. He said it was just out of habit, there haven't been any romantic feelings left for a really long time.

Around the time she moved out (2 months into our relationship) he kept saying how she was his best friend and he plans on staying close friends with her and they will probably see eachother weekly for a game they started playing with a friend.
I tell him I'm not as okay with their friendship as I thought I was and was questioning our relationship cause it felt like he hadn't fully moved on. The next day he said he realized he doesn't want to be close friends with her anymore cause now she has moved out, he realized they have nothing in common and he was just having a hard time letting her go after 7 years of being together. He said absolutely no feelings are left, just getting used to the fact that she's not in his life anymore.

The following weeks she goes over a few times to help out with the appartment (which was still in her name too) and help him move. She also went over a few times to feed his cat while he was at my place. 

We get into an argument because he wanted to hang up the phone cause she kept calling and it might be an emergency. I get really angry cause he keeps making me feel like she is still more important than me. He breaks up with me pretty instantly.
I also have to add that during the entire relationship i had a LOT of anxiety and every other day was crying to him and kept wanting to have talks about his relationship with his ex cause it made me feel so uncomfortable.
He says that's pretty much why he broke up with me plus the fact that I will never be able to accept their friendship. Also says she doesn't like me because I'm not making him happy (cause of all the talks).

During the breakup he says he realized he does want to stay close friends and he missed her friendship. Still no romantic feelings. 

A few weeks after we've broken up (which is now) he has moved out the apartment too and the divorce is finalized. They saw each other to play that game and celebrate the divorce was finalized. 
He texts me he missed me and we met up.
We had the most intimate night of my life. He told me he had missed me and still loves me at least 20 times. Said he had been distant to me because he needed to get his life in order first and I was causing him too much stress and that's why he wasn't happy.

He now wants to see where things can go again. He's been extremely sweet, showering me with love again and tells me he never stopped loving me. 

I realize this sounds like a shit show and It's probably best to just end the relationship.
But I haven't felt a connection with anyone like this in over 10 years so I would like to see if I can find another solution first.
I believe he doesn't have romantic feelings or attraction for his ex anymore. I just think he still needs to get used to a life without her after so long.
I am a very empathic person so I want to try and support him through this. Even though it hurts me, I still feel for him in a way. I mean I can understand that it must be hard.
Im just hoping their relationship will get less intense over time and that he will realise he was just having a hard time letting go of his previous life.

It keeps bothering me that they are so close, but at the same time I haven't felt what I feel for him almost my entire life. I feel super attracted to him, not just because of his appearance but also his mind and personality. The sexual chemistry we have is phenomenal as well. Each time I'm with him I'm having one of the best moments I ever had relationship wise in my entire life.
That's why I would like to see where it could go before I decide I don't want to be with him. Cause it looks like we are kind of getting back together.

I would love some different perspectives on this cause I don't know what to feel anymore.

I am a college aged guy in my early twenties, and I hadn't had any experience with women before this past summer, due to my shyness and pure luck.

In late summer, I was seeing this girl. Our first few dates were probably the most fun I've had with someone my age in years, and they lasted a long time. We saw each other a few times over a few months, namely because I had to go to college, and we lived over a half hour away from each other. I felt elated every time we talked on the phone or texted, or when I saw her. She was and is externally and internally so incredibly cute. We both liked art a lot, comics, and I thought we vibe well, but the final time I saw her it did not go well, namely because I recognize I behaved rude and inconsiderate and like a jerk. Then she stopped talking to me.

I hadn't paid this person as much thought recently because I knew they weren't into me, but I decided to say hi to them and tell them I wanted to try again. They said we can, and I told them the next time will be better. They asked when I wanted to, but then ghosted me. 

The other day, I made a TikTok account being encouraged to, and it included her in my list of contacts. She linked her Instagram on there, and I really wish I hadn't seen that or known she is on there, seeing all the people she has had a blast with, and a large clique of friends.

I'm aware I'm not entitled to anyone's time or attention, of course, but it still hurts. I've been sitting around miserably today, trying to concentrate on my schoolwork, but it is difficult.

I have had crushes before, like any young man, but not to the extent with this woman. I honestly don't think she will ever fade out of my memory. She had such a silly, sweet personality, and a lively, light-hearted side to her.

No girl I know compares to them. I still reminisce about our spectacular first date, and how ideal and fun it was, even though it has been months. If only I could magically relive that day.

Alright all, this will be a bit of a ramble but hope you’ll bear with me. So I’m 23/m and I’ve been consistently looking for a serious relationship pretty consistently for the past year-plus (15 months or so). 

To give a bit of background on myself I’ve struggled with social anxiety since I was about 13 and have always felt socially awkward to a degree since around then (have been told this by peers a few times as well but not for a while). Since about my junior/senior year of high school I have forced myself to be/become social, at first in the hope of becoming “cool” but it has turned into a commitment to getting over my anxiety - I joined a frat in college mostly for this reason. In college I had one gf for about 6 months that didn’t work out but definitely grew my confidence around girls - which was nearly at ground zero pre-college. I was also told once in college (before I dated my ex) that I was creepy with girls by a buddy with no particular context - and that has since made me a little paranoid about coming off that way. 

Since graduating and really since COVID started, I’ve committed to leveling myself up, intentionally going on dates, going out every weekend to try to kill my social anxiety, and working out regularly (just ran a marathon a few months ago). I’ve also finally found anxiety meds which really work for me and have 

Anyways, over the past 15 months I’ve gone out with 15-20 girls on at least first dates, and only gotten 2nd dates with 3 of these girls and never gotten a 3rd date (most of these via Hinge). If the first date went well and I liked the girl, I would always go for a kiss at the end of the date - probably about half of these girls. I’m starting to get a little frustrated at my lack of success and some of the nerves are creeping back in around girls since nothing seems to be working out. Any advice?

Ok, so I’ve never posted anything like this before, but it’s been bugging me for so long that I need to get some outside advice. 

So I am currently a junior (m) in college. My freshman year was great, and the first semester I met this girl and we became good friends. I got the idea that she liked me, but I was dating someone at the time and I wasn’t going to cheat on her in any way. Long story short, COVID hit and we were sent home early that year. We haven’t really talked since. 

I am currently in a relationship now, but I can’t for the life of me stop thinking about the girl I met freshman year. I’ve never felt like I’ve clicked with anyone quite like how I did with her. I have amazing memories of us hanging out, and I don’t know if I’ve ever enjoyed anyones’s presence quite like hers. 

I don’t know if there is anything I can or should do anymore. I don’t know if what I experienced was just a “honey moon” phase of a friendship, or if this girl is truly amazing. I don’t want to sell myself short with my current or future relationships, but I get not everyone is perfect.

I (24F) have been talking to this guy (24M) that I’ve know since we were in 10th grade, recently. Let’s just call him JC. So JC and I had an on/off relationship throughout high school and beginning of college. We kind of always thought we’d end up together, because no matter who we dated, we’d always find our way back to one another. He joined the Army after our first year of college and moved across the country, but we still kept in touch as friends. 

We have always had a strange relationship. Like sometimes we are into each other and we get along great, other times we do/say something that pisses the other one off and we go months to a year of not really talking. So JC recently moved back to the area in the last year or so, but I haven’t made the time or effort to go spend time with him. Not sure why, maybe nerves of not seeing him for almost 5 years. But anyway, I started seeing someone else during the pandemic for almost 2 years and it was serious. I had told JC about it and we haven’t been in contact since last summer. But it didn’t work out with the new guy and I ended things. 

Coincidentally, a few days later JC texts me, like I said, somehow we always find our way back to each other. He just wanted to see how I was and he ended up asking how my relationship was going so I told him things didn’t work out. So of course we keep talking and eventually get a little flirty and old feelings flood back. He tells me that he still loves me and that he’s sorry he took me for granted when we were younger, and he wants to start over and make sure we build a healthy long lasting relationship. 

So we’ve been talking for about 3 weeks now. But I’ve noticed he’s so different. Like in a good way, he’s more mature and wise and it’s kinda really sexy haha. But he’s like this new man that I have to get to know all over again and it’s weird, because I feel like I don’t know how to go about that. We have always had this hot heavy, fast-paced relationship every time we got together. And all of my relationships were never slow paced. But he really wants to take his time and be friends and build our romance and I feel lost honestly. Especially this coming from him (like I said totally new man). I’m not used to taking things slow, I’ve always wanted a slow burning romance but now that I get one for the first time at almost 25, I don’t really now how to navigate it. He’s hard to get to know and open up. Always has been, but it’s never really been an issue until now. I’m an empath and an open book, he’s more closed and doesn’t really know how to handle his own feelings let’s alone other peoples. 

Sex, passion and fun has always been our go to and now we have to really get to know each other and it’s foreign. I’m always busy with my new job and too exhausted after work, and I take the weekends to recoup and catch up on my to do lists, so I haven’t gotten the opportunity to be with him in person yet. But he says I’m rushing us and trying to hard to get him to open up to me, and I’m trying not to. So basically, I guess I need help resisting my urges or persistent ways. I can’t make him open up to me, but it’s hard when you’ve known someone for so long, but still don’t really know them. I feel like he should trust me enough to just share his life, especially if he claims to love me. How do I go against what I’ve always known, which is a rushed romance, to having a slow or normal paced one?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162895,public,self,Hot and Heavy to Slow and Steady,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t7s1f2/hot_and_heavy_to_slow_and_steady/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,

For some basic background information, I live in a small town, but work in a retail store that is very diverse in terms of characters and mindsets. As for me, I'm well-liked by most in my department; although there are a couple I personally harbor great disdain for, I generally like the people I work with as well! I'm described as genuine, kind and diligent. I should also mention that I'm on the Autism Spectrum (specifically, it's Asperger's Syndrome,) but I've gotten so good at masking my symptoms that people hardly ever notice it. That said, I do get very anxious when put under pressure, and fear rejection and confrontation; mostly from trauma that took root during my time in middle school, which also contributed to my lack in romantic/sexual/platonic experience. I also don't really go out much, unless I'm going to work.




Now! Onto the issue at hand: I'm having a hard time getting the people I like, to have mutual feelings for me. In the department I work in, there were a couple women I had caught feelings for (roughly a couple months apart for each one,) whom I thought were pretty attractive. I get along well with them, and them with me; no beef what-so-ever. That said, whenever I've mentioned the possibility of courting them, they both mentioned that I was a really good friend, and one of them mentioned it being unwise to date coworkers (which is fair, but one of the girls I liked had already dated a coworker, with the fallout of it not impacting their work in a noticeable way.) Curious about whether or not I was physically attractive to anyone, I went to another lady I was friends with and asked what she thought of how I looked; her response immediately laced with the assumption that I wanted to be with her, and that I was too nice. 




At this point, I don't even get it. Every attempt at dating, even before the two aforementioned events, have resulted in the friend card being pulled, and myself being rejected. Even trying to find out what it is, that's putting them off, is making other people think I'm hitting on them even though I'm not! And I get if people are a bit disillusioned with the idea of the ""nice guy;"" you've likely seen the posts on r/niceguys, or experienced one going off on you firsthand. But still, how can someone who's been known for being genuine, be considered ""too nice?"" With how things have been going, I'm left at one conclusion: this world's ethics are backwards, and I should just give up. But I want a meaningful relationship, and if I can't somehow manage to get one now, how can I ever get into one in the future?

Then she told me that things are moving too fast ( I agree), she then texted me less and I can see the change of interest level. I then cut down on texting and gave her space. 

About a week time, I initiated the contact and asked if she wanted to hang out with me next week (the place im going to take her is quite intimate tbh). She said “maybe i don’t know”. I like her because it seems like we have similarities. I want to make it happen but the same time I’m ready to move on. 

About myself, I’m a busy person too and I don’t have time for bs.

In my mind I have 2 options:
1, Leave it be and don’t contact her anymore
2, Clear communication to her, let her know that I’ll stop chasing her and keep things casual between us.

We got to conversing right away and the conversation never really stopped. The next day he gave me his number and asked me out for drinks. My schedule is crazy and so was his, so we had to plan the date a couple weeks out. However, the talking never stopped. For 2 whole weeks we texted pretty much all day, every day without fail. Good morning, good night, just got to class/work so talk to you after, all of it. We even had a solid phone call that lasted an hour. We shared a lot with each other, and the conversation never got sexual either. It was a really nice, flowing conversation of two people getting to know each other. 

We finally had our date 2 weeks in, and he chose the spot, drove pretty far to meet me  even though we live in a public transportation city, and it went great. We were there for 2+ hours, he bought drinks, the conversation was good, etc. He was definitely shyer and quieter in person than I anticipated, but I didn't think much of it. Afterward he drove me home, we hugged goodbye, and that was it. I texted him that I had a really good time and he replied that he had the same. He even kept the flirting going for a bit. The next morning I got no good morning text from him which I thought was odd, but didn't think much of it. Then during the afternoon I get a text saying he had to be ""up front"" with me and said that even though I was wonderful and had a lot going for me, he didn't ""really feel a connection."" So I replied wishing him the best and that was the end of it. I don't mind rejection, I think everyone has the right to reject someone if they feel that way. But saying ""no connection"" is what struck me. The reason I'm still hung up on it a couple weeks later is that it seemed so strange and sudden to end it after we'd had a great date, he affirmed it as such, and we talked so well for 2 weeks before even meeting - but no connection? Just seems crazy that meeting in person (which went well) would be what killed things off. I would've at least anticipated a second date just since we both would've been warmed up by then. My friends who read our messages and obviously know me said they think he maybe underestimated how outgoing/assertive I was in person. Over text I sort of let him take the lead. He also had a job that would have involved him in some degree to what's happening overseas right now, so I am not sure if he had to leave the country and couldn't say that, or what.

So I'm just curious to hear people's thoughts. Could a 1st date that went really well after 2 weeks of constant conversation really make someone end things? Or was it a copout excuse for something else? Was it that I didn't invite him to my place afterward? So many things I'm curious about.

A common thing that people who are into casual were saying is that they date but don't want to commit because they knew that the person wasn't enough for them to want to be with. OR that they just don't want the negative aspects and obligations that come with a relationship.

The thing that I've found, though, from talking with a lot of my friends who have been in casual relationships, is that the men (in these cases, not trying to gender generalize here) put in so little effort into these casual relationships, almost to the point of being disrespectful. Things like cancelling last minute, not putting in effort to keep up even light friendly banter over text etc. even after a conversation where both parties agreed to be on the same page of a friendly, fun casual relationship. The woman starts out excited about having this nice, easy casual relationship but then ends up feeling insecure because of the above mentioned behaviours.

I truly believe that people don't really blossom and often don't show their true colours until they truly feel safe and respected by someone. For instance, in relationships I've been where people's behaviour sparks insecurity in me, I close off and definitely don't show any of my good qualities, vulnerability, warmth, humour etc. with the person because I feel so put off.

So I'm just wondering if this approach of casual dating just puts both parties at a disadvantage from truly finding out if there's compatibility. I am just really curious to hear people's perspectives on this side of casual dating and why so many people approach it with what seems like such little respect for the other person and why they think it's a positive dating experience? Don't we get what we give? Don't sometimes things only blossom if we give them water? Also curious why when there's an agreement to be casual, it seems like the men don't treat it with the same respect they would treat a friendship etc. No judgement, just curious to hear some perspectives.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162894,public,self,"People who casually date, but secretly hold out hope for one day finding the ""one""... do you think your approach self-sabotages you?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t7sw1u/people_who_casually_date_but_secretly_hold_out/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,
