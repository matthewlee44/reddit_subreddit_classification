I've had a crush on one at work(49m) and more recently started talking to one who was my Lyft driver (47m). I'm so turned on by being able to turn on an older man, so when he got my number I was like okay this is it.. I got him. We've been taking for less than a week but already exchanged pics and such. He's very excited to meet again, as am I. I've just never been with an older man, ever- actually I just realized I lied because I was in a porno with one but that was ""work"" so it was different- but I just don't know how to be. I don't want anything serious,  which I've told him and he's okay with it,  but I kind of dig how he is. I know he wanted to actually date because he told me and I'm not opposed to it but I said let's just wait and see- because I take dating seriously- if we're a good match. We're supposed to see each other again on Sunday but I don't know how to act like I feel like school girl frozen by nerves- this has been a fantasy of mine for a while but I don't know how to maneuver our in person contact.. the first time was so nonchalant because he was my driver but now it's like AHH PRESSURE! Anyways, I guess what I'm asking is what to expect, be cautious of,  respectful of,  etc. Dating an older dude.. anything helps,  thanks!

Anyway, I'm 40m and I met a woman (52f) last July. I'm a dad with partial custody of my kids, so we date once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

She wants more of my time. Between work and kids, my time is pretty limited and it's just not possible. I have a full time job and I juggle 3 kids. I've re-iterated this before a few times, she's acknowledged it, she knew the deal at the start, but she has brought it up on at least the last 3 dates, so obviously she's really not OK with it. I'm starting to get frustrated by it.

&amp;#x200B;

On the last 2 dates she has started criticizing me. Last night she criticized me for being cold, stubborn, having a short temper, and being ""not sweet"". I can admit to being cold sometimes as I have a lot on my plate and I get distracted by my life issues. Hearing that I was stubborn and short tempered was surprising to me, though, because I have purposefully avoided displaying both of those qualities as I find them to be unattractive, and to my memory I have not been either of those things with this person. The last thing, ""not sweet"", I'm not entirely sure but I think it's maybe tied into me being cold.

&amp;#x200B;

So after I got home from our date last night, I thought it was time to do an assessment. I think on the one hand, her asking for more of my time and me not being able to provide would be kind of a deal breaker, but she's said she's ""ok"" with it when she's obviously not. As for the criticism, I can handle criticism but when it comes with no examples or really anything to point to then it just kind of feels unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking general advice as to how to handle this, any thoughts. I woke up this morning feeling like I don't really want to continue this relationship, but maybe I'm being a bit hasty and there is some wiggle room. Any thoughts or observations appreciated.

But it's all futile. They are not you. Everyone is different and has different hopes, dreams, desires, and boundaries.

Some people are highly sexual, open, trusting, happy to flirt and sext early. Others won't have sex before marriage. And everything in between. Humour is subjective. One person's turn off is another person's acceptable point. Tolerance for the other person's negative points varies. There is not right or wrong, there is no accepted standard, life and relationships are too complex to distill to a formula.

Yes, it's a free world, and free speech, and swapping stories is good. But for me, these kind of posts are usually just a vehicle for the poster to have their confirmation bias reinforced and tell anyone who disagrees how wrong they are. They are bad for the sub signal-to-noise ratio.

I’ve dated Black, white, Asian, mixed race - you name it. My friends are also from a variety of racial and cultural backgrounds. A pain point with my ex were his parent’s very right wing Daily Mail views. They often ranted about Muslims (his mother couldn’t believe I was even friends with one and suggested I ended the friendship) and immigrants (I’m an immigrant but they dismissed me as “not a typical sponger”). I’d always politely try to change the subject or show a different perspective but couldn’t bring myself to be rude or firm with them. My ex never challenged his parent’s views even when I wasn’t around and dismissed them as “of that generation”. I found this quite hurtful - I have always challenged, for example, my Dad’s homophobic views regardless of whether someone is around. I even dumped a friend who turned out to be a massive homophobe.

Fast forward to today: Met a guy OLD and we’ve had a date and clicked. I’m currently away for work and we’ve been texting and planning another date on my return. 

I stupidly made the mistake of Facebook stalking him and came across his parent’s profiles and took a look. Both his parents pages are filled with proud to be British, campaign to make St George’s Day a national holiday and lots of nationalist stuff. To be clear: I respect patriotism doesn’t always go hand-in-hand with racist views but I’ve panicked slightly. I’m worried in case his parent’s are anything like my ex’s. 

I know this may all sound crazy but we experienced a lot of violent racism (eg pelted with stones, bricks through windows) when we first moved to the UK and a lot of pubs in our town with union jacks and England flags were no go areas for people like me.

I also respect that his parent’s are/could be very different from my ex’s but I’m in catastrophe mode. 

Part of me is thinking “danger! Run! Don’t entertain another date!” :-(

 I suggest back to not have such a long first date in an area we both do not know well, where we would be stuck and his response is to suggest another area where we would be stuck, he likes long dates, he does not like the food in the restaurant I suggested. 

I find this strange. There is no problem to extend a short date if both want, it is no problem to see each other again soon, if both want to. It is very inconvenient to spent a half a Sunday with someone you soon realize to not like in an area far away from your home with a significant walking distance even to get to the car.

I have permanent ED from a side affect of a medication I took when I was much younger. Been to a dozen doctors with no help. Viagra is hit and miss. There's been obvious damage to the tissues of my penis.

I've had a Bumble for the past year now. I've met with about 20 different women from there. None have lead to sex or a relationship. I've had my heart broken badly twice with this year from women who I really liked, but who broke it off after a few weeks.

I rack my brain wondering what I'm doing wrong, but last night this girl ""broke it off"" via text message who I had two dates with. She said something extremely profound. She said:

""you have this very weird nervous energy about you that you try to hide. I can sense it, and it makes me not trust you since you're hiding something. It then makes me start feeling nervous. Our connection was just very awkward, and I wish you the best.""

I think that people, especially women with dating, are very intuitive. It's like they can just sense something is wrong with me which makes them stray away. I have no idea what to do about this. It's like I can't control that vibe I give off regarldess of how calm I pretend to be.

I feel like my problem goes well beyond words I say, or the way I behave. It's this weird ""something is wrong here"" vibe that I seem to have no control over. I don't know how many times I've had women break it off after a few weeks, and now I'm starting to think it's because of that vibe I have.

To use an analogy: it's like you're in the market for a convertable mustang. You go and check one out. You kick the tire, the guy selling it seems nice, it starts... but you just have this weird feeling you can't shake... so you don't buy it.

That's what my dating life has been like. It's like women just know something is wrong with me and they trust their gut and break it off.

I'm obviously going to hire a therapist, but even then Idk. I'm at the point now I literally just feel like telling my dates right away that way they know what's up. If I would have told that last woman, she probably would have been like ""ohhhhhh that makes so much sense. I'm not scared of you anymore like I was.""

This is my first committed relationship since I started OLD in 2020. I was with my ex husband for 16 years and have 3 kids together. He was with his for 10 years and share custody of a dog. My marriage ended bitterly, but his did not.

For me, when my romantic relationships end, they truly end. A wall goes up for me and I move on. I will remain friendly if I happen to see them, but there is no contact. My ex sees the kids twice a year so we text only when exchanging kids.

My bf is completely different and I’m just now realizing this. When we started dating I was aware he exchanged the dog every two weeks, so there would be contact. It came to light later that, in addition to the switch days, he will text her 1-2x a week and see her 1-2 times a month for lunch/dinner/whatever. 

WHAT. This is the woman that cheated on him.  OK, maybe the fact that they had a relationship for a decade means they can remain friends. I still don’t like it. 

My bf and I work in the same industry that is female dominant so he has many female friends. I have no problem with him having female friends because I have male friends. Here’s the issue for me, this week I find out that some of his “friends” are women he’s dated in the past.

WHAT. Those aren’t friends, those are past lovers. So now it gets me thinking when he’s going to go meet a friend, it’s really past lovers he is meeting.

I know he is not a cheater. We’ve had conversations about cheating since that ended his marriage. But my concern is why does he feel the need to still keep ties with all these exes? 

Last night he told me he’d have to push back our outing with my kids because he’s having brunch with a friend who’s having a hard time. I asked which friend, and he tells me it’s M, who I recognize as the girl he dated right before me. She is the one who was in love with him and wanted a serious relationship, but he did not. He said her business is tanking and she’s having suicidal thoughts. I didn’t know they were still in touch. But apparently they’ve been texting every couple of weeks or so.

WHAT. Why is she contacting him with suicidal thoughts? He told me he doesn’t “throw away relationships” and if he can help someone he will.

I’m trying to be understanding but having a HARD time. I have kids who keep me busy 24/7, while he does not. Maybe he’s able to keep all these relationships because he has more time? Or does he enjoy the attention from multiple sources? I know men/women will use the guise of friendship to keep hope alive so that they can rekindle later on. It’s not like I don’t trust him- I don’t trust their motives.

The kicker in all this is that, at the end of this argument last night, he told me he knows it’s a double standard, but he would not be okay with me being friends with any past lovers. I went home upset and woke up upset.

Do I just deal with this? Is he more emotionally mature and empathetic than me and I am just a massive asshole?

Pros: this seems low risk, the kids are not going to become attached after one meeting, and there should be plenty of fun/distractions so it will be a low pressure situation for everyone.

Cons: I could use some advice on this. My guts says it’s fine but I’m lacking experience: what are the drawbacks? If we are not together in a few months I am unsure there is any real impact on the kids from one meeting.

I'm (f/42)  dating a nice guy (m/38). I've never been married nor do I have kids. I do not want to have any either.....(I don't mean this to sound awful either)

Side note: I was open to dating a guy with kids because almost every guy in my age range has children and I thought I was being closed minded.

So, we've been dating for 8 months now. 
He's coparenting 2 kids with his ex girlfriend. He has a girl, 11 and a boy,, 9 and they spend 3 days a week or so with him.

So here's the guts of this post:
In December I purchased 2 tickets to a concert for my boyfriend &amp; I. It was a gift and I was equally excited to share an experience &amp; grow our connection.

On top of that, the tickets cost $250 which is a little costly especially since my hours just got cut.

He had no issue with the concert tickets as it's his favorite band.

The show is in 2weeks and he said that he received an email that the annual 'daddy daughter dance' falls on the same day &amp; starts at the same time.

Without technically canceling he asked if I can change the ticket date which he knows I can't. The show is a 90minute drive from where the dance is

I do not have any experience with this.
Usually anyone blowing off plans is a red flag, but this is his daughter.

I've never gone to a father daughter dance either might I add nor would I have wanted to at that age 

I also feel like I'm going to be set up for lots of these types of situations and that's not a good feeling.

So my question is:
Am I being unfair in my frustration/ extreme disappointment over this concert?
Should I politely bow out of this relationship if I'm feeling this way?
How do I even discuss these feelings/ issues with him without coming off insensitive ?

Late in my 30s my now ex decided she wanted to have one more child. Because it would most likely be her last chance to do so. I pushed back but finally agreed. My pushback was based on issues in our relationship that I felt needed talking about, but was assured by my wife that they were her issues that she knew she had them and was working on them with a therapist. We had heartache trying, but after almost 2 years, we finally got our second baby. 5 years later, my ex asked for a divorce saying that she had been struggling for a while in our marriage and thought having another child would “fix it.”  I had been very vocal, tried to communicate before and it just turned out the way it did. 

My issues with dating now, is the lack of time people have for one another. We all have kids and jobs and so on. Not to mention whatever their previous partner did to them being projected on you. I met one person who after a short time of dating felt the need to psycho analyze me when I just accepted her how she was. And tried to make sure to lift her up because she seemed to need it.  When I had a problem and I wanted to share that with her, THAT was the time she decided to psychoanalyze me. Not that what she was saying had anything to do with the issue I attempted to share, so it kinda came from left field. 

But what sucks the most, is finding someone that you click with on many levels, almost every level. They ask you to be exclusive. Then after Valentine’s Day, you get the axe. And the reasons given are things where the person shouldn’t have been dating to begin with much less asking for exclusivity. 

I don’t like dating, I don’t like dating around and I am not here to increase my body count. I just want to find someone who wants to be with me and takes things at face value rather than immediately tries to find an agenda. To learn more about me before formulating an opinion.  

We all have our scars and I’m not looking to find someone who wants to compare them or to try to heal mine. I don’t want someone who wants to create new ones. Just wants to find peace and a person with whom I feel safe again with my emotions. But I guess in this day in age it’s too much to ask for…

Like it’s no surprise . But I’ve noticed that a lot of guys will lie to get a relationship or sex. I read a study that showed a lot of men will do this and think it’s ok. I think it’s obviously the equivalent of catfishing. Trying to land a relationship or sex under false pretenses is so bad. Here’s some examples of experiences I’ve had with men. 

One guy I was dating had this fantastic lifestyle where he traveled to Italy in the summer and most of his clothing was Italian designers like Gucci Prada etc . I could tell he loved Italy and he was thrilled when he met me, a woman who is Italian. He told me he was Italian and would love to take me to Italy someday if we hit it off since I’ve never been. A month or two into dating he tells me casually during dinner that he’s not Italian and that he told me that to impress me and laughed like isn’t that so funny? My jaw dropped . I knew he was a bad person then . I further confirmed this by asking him a test question. He had told me previously he was raised catholic. Most Catholics don’t believe in abortion unless for some if it’s really necessary. He had mentioned he wanted a son. I just casually said to him “ so what if we were together and I got pregnant but it was with a girl. Would you mind if I just got an abortion and we try again until we had a boy?” And he said oh yea totally fine. I dumped him.

Another guy I was dating was a conservative type guy. He said he hated how modern feminism was going where women were now sleeping around all the time. I didn’t really care because I don’t want to sleep around myself but I wondered if he had a double standard about it . He was sort of questioning about my sexual history one day and asking me how I felt about the whole thing and I said I don’t really enjoy casual sex and asked how about you? He said “oh no me neither “. I said so what’s the craziest thing you’ve done , was it a threesome ? He then says “no but me and my friend both got jerked off in a car by this girl”. I was like hmm that’s weird. It was weird to me and he definitely was seeming to be a double standard guy. I asked him another time the same question and he had forgotten I asked him the question and he said yes he had two threesomes before. I dumped him.

Both of these guys and mostly every guy I’ve met has tried to have sex with me right away. I have never met a guy who prefers to take things slow like me and have even felt pressured to have sex with guys who gave me the attitude of “ I don’t understand , if you like me why aren’t we having sex?”. Well it is exactly things like this , men lying and manipulating me to have sex which makes me want to take things slow. Otherwise I feel like an idiot after. And it usually takes a few months to see if a person is who they say they are. Maybe these guys didn’t want just sex and I’m just interpreting the lying as a behavior that usually goes along with men using “game"" to get sex. I mean why is that word “game” with men even so popularly understood ? Because I am guessing so many men think of it as acceptable to lie to obtain sex . 

Why would a woman want to be a guys girlfriend if he lied ? They should not and this shouldn’t be shocking to the men who do this . My only thoughts are that I should wait a few months before proceeding to sex with a guy. What do you think should be the strategy to avoid these types of men?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67856,public,self,Encountering a lot of men with “game” or who lie a lot,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sxfm49/encountering_a_lot_of_men_with_game_or_who_lie_a/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was absolutely stunning and I probably looked like a deer in the headlights as I'm thinking to myself good lord I'm in trouble.

We have dinner and more drinks and after previous one and done dates with other matches it's nice feeling that attraction and intensity with a new person.  We end up at another bar / lounge after that to listen to some music and didn't finally leave until after midnight.

Update: There was some solid advice in that post and I appreciated everyone's perspective. We waited another 4 months before the intro (yesterday) and in that time I did some prep work in my own home. I let my son (8) know that I was dating someone and that I wanted to introduce them at a later time. That allowed me to have some good conversation about his feelings with me dating, a new person, his father, and the divorce. I started using the bf's name occasionally in conversation so it wasn't as much of a shock. 

The other thing I did was ask my son's opinion on how he'd like to meet the bf. Most of the advise in the original post was to introduce at separate times (me with his kids and then him with mine). My son actually wanted to meet him with the children. It helped to alleviate his nervousness about me dating someone else. 

So we took them to a kids event at a local place, they could run around and play with each other and other kids. Then we went to dinner at a place with an arcade. The kids got along well and it wasn't awkward at all. It felt really normal for all of us I think.

Update: There was some solid advice in that post and I appreciated everyone's perspective. We waited another 4 months before the intro (yesterday) and in that time I did some prep work in my own home. I let my son (8) know that I was dating someone and that I wanted to introduce them at a later time. That allowed me to have some good conversation about his feelings with me dating, a new person, his father, and the divorce. I started using the bf's name occasionally in conversation so it wasn't as much of a shock.

The other thing I did was ask my son's opinion on how he'd like to meet the bf. Most of the advise in the original post was to introduce at separate times (me with his kids and then him with mine). My son actually wanted to meet him with the children. It helped to alleviate his nervousness about me dating someone else.

So we took them to a kids event at a local place, they could run around and play with each other and other kids. Then we went to dinner at a place with an arcade. The kids got along well and it wasn't awkward at all. It felt really normal for all of us I think.

I was so thankful for everyone's advise, but also glad that we did what was right for us as individual parents and as a couple.

I was married from 24-to 30 and have been in committed, monogamous relationships since then. I like dating and mostly date online (Hinge, Bumble, OkCupid). I am emotionally intelligent, have done a ton of therapy, and consider myself to have strong boundaries, be outspoken, and generally able to hold my own in relationships.

I've been chatting for about three weeks with a guy that I met on OkCupid (52/m) who, despite our distance apart (about 600 miles), I've hit it off with. Early on, I suggested meeting halfway or meeting me in my hometown. He has been open to either, but neither he nor I have pressed the issue as we both have some tendencies to rush into things and I'm trying to do things differently after being single for a couple of years.

Over the weekend, we chatted for a couple of hours which was great. And, while I was walking my dog, I had this thought: have I been friend-zoned?

I spoke to him last night and just asked him the question. He acknowledged that while I hadn't precisely been friend-zoned, he did admit that he did think of me as a friend he was open to pursuing something more. Following that, he asked if that had happened to me before. It has. 

Looking back on it, I have probably been friend-zoned by most of my exes. My relationships tend to start well and are emotionally, very deeply connected. At some point, even if we have gotten engaged (which has happened to me twice; I decided not to pull the trigger), we become good friends/roommates. This has happened to me regardless of what age I date (younger, older, same age).

I'm curious to hear from both men and women who get friend-zoned, why they get friend-zoned, how to get out of the friend zone, etc.

I have tried online dating for a bit over 2yrs now and overall have been on about 40 dates. I met some interesting women and and dated about 3 of them on average 3-5 months. Overall though, of the approximate 40 dates I have been on there a couple of things I noticed.

1. I rarely match with someone less than 5 miles away
   1. In Chicago (where I am from) 10 miles is far considering what part of the city/suburbs you live in
      1. Sometimes I wonder if this is by design via the app makers
2. I have never matched with someone who *I* was excited about meeting (meaning I liked them first)
   1. not talking about ""10s"" per se' (those who are clearly out of reach) but I have a creative background and prefer women with a little edge 
      1. I have matched people who weren't exactly my type and I like them first. I try stay open minded because most people are just bad at making profiles (including me)
3. Most of the people I have met felt ""off""
   1. One woman lied about her height and said she was 5'8"" when she was 5' 11"" (I'm 5'9')
   2. at least 15 women used misleading photos
   3. One was a life long lesbian who decided to ""switch sides""
      1. It goes on
4. Piggy back off of #2 I have seen the same women on the same apps doing the same thing for at least as long as I have (2yrs)
   1. Is this a sign that dating apps may just not work for most people?
   2. I did meet my ex-wife on online dating but that was 2008, this whole swipe left/right culture I feel just doesn't work. Collecting and throwing away people seems like odd behavior

Around couple of months back I met someone who is also of my age. She is never been married and stays nearby with her 2 cats.

We like each other and are comfortable with each other's company and are exploring on how to take this relationship forward. When it comes to physical intimacy part so far we only do this at her place. However she is not very comfortable doing it at her place. The reason is mainly the society I live in is usually very unkind to single, never married women. People around do talk behind the back and as her mother also sometimes visits her, she is afraid that they might say something nasty to her mother, which she will have tough time explaining. 

She has met my daughters once and was affectionate towards them, but I am still not comfortable of her spending the night at my place as I don't know how it will reflect upon my daughter. We both understand each other's concerns.

So when it comes to taking the relationship forward how do we deal with this intimacy situation. Looks like it is still too early in the relationship to be spending time at each other's place due to some or other reason. One option is to go out of the city over the weekend but given we are both busy with our lives it is tough to find that common weekend. Also we cannot do this that very often.

How you folks deal with relationship when its beyond few dates and you start trusting each other and want to be with that person and would also like the relationship to move forward.

(Yes, it does happen!). It’s been about 7 months. 

I am usually a bit cynical about these kind of things, and keep my heart a little protected for a long time. But this has been so great, and he has been so wonderful - consistently loving, excited about building a future together, funny, smart, easy to be with, open to talking about feelings and challenges - that I have given up trying to slow things down to feel safe, and have thrown myself into this relationship with abandon, possibly for the first time in my life. I want to marry this guy and be with him forever. Not tomorrow, but not too long either. 

Here’s the issue. I know things get hard. I know they get real. I know this giddy, being our absolute best selves, brain flooded with OxyContin phase doesn’t last. Not only do I know that, I feel like I still can’t totally relax and believe that I have found the love of my life until things get real and difficult and we still want to be together. I think it’s a little bit of PTSD from my marriage. We loved each other and it was great in the beginning but when things got difficult, and our deeper differences surfaced, we got miserable and ultimately it weakened our marriage until it ended. All the marriage counseling and date nights and best intentions in the world couldn’t save it.

So my very unscientific question is this. When will I know this is real? When can I trust these feelings of excitement, and gratitude, and potential? When can I relax instead of being ever vigilant for as-yet-unseen red flags?

I posted this the other day and a few responders asked for an update. 

I told her I’d like to chat outside the DMs and suggested coffee or a virtual link if that was more comfortable for her. She said maybe in a few weeks. 
The conversations continued upbeat…quick response time..revolving mostly around music. I think I’ve learned a bit about her through her sharing some of her favorite songs and lyrics. 
But….

I can’t call it. I’m the one initiating the conversations. However, she did say that she doesn’t initiate conversations but is friendly if one is initiated. I’ve found that to be true. She would send walls of text about stuff we’re talking about that I enjoy reading. 

Also….she isn’t who I thought she was. The person I found on Instagram isn’t her based on things she’d shared. So I’m clueless about what she looks like. 

The more we chat the more curious I get. I’ve given her my name and I’m on google so she likely knows why I look like and some basic stuff about me. 

Part of me thinks she’s just being friendly and isn’t interested in getting to know me outside the dms but that could be some insecurity speaking. 

One of the things I’ve learned over the years is that you can only be totally sure if they feel like they’re 100% into you. I don’t get that feeling. 

I’ll just continue chatting….who knows…I might end up with a very cool online friend and nothing more.

The girl I've been seeing for a year went out to dinner with her ex husband and left me home. I planned to cook us dinner. Had everything out ready to cook for us. Yet she still left.

Her Ex husband comes into town one weekend a month to visit their kids. When he does, she would always tag along to go eat dinner. After we started dating, I told her I didn't like that she does that. I told her that if he's in town for the kids, then let him be with the kids. You be with me. You have a place to stay with me and will be child free for those few days. This weekend, he's in town. It was her idea to stay with me the entire weekend. She changes plans the day before saying she's still going to eat dinner with her ex and kids. She goes on Saturday but comes back to my place that night. Sunday we spend all morning together. I get steaks and baked Mac and cheese ready to cook for us. She tells me she's leaving. I'm shocked. I don't know what to say. I'm visibly upset yet she still leaves. Hours after she leaves, I'm hoping she comes back through my door. But she never does. She continued to eat dinner and hang out. Even if she came back and we had awkward silence for the rest of the day, at least i know that you choose to be with me over the guy that hurt you and you're now forced to deal with because you have kids together. We text and she's unapologetic and doesn't see any of it from my side. Just that I'm too jealous and that there's nothing to worry about.

Maybe I am jealous. I don't know. I think a healthy amicable relationship with the father of your kids is definitely needed for everyone's mental well being. But does that mean she still needs to spend time with him? We barely have time to be together when he's not in town. Now that he is, this gives us a whole weekend just to be alone.

technically  we ended our relationship last May.  She broke up with me (47M) and although  we did not go full no contact, I did move to another continent.   At the  end of last year's summer, we were texting again but I found out she  lied to me.  Basically she was sleeping with the guy she cheated with on  me and although she could do whatever she wanted as a single woman, I  had asked her to no longer contact me in case she started hooking up  with him.  but she kept saying how much she missed me and loved me,  while being with him.... We went no contact for a couple of months.  I  was hurt and angry.   Early November she started contacted me again....    Some excuse about she wanting to cook a recipe I once made for her.   I  had calmed down and been on a couple of dates myself so I answered.    Long story short, it didn't take long for both of us to confess how much  we missed each other, still loved each other and wanted to see each  other.  So after Christmas, I flew back to where she lived and was  planning to spend NYE with her and the rest of that week.   However, on  the 30th of December, we were just together for a couple of days, she  hurts her knee pretty bad and can no longer walk.   I decide to stay a  few days longer and cook, clean and wash for her.  I go shopping and  make sur ethat when I leave her freezer is stocked with fresh meals and  her frigde with enough ingredients to keep her going for  a while.   I  return to my home and every day we text, almost every day we talk and  leave voice messages to each toher telling how much we miss and love  each other still...  She tell me everyday how crazy she is getting from  not being able to move around.   This lasts through most of January that  we decide we want to see each other again around Valentine.   She  really needed my help.  I fly back for another week together.   And then  I start noticing things....  She was not going to drink for a month and  I supported her through January and I though she achieved this.  But  then I saw for example that the bottle of Whiskey I bought to flambé our  steaks was almost empty.   She came up with a lame excuse but I let it  pass because I was so happy to be back.   But then I started noticing  more....   Bed sheets clean when I left, dirty - sex dirty - and thrown  in a corner...  hair under the toilet seat, a used towel with hair and  stains....  And everything started adding up.  I waited until the last  morning to talk to her about it.   I had asked her in December to let me  know if she would be sleeping with other people.   We were having  unprotected sex and I did not want to risk my heath if I wasn't the only  one.  I did not need to know who or when or why,  I just wanted openess  in case we were also seeing other people. She agreed with me.   The guy  she was sleeping with again while texting me how much she loved me is  non-monogamous and sleeps around a lot.   They have unprotected sex as  well.  She's been putting my health at risk as well, while I was  cleaning and cooking for her.   I feel so manipulated.  I feel so angry.    I was hoping that after all these fights we could start with an  honest base and built further, make new memories.  We had made pplans fo  rher to come over to my place in June and then travel around italy....    I know she woud have really loved to do that.... But unfortunatly, I  do not deserve the truth....  And I cannot live any longer with that.   What's even the point of tryiing to be friends when I can only see her  lying to my face over and over again....   I broke off all means of  contact as soon as I landed back in Europe.

I sent a text saying I was disappointed and it was disrespectful of my time to reserve me on my b-day night and then bail. And that if he's intentionally ignoring me, that's super hurtful.
