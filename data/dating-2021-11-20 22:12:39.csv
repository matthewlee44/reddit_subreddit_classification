1,qymunk,1637468206,Moving out with GF soon but I feel sad I’m leaving my parents of old age,"Me and my GF are in our late 20s. I’ve been dating her for 10 months now and we are planning to move out to rent together.
We live 2.5 hours away from each other and we see each other on average every 1-2 weeks.
She got a job that she’s been trying to get for a few years, in my city, and she doesn’t want to miss out on it. It’s going to be near where I’m living now..

My parents are separated, but we all used to live together. I’m the only child. My dad moved out years ago and lived away from here for about 5 years. I was busy with my own life and disappointingly, I’ve only went to see him once. He went back home for a holiday during pandemic last year and then wasn’t able to come back until 3 months ago (he was there for 1.5 years). When he came back, me and my mum went to pick him up at the airport and since, he is staying here with us at home again.

I was sad inside when I saw him as he has changed a lot age wise and it was sad seeing how he has gotten a bit weaker :(

We have no tv at our place and there’s nothing here for him to do compared to being abroad, he’s able to be with his siblings and go out to eat and enjoy the weather.

Because of this, he wants to go back there in 2 months. It was a shock to me and my mum but he says that he feels bored here and wants to enjoy the last few years having fun.

Now as I’ve always lived with my mum, breaking her the news that I’m moving soon made her feel hurt and rejected and sad inside. She’s also getting old and is sad about me leaving.

She says she’s taken care of me all these years and now I want to leave her.

The place I’ve chosen to rent with my GF is just over an hour away. She has 2 cats so we had to find a place that allowed pets. As mentioned before, her workplace is going to be near where I’m living now with my mum.. and the new place is a New Build, and it very nice and allows pets, hence why we chose it.

Today, my mum was saying why I couldn’t choose somewhere close to here so she could come to visit and I can come visit her also and remain close.
Where I’ve selected, it’s too far and it’s an hours drive. She doesn’t drive and has had an injury in the past so isn’t able to walk very long. So she wouldn’t be able to come visit herself unless I or my GF pick her up.

My GF suggested I need to make the effort to come see her every week so she doesn’t feel lonely.

My mum suggested when my GF finishes work some days, she can come over, and could come in the car with her to our place and see me.

They’re not that close and have only met once.

It’s very complicated for me.. we’ve signed the rental agreement now and plan to move next month.

My mum makes me feel sad that I’m going to be leaving her alone and that I don’t worry about her at all (shes getting old), and says she could just go crazy for being alone and lonely and I’d regret it forever. Then my friend says I should spend more time with my dad rather than work all the time as he’s going back abroad very soon and might not come back.

It’s all too much for me and I don’t know what to do :(

*Quick Summary*

Dating GF for 10 months.
Planning to move out next month.
Rent agreement signed.
Mum saying she’s going to be lonely and sad and makes me feel bad that she’s raised me up since I was little, hoping I’d take care of her when I’m older and she’s old, but I decide to run off with my GF and she thinks I probably won’t even care after I go, and says seeing her would be very limited and not much.
Dad is going back home abroad and might not come back and I haven’t seen him for around 6.5 years.

I went on distance some time you know so she could dance freely and all

I am currently dating around and I am finding that a lot of girls are looking for a serious relationship. There’s clearly nothing wrong with that, but in my case I do not feel like this is something that I am able to commit to right now.  Of course, I’m not completely opposed to the idea if I meet a really cool girl, but I mainly want to date and have sex. 

Now the issue I am having is about finding the right timing where I can be clear about my intentions.
Should I be honest right from the first date? 

I really don’t want to be a douche and lead anyone on or waste anyone’s time. So it’s probably best to just be clear from the get go no?

13,qynmkl,1637471062,"I fell for someone with 100 red flags, help.","I need some help here, I'm dealing with a lot of emotions so bear with me. I am recently divorced and have learned a LOT of about red flags from it. Well, I recently reconnected with an old ex from high school and we hit it off fast and hard. We chat all day every day and yesterday we went on a date for the first time since high school, it went beautifully. I felt things I haven't felt in a long time and I feel it's partly because of our past connection, I don't feel like I'll get this kind of connection with someone new. We didn't have sex but we made out and cuddled the whole time, it was so amazing and she's totally into me. She stopped me while making out and said she didn't know if she was ready for sex yet, I respected that and laid off. We just cuddled after that which was great for me.

So here's the problem, she's red flag central. She has multiple kids, recently divorced and still fighting with her ex (including physical on both sides, she insists it's totally over but it seemed very fresh to me), still lives with ex (but insists she lives in her car while he's there), ex is hung up on her and kind of crazy.

Even my friends who know her said stay away and that she and her ex are crazy. But I thought I'd be smart and see if I could just be friends or maybe a FWB situation since I'm not looking for anything serious right now anyway. I'd be totally fine with friends or FWB but I'm afraid even that isn't going to end well for me. Her ex was even calling her during our date, but she didn't pick up and said he was just trying to get out of watching their kids.

Guys I know this is red flag central, I know I can't be with her, but it's so hard to end it because our connection is so deep. We can make each other laugh for hours, we have a shared history, we connect well physically etc. I'm also afraid she may accuse me of cutting her off because she denied sex, which a previous ex has accused me of and it was extremely hurtful. The sex isn't the problem at all, I'd love to just have her over to watch movies and cuddle every week lol, the problem is she's red flag central and I know I will end up hurt.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qynmkl/i_fell_for_someone_with_100_red_flags_help/

20,qyo074,1637472485,I got dumped by my girlfriend and didn't see it coming.,"I dated her for more than a year. She was a beautiful woman and had a kind face. Thats why I think we were compatible, because of our ""morals"". Her words not mine. We kissed on the first date and never looked back from there. She used to say I love you to me every day, multiple times in a day. I had never heard that phrase from anyone, be it from my family or others. I fell in love quick and she did as well or so I thought.

We were very much committed, had promise rings, had plans of marriage. She was in touch with my mom and I knew her family as well. She talked about having kids. She got me like I always wanted someone to get me, I thought that I did get her as well, she insisted on saying things like that she was so grateful for me and called herself my soulmate and that she was so lucky to meet me. I knew it was moving fast. In the back of my mind I always knew there was a whisper of doubt about this situation. But I never let it grew into anything more, after all she was showering me with love and I in return as well. She joined a post grad program for law and thats when the relationship started taking a nose dive. We were still hanging out although less as she was busy &amp; I tried to give her all the time she needed. She told me once that law is hard especially with a relationship. I responded by saying she can have more time to her and I didn't want to come between her studies, not thinking she wanted to subliminally breakup. I had asked her in the past, if we should part ways, she used to start crying and used to tell me things like she couldn't live without me . So I didn't think she wanted to breakup ever.

One day we had a disagreement about her choosing to hanging out with guys late at night instead of hanging out with me as I had cancelled my time with her to give her more time to study that day.  
That rubbed me the wrong way and I communicated that to her. I thought it was a very small disagreement, for a committed couple and could be resolved easily. The next day, she still believed she was right and so did I. Mind you, with the history I've given here, to me this was a minor issue as I've helped her through more serious issues. The next phone call I received, changed everything for me.

She told me she was breaking up with me and that she ""wasn't over her ex"". I was speechless, I couldn't even respond. It felt as if she had ripped my heart right out. Then she hung up the call. Thats the last time I spoke to her. I proceeded to send her texts, that I will always love her blah blah blah. I even asked her to end it on good terms. She texted she couldn't do that. Now, I confess I overthink, may even have slight paranoia, but this never once crossed my mind, that she of all people, would do this to me. The only response I got to my texts was a single ""stop texting me our relationship is over"". I fail to understand that how cruel can someone be to not even end it in person/good terms.  
I was heartbroken and more than that deeply hurt. She knew I had mental health issues (intermittent depression) and was even taking antidepressants and she was too. Still, she marched on with her plan to torch our relationship into flames. But what happened next, that pushed me over the edge.

No matter what I sent her; that I'm sorry, that I didn't know the real reason for the breakup , that I'd been crying or that I was so deeply hurt. This woman didn't send a single text back. She blocked me from everywhere. No words come to my mind to describe the betrayal I felt. It is truly beyond words. She just ghosted me. She lives 10 mins away but I never visited her. I proceeded to have crying spells and the only thing that stopped from me from doing self harm was that she wouldn't even know that I'm dead.

22,qyo7z9,1637473291,"Been steadily getting closer with a woman, but mixed in hot and cold.","TLDR: Both mid 20's, She and I have known each other for 5 months, been talking everyday for 2 months. I asked her out twice and recieved a mixed response both times. Still talking and making plans often, but not officially dating. I'm feeling frustrated and afraid of ending up looking like a clown. Is this a sign to start letting it go and fading off? Or should I make an attempt to communicate directly.

Context:

Met this woman back in June, was attracted at first sight. We ended up volunteering at the same place and connected. She was the one who got my number, and added me on socials. While taking a course together we got closer and began talking more often. During class she would always sit next to me or save me a seat. We were always activities partners for the class. 

The first time I asked her out I did it by text. Truthfully, I only did it to clear the air and get it over with, in a sense... . At that point we had been talking daily for about 2 weeks. She responded that she had just gotten out of a relationship, and it wouldn't be fair to me, and that she didn't want to give me the wrong idea. It never sat right with me that I didn't ask her out in a more direct and proper way. About a month later, we had been talking/texting daily for 6 weeks, I asked her out again. This time I made my intentions very clear and pointed out the personality traits I find interesting about her, and I did it in person. She told me that part of her wants to date me, but part of her wants to spend more time working on herself and commitment issues. We chatted a bit more but then got interrupted by friends arriving for a group event. I said we could talk more later. 

Since then, my attitude towards her has been that I've made the moves I want and made my intentions clear, unless she says brings it up again, we are just friends. 

Since then, we have continued texting daily and making plans together. She even asked me to go to the gym with her one evening. During that gym visit, she mentioned a mutual friend of ours, and stated she avoided doing an activity he asked her and I to do(that I was unavailable for), because she didn't want to give him the wrong idea. I found this ironic considering she and I were hanging out one on one together. Some of our conversations have been flirty too.

Twice now, there have been ""cold"" periods. Where she begins leaving me on read, uses less emojis, and generally avoids conversing. My response has been to back off and wait for her to push back again. However, I am considering messaging her directly about the behaviour in a non-accusatory manner to clear the air. I don't want her to feel like I'm acting available because I'm waiting for her to come around, I enjoy talking to her and if she doesn't end up wanting to date, that's okay with me. I'd still treat her like a friend. If she does, then i'd be happy with that too. I'm debating if communicating that is a good idea because honestly, I feel like she's nervous I'm going to ask her out again or something, like there's pressure to that.

Anyone who can offer some advice or suggestions, i'd be happy to listen to. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyo7z9/been_steadily_getting_closer_with_a_woman_but/

I'm not really sure why that is. I wonder how much of it has to do with the fact that I act differently around people I do like. I don't think I'm ONLY attracted to unavailable guys either. In fact, the last guy I dated ended up finding a girlfriend already shortly after we ended things so..

28,qyp0rz,1637476409,Situationship for 2 months,"Hi, I (F, 29) started seeing this guy (M, 35) casually for about 2 months and am thinking of cutting it off once and for all, however there were both green and red flags that i’ve noticed so far.

*Green flags:* Transparency in his daily activities and what’s happening in his life.

Able to articulate well and be vulnerable with me.

We share many similar values: desire for self development, dark humor, watches same types of shows, open non-judgmental communication, able to display vulnerability.

He is also seeing 2 therapists to deal with his past relationships that ended and with his parents (poor childhood attachment). 

Constant communication and willingness to resolve even minor miscommunication when it comes up between us.

*Red flags:* His attachment style is Fearful avoidant. Mine is a mix of secure + dismissive avoidant. 

Because of what ended badly with a girl called A (6 months ago), he got reattached to his ex of 9 years, claimed no intimacy but just friends and has been telling ex no possible reconciliation of anything romantic. However she has hopes and has told him.

He and ex still meets weekly as friends (time boxed) because he feels guilty and fear of hurting her again if he cuts even being friends because of his own “mistake” of getting reattached. 

He says that there is potential between us because of mental/emotional/sexual connection and i said that same (but i also just got out of a 9 year relationship 2 months ago).

TBH feels we are just each other’s rebounds (spoke with him about this before he said i’m not a rebound).😂

We both have disclosed that we like each other, but i’m also afraid because of what we currently have (casual for now) i myself would be unable to even want to have something more with him because of how casual it is now, and maybe he would feel the same eventually.

I am a 26yo black gay man. I am fortunate enough to study medical sciences in school however due to ky schedule, I sometimes do not have the time to “go out”. But today that changed. 
After talking to this man on Tindr for months , we divided to meet and have dinner. Everything went well at first however towards the end, he kept asking me about my penis size and how nice my ass looks! Then he asks if I can send him nudes. WTF man? 
Throughout our conversations online he seemed so “civilized” kind and patient. Meeting him in person was a different story. 
Am I wrong for blocking him right after the date? I’m tired of just being seen as a sex object. I understand we all have “needs” but  this type of behaviour on a first date is unacceptable.

35,qypp3p,1637479212,I am in ldr for 7 months,"English is not my first language and this is my first time posting Reddit so bear with me a little. Oh and this will be long :)

I am turning 17, F and my partner would be 16, M - we're only 2 months apart. I know, some people would say we're too young to be in a long-distance relationship but I didn't expect it to happen either.

It all happens around this year when I start having online friends. We met when one of our mutual friends add him to the same group we were in. At first, I hated him so much that we fight over every single thing you could think about but not long after, we become friends. Fyi, most people I've ever talked to usually hate me because I am a straight-laced and stubborn person. I do not tolerate disrespectful people and when I lose it, I'll start a whole debate competition with them. Somehow I got labeled as toxic. I think I am. Fortunately, my friends (IRL and online)  know how I am and they are cool with it? More like my attitude doesn't bother them anymore and I'll get a piece of lecture whenever I misbehaved. 

Anyways back to the topic, I and my bf were enemies and then we become friends. We talk about random things in the group and dms.  We don't have that many similarities at this time because he's a gamer, I'm more of a reader, etc. After a month or two, he was so interested in my past relationship and always questioned me when I flirt with my girlfriends (as a joke) which confuses me till now. Why would he be interested in my exes? and why does flirting with my friends bother him so much? It's not like I had a partner or set my eyes on someone at that time so I ignore it. Then I realized I have a crush on him and I was trying hard to deny it because he's my FRIEND! I don't want to ruin our friendship!  Not long after I've realized my feelings, I told one of my closest online friends about it, and guess what. SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT IT because she wanted to ""help me"". Oh, I was mad but she laughed as she knew he also feel the same for a while now and when he dmed me, he instantly proposed to me to be his gf. So, it's all thanks to my best friend but I'm still mad at her lol :)

So yeah... during the ""honeymoon phase"" we were good, flirting was awkward for me but I get used to it and then there's this girl (his ex-crush who rejected him) who confessed to him and got rejected so bad by my bf. I feel sorry for her but I'm glad he told me about it and about other girls who tried to hit it off with him. The same goes for me, once a guy tried to hit it off with me, even though I said no, he keeps pushing and telling me he could be better (actually, acting like that doesn't make him better at all). I don't know how to deal with that guy, so I told my bf and the guy who admitted he could be better than my bf was so scared he couldn't say anything but sorry (that guy is a year older than my bf so it's kinda funny). Like other couples, we got into multiple fights. We almost broke up once but we fixed it by giving each other time. Each fight keeps bringing us closer. It's as if I love the same person over and over again. As we grew as partners, we also become best friends and each other's enemies. After months in a relationship, some people (including our friends) confuse him for me and vice versa because the way we texted and how we phrase something is quite similar by text. He also starts to be more open about his feelings and can be quite clingy (usually for attention because sometimes I talk to my friends and accidentally ignore him lol). 

When we're free, we'll watch Kdrama and the best Kdrama we've ever watched would be Hotel Del Luna because the whole story made him emotional. I was not a fan of Kdrama but he LOVES Kdrama so yeah somehow he makes me fall in love with Kdrama. He also supports one of my dreams to write a book even though he's not a fan of it. We often talk like how friends do and always get the ""You guys must be good friends"" we just play it along before we reveal our real status to them. Their reaction was priceless. Sometimes we even switch roles like he's me, I am him to trick our friends and we'll mock each other like kids. It was so fun and wholesome. He's a huge cat lover and his fav gifs would be catsss... As perfect as someone seems, he also has some other flaws but it's okay because he also accepts me the way I am.

On our 6th-7th month (this month is the 7th) we have irl school means we barely talk to each other because I am in my senior year at hs and he'll soon graduate college as well. Our schedule doesn't add up and sometimes it takes around a few days till we could talk. I do overthink sometimes and I also don't want to annoy him so I keep it to myself till he's on. Whenever he's on, usually he's playing games but he talks to me or listens to music with me during the game. Sometimes he also sends pics of his artwork or handmade gifts he made for me. I feel so loved and I miss him. Oh ya, we live about 4 hours apart and no, we hadn't told our parents yet about this relationship because we're not ready yet. During this period, sometimes I wonder if he'll find someone better out there to who he'll care for and give his attention the most. As much as I love him, I'm excited and scared to know what'll happen in the future.

44,qyqqfe,1637483718,What to do if someone is interested in you first and you want to reject them without making it awkward?,"So the first time I found out someone was interested in me, was through my coworker. It was actually my coworker, we weren't talking much and kept convos mostly work professional, so I couldn't understand why they took a liking to me. 

We were taking our breaks in the breakroom and it was then when they asked me to go out with them but it was very vague. I was shocked because it was so sudden and our break time was over before I could respond. After that I couldn't really respond to them because our work schedules didn't really allow us to converse. And when I did they were avoiding me. So I assumed they lost this interest in me. But then I was hearing from other coworkers that they said I was ghosting them in real life. It really frustrated me because I really did try to get back to them but I didn't want to cause a distraction in our work place. 

Anyway after work when we were clocking off, I made sure to give them my number and they took it. Some things felt off about it, because I didn't really like them then. I felt uncomfortable that our coworkers knew about this happening but it was both of our faults that they knew. They told one of our very cool bosses, and I asked coworkers if they tried to ask anyone else we were working with out like they did with me, because while this happened I was still pretty much new. 

I felt like I was being forced to like them because they seemed like a great person. And even though I'm not a fan of the jealous types, I was very upset when they would speak to attractive clients in the same tone they did with me. This is weird too because whenever we were alone together they wouldn't act like they cared about me but in front of others they seemed to be infatuated with me.

So because of this I felt like maybe I shouldn't be with someone that makes me uncomfortable like this, and I have vaguely but mostly rudely rejected the many times after they requested to take me out. And I really felt like I couldn't breathe or feel good in my own skin, because my bosses and coworkers really liked him and treated me differently whenever they said something about the way I treated them. 

I went through this severe depression and anxiety, where I felt like I had to be with them, even if I didn't choose them. So I envisioned myself with this person in a unrealistic fantasy, hoping things would eventually fall into place. People around me and family members knew of them and thought they were suitable for me, but I was the only one who felt uncertain about this person. I was honestly a lot happier before I knew they had feelings for me

I just want to make things right for the next time this happens just so that no one gets hurt, and I don't end up with this grudge against myself.

Sometimes I just feel like a vagabond lost in a void and don’t know where I’m going or where my true home is. It seems impossible to find a woman who actually likes me here. I’ve hooked up with some but never anything long term like dating. And this year has been the absolute worst. I just have hardly anything in common with most people here. People here generally don’t like outsiders. If you don’t fit the stereotypical persona here then people tend to have preconceived notions about you. One of the biggest crushing blows lately is that I don’t have a date to a formal my student organization is having. I’m like the only one I know who doesn’t have one. I asked this woman in my class that I thought might’ve said yes but she indirectly said no. Yet she keeps coming to sit by me and I wanna tell her to go away but I don’t have it in my heart to be mean toward her. Still I don’t know what her problem is. She sent mixed signals this entire semester and I’m sick of it. Wish she could just be upfront with how she feels about me. So it’s like I really don’t want to go to it unless I find a date otherwise I’ll look like a jerkoff loser being probably the only one without a date and it’d be super awkward. I hate most of the officers in my organization too. They’re super fake and full of it. Especially one who has a ton of single friends yet never tried to help me at all. She’s so pretentious and fake which annoys tf out of me. A supposedly devout Christian who’s cheated on her bf more than any non religious person I’ve known. But she gets a pass for it because of her looks… I just sense her stuck up attitude and that she has a poor opinion of me. That’s one thing I’m good at is being able to tell if people are thinking low of me or not. So I’m at a breaking point and can’t stand pretending to respect these people who I know don’t give AF about me. 

And again this is a formal not an orgie party so it’s not like I’m even expecting intimacy or anything. Just someone to go with that’s all. Lately I’ve just felt more down than I can remember in a long time too.

On Friday night I got a text message from him saying that he had met someone else the previous Saturday night and that they seem to have a connection and it could potentially get serious between them. He said that he would rather let me know rather than ghosting me.

Seeing as I had already pulled back on communication I am really touched that he respected me enough to inform me that he had met someone.

Considering I was so nervous about starting over again after my breakup I am so glad that I met someone so honest and decent!

57,qysi0z,1637491521,She wants to take it slow,"If you'd like to have more context feel free to check my post history.

For the last 3 weeks I've been talking to a girl I really like and she really likes me as well.

We had our first date last week and we had our second date planned for yesterday but something urgent came up and we had to reschedule til next week. I supported and reassured her that I had no problem with it and that she did what she had to do, so that was fine.

We text a lot. Sometimes we're being goofy, sometimes we're flirting and sometimes we're discussing intimate things. I think I'm falling in love with her.

She always says that she has never met a guy she's been this comfortable with and that regardless of the outcome, she's happy she got to know me. I'm not seeing other girls and she's not seeing other guys either.

Last night we were talking she told me that she's really eager to see me again and that she's feeling some kind of vertigo and that she wants to take things slow. She explained that she doesn't want me to change the way I treat her or filter my thoughts and feelings because this has to do with her insecurities about not meeting some expectations of going at the same speed I might want.

I asked her if I could do anything to make her more comfortable and she said that I always make her feel comfortable and that the best to deal with her vertigo would be carrying on talking the way we do everyday but taking it slow.

This made me realize I'm getting attached to her pretty fast but we've been talking for a while. This is the first time I try to commit to a serious relationship and it seems that while she likes the idea of it, easing into it is hard for her. So basically, neither of us know what we're doing because it's our first time going for something this serious.

I haven't even kissed her yet and I can't stop thinking about it. I read from her body language she wasn't reading during our first date and if I don't see it clearly next weekend I might ask verbally with a bit of a flirt if she'd like to kiss.

I just don't know what I'm doing, things seem to be going well, but I don't know what taking it slow really means. My feelings are what they are and I've been excellent to her so I'm not sure if there's more I can do. I'm scared of losing her.

60,qyslm4,1637491985,Dating feedback,"So let me start off by saying I’m 25 and I started chatting with this woman who is 22 , through a dating app last week.

I’m black and she’s white . Through the whole convo, she was telling me how she only like black guys, and I was like for sure like white and curvy woman as well. 

We had great chemistry and we eventually agreed to meet up for a meal . So I reside in London and she lives outskirts a bit outside London. 

After the meal , we decided to go the cinemas. The romantic tension was building up. We were hugging , kissing and cuddling and also held hands from time to time . After we departed , we met again during the week. 

She told me I’m a gentlemen and should stay with her for the week, which I am doing now .We still going out and holding hands . 

So the question I want to ask is ,do you feel this woman interested in taking things further in terms of a relationship?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyslm4/dating_feedback/
61,qysxx2,1637493406,Dating older,"So I (M/23) am recently out and have never dated before. 

I met this guy (M/38) on hinge over a month ago. Since then we’ve texted at minimum once or twice, every day since. We’ve Met up total 4 times. Once at his place for drinks and fun. second time for movie, pizza, beers at his place. the third time we went to this fancy restaurant, followed by drunk sex (I’m new to city so when he asked if I wanted to go to ___ I presumed it was a pub). And last time was drinks and fun. I find these details relavent for my later question. 

During our date he was telling me how he wants to get married and is super interested in starting to date someone again. He also attempted to pay for the $200 bill. Then proceeded to defend it by saying “no, i told my colleagues that I was going on this date tonight, let me pay”. That almost made it an ick. Idk I’m just scared I think cause it’s all so new. And I tend to run away from the thought of being hurt. 

I like him. He’s nice, sweet, romantic, funny, and pretty hot. Which is seemingly rare. 

The only thing holding me back from putting in more mental effort is his age. I know of one or two couples with a 14-16 year age gap. But they’re in their 40-50s so it doesn’t seem as odd to me. 

With the following in mind, what would you advise I do:

- I’m newly out to friends/family 
- I’ve never dated before
- He’s wanting to pursue a relationship but is open to fun (in general terms tho. I still don’t know what he exactly wants with or from me) 
- he’s 15 years older than Moi",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qysxx2/dating_older/

However, I’ve been thinking about her like crazy since then. I feel like I made a mistake by saying that. Part of me thinks she’s not into me because there isn’t much flirty chemistry, but part of me thinks she just agreed because she didn’t want to be pushy.

I feel like asking her out again, but I deleted her phone number and we unmatched on Hinge. I don’t have her on any socials either.

66,qytgdf,1637495662,Girlfriend is starting to get on my nerves,"Hello. This may sound bad, but I want a third party viewpoint. 

I (M21) have been dating my girlfriend (F23) for almost a year. Things were great in the beginning, and I'm sure they have the ability to be great again as well. However lately I'm starting to get frustrated.

Backstory: I'm in my final year of college, and I also have a pretty much full time job, as well as running a small side business. My full time job isn't an office 9-5, but I work from home where I have some freedom. Regardless, I still have to work. I did not have this job when we met. She is also in college, and has a part time job. I have my own place, and she rents her own room. Since dating her, I moved to a neighboring town. About a 45 minute drive from where she lives, which is not really a big deal in California. Since I started working, I noticed that I'm more on edge and frustrated. Since not spending so much time with her, a lot of our relationship has moved over the phone and such. I don't see her often, and she loves to Facetime and call. Here's the problem, I can't facetime often. I can't facetime and work/do my schoolwork at the same time. It's just not possible. As of late, she is always asking me to facetime when she isn't busy, which happens to be when I am busy. I tell her I can't, she gets frustrated. 

This in-turn frustrates me, because I feel like she demands me to be on her schedule, and gets upset at me when I say it's not convenient for me. Sometimes she'll just say ""I'm busy rn, I have to focus and I'll text you later."" All right and good. However, if I'M busy, and she asks to facetime me, and I can't, she gets upset. And even when I do, it ends up being an hour long, and now I am an hour behind, she gets to go to bed and I have to stay up late and she doesn't seem to really care. I feel like whenever she has free-time, she just wants to smother me, regardless of if I'm busy or not. It stresses me out more because I don't feel respected with my schedule and my time. I try my best to make quality time for her, but I have projects, assignments, and people's orders to take care of. I admit, this has made me on edge and probably act a little bit hostile. I've told her this, but nothing ever changes. I just don't know what to do. It has made the relationship really unsatisfying. I can feel the tension, and I'm lost. If we lived together, I know it would immediately fix most of this issue, but I don't know how soon that will happen or if that's a good idea. 

TL;DR: I don't feel like my schedule or responsibilities are being respected and understood by my girlfriend, and she smothers me when I am busy with my work, and it's making me become upset.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qytgdf/girlfriend_is_starting_to_get_on_my_nerves/

Me  and this guy spoke at the event, and exchanged phoned numbers as we  enjoyed each others company. We talked every single day after that, and  met up for dinner and drinks a number of times over the last few weeks.

A  few days ago, he invited me to hang out at his apartment. He told me  there's a spa area with a sauna and pools etc. so we could do all of  that. I go over to his place on Thursday evening, and we did all the spa  stuff. It was really nice. So then I went to take a shower in his  bathroom before we went out for dinner.

So  here's were the problem begins. After the shower, I decided to do my  makeup his bathroom. I put all of my makeup on the counter (which was  already very cluttered with his stuff). And while I'm doing my makeup, I  notice noticed a chunk of compact powder (which was pretty identical to  my skin shade) had broken off onto the counter. I assumed it was mine,  and so I didn't ask any questions. I just cleaned it off the counter as I  was concerned about leaving a mess behind.

Long  story short, when I got home the next day, I decided to check out how  badly my compact powder had broken, as it was brand new and pricey. Only  to find that it was completely in tact. It was not broken at all. My  eyeshadow palette was also not broken.

The only thing I can conclude at this stage, is that it was somebody else's makeup on his bathroom counter and not mine.

I  don't know if my feelings of frustration and hurt are valid at this  stage after knowing him for only 2 months. But I don't know whether I  talk to him directly about it, or just call it off all together?

I moved here 2 years ago and I have no one in where I’m living other than one or two ‘friends’ whom I met only 1-2 years ago… I don’t speak German yet, I live alone etc etc. I recently got on the dating apps 2 months ago or something. And I’m seeing someone for 1.5 months. Also, I’m lesbian if it makes a difference at this dynamic. 

And omg, dating locals is hard! I’m dating a German right now with five siblings and many childhood friends who live in the same city. While the person has many social occasions going on at their life, for me, I feel like the person I’m dating is the closest person to me in this city but I’ve also only known them for a month or two! So, it’s a very unhealthy mindset.

My last relationship ended because I became too dependent on them and it was also because of the same reasons. But I’ll never have a family or friendship situations like they have in this country. I also acknowledge that they’re still strangers from dating apps at this point, so it’s healthy to keep a distance. 

Anyone is becoming dependent on people from dating apps because you don’t have friends and family and you feel like these dating situations are the only possibility for you to get some human connection and love and you are desperate for it and because you are desperate for it, the other person senses it and it ruins things?

81,qyv2cj,1637501600,I got lead on and I feel bad about myself,"Long story short:

How we met: online on discord, he texted me first. I didn’t care to start chatting him up like crazy or anything. I talk to him like any stranger on discord. Wasn’t ugly or anything, just didn’t spark anything 

During the pandemic: I’m enjoying my life  and also in need of socializing and I realize “ hmm let’s see what up with this guy”. I restart conversation and we talk sparely here and there

Deep into the pandemic: 
We start phone call ( on his time or when I was free), as bit of time goes on, I told him I am interested in him. He feels the same way 

HOWEVER: his actions doesn’t make me feel wanted or that he actually wants to get to know me. I tell him this and he know and he said he will “put more effort in”. He gave me compliments and said I would instantly be his gf if I lived closer( I was werided out by that)

As time went on, he will say stuff like let’s meet up and when it came near that date he was silent and I would have to confront about it. He has been flaked before and I guess another red flag I missed is that he still has feelings for his ex. 

After being in denial with myself and trying to get him to be into me like I am with him( especially since he was extremely attractive in my eyes and he viewed  me as attractive as well, and I wanted to see what lies beneath his beauty) I blocked him and reconnected, he never answer my call when I told him I will call and he agreed. 
So I sent a paragraph bragging that I had other people who want me…and that he is worthless in my eyes and maybe girls won’t leave or flake him if he wasn’t a loser. Then I block his number again ( yes I know this was childish, I wanted him to feel bad and then I realize he is probably looking at this and laughing)

I have to move on but I am hurt for being so vulnerable with someone I thought could respect that.
I will be going to therapy to heal in general with everything in my life and the fact that I got attached to this guy when before I barely cared for him being in my dms.

If this is what the pain feel like, I don’t know if I ever want to put myself out there. I know time would heal my wounds but for now I feel so stupid for being vulnerable and chasing after someone who doesn’t 100% feel the same way.

Even my male friend makes me loved and the way my friend treats me vs this guy on discord is like day and night( it is too unfortunate that I don’t have any chemistry with my guy friend)

82,qyv7ir,1637502075,How can I stop self-sabotaging myself while dating?,"Hey guys!

Sorry for the long read below but I need your help. Below is some context to my situation before I get to the problem.

1. I (26F) started talking to this guy (30M) 5 months ago - went on our first date a month in.
2. Due to our city's strict lockdown, we couldn't see each other for the next 4 months. We continued talking on the phone every other day and messaging consistently (not every hour of everyday, but the conversation was always flowing)
3. We've had 4 dates in the past month now that we're out of lockdown - he organised the first 3, I did the last one. Great time, loved each one and genuinely enjoyed being with him. 
4. I told him on our second date of my physical boundaries (no sex) and even though we joke about it, he had said that he's not going to influence me in any way. He's been very respectful about it, mostly due to being the same faith and cultural background. That said, we've never gone a date without embracing each other at lengths of time.
5. We have an ongoing joke that 1) I'm also dating a bunch of other guys and that 2) I think he's a massive fuckboy.
6. He told me on our last date as a random comment that he deleted his online dating apps and when I joked and said if it was for me, he said yeah of course. 

So after our last date, we were good for two days until he started to become distant in my eyes .. the communication had died off and I felt like the vibe was off. I called him and he said work was exhausting him and if anything was wrong and if I was okay - I said I was all good and said I'll let him focus on work. He messaged me the next day saying that woman should never lead (inside joke, don't stress) since I was supposed to choose where we going on our next date and day.

So I suggested we would skip this week so he can focus on work and we would do something fun next week. He said that it sounds good and that I can wrap up all my other dates with the other guys (Point 5) jokingly this week. 

Since then, again - the convo has slowly died and I genuinely feel the vibe is off **and I don't know why!** I don't want to initiate texting/calling if he's busy because I'm not a clingy person. I also don't want to scare him off since we're technically not in a relationship and I really don't have that authority. over him.

My mind is going a million miles an hour, overanalysing what I've said, if he's lost interest in me, if he's talking to other girls (and if he is, why not just break it off with me), if he's bread-crumbing me, if he's doing the slow fade ... I honestly just want to block him so I can cut him off as I don't think he'll be contacting me this week unless I do ... and I don't want to go on a date with him if he's not keen in the first place.

Am I self-sabotaging myself here or is he just getting comfortable? Should I wait for him to call/text me about our apparent date this week? I don't want to message fearing I'll be rejected or ghosted.

Articles I've read online have said that a guy who's into you will want to speak to you everyday and won't go through long periods without engaging with you. This guy certainly hasn't now... how is he just becoming distant now without telling me how he feels after 5 months of talking. 

Help! I need advice or a slap of reality please!

We met up for the first time last night, had drinks and went to several bars. He was sweet and very easy to talk to. 

We kissed at the last bar we were at, and then he called a cab to take us to his place. I should probably state here that I'm kind of a late bloomer, have never been in a relationship before (only gone on some dates that didn't go anywhere physical, beyond a hug/kiss). 

Anyway. So about halfway through the ride to his place, I suddenly realise.. he's probably expecting to hook up. I didn't want to say anything in the cab so waited until we got to his place. 

He makes me a cup of tea, I play with his cat. We start kissing again. Things move to the bedroom, which is when I finally blurted out that I wasn't trying to ""go the whole way"". In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have phrased it that way. My main goal was just to emphasise that I wouldn't be having sex. I'm a virgin, but didn't mention it. 

So we continue getting intimate and he goes down on me. And then things progress more and I end up doing the same, with gentle prompting from him. I can't explain my thought process. It just happened. He came, and then we cleaned up, watched a movie and cuddled on the couch. 

He wants to see me again, but I'm looking back on the experience now and wondering why I did what I did. I didn't feel pressured or coerced at all. But I hadn't anticipated things going that far when I was leaving my place to meet up.

Anything wrong with this approach to see if someone will give me their number, etc?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyvlto/dating_for_the_socially_awkward_nervous_and/

89,qyvvrv,1637504255,"Tired of hearing the same line, “its not you it’s me” or “I don’t feel a connection ”. Anyone else relate??","I’ve been using online dating since this past summer. I get matches, have been on several dates, and have met some interesting guys and been on a few nice dates. 

I guess what bothers me is the  rejection after several dates. I’ve heard the same line over and over, that I’m a great person and a catch and blah blah blah but that the guy just isn’t feeling it it. 

It’s hard not to feel discouraged after you put yourself out there and keep getting the same response. How do you guys keep trying? 

And what do people mean by connection? Is it realistic to expect to connect with someone after just one date or two? I feel like good things take time to develop and wouldn’t necessarily say no to someone right off the bat unless there are major red flags.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyvvrv/tired_of_hearing_the_same_line_its_not_you_its_me/

I have been single for a while now and literally cannot find any guy I like that wants to date me. I really wouldn’t consider myself picky I don’t care about money or looks that much I genuinely just would like someone who is funny and that I get on with. I am reasonably attractive and have a lot of matches on dating apps but I always feel like something is missing. Also I’ve met guys irl who seem very very keen on me and ask me for my number and ask me to hang out with them etc and then when it comes to meeting up again they ghost me?

97,qyx1ph,1637507851,Is he fading or am I tripping?,"So I (F22) matched with this cute guy (M23) on Hinge almost a month ago and we’ve been talking back and forth since we matched. He’d text me every day throughout the day and send good morning/good night texts and when conversation would die down a bit he’d try to pick it back up to keep talking. I respond well to this kind of effort so I matched his energy too.

We went on a date last week and we both had a great time and he asked me out again. I wanted to show interest and not let him plan things alone so I asked him midway through this week if he’d want to meet again this weekend if he was free. He told me yes and that he’d let me know if he could (his schedule is a bit packed since he works the entire week). Well it’s Sunday and he has not let me know which I’m taking as a hint he doesn’t want to or can’t see me this week. Which is fine, we all get busy!

I’ve noticed this week tho that his response times are muuuuch longer now where before he would respond like once per 1-2 hours now it’s taking around 6+ hours. I don’t play waiting games so I’ll usually respond within an hour or so depending if I’m on my phone. By the time I respond he’s gone. He’ll then text me hours later or the next morning apologizing for the late text and say he was asleep or studying. So far he hasn’t gone a day without texting me. 

I’m a chill girl but the change in consistency is a bit noticeable and I just want some outside perspective if this is signs of fading and I should back out or if I’m just getting in my head. I’m talking to other guys so I’m obvi not fully invested just in case but I do talk to him the most so I’m curious as to what to do (I won’t confront him tho that’s lame IMO lol).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyx1ph/is_he_fading_or_am_i_tripping/

She even game me communist propaganda from the 1930's to read as well as many other pamphlets. I dressed up nice, and was excited to go out with her. Then this happened. I don't know how to respond. I'm still having trouble processioning what happened. Just another failed date I guess.
