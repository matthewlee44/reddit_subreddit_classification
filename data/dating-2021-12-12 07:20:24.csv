We have been texting fairly often and she has been flirty with me the whole time (e.g., telling me I'm handsome, sending me pictures of herself, etc.).  She even sent me a possible booty call text around 12 am on Friday (i.e., ""I'm wide awake, what are you up to anon?"").   Her and I haven't texted since around 9 am yesterday.  

Should I keep trying to text her or just play it cool?  Personally I would rather holding off on the texting so we actually have something to talk about on our date.  I guess I'm just worried that she might take it as I'm not interested.

3,reph6x,1639317325,What are some of your creepiest dating experiences?,"I ask because I randomly remembered one of mine - a guy I graduated high school with  asked to take me out on a date. I said sure, but I wasn’t ready yet. About an hour later I notice a car parked on the street outside of my house that I didn’t recognize. I was receiving “are you ready?” texts as well. I notice this car drove off…ok whatever. Then something catches my eye - that same car drove down the street past my house. Then it did it again, and again, and again. It then parked again for a bit. All while I was getting these texts. I was squinting so hard to try to see who was driving the car. I’m nearly positive it was the guy. He had a hat on but it definitely looked like him. I then realized this guy knew where I lived, though I hadn’t given my address. I did not even agree to being picked up - I would have preferred to drive myself. I never replied to him again. The car did laps for a while and eventually left for good. I was panicked trying to figure out how this could’ve happened. I lived with my mom at the time and we had JUST moved into that house maybe a month prior. 

I finally realized what likely happened - for some God forsaken amount of time, I never knew that I had my location turned on in my Snapchat app. It’s very detailed - if you zoom in you can clearly see exactly which house on what street. This guy did just that and showed up to take me out.

Hi! Sorry for formatting issues Im on mobile- 16f 18m we’ve been on and off since I was 14f and him 15m. 

So last night we had a great date, and he told me after he was maybe gonna hang with his friends- I saw him texting them organizing it

He leaves his house around 12:30 and I text and say I’m going to bed, I wake up at 2:30 and he hasn’t been on snapchat nor texted me again or answered when I called

I woke up this morning to see he had texted back at 3:30 am and said he was home, he fell asleep at his friends and he was sorry for worrying me. 

But he’s lied to me in the past, and we often ask to see eachothers life360 when it was unclear about where we were at. He’s usually on snapchat often so for him to not go on for ~4 hours and text me once the whole time is suspicious to me. 

Idk what to say to him- when he got home he saw my calls and texted ""Don’t be mad at me” and I responded this morning ""don’t be mad? you left your house and didn’t go on snapchat for the next 4 hours and texted me once the whole time, you’d be mad too.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/repwnh/how_to_approach_possible_cheat/

“Every time I ask her when we’ll see each other again, she doesn’t react anymore..

I met her via Tinder. We went on two dates that were really fun and I could tell she really liked me. The only thing is: I’m a male transgender. I have told her that the second date and yes it was something she didn’t expect, but she said she didn’t feel different about me. She stayed with me till 2 am and we even kissed after I told her my story.

Well.. after our second date we still chat a lot on whatsapp. But every time I ask her for the next date she stops replying at that message and the next day she starts texting about something else.. totally ignoring my question. 

Last week I confronted her about it (not in a accusing manner) because I can also understand someone needs time to let my story sink in. She said she was sorry she gave me that feeling and that she still wants to date with me, because she felt so at ease with me.

Well another week of chatting and me gathering courage to ask her again.. and it is the same story again. We chatted the whole day yesterday, until I asked for another day and it is silent again.

I want to give her some more time to react, but it’s confusing..

Is she leading me on or do I have to give her more time to let my story sink in?”

The situation now:
Well it’s the same. I ask her to date. She stops texting me for a day. Well.. we had sort of a date planned for today. But she canceled because she had stomach flu. But now I get a snap that she is drinking wine at a bar.
But she also says she really wants to see me again. I’m just confused about everything. Why do you sent me a snapchat of drinking wine, while you canceled our plans? Is she testing how stupid I am? A week ago i posted a story that I was iceskating. She asked me with who I was iceskating. I said with friends. She said: “oh not a date? Because than it would be over between us”. We’ve had two dates.. and did not seen each other for a month now. She keeps texting me.. but I’m just confused.. 

And the thing is.. I know this is obviously not okay.. but I just can’t understand people are like that. And I’m scared to confront her with her behaviour, because I’m scared she gets mad.. but I deserve better.. I think.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reqhs7/im_confused/
12,reqrow,1639321421,How do you fellow gay people here do the whole dating thing?,"I (M22) don’t really know where or how to look anymore. Apps such as Grindr seem to be absolutely useless (or maybe I’m doing something wrong?), due to corona going to gay bars around town is not an option (not even sure it’s a good place to look, but it’s the only place I can think of where you can meet other guys and actually KNOW they’re into dudes as well). I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to increase my chances of catching someone’s eye. Maybe I’m trying too hard, but at the same time it’s not like it’s any different when I’m not trying.

I’ve found myself becoming a hopeless romantic once again. I’m going through a period of time where I wish I had that kind of connection, someone who makes me feel special, someone with whom the feelings are mutual, intimacy, and all that. Not just to fill a void and no cheap hookups, I’ve kinda figured those just aren’t my thing. Whenever I’m in public I’ll see plenty of guys that catch my attention (daily, it’s exhausting but my brain is an unstoppable machine when it comes to this); at school, on the street, etc. but as a guy it’s not like I can just step up to another dude and start flirting. I’ve had multiple “crushes” or interests at school already (and here I thought by now, at 22, I’d be over those kinda things lol), only to find out every single time that each one of these guys are either straight and/or taken. Makes me wonder if gay guys in my area are a myth (for reference, I go to an art school, and not to push stereotypes; but I didn’t think nearly every guy around me would be straight). That said, it’s not like people could tell I’m gay just by looking at me or talking to me either, at least that’s what I’ve heard.

I guess I’m a bit exhausted from all these feelings and internal frustrations that come from this, so part of this is me kinda venting maybe, but I’m also looking for any advice or tips to see if there’s anything I didn’t try or think of. And I’d love to hear others’ experiences when it comes to same sex dating (both men and women).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reqrow/how_do_you_fellow_gay_people_here_do_the_whole/

I seem to have started having feelings for him. Dang it.

To give you guys context, we’re still living under the same roof (we’re out on an almost month long trip with friends for business purposes) so I’m with him everyday except when we’re both out for work (we do work while on the trip). We live with five other friends.

I haven’t really given him much thought prior to the karaoke incident. I’ve always known he was attractive (physically handsome, has an amazing voice &amp; great humor) &amp; I even had a crush on him a few years back but we’ve been friends for so long that my crush eventually faded. Until that karaoke incident. *sighs

My response was to shake the incident off because I don’t really know what his intentions were so I assumed he could be just overly friendly to me or it was just a random thing he thought of doing. I tried not letting it get to my head.

However, after that incident, he’s been acting really kind and concerned towards me which makes it hard to forget what happened. I’ll give you examples:

1. One time I had to stay up super late at our common room because of how stressed I was with work. I was internally panicking and I didn't say anything about it to anybody.
Without me asking, he stayed up late with me. He sat down beside me &amp; stayed there way past his sleeping hours. 

2. He always checks up on me. I noticed that out of all of our friends, he was the one who would easily recognize when there was something wrong with me &amp; would go out of his way to make sure I was ok. (

3. Whenever I felt excluded, he'd make sure to bring me into the conversation. I'm an introvert so I find it difficult to socialize much &amp; prefer being silent. Whenever we're out at parties, he'd make sure to include me in the conversation.

4. He asked to take pictures with me. This one feels silly but I had noticed he wasn't the type to ask for picture with anyone. Which is why when he suddenly came up to me and asked our friend to snap a pic of the 2 of us, I was really surprised.

5. He learned the chords to my favorite song even though he said he doesn't listen to that artist. He took a few minutes off his work time to learn the chords because he wanted to play the song for me. He made an effort to teach me the chords and encouraged me to learn even though I sucked at music.

6. He'd offer to take my pictures. Whenever we're out on work breaks exploring tourist spots, he'd offer to take my shots. He'd see a nice spot or scenery &amp; then tell me to pose so he could take the picture.

These are just some of the things he's done after that incident. I think if it didn't happen I wouldn't have made all these a big deal, but now I've been wondering about what it actually means.. because all those six things &amp; the song he dedicated for me, kinda seem special? What do you think? Is it something a mere friend would do?

The thing is, I’ve been catching myself looking more often at him and been realizing how handsome he is at the most random times of the day (e.g. while we’re eating dinner as a group) &amp; feeling embarrassed when I realize what I’m doing. I've been having the weirdest bouts of butterflies whenever he does even the most normal of things like walking alongside me at a street or smiling at me and it's making me feel a bit crazy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rerqeu/could_he_possibly_like_me/

25,rerzmr,1639325108,Guys - how do you feel about the girl asking you out for drinks?,"Would you find the girl asking you out unattractive or would it put you off in any way?

I am usually not the person to initiate however I’ve been talking on and off to someone for a little while now, and there’s a couple of things (relating to him thinking I’m likely to say no) that I suspect might be holding him back from asking me. Either that or he isn’t actually very interested. 

I have met him a number of times in real life; but only briefly as a friend of a friend. I do not see him regularly and I am no longer very close to the mutual friend so it is unlikely I will see him any time soon. So this will have to be via message. He messages me first a lot, and although neither of us are super quick repliers, I really like talking to him and think we have a lot in common.

So I kind of want to see if I’m wasting my time or not in continuing talking to him, and I think the only way to do this and get a definite answer either way is if I go for the question. But I don’t want to do so if this would ruin my chances altogether and I should therefore just wait it out.

Opinions very much appreciated!

So there’s this girl who I really like. She’s super smart, funny, and interesting. I have pretty low self esteem and think that everyone hates me but I really thought that I had a chance with this girl. We talk every other day when we have classes together and she’ll wait for me after class to talk. We even did a project together last week, and it went really really well. I thought for sure that I might have a chance. She is kind of shy, but I felt like she was giving me some signs, and I know nothing about girls (and just people in general) because I feel like I’m really awful at talking to people and usually keep to myself, but I thought that everything was great.

So, about 2 months ago, she added me on Snapchat, and we had been snapping each other a couple times a day over that time period. A couple days ago (almost a week now. :( that sucks), she just stopped snapping me back. We had a couple more classes together, and she still waited for me and talked to me as if nothing was wrong. I know that Snapchat is super stupid (I didn’t even use it anymore until she added me) but she uses it all the time, and I feel like she saw me get back to her and just decided not to respond. This feels pretty awful. Just last week (and earlier this week) I felt like I still had a good chance and was gearing up to ask her out, but now I feel like this might be slipping away. Should I still ask her out if she’s acting like she might like me in person? How much does this matter? I really don’t want to give up but should I? Am I totally insane or just a little bit crazy? I just feel like with who I am, I won’t be able to talk to anybody else with any chance of getting anywhere, and she is really fantastic and and don’t want to lose this opportunity.

We’ve been dating for a short time (it’s only been 3 weeks). He’s only been Muslim for a few months. He’s very passionate about it which I admire. However he is at time dogmatic and that I do not enjoy. I’ve been trying to educate myself on his religion so I can be more empathetic to his beliefs. We had out first “mini” fight today because I was watching one of the educational YouTube videos about Islam. He got a little up in arms because the narrator most likely (we didn’t know for sure) isn’t Muslim. He told me it’s better to learn from an actual Muslim. I said to him that I would prefer someone that is neutral to learn about Islam from because I hate dogmatics in explanations. So after that I sent him a video of a Muslim youtuber talking about how Muslims shouldn’t date non-Muslims. He stated he saw it already and he knows he’s not supposed to. So I said why don’t you just date a Muslim girl then. He said he tried and it didn’t work. When I asked him to elaborate he said he didn’t feel comfortable. I said we had talked about far more important things than this before so what is the problem. He immediately got upset and said he doesn’t press me when I say I’m not comfortable talking about something.  I said I understood and cut the call short at that point. I kinda think things aren’t going to work because he’s not really open to general conversation on his religion. I feel like if I challenge his belief in anyway he’d get annoyed/upset. I also don’t get that if he knows he’s not supposed to date a non-Muslim/non-believer why he wants to date me so bad (literally wanted me to be his girlfriend after our first date).,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/retf4g/im_dating_this_newly_converted_muslim/

Sometimes there is an attempt at romance that is rejected, and it transitions into a “friendship”. In some instances, there are unexpressed feelings with someone where dating was never intended. In most instances, the object of affection already knows, in which case they are being somewhat dishonest as well.

We’ve been told that if someone doesn’t want a romantic relationship, but offers friendship, the mature and kind thing to do is accept the offer. If you have feelings for someone and truly aren’t interested in platonic friendship, then you are actually being deceitful, regardless if the intent is pure.

I am an 18yo male and have never had a relationship, nor kissed a girl or done anything sexual. Part of the reason for this in the past has been that I used to be extremely anxious about approaching and talking to women, but that has largely gone away ever since I've stopped watching porn (plz don't start an argument about whether Nofap is pseudoscience or not in the comments, I just wrote this for context). I  still get kind of anxious, but not as much. 

I am a fairly good-looking guy, although I have a bit of extra weight, but I would characterise myself as more bulky than fat. I go to the gym regularly and play sport at uni and am not an antisocial person, I am just not part of the 'popular kids'.

I go to a top-tier uni, but I'm not really a nerd. I enjoy talking about deep stuff, philosophy, religion, art etc which kind of helps when talking to girls at uni as most are quite keen on this sort of stuff.

Apologize for my broken English I'm not a native.

It all began when I met in Thailand this Guy from the US.

We met in a bar and we both drank a lot, and instant chemistry so we.... make out in the streets of Bangkok in the middle of the night. He was a tourist ( I used to live in TH) so I thought that would be it, and I would never see him again...

But he invited me for a date on the next day and was amazing, we had dinner and we went even to red-light district saw some strippers... back to my place amazing sex... 

He was a tall and fit guy half Asia, half African America he was my Jason Mamoa sort of...

But he had to leave to visit other places and but we still talking, he had some more time left in Asia, however, I had to go for a run visa in another country, and he came to me!! Stayed for 4 days.. and was perfect...

He went back to the US and we were talking every day... So in the same year, I went back to my country in Latin America, and there I tried my US visa, was denied... and I just thought maybe that wouldn't work so little by little we lost touch... I went back to TH, and lived my life... met some guys but nothing serious... so the following year he texted me saying he was coming to Asia to visit some of his family 

( let's say China)... And I all my hope for him grew again, I even went to a Tarot reader and she told her words ""I'm finally completed, male and female sides"" So I thought omggg he is THE ONE, I'm going to marry him no matter what I will be with him.

During this time of my life, I was suffering of panic attacks and anxiety ( because of drug abuse) and I felt sick physically even tho nothing was wrong... He told me he couldn't visit me in TH, but I said no problem I will go to see you, so I went... 

It was so good to see him, I even felt better, I felt protected I felt loved... but on the second day... He said something like ""Jenny is not really happy that you are here"" .... (Wtf ? ) ""Who is Jenny?"" I replied

and he answered ""Oh is My Girlfriend "", I was speechless I left Thailand with no money at all to see him, thinking that he was feeling the same about me and I was just adventurous ... I was going to spend more 4 days with him! I got worse, all the pain was back and he brought me to the hospital one time... His mom was also in town and he never introduced me to her... 

I usually have my expectations with relationships very low... and when I finally put that high I fall badly.

Well the past 4 days was really weird... and I left China and the next was my birthday... he texted me with birthday wishes, and one hour later he ""butt called"", wtf - FUCKING ASSHOLE that's was even more painful lol, you know when you get that 5-sec hope and is it crushed instantly? That was the feeling with this butt call... 

So I decided to block him and delete his number, two years later here I'm still thinking about that... and I can't meet anyone new, obviously covid happened and in TH the lockdown was very harsh, I finally move to another country but I'm blocked! I can't open myself. And this makes me feel a bit dead inside... 

I've been in other relationships that were left with a broken heart and even worse than him, but since that, I can't open, and wonder is this the result of many failed relationships? or just this one? And why I could move one before? And how I can start again with my love adventure? Also, do I need a relationship to feel fulfilled?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reuvm6/fail_love_story/
59,reuvz8,1639333432,Why is our timeline so messed up??,So me and my bf started dating a few weeks ago. We bonded pretty immediately over the phone (we knew each other bc I used to date another guy in our old group) and talked for hours on end and watched Netflix together and stuff. Then our first hangout that I wouldn’t really call a date was going on a trail which was really fun. Next date we held hands in the car. Hugged the time after that. We still haven’t kissed yet but we both want to we’re just too nervous to make the first move lol. But anyway this next bit is nsfw. Basically we were sitting at this picnic table next to my mom and her friends. We were holding hands and somehow my hand ended up on his thigh. And then I like inched it closer and yeah..I was texting him to ask if he was ok just to make sure it wasn’t like making him uncomfortable or anything. Basically our messages were just us saying we were horny. And then I was like “I’m so confused on where it is” and yeah..I found it. Tbh this was like the most risky thing I’ve done but it was pretty fun. I did it again when we got in the car and i could feel it pulsing. I looked over at him and he was yeah definitely enjoying it. It was only through his pants but yeah. Anyway this morning we technically were sexting if you call it that. He’s told me that he’s a bottom and I’m more of a switch I guess. So basically he said I could control him for the day so..yeah. I gave him JOI and he came. I feel weird about it now since we’re young and idk how to feel about it. Tonight we’re supposed to do it again and yeah idk. It’s not that I don’t want to it just feels weird or wrong or idk. It’s like when we’re both horny it’s great and all but after it’s been like 20-30 minutes I just feel like I’m doing something bad or wrong.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reuvz8/why_is_our_timeline_so_messed_up/

We have expressed that we both like each other and we will Snapchat each other basically every day 4-6 times, usually with short captions/convos, and we usually text each other relatively daily.

During school, we try to meet up between third and fourth period to talk for 5-6 minutes before our next class. But over the weekend, we basically never verbally talk. I know other couples do the facetime thing, but I don't know how to get that stuff started (any tips on this, as well?)

I guess my question is first whether or not I am already doing enough, and secondly if I do want to talk/spend time with her more, how I should go about doing it. We are both seniors in high school and pretty busy so I also don't want it to feel like I am too needy or whatever.

I can’t help but feel anxious and almost a sense of dread. He had called me to apologize for ghosting and explained everything. Then he asked me for a date on Sunday (today)
He did mention that it was finals weekend which is why we could go out on Saturday. He said he had a big test and I know he’s been a little sick. I was the last one to text 3 days ago. We had been talking about movies and how excited we are for Spider-Man. All of this combined I’m trying to be understanding and also knowing the fact that he’s an awful texter. I guess I’m nervous that perhaps he forgot. 
I’m thinking maybe I’m being prideful in not reaching out myself to confirm. But seeing as he’s the one that ghosted and the one to ask for this Sunday. I feel like I need to hold on to some dignity as I did agree.
What should I do? Im scared of being let down, I really was in a very bad place after he left and now that he wants to “make it up” because he was a “jerk” and because he “missies” me.
Him reaching out is all I’ve wanted, I don’t know how to play this. I do badly want to put the past behind us and be genuine this time around. But then again that same attitude is what got me ghosted in the first place.

I’ve spoken to her briefly at gatherings over the years and our families now know each other very well. I was in a relationship in the past as was she so things never happened between us. With that being said, I’ve always considered her a catch. 

After a breakup, I’ve found myself on OLD. As faith would have it and to my surprise, I ran into her profile on Hinge. The doofus that I am panicked and without swiping left or right I exited the app instead. I believe when this happens, the persons card is still somewhere in the pack but I have no idea how much swiping I’ll have to do to find her again. 

My question is that we are friends on Facebook and I’ve been considering messaging her instead of swiping endlessly on Hinge to find her again. My fear is that I would come across creepy messaging her on FB about seeing her Hinge profile.

I have a small bone structure myself although hers was certainly a bit smaller and not too long ago I've been as light as 115 lbs at 5'7. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure I was nowhere near as tiny as this woman. Her legs were like chopsticks, even when she sat down there was really no meat visible and she was wearing a skirt that showed her upper arms and they were about the same size as my wrists which are not very big. The point of this post is not to insult her appearance, obviously she'll never read it at least I hope so, but coming back from the date I was thinking I'm never dating a woman under like 140 lbs or so again. But then I was thinking if she were taller she wouldn't be all that much lighter than me assuming she didn't lie to me so maybe I should give a woman who claims a similar- size a shot. I don't want to waste anybody's time especially my own, but at my age I feel I should have a broader range of taste and give me more options of personality types and frankly just people to date because while some women find a man they weigh the same or  more than not really a problem certainly others do have a problem with it. Obviously you guys can't no I did not take a picture of her, but talking with her she doesn't work out she has a sit-down job and no visible muscle or fat.

During earlier this summer of 2021, I started my job at Taco Bell and work in the drive thru taking orders. Firstly, I don’t really find myself attractive but have been called cute sometimes by older women but I think it’s because I’m Asian/hispanic and have a sort of baby face lol. 

To get goin, my type is latinas. And this girl pulls up in the drive thru and absolutely takes my breath away. She is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful hair and she takes my breath away. She hands me her card and gives me eye contact and smiles. Shit was mad dangerous man it was so attractive. Continuing on, my Taco Bell workers take extra time on making the food for some reason so I just stood there awkwardly and didn’t spark conversation with her. The food came eventually and I thought I would never see her again.

Today on Dec 7, she came back again and I nearly had a heart attack. She was even more gorgeous somehow and she game me that eye contact but it was different in a good way and she smiled at me with eye contact. Unfortunately, I did the same thing and just stood there awkwardly, I gave her the food and she gave me the same sexy eye contact and smile. And she was gone, I wanted to kick a wall so hard i was fucking kisses for pussying out.Like listen I think can tell when someone’s just being friendly but this was so different from anything else. 

My question is what should I attempt to do next time. As someone who has never had a girlfriend or attempted to have one besides this one girl we don’t talk about, I don’t even know how I should’ve greeted myself or started the conversation. I was overthinking it because I didn’t want to come off as too friendly or cuz I don’t know how to flirt. 

Now I will never know if she was being friendly or flirty because of me being scared.

I feel like every time I make conversation with a girl, I come off as too friendly in a way when I want to show I’m attracted to her. I don’t know how to show someone I’m attracted and I don’t want to come off as creepy. 

Help a brother be the better man next time, thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rex6ag/fumbled_the_bag_twice_what_to_do_next_time/

She asked me when I’m free and I did the same and we decided to go out this coming Friday. However her reply times are soo bad. Sometimes she takes 16hours to get back to me. Her replies however aren’t dry and have substance. She asks me questions and keeps the convo going. She seems excited to meet me and we even gave eachother a fun challenge to see who shows up looking the best on the date due to our love for cargo pants. Anyways, is this normal? Am I overthinking it? Shall I just wait till Friday and see how it goes.

89,rexcsz,1639340432,Why does she ask for hugs but never talks to me? Do you think she likes me?,"




My english is bad sorry. There's this girl who I see sometimes on parties lately on the weekends, she always comes alone. She's so quiet and never talks to me but I see her talk to other people a lot. I go up to her sometimes and I can't figure out what she thinks of me because she never says anything, she smiles a lot I don't know if she's just being friendly but she wants to hug me sometimes when I greet her but she also hugs other people. One time I saw her sit with some people and I came up to her and she was like ""omg you're here"" but nothing else happened. So many other guys there always speak to her she's so beautiful think anna nicole with dark hair really I don't even know why she would hang out with people like us, I'm in my hometown since 3 weeks now and last time when I left she didn't initiate a hug when I said bye so I didn't know what to think I don't want her to think I'm a creep and just left.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rexcsz/why_does_she_ask_for_hugs_but_never_talks_to_me/
90,rexdty,1639340514,Wtf?! I'm so confused!!!,"So there’s this guy. Whenever we have hung out there is this amazing communication and connection at least I feel like there has been . Ive caught that he is nervous around me, guess this can be good or bad..... But he rarely texts me. Which is fine. I’ve told him a couple times, I’m getting the feeling he isn’t into me and he swears he is. I stay and wait---- Last night I invited him over. With every intention to have sex for the first time with him and  to be the biggest freak ever. We took shots, talked, laughed even kissed a couple times. I told him I wanted him (sexually)  and then out of nowhere he got a “phone call” and said he had to leave, he  left. Just left. I’m heartbroken and confused, I did text him this morning and told him “ Can't believe u left me like that. Shit broke my heart. Been waiting all week to kick it with u. Trust me I get it now. It's good. “….he hasn’t responded clearly….. wtf?!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rexdty/wtf_im_so_confused/
91,rexeo4,1639340581,Do guys really care if the girl has never been in a relationship before?,"I'm 20F and I've never had a serious boyfriend. I've had quite a few flings yes but never been with just one person. it's not that I don't want to, it's just that I've never truly been in that situation where I could see myself being w someone. 

Now everytime I meet someone new I feel they automatically assume that I'm just not interested in dating altogether.

92,rexfm2,1639340656,F boy Energy,"Fancied a boy for the past couple months and ended up sleeping with him after a night out last weekend. Texted him briefly throughout the past week, and saw him in person once as well when I dropped off a pair of trackpants i had worn home. Just found out that he had slept with one of my friends this weekend. 

Obviously I have no right to be upset about it as there was no relationship or exclusivity but I feel shitty about it and no idea how best to navigate this situation. Any input appreciated, even if we are just calling him a fukboi.

93,rexrbj,1639341596,Unsure of how to proceed,"Mid 20’s M and her too. 

Talking with this girl for about 2 months now. Countless hours on the phone/FT, talking everyday, 3 all-day dates now (past 3 weekends in a row) with multiple more already lined up. We are obviously very into each other, but are taking things very slow (fairly mutual with that). Handholding from 1st date, 3rd date had a quick kiss on the lips. You get the idea. Nice and very slow. 

Anyhow, i’m pretty convinced after a lot of constant reflection and figuring everything out… I think I’m past infatuation and the L word drifts into my mind. Too soon? maybe? but i’m also pretty knowledgeable about what i’m after. 
I keep things like this fairly private and close to me, but i’m wondering if I should bring up the talk about what we are? Is this a relationship now? Is she my girlfriend? Both of us have nil dating experience. Lol
But I do know we greatly enjoy spending time with each other and I can see her with me from here on out right now. 
I’ve been out of the game for more than 5 years, she’s just recently out of a multi year relationship like 4 months ago.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rexrbj/unsure_of_how_to_proceed/

96,reyeaf,1639343430,It keeps happening over and over again,"So hear me out fellas

Last week I (M 22)matched with a girl (F 24)on Tinder. We talked for a while, and since there was a lot of chemistry between us and after a couple of days I asked her out and she willingly accepted. We saw each other and I have to say that this first date was great and she herself asked me out again because she had such a good time. 
After that she gave me her number and we continued to text each other talking about different topics but after a certain she stopped texting me frequently to the point of getting one message a day. We had already decided to meet next week so until proven otherwise the appointment is already scheduled but the fact that she answers me every time after a day makes me think (also because she regularly posts stories on ig) that maybe she’s not into me as I though she would be 
I know for sure that I didn't do anything wrong and I never sent her a lot of messages to understand this behavior of hers but I'm afraid that as it has already happened in the past, this girl will lose interest in me out of the blue.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reyeaf/it_keeps_happening_over_and_over_again/
97,reyegq,1639343444,"Things seem to be going well, but I keep feeling that impending doom of rejection","This is more myself wanting to write something than seeking advice, but open to any.

Ended up giving up on dating before I got a reply back two weeks later on facebook dating by a girl who just looks really genuine, looked naturally beautiful and just a generally sweet looking girl.

She ended up wanting to facetime before meeting, we did that and a phone call and it was great. She’s exactly what I expected her to be, kind and sweet.

We’ve had two dates so far with a third one tomorrow. She was very comfortable with physical contact in person but seems to not like PDA such as kissing for long periods. On the first date she linked her arm with mine so I held it and she was fine with it. She also always asks when I’m free next at the end of the date.

Inbetween dates she reaches out to me by text, we send some texts back and forth but I ask when she’s free to call and we just speak on the phone instead. We seem very comfortable with each other, she’s what I want from a girl.

She told me how i’m a good kisser, good looking and the first normal person she’s met. Also told me she hasn’t had a date in years (not sure how!) and told me all the horror stories she’s had with online dating such as being ghosted, stood up, receiving rude pictures, etc. She can be quite forward but I like that. We spoke on the phone before and she was mentioning about spending weekend together some point soon once everything she has planned is out of the way.

That’s my problem though. I have this impending doom that rejection is about to happen as after dates 2 or 3 I always seem to get rejected. She’s the first girl in the last few years that I’ve dated that could end up going somewhere, but I feel like I’m resisting getting too attached incase of rejection.
