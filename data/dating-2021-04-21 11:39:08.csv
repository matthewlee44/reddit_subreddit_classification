0,mvjqfj,1619023335,How to stop falling in love so fast,"I am a 25 year old graduate student. Whenever I meet a guy that I click with....I am usually enamored and believing that I met the love of my life within 2 weeks. But then I end up with a broken heart whenever it doesn’t work out (I.e., being ghosted, friend zoned, or the relationship just fizzles out). I have only been in one serious relationship so far in my life and that only lasted for about five months.

Let me give you a sense of my dating habits: 

I met a guy during March of last year. Let’s call him Mike. Mike and I we were declaring ourselves a couple in April even though the only interaction we had were text messages and Factime dates. When we finally had our first in-person date, we said “I love you” and by Memorial Day weekend, we were having sex. By July, I even offered to move in with him because I was trying to overcompensate from not being able to see him on a regular basis while he was stationed in the national guard. Things then fizzled out by August for various reasons and then a week after that breakup, I met a recovering alcoholic named Luke. I became fast friends with Luke and thought I was in love with him and still think I am in love with him. Luke tells me that he is not ready for a serious relationship right now and I willing to respect his boundaries. But as soon as he told me that, I contacted Mike to get back together but that only lasted a week because I was reminded of the reasons we broke up and I realized that I was still not over Luke so I thought that would be unfair to date Mike when  I wasn’t. 

I don’t know...l am tired of these heartaches and emotional roller coasters. What can I do so it won’t hurt so bad.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvjqfj/how_to_stop_falling_in_love_so_fast/
1,mvk8r8,1619024719,Moving on emotionally from a questionable relationship,"I (M21) had broken up with my ex girlfriend (F21) last Saturday after having been together for the better part of 2 years. We had matched in tinder in January of 2019, and we hit it off right away (both of us wanting a serious relationship). Personally, I was hesitant of getting on dating apps because I was not a fan of hookup culture (I've only been intimate with my 3 girls, all of whom were exes). However, I saw how most of my female friends were often more relationship-oriented so I decided to give it a shit. Everything was going great with her: both of us lived in a university-town so we were still with our parents while commuting to school. She's an only child, she had the same Catholic upbringing as I did. She would always tell me that the reason why she liked me a lot wasn't only because of my appearance, but also because of how different I was from other guys she's spoken to on tinder (mostly jerks that just wanted hookups).

Then one night in the Spring of 2019, it was getting late and we were up talking philosophically about our past and our previous relationships. She is a very honest person and didn't seem she wanted to hide anything, so she told me she had only been in one serious relationship before, which ended over a year before we started talking. She told me that she got on tinder in the summer of 2018, but she was strictly looking to date. She had matched and talked to one guy whom she had gotten to really like, and they had planned to meetup at a coffee shop, but he ended up ghosting her. She was completely distressed. She happened to be working at a Walmart at the time, and one of her ""promiscuous"" coworker (who was known to sleep around a lot) convinced her to have a ""fun phase"" on tinder, which is essentially sleeping around. My ex agreed because she wanted attention after getting ghosted. But it's how she handled the situation that disturbed me...

Basically, in the Fall of 2018 she would be talking to tinder guys that clearly just wanted sex, and she would give them her address to come pick her up on certain nights. She would lie to her parents and say she was going to a female friend's house for a sleepover. Her parents trusted her because they always believed she was a ""good girl"". So she would get into the stranger tinder guys' cars and the guy would drive her back to her place to have sex. But what was most disturbing was that she admitted that she NEVER used condoms with any of those guys (there were 7 guys she had met up with in a span of 3 months). When I asked her why not, she said ""you know, it doesn't feel as good"". She even had ""accidents"" with 2 of the guys she was seeing, where they had accidentally finished inside of her, and she wasn't ever on the pill... She told me how when she went to go see her gyno at the time, she would always have that shameful expression when the gyno asked if she was being protected. But that didn't stop her.

So eventually she got out of that phase and ended up dating me in 2019. During that same night we had that conversation, she told me how the guys she had seen in her phase were following her on Instagram (and she was following them too). She even had a snap streak with one of them (although she had streaks with a lot of her friends and coworkers). I didn't want to say anything because I trusted her and didn't want to be the type of boyfriend that questioned her loyalty.

However, in April of 2019 she broke up with me after we had issues concerning something else. We didn't speak until January 2020, where she told me that she was sorry for the way things ended, and (long story short) we ended up back together. She later told me how in the time we were broken up, she was seeing another guy during the summer, and then later had a one night stand with someone from tinder. I had been single and working the entire summer.

Since then, I've had a horrible feeling in my stomach thinking back to all the things she told me. Even though she had her ""fun phase"" when she wasn't with me, it really disturbs me how she lied to her parents about where she was going off at nights, when she was having strangers from tinder pick her up and drive her back to their place to have unprotected sex. She claimed she was clean, but to be honest that wasn't what bothered me. It was the reckless choices she made, and those aren't values that aligned with mine.

I made a mistake of trying to be okay with it, but clearly I wasn't. I tried to move on, but in the end I couldn't see myself being with someone who made those horrible choices. So after a lot of consideration, I gave her a call on Saturday and explained my concerns with her and I told her I wanted to break up. On Monday, one of my buddies on tinder sent me a screenshot of her new tinder profile, which made me see that she was in no wait to move on.

I decided that experience left me sad, and I didn't want to date again for a while. I definitely won't be using tinder again. I don't want to put my hatred on the hookup culture, but I definitely want to focus on finishing school and starting my career. But I'd be lying if I said this past experience is difficult to overcome.

How can I get past this?

Tl;dr - I broke up with my ex gf of 2 years after not having expressed my concerns about the poor choices she made with tinder guys before me, and still keeping in touch with them (indirectly) while we were together. She jumped right back on tinder after we broke up, but I want to focus on school and not date for a while.

I guess I won’t go into the full details of my life as it’s probably not necessary to communicate the core message I want to get across. 

These last two years were extremely difficult for me (lost a 2 year relationship with my first real love, my mental health declined, lost work, lost friends, had to move back in with my parents, etc..). I have recently been getting life together slowly yet surely, but given the magnitude of the issues I’m dealing with, I’ve realized that I literally can’t be in a relationship for a while. I’m too unstable to bring my energy into someone else’s life and I have too much rebuilding to do. I’m a handsome guy, and I’ve had a few long term relationships (23-years-old), but realizing this has made me feel extremely bad. I know I want to have a meaningful relationship again in the future, but like I said, I just can’t have that right now and it’s super shitty. I have to learn to be single and content with myself otherwise I’ll never be able to bring the best I have to any future relationships. I know I’m kind of just venting her, but has anyone else dealt with something similar?

15,mvldkg,1619027858,Doesn’t have time to text,"Hey all,

I started talking to this 27M guy about a month ago on OLD. He was slow to respond to messages- would consistently message me every other day rotating with my responses which I matched to his pace (day one he messages, then day 2 me, then day 3 him). He would send me paragraphs though and I would do the same. I thought hey it’s really early and we are just getting to learn about each other so it’s fine.

Went on our first date 5 days ago which was great. He was kind especially after I was an hour late because of traffic. 

Didn’t hear from him for 2 days after the date and I did not reach out either as I wanted him to put in the effort. He eventually asks me how my weekend was and we start texting back and forth. Only about 2-3 texts per person per day. Even though I’m a fan of more communication, I figure this is okay as we should be connecting more on dates and we both have busy schedules so texting so much all day would be exhausting and not beneficial this early.

He still continued to take 2-5 hours between each response hence only 2-3 texts per person per day. No calls, FT, or anything else. And while he’s hinted at possible future dates and mentioned it at the end of the first date, nothing planned yet. Only been 5 days though.

He texted me yesterday morning to have a great day to which I said something quirky about my day. No response for the whole day. I don’t ever double text or probe him to respond faster.

Today morning I get this text: 
“Omg so sorry for the late reply. Just got so busy with work yesterday - any chance we could just pause until the end of this week? I’m anticipate a hellish couple of days!”

Mind you, I have a busy job too. And he did tell me on the first day that he clocks about 80 hours a week but doesn’t have time for a few texts a day? Especially this early when he’s supposed to be putting in the effort?

I was planning on ignoring the message and waiting for him to text me again asking why I didn’t respond/am mad etc. To which I am planning on responding 

“I didn’t have anything to say in response.
Too busy to respond to 1-2 texts in a day? Lol what?

I want someone that aligns with me in terms of not necessarily constant back and forth conversations but consistent, timely communication.”

Basically my standards are for consistent communication and I want to get this point across.

19,mvllsu,1619028461,Talking for months then suddenly “not looking for anything at the moment”,"Just experienced something really weird. 

I got talking to a guy from Tinder in December. Our country was in national lockdown which put meeting up out of the question so we just messaged each other. 
This then moved to him giving me his number and moving to WhatsApp. We texted every day, sent each other Reddit links we think each other would enjoy, sent pictures of our pets doing funny stuff. We had a lot in common and the conversation was always great. 

This happened for 3 months (lockdown). A few times I mentioned how we have to meet up for a walk with our dogs when we’re allowed and he was always up for it and seemed keen to do so. He never said or gave the impression he didn’t want to meet or progress further. 

Then we came out of lockdown. During one text conversation, I asked him when I get to see him in person. He didn’t reply for about 12 hours (not really like him). He then said he “wasn’t really looking for anything at the moment” because “life is so hectic” and he was “sorry if he led me to believe that”.

His life is hectic, he’s a lawyer. He’s very very busy...but why lead me on to think things are going somewhere/talk to me for months/initially agree to meet when lockdown ends? Then totally blindside me out of the blue. 

I’ve seen his socials so I know he’s legit and not a catfish. It’s really hurt me (silly I know as I never even met him!) but I really believed we had a good connection and I do miss talking to him 😔

30,mvmvvv,1619031955,The girl [16] I [16] like is currently abroad. what should I do?,"I'm from germany and i met an amazing girl in school. We have been talking and I'm pretty sure we share an interest on each other, but we have never been on a date together. Shortly after we came in contact (january) she flew to michigan as an exchange student for half a year, so we lost contact.

But recently i texted her again and it has been going well. We text each other often and videochat once a week. While videochatting she told me that she wants to meet up and do some activities together once she gets back. But she hasn't esplicitly said that she wants a date with me.

But now I'm unsure of what the next step is. I really feel a connection between us and i also want to keep in contact while she still is in America. But in our conversation i dont really get an opportunity to ask her out or get closer to her.

Im also afraid that we our contact to each other will fade over time, because she still stays 2 months in america. But maybe im just overthinking things.

34,mvnokj,1619034174,He's moving a little fast? Not sure now to react,"So I randomly met this guy a week and a half ago through through a group of friends, and we really hit it off.

The first few days were great, we were texting non stop and really getting to know eachother. And he was texting me good morning and goodnight, checking in through the entire day. 

But I almost feel like this is too much too soon, and I'm starting to feel like I'm running out of things to talk about through out the day. There's just not that much happening on an hourly basis to talk about. Having in depth convos in person would be different. 

He also wants to see me nearly every single day.  We met for the first time on the Friday before last, and then I saw him that following Monday, and then again last Friday... Friday night he wanted me to spend the night, which I did. Then Saturday morning I woke up he wanted me to spend the day with him, but wanted to go home. I agreed to come back after a few hours, and I did and we spent a few more hours together before I had dinner plans with my sister. He wanted me to come back again after dinner, which I declined. Monday he asked when he could see me again, and I said how about this weekend. He kind of insisted that we go out for dinner during the week and I said I'd rather just do something this weekend. Then again today, Wednesday, he asked if he could see me tonight- I responded with ""lol I said I wanted to wait and do something this weekend""

It just feels like he got really obsessed with me quickly. Which to be honest feels nice and is really flattering. And I really like him too and it seems like we get along really well. I just feel like it's ALOT for only know eachother a week and a half. Like I do love spending time together, but I don't feel the need to see him every day. And I enjoy talking, but texting back and forth multiple times per hour feels like a lot and I just honestly don't have that much to say on the daily. 

I don't want to cut things off AT ALL, and would love to see where this goes, butI'm not sure how to pump the brakes or handle this without seeming harsh/uninteresred/hurting his feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvnokj/hes_moving_a_little_fast_not_sure_now_to_react/
35,mvnp73,1619034224,Thoughts on this date idea?,"Hey all,

Hoping to get your advice on the following:

I usually try to keep the first few dates a bit on the shorter side for various reasons. I had a great first date with a girl last Friday (she immediately invited me over to her place) and I'm seeing her again on Saturday.

I would really love to take her to this amazing open air museum, I think it will be a great date. The only thing is, the drive from/back takes 50 minutes one-way. I would pick her up and her place and we'd drive together which means that besides the time that we spent together at the location itself we also share 100 minutes in the car.

My worries are awkward silences as it's only the second date and this is usually something that fixes itself a bit further down the road when you have seen each other a few times (in my expierience). Besides that, driving and talking at the same time is not my specialty. :)

Mind that it's Covid-19 so it's hard to come up with good date ideas.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvnp73/thoughts_on_this_date_idea/

37,mvo4p6,1619035428,my ex is talking to me as if we didn’t just have a bad (but quick)breakup and toxic relationship. why??? background in text.,"we broke up because i wasn’t satisfied with the sex so i assumed a lot before even asking him and didn’t even get the chance to ask questions and talk about it because we ended up just breaking up right then and there.. i came at him about it in the morning.  i kept asking if he just wanted to break up, i was so stressed to the point where i couldn’t eat or care for myself without worrrying about him so i did want to leave but i didn’t want to be the one to say that. i still think about how i wish i was back with him. but he included that our age gap makes things really difficult and also said we can’t be lovers. i said bye and he said he’ll still talk to me if he sees me in person and i said i was good. he didn’t even seem bothered at all. he was probably just looking forward to going back to looking at his instagram models and nsfw accounts on all his social medias. (he didn’t have them on his phone while we were dating) 

we unadded/unfollowed each other on social media’s but didn’t block. he blocked one instagram account though but it was my spam one and i had post about him being a creep indirectly so i guess that’s why he blocked me lol. i know, it was childish of me but he really is a creep. that’s why the sex wasn’t good.. i’m not getting into that but just know, he had a problem. and i wasn’t about to be his therapist to fix it. .. actually, i added the background at the bottom of the text. ***

then he texted me on 4/20 saying “happy 420” i said “happy 420 thank u” then he kept conversation with me. showed me the prettty view of where he was, sent me a picture of himself saying “ik this won’t mean anything to u but just showing u my face before i smoke” while he was clearly still at work by the ovens.. idk why he sent the pic, i assumed to try to get me to say “awe” or a compliment or for me to miss him maybe.. he isn’t really attractive tbh. but all i said was i got the pic and i ended up responding to something else he said.. that’s all i said though. he also ended up telling me how he still has faith in me to do better and get myself together mentally and called me beautiful while doing so. 

anyways, he still kept the convo going and now it’s morning and we are still talking. right now it’s about his coworker’s cat popping his air mattress. it hasn’t gotten to a serious convo so far since he texted, just small ones.. as if we weren’t just in a very toxic relationship (we didn’t allow each other to see anyone have anyone on each other’s phone so on, had each other’s locations, etc. very toxic.) 

*** btw to add, this guy hasn’t had much relationships nor sex even though he’s a bit older than me. he’s just been a lonely dude for the most part, he did online things to fill that in.. then i came into his life and he realized that that gave him sexual problems because he depended on his hand and a screen for so long. i couldn’t go through the PIED recovery with him. he wanted ME to figure out how he could fix it.. no. he didn’t know intimacy because of it and the fact that he never even slept in a bed with a girl, he was also mean. i just couldn’t fix all that, it’s not my job to either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvo4p6/my_ex_is_talking_to_me_as_if_we_didnt_just_have_a/

I saw her again in March, and more recently in April.  We get along great, and have very similar interests and values.

What she says she wants in a guy that she's looking for is the same thing that I could give to her, if given the chance.    


So my question... should I bring up, or start a discussion about, possibly considering me as a potential match?  To take a step out of the friendzone and see if I am indeed a better fit for her?

So im 23 y/o M. I turn 24 in a few days. I live in germany. I‘m in traineeship to be a teacher. 
When i was 16 i met my first girlfriend and we dated for 5 years. Everything was set in stone but i did the oldschool blue pill beta nice guy shit and she left me. After that i learned a lot about woman and met good ones but not great ones. Many that wanted a relationship with me but something was always off for me. I dont have many criterias to meet. I want a girl that i find attractive, i can vibe with and that is more or less intelligent. Although the last point and the second point go hand in hand. I workout since im 15 years old and i‘m a fairly attractive guy. I‘m vegan since im 20 years old. I dont want to sound arrogant or anything but i just dont want to hurt anyone and maximize my looks, my intellect, my morals just as good as possible. Life a good, healthy, life. I never hurted anyone on purpose. Not the women i met, not the friends i had. It‘s against my nature. I know this sounds like im trying to come off as mr. Perfect but im just telling the truth or at least my perspective of it. 


I had to move to a new city for the traineeship and im really lonely. The pandemic doesnt help. The gyms are closed. The clubs are closed. Everything is closed. I have no friends here. I have no „real“ friends anywhere. Like those friends you love with all your heart. I had those before but they betrayed me or we just drifted apart. I know im not a loser but i feel like one. 

I just sit here, can go to school when they are‘nt closed, swipe through tinder and just feel my brain melt, my heart crumble and my muscles shrink. I did a „dating detox“ at the beginning of the year because i felt like i had something with someone for the past 7 years or so. I started 3 weeks ago to „date“ via tinder etc. Im already burned out. I match with women. I have sex with women. But for what. They just arent funny, interesting, intelligent or anything. It‘s just really frustrating. Other‘s ghost. Idk. Everyone seems really immature. Superficial. They bail because im vegan. They bail because i dont smoke. Its super cringe. If there was no pandemic and i had friends it wouldnt be as bad. But i just feel lonely and hopeless and i just want to end thing sometimes. I know its dumb. Im young blabla. But for me life is way way way better with people you love and love you.

the gathering got moved to saturday so i messaged him today saying “that thing i was telling you about the other day got moved to saturday if you’ve decided you want to come, no pressure though”. and he just said to me “oh yeah i think i’m gonna pass on that, thanks for inviting me tho” so i just said “it’s fine” and changed the subject. honestly i don’t feel as bad as i thought i would have. like i’ve never asked anyone anything like that before so even though he said no i’m really proud that i even asked him at all. 

so my question is what do i do now? if the reason why he said no is really because of the fact he thinks he’d be awkward in a group of people (which i do believe because he’s quite shy) then i think he’d probably just say no if i asked him again. but then i’m the other way round and i would much rather meet him with my friends than just the two of us so my friends can help diffuse any tension you know. so what should i do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvqyov/my_16f_crush_16m_rejected_my_invite_what_do_i_do/

62,mvr5wd,1619044209,How to get over humiliation from parents / women that has made me emotionally numb (NEED ADVICE),"im 21m and had a rough childhood because of my parents. parents are not there emotionally and make me feel guilty for having feelings that make their life inconvenient. I tried asking my dad about how to feel good about going up to girls because I kept getting made fun of but didnt tell him that part about getting made fun of. he just says to be a man, but I dont know what that means?? Girls like me but so many bad feelings come up from being humiliated my whole life that it just takes every part of me to go up to a girl. 

Girls would wince in disgust, laugh and give me weird looks when i tried telling them how I felt. It makes me feel like such a gross person. This was the story of my life through all childhood.

I came back from college and girls who laughed at me like me now? Girls who have boyfriends flirting with me? It makes me want to throw up, it feels like im a joke to them. Girls who ask me to text them just to ignore it? am I missing something here?????????

I just dont know what to do. Girls use to drop me the second I show any emotions / feelings for them even when it feels like they are trying to push me into talking to them, I dont use online dating and I dont dm random girls online. Only girls that I have had some real interaction with. 

I normally start with saying ""Hi, how is everything going"" or ""hows your day"" something of that like to get some information to work with when talking to her after spending a night out with her and friends. I normally get a ""good"" or ""doin good"" so then I take this as shes not interested prob was just really drunk. so I dont send anymore texts. Girl re-contacts me but doesnt really say much. I try starting some kind of conversation LITERALLY ABOUT ANYTHING I DONT CARE and get more one word responses. I just dont understand. I just dont get how to get a conversation going. All the meanwhile im feeling like shit the entire time because im having PTSD from ever other girl. Does my generation just like not respect men at all?

It feels like no girl respects me because im shy in the beginning, my personality is decently outgoing, im more reserved talking to women in the beginning because ive just been humiliated and shamed by parents and girls my whole life. 

All this has just messed me up so bad in my head, I cant even make sense of anything. These thoughts dominate my head because I just want to be a guy that someone would want to talk to and I try so fucking hard it makes me feel totally drained at the end of the day. I have spent thousands of hours online / therapy trying to make myself as normal as possible in a dating sense. I just dont want to be made fun of anymore. I just want to experience any kind of connection but I never feel anything anymore and talking to girls just feels like a chore now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvr5wd/how_to_get_over_humiliation_from_parents_women/

The hard truth: These people you match with owe you nothing. Stop putting them on a pedestal. Just because they match with you, they are not obligated to message or respond to you. While there are people looking for the same thing as you, some people aren’t as invested in dating apps as you. Instead of complaining of the lack of interaction from their end just move on. They may even ghost you or not reply to you at all but it’s okay. They genuinely owe you nothing. Just unmatch 

The more you start treating online dating as a fun activity and less of a necessity - you’ll find yourself less stressed. If you put your matches on a pedestal you just end up being disappointed. That’s the reality of online dating.

68,mvrjq6,1619045382,I can't help my thoughts of desperation and low confidence,"Let me start this off with saying I'm 20 never had a gf. Before you ask no I'm not fat and yes I do take showers. Now that's out of the way I can start by saying I've never really had any real attention from girls that didn't go past friendship. I've had my fair share of female friends throughout my years so I don't think I'm coming off as creepy. Anyway I don't wanna turn this post into me whining about how I've never had a gf cause I've already posted about it at least a million times by now.

Point is how can I not feel desperate and self conscious about myself given my situation? Think about it this way, if you were playing basketball and you airballed a bunch of 3 pointers would you feel confident in your jumpshot? Hell no so I don't understand how someone like me is supposed to be fucking confident with girls if every single time I try to find one it ends in failure. Out of all the people I know I only know two people who have never had a gf but both of them has had sex. As far as I know I'm literally the last person I know to never have sex. How am I not supposed to feel desperate about that? Of fucking course I'm gonna be desperate. I'll take anyone at this point other than fat girls and by fat I mean landwhale status I don't mind if they are a little on the bigger side. They could have any personality type, any body type, and any face it literally doesn't matter to me. I find 80-90% girls my age attractive. So the problem definitely isn't my standards being too high.

The question I have is how can I not help but feel desperate and self conscious about my situation? I know those are the two things girls hate the most for whatever reason. I don't really understand why those two things in particular tick off girls so badly? We all have our problems and demons we struggle with. People are imperfect so we just have to accept people for who they are including their flaws. I just wish they were more understanding. There are many positive things I can bring to the table in a relationship but all that is thrown out simply because of the minor character flaws that are low self esteem and desperation. I just hate it when people just say ""be more confident"" or ""don't let it get to you so much."" Like you really think it's that easy. I can't just flip a switch and then tune out all the negative thoughts. You don't think I don't already know my lack of confidence is causing problems? I can't just pull confidence out of my ass I would have done that a long time ago if that were the case. If girls love confidence and high self esteem the most which I have neither then are guys like me meant to be alone forever? It is just a big cycle of being turned down and then losing confidence until eventually I lose the confidence to even approach girls in the first place.

70,mvrrzj,1619046120,Should I date my ex again after this?,"
My ex and I started dating in highschool. We were both each other’s first.We dated 6 years and broke up in our early twenties. She was the one to end it because she wanted to focus on herself/work and stated she was just confused as to what she wanted in life.

Now 4 years later she wants to try working it out again. My issue is during those 4 years I made several attempts at reconciliation and she always said she wasn’t ready for a relationship.

Recently she told me she did date 2 people in our 4 years apart. She told me she did catch feelings for both these guys. The first being a year after our breakup (for 3 months) and another last year for a couple months and neither worked out and she ended it with both.(she of course slept with both these guys).She told me on her own. I myself went on quite a few dates but just never found someone who I wanted to date although I did have some one night stands.

 I obviously am not happy she slept with 2 other guys, I can’t be mad because I slept with other people also. I have no issue with her dating because she was single but it does hurt me that when I tried to get back with her she wasn’t interested in me. We did hook up a few times in between these guys and when I asked her if she was dating or saw someone, she didn’t mention the first guy at that time.

She’s telling she wants to try again with me because she was happy with me during our past relationship, but at that time she was confused with her life.

Would you guys take an ex back? My issue is whenever I tried getting her back she told me she wasn’t interested in a relationship, but then she dated two people so she wasn’t really telling me the truth.

75,mvssvc,1619049465,Promising match with a fun conversation only to get unmatched in less than a day,"Matched with a girl the other day less than an hour after sending out that first text (this is on Hinge fwiw). We have a shared interest of webcomics and we really seemed to get along well. Most girls I match with take maybe a day or longer to reply to me, so I take notice that she replies to my messages almost immediately. It seems like she's just as excited as I am about the match and we seem pretty compatible. She says she's sleeping early for the day but she'll reply with more chitchat tomorrow-- fair enough.

Next day comes and we're swapping stories and having a generally good time. She then casually drops that she's not interested in me romantically. Again: fair enough, and cool of her to bring it up sooner than later. Not completely thrown off yet though, as she does bring up (without my mentioning) that she'd be down for casual talk. I say that's good, and say it would be nice to have a confidant to share and gripe about dating app stuff with.

She doesn't take this well.

In the span of like a minute she gets very defensive, says she's become uncomfortable talking with me and immediately unmatches with me.

Not asking for anyone to make sense of this or to take sides on the matter (hence why I'm tagging this as a vent) but dang... to have things come off as so promising at first only to go immediately sideways in less than a day was way more disheartening than any ghosting or generally rude comment I've gotten on dating apps before. Looking back, it does seem like she was quick to reply only to get a better feel for me that much quicker. Again, this is fine in itself but... making that judgement in less than a day? For me, the surface-level judging is done when the other person decides whether or not to match with me-- not for when you're already initiating in conversation.

80,mvtb1a,1619051189,Has anyone dated someone like this?,"So about a month ago this guy commented/liked me on hinge. I responded, he responded and I got busy with life and forgot. Anyways, a few days later we by pure coincidence ended up meeting in person through a mutual sport. I recognized him in person and afterwards looked him up on fb, added him and messaged him to tell him we had matched on hinge. Since then we have been going out 1-2 days a week (we've gone out 6 times now) and are texting regularly. 

Anyways, he's a very reserved guy (not really shy, just awkward and I'm guessing not super experienced with dating) which is different than what I'm used to. After our 3rd date we had an awkward half hug, half goodbye kiss that left me unsure of whether he liked me. I texted him after to ask him what he was looking for and since we are both ~2-3 months out of previous relationships, we decided to exclusively date but go somewhat slow. We redeemed ourselves on our 4th date when we got to try again and made out (YAY!) and cuddled and whatnot. 

Normally guys I go out with are more dominant and flirty, moving things along physically or at the very least telling me what they want. I'm pretty open with sex and whatnot so I don't mind sleeping with guys I like and want to pursue. However, with this guy, things are different. I'll flirt with him over text and I honestly sometimes can't tell if he even realizes I'm flirting with him. I pointed it out to him and apologized for trying to make the conversation dirty/flirty with him and he told me he likes the flirting and not to apologize. However, he also doesn't flirt back through text!! He told me that he would have stayed the night over at my house but didn't want to assume he could to which I told him I would have loved that. I told him I didn't want to pressure him into sex because he had said he wanted to go slow initially and now he's telling me he's okay with not going slow. He told me to tell him when and where and he'll be there, he's just not great at texting.

Anyways, he's coming over Friday to stay the night and I'm definitely buying condoms because I'm not sure if he will plan ahead like that. I just feel so dominant and am not used to it. I want to feel like he likes me and is not just going along with it because I like him. 

Has anyone dated a guy like this? He must like me if he's texting me every day and planning dates and whatnot. But it's new and feels like he's taking a while to warm up to me.

I haven’t had a crush for a long time now, after getting rejected 3 times in a row by my last crushes. That messed up my confidence and made me scared of rejection, so i havent really dated anyone in a while

Anyways, I recently made a new group of friends (with both guys and girls) and it’s honestly a really nice, supportive group.

I kinda sense she likes me too, but after being rejected many times by girls i thought were into me, i dont know how to tell for sure if a girl likes me anymore.

Either way, im scared to ask her out or even slightly flirt with her because if she rejects me, things may get awkward in the friend group and i dont want to ruin it or get excluded. But idk, she’s great and maybe i should try and see, i really want to be in a relationship. Either way, even if i decide to take the risk, i dont even know where to start, im bad at romantic interactions in general and im way too scared of rejection after my past experiences.

86,mvu560,1619054149,I [M21] got caught in a lie with a girl [F20] I’ve been seeing... should I move on?,"So I met this girl I’ve been seeing at a group event (poker night) in the latter part of 2020. One key detail is my friend organized this event. We hit it off and ended up hanging out privately and it’s gone pretty well. We’ve just hung out and talked thus far but I feel like it’s been going in a good direction and I have definitely fallen for this girl.

Anyway, over winter, my friend told me he wasn’t going to invite this girl back to poker night in the coming semester. He said it was because he thought having one girl there distracted everyone (all dudes) and he wanted to invite a couple of dudes who there wouldn’t be space for if he invited her back. He also asked me to not say anything to her. I was pretty surprised he did this because she enjoyed it and everyone liked her, but I wasn’t really in a position to tell him not to do it because it was his thing that he put in the work to organize, so I agreed. I should also mention I didn’t know her as well at this point. 

Anyway, I’ve been seeing her this semester and a few weeks ago she randomly asked me if we still played poker. I felt really bad because I felt if I told her she would feel really bad and we were having a nice time and I didn’t want to ruin the mood. Furthermore, I thought the fact that she asked revealed that she must have been a little bothered to not have heard anything. So in the heat of the moment I decided to lie (still kicking myself) so she wouldn’t feel like she had done anything wrong (she didn’t, she’s good company) or feel bad... 

I thought it’d be okay because I was really the only one from poker she saw outside of it. However, I hosted a get together a couple weeks back and within 15 minutes of her being there one guy from poker (who apparently didn’t get the memo that she was uninvited) walked right up to us and said “why haven’t you been coming to poker.” My heart sunk. Furthermore I was drunk, my friend from poker was drunk, and she was sober... so I probably didn’t handle it the best. I was mortified. She left shortly after this. 

I apologized then and there I sent her a long thing the next day saying that I said that too her because I didn’t want her to feel like she had done anything wrong and that it wasn’t my choice to uninvite her, etc. I also said I really value our relationship and hope I haven’t ruined it. She said she wasn’t super upset about poker (I think this wasn’t true but obviously I wouldn’t press her on it) but wished I hadn’t lied to her and that she’d rather be told hard truths than lied to (which I totally get, I’m the same way. I’m a hypocrite because I think lying is basically always wrong). 

I probably could have said more like I thought it was bullshit that she was uninvited and that I wasn’t the only one who thought this but I didn’t want to throw my close friend under the bus. 

Anyway, it’s been a couple weeks and I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m worried the relationship is screwed now. She did text me a few days after the incident wishing me a happy birthday, which I was very relieved to see. I texted her the other day and she gave me a pretty short response, which was tough to see. 

Anyway, how should I proceed? I’ve definitely wanted to give her some space and not be up in her face about it apologizing continuously but I’m not sure how long I should wait to reach out to hangout/do something. 

I’ve thought about giving her a copy of one of my favorite books called “lying” which talks about how lying is basically always wrong and framing it as both an apology and a commitment to not lie to her again. But idk maybe this isn’t such a great idea? I’m worried this could be received poorly but I also think if I frame it properly it could be a meaningful gesture (she knows how much I like the author)

Any advice on how I should approach this? I’m really scared I’ve lost her because I really like her and I feel like I won’t meet a girl a like as much as I like her for some time.. if there’s anything I can do to recover this I am willing to do it. Right now I feel like this means giving her space but I’d love input on how to approach this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvu560/i_m21_got_caught_in_a_lie_with_a_girl_f20_ive/

89,mvuay9,1619054723,Am I wrong for hanging up on this guy?," 

Hello. I'll try to keep this very brief and I want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation. I don't know where else to put this at, and thought it could go here, but please let me know if it doesn't.

So I have been talking to this guy (Let's just refer to him as Doug) on Tinder for the past few weeks. I probably wouldn't meet him in person because of the pandemic and all. Nothing very serious, just us chit chatting because I just broke up with this guy and I don't want to jump into anything serious right now.

So after weeks of back and forth, I kinda wanted to hear his voice. We decided to have our first call today, about 10 minutes ago and I am left shook. and spellbound

Then Doug called me on his way home from work, as he tried to call me earlier and I was making my son and I dinner.

We started talking as my son went to his room to work on his homework and I sat in the living room and took the call, letting the some of the dishes drip dry. I poured a glass of wine (long ass day at work, let me tell ya, working from home is no better than being in the office).

The conversation was normal at first before he started talking about how he doesn't know about the expressways around Chicago and kept talking about his hometown of Washington D.C. I am VERY familiar with the DC area and I told him that there many an expressways in that area. Doug then said that he just knows exit numbers. He said in DC there is just I-95. Again, I told him that I-95 is north to south/south to north, but there are many highways that branch off of it, such as 295, 495, etc.

Doug then said there was just I-95. I told him that one day I will teach him the expressways. I then told him that's dangerous to just know exits, as he could get a flat tower and not know exactly where he was at. I then jokingly stated that if he's far out of Chi-Town, he could get nabbed by the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and leave his phone there. Anyone who has been to Chicago knows that once you're out of the city, there's nothing but cornfields and farms.

Doug's voice got very low and creepy in his next reply: ""I wouldn't get kidnapped. People who get kidnapped put themselves in a position where they can get kidnapped."" I thought he was joking and I quipped back with: ""Oh, so we're victim blaming now. Charming."" He then responded with the same low, creepy voice: ""I'm serious. These people put themselves in the predicament, so then they learn a lesson.""

My mind went blank. It instantly went to the story of that evil 911 operator who berated a woman who was drowning in her SUV that was swept up in a flood.

*Drowning Woman: ""The water is rising up to my neck!""*

*Evil 911 Operator: ""****Well, maybe this will teach you not to drive in the water anymore!****""*

The woman drowned to death in her vehicle and those were the last words she heard.

I did a nervous chuckle and told him ""You're not serious."" Doug responded in a guttural tone, ""I told you I was serious. If a prostitute is walking a street corner and someone comes up behind them and snatches them, they shouldn't have been on the street.""

Not that I condone that sort of lifestyle or profession, they are still human beings and deserve to be valued as such. Some of them have no choice but to do it. I told him as much. Doug told me in a grimly mocking tone: ""Everyone has a choice."" Yeah, everyone does have a choice, but nobody deserves to be kidnapped/murdered.

I placed my hand over my heart and whispered into the phone, ""So the thousands of children that go missing every year are *choosing* to be kidnapped?"" He responded with: ""If little Suzy is playing in a park and her mother takes her eyes off of her for just one second then that's the parent's fault and her fault!""

I was breathless. How can someone sit there and justify someone abducting someone else? He asked me if I understood his logic and I gasped ""No!"" Doug then started condescendingly laughing at me before he stated that he could text me FBI reports that stated that the kidnapping victims were to blame for their own abductions.

The whole thing was so creepy, I hung up on him and then blocked his number. I had to take a long, hot shower just to get the filth I felt from him just hearing that nonsense over the phone.

I'm wondering if I'm the asshole and should have laughed the whole thing off as some sort of very, very morbid sense of humor?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvuay9/am_i_wrong_for_hanging_up_on_this_guy/
90,mvuk8v,1619055639,Date still on if she doesn’t text back?,"19(M) matched with this girl on Monday who was really engaging and came up with a date idea to walk in the park and grab food before I could even bring it up. We planned to go on Sunday, and had a specific time and place to meet up already. We traded numbers and had good banter the rest of the night. Tuesday we didn’t talk, and this morning I texted asking if we can reschedule the date for Saturday because it’s going to be raining all day on Sunday . I texted before 11 am and haven’t heard from her yet. I’m gonna wait a day or two, text her one last time to see if she’s still interested and if not then ok. I’m just wondering, if I did anything wrong in this scenario or should I have done anything differently. Thanks for reading up to this point guys 

Also, she used to respond within seconds and the last message she read was Monday when I told her good night. Just adding if it makes a difference.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvuk8v/date_still_on_if_she_doesnt_text_back/
91,mvuq6s,1619056242,Reaching out with social media to date during covid.,"As the title says, If i am a college student and have a course where i am in a monday block of courses, I due to a project had to attend wednesday block courses to get help with a project and realized there was a cute girl. My teammate is joking how he hates the class, she's like a little bit and im like a little bit? mild banter she laughed. I made a first impression it was good, Ill probaly never see her again since project is about done.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the other thing and my question.

Courses list everyones email, theres barely any girls in comp sci classes, so their full names are basically given when we signed up for the class. I looked up her facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a valid strategy to maybe within a day or two add her on facebook? Its not like i had to look very hard to find her facebook. I have a no regret thing, I'll feel bad if i didnt try my hardest, so even if the chance is relatively low, Il add the girl try to strike up a conversation, feel bad if i get rejected but atleast i don't have to feel regret. if I dont say anything will probaly never see this person again.

Covid honestly pisses me off in ways, I could have actually teamed up with this girl and maybe became friends with her like the normal way, but now I kind of have to just reach out and see if she swats my hand away or takes it.

Its hard for me, because its changed dating dynamics but I do all i can, if this is all i got then its all i got, any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvuq6s/reaching_out_with_social_media_to_date_during/
92,mvuz1s,1619057117,nyc story with a twist,"So I’m walking in the city shopping and as I’m waiting for the next light to change this guy says hi to me. I thought he was one of my friends I haven’t seen in a while but it wasn’t. So I ask “Do I know you?” , he responds saying no I don’t but you’re very pretty and I couldn’t not say hi” I say “Thank you” He says “I have a few minutes so I’ll walk you wherever you have to go” The store I was going to was the next street down but he told me about himself (4 years older then me) and he had his puppy with him that he rescued. He also told me that he saw me then turned around, walked towards me and then said hi.  I didn’t tell him that much about myself since I do have a boyfriend who I love very much and this guy was set on going on a date. I told him I have a boyfriend blah blah blah but he insisted on getting my number in case we break up. ( no I don’t think we’ll be breaking up , we’ve been dating for over 3 years and are very set on each other) I did give him my number because I kind of felt like I didn’t have a choice so then he texted me twice since and I haven’t answered once because like I said his intentions are going on a date (like he mentioned himself) Should I answer if he texts again? My boyfriend was a bit bothered by this situation because he believes I could have not gave the guy my number. Also, I think I have a thing for meeting guys in movie like ways. So while you’re reading I’ll tell you how my bf of 3 years and I met , I was rollerblading with my friends , he with his own and then I fell and he picked me up and that’s how we stared talking!
