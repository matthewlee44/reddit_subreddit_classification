I never thought I'd ever use Reddit but here I am!

I'm a 28 year old asexual/gay dude. I've never dated, like ever, for some reasons more obvious than others.

I've always found it extremely difficult to want to start dating because I'm asexual and very sex repulsed and I'm never going to compromise on that. That being said, my dating pool is very limited to non-existent. A couple of years ago, I was going through a major depressive situation and during that time, my best friend (who at that point has also never dated or anything) had told me she had a boyfriend. 

I was already feeling incredibly miserable emotionally and I guess chemically you could say in that moment and I had to hold everything back to keep from crying/losing it while smiling to her telling her I was happy for her.

I'm of course not blaming anything on her! I was just very mentally volatile and it was the most crushing news because all I could think was, ""Even my best friend finally has someone and I still don't."" It was even worse the next morning when her other friends who are married came over and they talked about double dating and stuff and I just had to stand there pretending I was okay and feeling left out.

Again, this is all on me, not her and I am truly happy for her. I just felt more lonely at that time and I still remember it very vividly. 

I just wish I could find someone and experience what so many of my friends have. I want to put myself out there but nothing happens. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bitter though at times whenever one of my friends brings up their relationships because all I can think is ""Well, at least you're IN a relationship."" I don't have any other ace friends IRL to talk too either or relate to. 

I've tried dating apps and all that but I never find anyone I can vibe with who also isn't just interested in hooking up. I'm definitely not into the whole ""gay culture"" thing, at all. Not to mention it's very shallow. I mean hey, it works for others but it's not for me. 

I feel like I'm never going to be with someone at this point. I'm just not going to compromise that part of me just for the sake of a relationship either. Being ace rocks, wouldn't change it! But it does making dating more difficult. And the very rare times I have talked with other gay ace dudes, I just don't mesh with their personality and have little in common. I've basically given up searching at this point because each time it's ended up fruitless.

Im a [23/M] she is [19/F]

I saw this girl from IG a random girl from my city, we have mutual friends, never really met her in real life. But I’m dumb and love taking risk. So I message her couple of days ago she does reply back. I asked a couple of questions and I get an answer. But now almost 1 day no reply, she didn’t even seen my DM. I know she broke up with her BF not long ago probably like 2-3 months ago not sure.

Its almost two weeks after I followed her on IG before I message her but before messaging her I only react to her IG stories whenever she post a selfie on her story something like that and I always get a response like she heart my react and things like that. Since my friend also follow her, before messaging her my friend let me borrow his IG account and what I did is I reacted on her IG story using my friend account and I also reacted on her IG story using my account. My friend was left on seen, while I get a response from her. So thats when I decided to message her since I thought I have a chance but guess I was wrong...

But before her I had a LDR relationship which I also found on IG thru common friend everything works well she does reply late from beginning as well but we ended up being a couple but broke up eventually.

Going back to this girl that I’m really interested right now, since we didn’t really know each other I tried to impress her by posting on my IG stories. Just to give her some idea on what I do something like that, just giving her something she can use to have a impression on me. Since I do lot of stuff I freelance with video editing, graphic designing, trade stocks and forex, starting my own business but no luck I guess. 

Im too afraid to ask her out since Im pretty sure she will say no since she don’t really know me. But I’m still thinking if I should pursue her. I’m mentally confused right now. 

Mentally because I know I like her, I really do. But I don’t know if I should..

I don’t know if this is rejection or what since I never really get rejected or something, everything kinda works well when I try talking to someone.

Im just confused whether she is playing hard to get or not really interested. I really want to pursue her, I really do, because I really think I found the type of girl I’ve been looking for a long time.

And I had to learn from the ground up how to talk to girls and spark attraction. It wasn't something that came natural to me at all. Starting off I was really shaky and made a ton of mistakes. I'd text too much, overthink everything I said, get clingy, and as embarrassed as I am to admit it, I was kind of simpy and would constantly compliment the girl and put her on a pedestal. I'd always make blunders that made her lose interest in me and stop talking to me. 

Through a shit ton of trial and error I feel like I finally found a good way to talk to girls that usually leads to a strong rapport and potential attraction. What I do is, I essentially friendzone them first. I literally give no hint or inclination that I want to date them. I'll even teasingly encourage them to go after hot guys/celebrities they like, like I would with a guy friend talking about a hot girl. Even just delving into the guys she finds hot, with no judgements and genuine interest, and maybe a playful comment here and there, may prompt her to open up sexually with you. I'll basically treat her like I would treat another guy (with a few differences, I'll get to that) and I swear, it literally always breaks the ice and eases the tension. 

When I say treat them like a guy, there are a few key differences. With guys, I can be vulgar and disgusting and just laugh about it. Not so much with girls. You'll probably offend her and get told to fuck off or get blocked. You can curse and things like that, but you do have to filter anything that could be potentially vulgar. If you want to make a dirty joke, really think about it first and if it contains anything even a little messed up, culturally offensive, or even offensive in general, take it out. 

Don't overthink. Overthinking is hard to stop but it will ruin things for you if you do it. You'll second guess shit you say, things you say will come out weirdly phrased, and you'll potentially make her uncomfortable. The way you stop overthinking is killing it before it even starts. If the tide pulls you out into the middle of the ocean, you'll never find your way back to shore. That's why you have to swim to the shore as soon as you feel the tide pulling you in. Overthinking is hard to stop once it starts, so the second you feel it coming on, swim to the shore. 

Don't be a douchebag. You should be friendly, playful, relaxed, and easy going. Don't necessarily be afraid to show emotions. You can show that you don't like something. You can talk about what makes you peeved, sad, or upset. You can show that you're a human with feelings and emotions. If anything she might connect with you emotionally on certain things and that will strengthen the relationship. 

But. **Never** direct any slight negative emotion or attitude towards her. **Always** keep the vibe innocent and lighthearted. Just be the guy who isn't phased by anything. Girls love that, it shows that you're strong and in control of yourself. If something she did annoys you or makes you mad or something, keep your mouth shut, take some time for yourself to process the emotion you're feeling, and work out a logical and constructive way to fix the problem that doesn't come from a place of anger, jealousy, insecurity, or any other negative emotion. If she isn't talking to you or being short with you, instead of saying ""why aren't you talking to me, what's wrong with you? I'm upset"" try saying ""is there anything you'd like to talk about? I like listening to what you have to say"". 

If you say something embarrassing or out of left field by mistake, don't panic. It happens to the best of us. Just laugh about it. Just joke with her about why you said it and laugh at yourself, and then move on quickly from it. 

Lastly, and most importantly, don't text too much. Take it slow and relax. Even if you don't hear from her for a few days, it's no big deal. Neediness is the ultimate girl repellant, trust me I know. Every girl is different, but neediness (especially at the beginning) will ruin your chances with every girl you're likely to encounter. You can totally message her, but never try to force a conversation out of her when she doesn't seem interested and don't triple text her at 3 am.

Too frustrated and too many emotions. 

I feel like I sound like a guy lol but I am a woman. I’m 29 and I feel very INTENSE jealousy toward my cousin and his wife.

They’re over a decade older than me but have been together for 7 years now. They seem to have the “perfect relationship” - almost idyllic. Furthermore, they have the type of relationship I so badly desire. They are both pretty attractive. Although I have to say my cousin overall, like his job, status, finances, looks, body is like 9/10 and she’s more like a 8/10. But anyways, some other things about them, they are both so in sync and so into each other. They live in a very nice city in a very nice house, have money, it’s mainly my cousins, she doesn’t work but has a super rich family, which is another thing I envy, that my millionaire cousin provides for her no-problem and doesn’t expect her to work at all and she just gets to enjoy all these perks. Oh and they are the same age as each other so it’s not like he’s her “sugar daddy” or anything. She’s actually a month older than him. 

So here’s why I’m like kind of fuming over here. I have read countless comments on here, other sites and just heard from guys about all the different things that men consider when dating/committing to someone like someone’s beauty/attractiveness/hotness, their age/youth/“likeness to get pregnant” and be “good mothers”, no-baggage etc etc 

Ok this girl is divorced. She was dating a guy for 10 years, married him, her parents spent over a quarter of a million on her wedding (like huge, celeb-like wedding) and she literally left him on the night of the wedding. I personally know the caterer that catered her wedding and she told me that on the night of the wedding she was going around and telling all the guests that she doesn’t even want him and then left for Europe on her own the next day. She did this at 32 years old. The guy was also 32 and I have seen his photos, he’s not bad at all, very comparable to my cousin but me being bias, I’ll say that my cousin is better hehe. She met my cousin at 34. Trust me I’m all for meeting the right person and I really think that’s what happened here with them but I swear if I had “relationship baggage” like this, I’d be getting crucified by all my dates considering how picky and unrealistic everyone’s expectations are these days. 

Secondly, although I personally don’t think 34 is old by anyyyy means, but according to most men she was not ‘young’ and ‘youthful’ and ‘fertile’ when she met my cousin met, considering he was the same age as her. Also, he didn’t marry her until they were 38 and she’s been trying to get pregnant since then and she’s unsuccessful, obviously. She’s almost 42 now, pretty sure it isn’t going to happen and yes, they’ve taken scientific/artificial steps for like 2 years now to no avail. 

This next one doesn’t seem to be a big deal to most guys but I’ll bring it up anyways. She does nothing all day. She does not have a job, never has, not even when she met my cousin, she lived in her parents house. I sometimes do actually wonder what she does all day long since she doesn’t have children either? I know she sleeps in til like 11 am, living the life of a true princess and all. My aunt has told my mom all this. She also told her how every time she facetimes them, she’s just lounging around or taking a nap or something. I remember there was a period in my life when I wasn’t working because I was trying to figure myself out and every time I told guys this on dates, they were thrown off, one of them even flat out called me a low-life. 

And then here I am 29, have been seriously trying to find someone since 27. I have almost no relationship baggage from my past, no crazy questionable red-flag like changing my mind about my marriage on my super expensive wedding night after having known my SO for a whole decade, I am young, I have 5-6 more years of “healthy fertility”, I have a pretty good job now too and no longer a ‘low-life’, and lastly, I am a very attractive girl. I am trying to date guys within my league and the only guys that are willing to commit to me are guys who are definitely below my league and let me say this nicely, they just do not meet my standards. 

So now that we’re on the topic of standards, she has talked and posted about this on social media and how she didn’t lower her standards and was patient and didn’t settle and that’s how she ended up with her soulmate and blah blah. But you know what, I GET IT. I don’t want to settle either. I also want to find a guy that fits my life and standards and these are the moments when I start to ask myself ‘why’. Like why not me? Don’t I deserve it? Don’t I deserve to be happy with someone that makes me feel amazing? These are the moments that I feel jealous of how she was able to find the guy of her dreams despite all her baggage and I am still stuck searching, hoping and waiting. 

I sometimes think there’s more to it than just that though. I think she legit hit the jackpot. Cause I still don’t understand how she got a guy like my cousin to commit to her? Like good for her but like how? Cause my cousin, I swear to god, he is like a unicorn. All my girlfriends who have met/been around them tell me the same thing. I have a few single gfs around my age who have met my cousin and they’re like omg he’s perfect and agree that yeah his wife is good too but like it gets us wondering cause we’re single and we know what it’s like dating and how guys like my cousin are and we’re just like how?? And it’s not like she even meets all these insane requirements that guys claim to have. 

She for sure got lucky but I also feel like dating is so much harder now. I have talked to my therapist about this, that if, for example, my cousin’s wife was single and dating as a 30 something year old today, chances of her ending up with someone like my cousin would be much less and she’d be out there struggling like me and my gfs and all these other single girls who are contemplating lowering their standards. And then my cousin would also just be swiping away on bumble and getting endless dates and hook ups. Getting a guy like my cousin to commit is like impossible these days. My therapist understands my perspective on this and has professionally agreed about how the dating culture has changed.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,696113,public,self,"How to overcome feelings of jealousy, unfairness and all the “whys” when watching other people’s love lives come together and basically live out your dream?

Cool, whatever.. kids come first that’s obvious.

Early in the week I make plans for this weekend.. she says yes and we continue going back and forth texting / snapping. She starts getting super flirty saying she can’t wait to meet me blah blah blah on like Tuesday.. then Wednesday she leaves me on read. Thursday she hits me up and she’s all like omg I can’t wait for the weekend I’m beyond excited to meet youuuu. Then yesterday, she leaves me on read all day again until like 10 pm.. then she sends a text saying “omg I’m so sorry my phone was screwed up I was at apple all day and I just got it fixed.”

I’m like it’s cool not a big deal.. so we’re still on for tomorrow right?

I don't ghost people nor do I plan to. I have not really experienced being ghosted in a meaningful sense but I know I will be pretty damn sad when it happens. I think it's *evil*.

After a relationship ends (not a long-term relationship, less than 3 or 4 months), AFTER the conversation, and AFTER any back-and-forth via text or FaceTime post-conversation come to a full stop, I wait about 2 weeks and then I block the contact's phone number. I do something similar on dating apps. I send my goodbye &amp; thank you messages, wait a few days to make sure they get a chance to read it (and usually respond), and then I un-match. IG and other social media are not in the picture.

This topic came up in a conversation with a galPal and she said it's an asshole-y move. I'm pretty shite, tbh, but I don't want to be promoted to arsehole status....

My thought process is: I always keep my read receipts on so if I see the text, I'd have to reply. Sometimes, it's really awkward and difficult to reply. I think the &lt;don't reply at all&gt; route is evil and hurtful, regardless if I have my read receipts on or not. But if they are blocked, the text turns green or doesn't show ""delivered"" or etc. I feel this allows the texter to feel better. She'll probably think, ""maybe he's traveling or has no reception or got a new number"". Unlikely, but I think it's still ""better"".

Any thoughts/advice for me going forward? I'm not going to lie, I really like this approach more than before when I didn't do it. I believe I am helping both myself and the other party with this approach.

Each date consisted of her coming to my house and us cuddling and doing certain sexual acts like touching and performing oral on each other. The first time she came over and did this, I tried to initiate sex but she declined even though she would tease me to ""pound her"" when I was performing oral. Nonetheless, I respected her wishes and didn't try and go any further when she declined. Over text, after the first meet up, she gave me really mixed signals as she would reply extremely dry to some of my messages to the point where I was almost forcing the conversation. Other times, she would be really into it and engaging constantly and even orchestrating the convo herself.

Now at this latest meet up, she was constantly on her phone while we watched Netflix to the point that she occasionally didn't even acknowledge when i asked her certain questions. I noticed when I looked on her phone screen too from the side of my eye that she was texting some other guy. Furthermore, she seemed less into me sexually than the first time as when we started touching and getting into things, she suddenly changed her mind and said we should just chill and that she wasn't feeling it. I asked her what was the problem and that she could be open with me and I wouldn't mind. She replied that there was no problem and that she likes me but she just didn't want to do certain things and regret it later. I accepted what she said but felt something still wasn't quite right. Her body language towards me seemed a bit cold as she didn't particularly try to cuddle for the majority of the time we watched Netflix and even remarked herself that she was cold in general. It then got to about 10pm and she was debating whether to stay the night with me or go home. I convinced her to stay in hope that I could rectify the already cold situation.

After she decided to stay, she improved somewhat and started cuddling me once she decided she wanted sleep. The next morning she left around 10:30am but didn't actually say anything when she got home. Instead, I was the one who text her saying ""hope she enjoyed her stay."" She replied she did and that she had a really good sleep. I then said I did too and that we should do it again soon to which she simply replied ""sure."" This seemed like a really basic and uninterested reply to me although I could just be overthinking it. Over 2 hours has passed and no messages have been exchanged since.

Are these clear signs that she really just isn't that into me despite what she said at my place? What steps should I take from here? Should I continue like normal talking to her and ignoring these red flags and negative gut feelings since she claims she likes me?

I told a friend the situation and his crude assessment of it was that I was a sideman to her and almost a ""teddy bear"" to sleep and relax with since she's ok with staying at mine overnight despite showing more or as much interest in being on her phone as with speaking to me. He also felt that this other guy she's texting is probably higher in the pecking order than me.

TL;DR: A girl I've been speaking to and met with twice is still giving me really mixed signals. At our latest meet up, she almost seemed more into texting other people on her phone than conversing with me. She was then cold to me while we relaxed and didn't want to engage in any sexual acts like we did the first time of meeting up. I asked her what the problem was but she insisted there was none and that she liked me but just didn't want to move too fast. She stayed at my place overnight anyway and her attitude towards me only improved when going to sleep and she cuddled me at this point for the majority of the night. Next day, I was the one who text her when she was at home. Asked her if she'd like to do it again but her reply was just a simple ""sure.""

My grandmother has four children, my mom, my two aunts, and my uncle. My grandmother was cheated on by my grandfather (he had children with another woman) and had gone through many shitty dramas throughout her marriage: screaming, crying, throwing a tantrum, etc, all of those jealousy anger. Divorce was their final decision to end the drama. 

My mother who witnessed what my grandmother had gone through and swearing that she would never make the same mistake. And now here she is, on the verge of divorce because my father cheated on her and has a child with another woman. My two aunts are divorced because their husbands weren't happy with the marriage. One had an overly jealous husband who always tried to control her; the other had a husband who (actually) had never truly loved her and just married her for the sake of having a wife. My uncle, in the past, had cheated on his wife and was involved with gambling and debt. His marriage was almost broken. He has changed now, but his marriage wasn't as happy as before. 

One thing I notice they all have in common is that their marriage always start off with happy relationships. That ‘happy relationship’ phase is the scariest part of a relationship because you just can't expect what will happen next after experiencing it. Today you are saying “I love you” to them and kissing, hugging; and then the next thing you know you are signing the divorce paper. The person that you have known are no longer like they used to be. It’s so unknown and unpredictable it’s scary. You will never know what will happen next to your relationship.

Whilst rewinding all of those unfortunate marriage experiences of my family members, I realized, “Oh shoot! Is it my turn now?” I don't want to be a part of an unhappy marriage cycle within my family. If I'm in a relationship or marriage, it must be a long-lasting one. If it’s not, then I'd rather be single in the beginning. Either you have nothing or having what you don't want. 

Honestly, I'm pretty desperate right now so it's kinda hard to think about staying single. But I'm too scared to be in a relationship. At this point, I'm not sure if I've lost my faith in dating and relationships. Frankly, I've almost lost my faith in men. But that doesn't mean good men don't exist.

This is mostly just to vent. I went on a date with a guy who i have known (very casually) for a few years. We went for drinks and then we made out a bit in his car. I was kinda buzzed and i figured we could hook up. Point is he stopped during foreplay (i was already naked) to tell me he didn’t have sex anymore in his car because he had slept with a virgin there and there was so much blood that it stained his car and she cried and then he started to tell me random sex stories like that he fucked the ex of his friend and she was also in pain during sex and it annoyed him. The man spent like 30 minutes talking about this sex stories that i really didn’t wanna hear while i was naked in a tiny car. 
Literally all the stories involved girls being unconfortable or in pain. It really turn me off so i asked him to take me home and he said we could hang out next week.
We didn’t talk during the week and when he hit me up he wanted to bring me to a party (during the pandemic , i find this highly irresponsible and inmature) , so i rejected him and he send me a long ass audio message asking me for explanations.
I literally cannot fanthom how he can’t tell that speaking about weird sex experiences just before sex Is a deal breaker.

It hasn’t. 

Long story short: TLDR
Was talking / flirting / arranging to see a girl who looks like god made her just for me, for 6 months! 1 basic dinner date with a kiss. Several plans to arrange to meet that fell through on her part. After 6 months she basically says I should find someone who would give me the attention I deserve out of nowhere. 

Now she had a kid so my intentions of a relationship weren’t really there. But being intimate with her was on my mind like Christmas to a kid on Xmas eve. 

I feel a terrible terrible cocktail of emotions in my chest every day that’s exhausting me. A fucking indescribable dose of sexual frustration, bitterness, envy, depression, idk...all of it. It feels worse than my only breakup of a 2year relationship. 

I’ve basically been anticipating sex with the girl of my dreams for 6 months, and been close multiple times, but it never came. 

Every time I notice myself in a content or happy moment, my brain will be like “hey, remember that thing were depressed about” and I’ll stop smiling on the spot. 

I’ve talked to many beautiful girls in the past that didn’t go as I wanted and was hurt but it seems nothing like this. With the flirting and and snaps she had sent me for that long, I feel like a starving lion that has been poked and prodded over 6 months. 

I would fucking do anything for one night with her beside rape obviously. I hate desiring someone this badly. I’m embarrassed to write this here even anonymously. I feel weak and stupid. 

Time is the answer right? There’s a scary feeling inside of my that I will never get over this and my sexual frustration with this girl, and will be stuck with me forever like a curse.

We have so much in common, we never run out of things to talk about, and 3 weeks ago we went on a date which went really well, where we shared a lot of emotional things about our lives and the date ended with us having a good laugh about other lighter topics.

Then I suggested a couple of weeks ago that we meet again, so we decided to meet last Monday, but then she cancelled with just 3 hours notice saying she hadn't had enough sleep the night before and wasn't in the mood to socialise.

Can't find potential partners without **intellectual engagement**. *Where do I go?*

I **(M41)** was a know-it-all as a child. This evolved into broad-curiosity nerd; the kind who loses himself in ideas. My relationships as an adult have been few and far between in part because of this. I am also conventionally unattractive. And weird. All of these barriers fell for me twice in my life when women who gave me the time of day engaged my intelligence. With a leap of trust we were welded together - first (F25) for five years, then for (F31) ten. They found me superlative when most women saw a weed.

With the right partner, everything clicks, and for me the devotion is deep. Inside these reveries I could not conceive of what would happen if it ended. *Then it did.* Apart from being heartbroken, I took each as notice served that I have emotional blindspots. Warnings that I did not see, deeper needs unmet. Awareness and vulnerability are now easier for me than my nerd-self found years ago thanks to the wisdom of failure. Unfortunately I now find dating, especially OLD charged with fear and distraction. Is there any place I can find a physical date and a long conversation with someone who might appreciate me? I need deeper interaction (I do expect to earn it).

Ideas? (here are some mediocre ones)

1. Join The Well and find someone like-minded down a rabbit hole
2. All the Meetup that will meet (virtual or other) for freethinking, philosophy
3. Join an intentional community and die alone with company

He brought a few snacks too and I brought the wine so I ignored it... but in the back of my mind I wondered why he only had one sandwich for two grown adults.

I also noticed that during the time I’ve gotten to know him, he’s complained about high prices quite a few times and it’s usually for places I regularly go and things I regularly do without a second thought lol.

What happened was it was nearing the end of the summer before grade 11 was about to start, and I got a DM saying 'Heyy' from a guy I briefly knew from my art class in the previous grade. The funny thing is, I had actually formerly 'liked' this guy during school, which I never confessed. But COVID-19 hit, everyone stopped going to school, and naturally, I got over those initial feelings. 


Back to the story, I replied back and we had a short convo before he had to go and asked for my snap, and then things escalated from there. Of course, I started to regain all those feelings for him. We started talking on snap a lot, and eventually earned the besties heart emoji. He asked if I was interested in hanging out, and I agreed (big mistake.) Around this time he admitted that he wasn't in for a serious relationship or anything, which all makes sense now but I appreciate the communication from his end.


So I went to his house, met his parents and had dinner, smoked a little weed, played MarioKart, watched a part of a movie and made out. Nothing else happened further than that, thank god. He said that we should hang out again as I was leaving. After that night, we still chatted on snap sometimes, but I noticed that he wasn't as consistent in his lengths of communication. Eventually, it died down to the point where we stopped chatting at all, despite my failed efforts to initiate something.


At the time, I had fallen for everything, but thinking about it now, it all makes sense that his hormones were high and he was just looking for a night of sex in the end. The things that pisses me off is that he still led me on in a way, saying things like 'Let's go longboarding one day, I have an extra at my house :)' or 'It would be dope to go 'dirtbiking,' etc etc. He'd even say ""I'm not a fuckboy omg 🙄"" which he very obviously is. He also said other things indicating he is a player, such as asking for nudes and one time, he even said ""I'm enjoying talking to you right now mostly,"" indicating that he talked to many other girls. Almost whenever we texted, he'd be high, drunk, and/or on another drug which means I never knew when to take him seriously.


 It's been 7 months since it'd happened now, and I recognize the intent of the entire situation and the person he actually is. He has a girlfriend now, I'm curious as to if he actually treats her right. Just a few months back, he'd been accused of flirting with a lot of other girls during lunchtime. Another girl called him out for it, and he proceeded to slap her in the face. He then tried to drown another person in the ditch (ultimately, he pussied out and ran away.) 


My goal now is to stop checking his social media and forget about the whole thing of the past completely. I don't see him around school anymore, and I'm not in any situation where it's impossible not to see this face, so that has definitely helped. However, I know that he's a typical 'attractive' player and that I was just an option to him, so why do I keep thinking about it still? For instance, I keep hoping that he'll text me again and we'll start an actual friendship, which I know won't happen and it shouldn't. I've made progress in moving on, but any advice on how to drop the whole thing completely? Any tips will help, but I am making efforts to furthermore forget about it.

Posted this in another sub, but just want as many opinions as possible.

So this girl I was talking to for a week or two basically just a few hrs ago deleted her instagram (i wasnt blocked) and then removed me as a friend/or blocked me on sc. I'm so confused rn :/

Here is some backstory:

I was literally gonna meet her in a few days (even booked my train ticket) and we talked in depth/already knew what were our plans were when we would meet. Last nights conversation a matter of hours ago literally included ''I cant wait to see you'' from her etc, and when i told her i got my train ticket, she got pretty excited. So i don't believe it was anything on my end which i said or did, idk. I know she talked to a lot of other boys, and had an issue with some weirdo, but i doubt it was him because it had already gone on for months.

I mean i would of understood if she blocked me on insta too (even though it still makes no sense) but she deleted the whole thing, so I feel like its got to do w something else. Like if you saw the message exchange between us from just last night I think you would be so confused too lol.

Can I get any opinions on what you think is going on? What I should do? Because im sure others have experienced this too...

Unpleasant. As you jump down my throat: know that I do genuinely understand and even sympathize with polyamorous persons. I have multiple very intense and loving friendships and my friends do not feel neglected, or insecure / competitive with eachother for my attention affection a place in my heart etc. My love for my parents doesn't compete. I've even managed multiple romantic partners before and no-one said then or now that they felt neglected, insecure, or jealous without a good discussion and amends made. My different relationships fill different niches or at different times and we're all high communicators in a nice tight happy friend circle. People come, maybe aren't a great fit and go. Life happens conflict is inevitable.

No, what I'm seeing in the dating pool is a large number of people who really seem to be saying 'polyamorous' out front so that they cannot be ousted as a disrespectful cheater who hasn't managed their personal traumas well enough to commit or bond the way (I) expect of a partner. They're poor communicators who mistreat multiple partners at the same time and are always looking for new and exciting people to abuse. I've grown so tired of it that at this point I view the word (which I at times feel describes me) as a massive red flag if not a deal breaker.  
I understand not everyone has the time and attention to put in their relationships that they'd like. People have more intense work obligations that burn them up, or maybe their social marketing / upbringing makes the idea of multiple partners just icky. Lots of reasons to be a serial monogamist. Totally get it.

I’m typing this up on my phone so I apologize for the monotonous tone or incoherent thoughts 

TLDR; I met this girl. We have talked and hung out a lot. Want to know if it seems like she is interested in me and pursuing a relationship or if I’m reading into it too much 

Context: I (18M) have used Tinder for a while now, but I don’t take it seriously and rarely swipe on it. It’s more of entertainment for me because I don’t expect people on it to be searching for a long term committed relationship like I am. About 2 months ago though I matched with a girl who matched my energy and had a lot of the same ideals and expectations that I did. We started talking almost immediately and she mentioned how her roommate and her had downloaded the app more as a joke than anything to find interesting bios. I asked her if she still wanted to meet up sometime and talk even though she wasn’t taking it seriously and she agreed, but said she wasn’t looking for “anything at the moment


Fast forward after month or so of daily texting (she doesn’t use snap that often and prefers texting because it’s more personal) and we have finally found a time to meet up because our schedules were out of wack because of me being out of town and her being sick. 

I pick her up at her dorm, and then we drove around for almost 5 hours just talking about anything and everything ( could have talked all night but she had an early morning class)  It was crazy how easy it was to talk with her and I enjoyed listening to her talk and her getting excited over little things she found cool. We played a card game towards the end called We Aren’t Really Strangers in a parking lot which helped break the ice even more, and she mentioned how I was so normal. At first I wasn’t sure what she meant so I asked her if she meant I was boring and she said that she meant I wasn’t creepy, I was easy to talk too, and super interesting and funny. This is important for later on in the story. 

Another week goes by and we schedule a meet up for coffee this time and then we go and walk by the river for 4 hours and talk again. It’s smooth sailing and again it feels like talking to an old friend and our conversations have started to get more vulnerable and it feels like we are getting closer

I drop her off and then drive home and when I got back I sent her a trivial text about something we had talked about. She responded with a text asking if I wanted to hang again with her later that night or later that week if it worked better for me

This entire time I have started to really like her and have really started seeing her as a pontential partner to experience life with, but I’ve been held back by what she said at the beginning of talking with her on Tinder so stuff like what she texted me after has gotten my hopes up but I’m not sure

Fast forward another week and another 5 hour long drive and talking

We started talking about how we see dating and what we want in relationships and she mentioned how she doesn’t do hookups and she’s playing the long game for a committed partner and how the most important part of dating someone to her is if they are interesting to her and have a great personality. She always mentioned how I was super interesting to talk to and fun to be around so it makes me wonder if she sees me as a potential partner. 

Fast forward to yesterday morning. I picked her up super early for a sunrise hike. It wasn’t much but there was more of a physical touch barrier broken as I would hold her hand to help her through some of the icy or slippery parts of the hike as well as when we later walked around town she was constantly brushing against me with her shoulder. Everything went super well and we spent almost 8 hours that morning talking and enjoying each other’s company. 

Miscellaneous:

She has mentioned how her family knows about me and she talks with her siblings about me

Anytime I ask her if she wants to do something with me says absolutely or of course

He was so nice and polite, he helped me a lot to overcome that situation.We used to talk 24/7, he always praises of me and he thinks I'm one of the cutest girl he has ever seen.

After that I  stopped showing feelings and hints also it felt like i was bothering him. whenever he had hard times i used to comfort him with all of my heart. But suddenly 2/4 months ago it felt like he's kinda ignoring me or he's not interested (he never said it tho)  in my stories so I've stopped sharing my stuffs. Later he asked me several times what was going on my life,what's wrong with me,am i okay or not but i couldn’t share anything!  I simply said ""I will be fine"".  He taught me alot of things so i owe him a lot! So i never told him what was bothering me and pretend like nothing happened. rn I made myself understand that he's not the one, I'm not his type. We still talk,hangout but don't feel like before (or trying not feel like before). I'm happy that i made it. 
But sometimes it hurts!  I mean it feels suffocating! Last night i was crying, thinking that did they lie to me when they said i was pretty and kind hearted, they said i can easily have anyone.

During those hookups, there was no or barely any foreplay, and men didn't make any effort pleasing me. I've never really done hookups before, and I'm pretty shocked. Is this the norm, or am I just unlucky? I have dated guys in the past who didn't put in much effort either (big turnoff) but this is a new level of dramatic. 

For what it's worth; I always make sure I'm clean, shaven, no strange smells, wear nice lingerie, and I do make an effort to please the man. All my hookups wanted to meet up again, some said the sex was really good. I turned them all down except for one, hoping the second time would be better. Unfortunately the second time was disappointing too. I did ask him to do certain things -in a friendly way-, but he just didn't. I felt kind of used after that, it seems I'm no more than an object that's fulfilling someone else's needs. 

I'm not necessarily looking for a relationship (though I wouldn't say no if the right person comes along), but having sex occasionally would be nice. However, I feel like avoiding hookups now because I don't want to end up feeling used and unsatisfied. It's so disappointing when you've been chatting, flirting and you're getting really into it, and then it's over the second the man finishes. If this is it, I'm out.

Questions for you:

1. Women: what's your experience with hookups? Is it the norm for a man to not put in any effort?

2. Men: do you make sure to please the woman, or is a hookup just about fulfilling your own needs? (honest answers) 

3. Any advice on how to get better hookups? I feel like I can't demand (good) foreplay or a man going down on me. Would it be an option to discuss it before meeting up? It feels like an awkward thing to do, since it could give someone the impression we're definitely going to have sex.

It’s early days of course but out of all the guys I’ve dated (meaning at least getting to 3 dates) nothing about him makes me worried/anxious etc. 

I’ve met guys who have ghosted, been emotionally abusive, and have been in and out of my life due to commitment issues. And although that has gotten me down I guess I’ve managed to pick myself afterwards and not give up on dating as I decided to walk away with lessons and good experiences! Well recently I jumped on tinder again without much expectation and the attitude of if it happens it happens. 

This guy messaged me on tinder, which led to a casual funny chat, which lead to a date set up 3 days later. I went thinking nothing of it just because of past experiences where I just don’t want to get over excited these days. We’ve had 3 dates now and it’s just been great overall! 

The crazy thing is is that he told me from day one he needed heart surgery and we thought it would be in 9 months but it’s going to be in 2 weeks time, very unexpected! So he will be recovering for 6 weeks, and be back at his parents a 5 hour drive away. But after telling me this over text, in person as we lied in bed he said that he hopes we carry on dating and he has no intention to date anyone else even after his heart surgery which was really unexpected. It made me feel reassured for the first time. He even said he’d love for me to come and visit him, he lives in a lovely area and he said he can show me around when I come down. After 6 weeks he will move back here again. 

Everything has just been communicated from the first date, I even asked him straight up would you wanna carry on getting to know me, and it didn’t scare him off and he gave a straight answer to me. 

I guess what I’m trying to get at is to not settle for anything less of what you’d want! Communication has always been a big factor for me, and he’s just been the first guy to really reciprocate it where it feels genuine. I don’t even feel worried about not being able to see him, I have my final year of university to focus on anyways. But regardless, we’ve both had a positive attitude towards it all and I hope it goes well!

I see so many repetitive posts &amp; comments about it that I’m feeling concern about the toll your bitterness is taking on your mental health. It’s not like this is a new thing. These problems with the online dating game have been around since it became a thing years ago, although admittedly it’s steadily gotten worse. The statistics and studies that repeatedly get presented to show how unfair it is out there are not new information. Women have their own unique set of complaints and are never going to be swayed by your own. They are never going to feel sympathy for you. Trying to debate about it only makes them dig in their heels. 

Learn to be okay with the idea of not having a partner. We’re all fed a lie through television and movies that the most important thing in life is to find a partner. It sets unrealistic expectations about romance and love. Some people do accomplish this and good for them. But the sad truth is that many men will not find a partner. The other sad truth is that many who do will end up with the wrong partner yet suffer through it out of societal expectation and fear of starting over and failing. I’ve known so many partnered men who are good at presenting an acceptable facade but after a few beers open up about how miserable they truly are. 

The only answer is to let it go and walk away. Do your own thing. Delete your profile and then delete the apps. Take a nice long break. If it isn’t working for you up to this point there’s no sense in continuing to subject yourselves to the torture of constant rejection. 

Stop worrying about the “Chads”. That’s natural selection at play and isn’t their fault. Remind yourself that when those guys actually end up getting hooked into marriage that 50% of them will divorce and 70% of those divorces will be instigated by their female partner. 

Consider the worst thing that can happen...that you’ll end up alone forever. If that ends up happening, and it may, you need to start preparing for it now.  Focus the time you’ve been wasting swiping and sending first messages into the void on becoming more self-sufficient. Learn to cook for yourself. If you’re clueless on this get a crockpot and go to town, even a fool can make a decent roast in a crockpot.  Consider your finances and start thinking about how you’re going to keep from being homeless when you’re older and unable to work. Read books. A lot of books. Take yourself out on dates, there is no shame in going out to eat or to the movies alone, and fuck anybody that tries to tell you otherwise. Learn to play a musical instrument. Explore any chance to be creative. I’m a musician and artist and can look back over my life and see how my creativity has sustained me through many periods of loneliness. Get a pet. Find a good male therapist that you can talk to regularly and feel comfortable being vulnerable with. Seek out other men to lean on for emotional support. If you don’t have any friends and feel isolated go to your neighborhood Facebook group and make a post asking if there are any men in the area who would be interesting in forming a small men’s support group. You may be surprised to see how many other guys are in the same boat and are desperately in need of friends themselves. Don’t better yourself in hopes of attracting a woman, do it for yourself because you’re worth it. 


The idea of not having sex can be hard to swallow. Understand that a lack of sexual encounters does NOT have any meaning on what makes you a real man, regardless of what you were told in your teen years. Sex can be an incredible thing, but it isn’t always the big deal it’s hyped up to be. If I’m honest, I have to admit that many of my sexual encounters ended up being rather ho-hum. How many times have I walked away from getting laid and thought to myself, “I’ve had much more satisfying orgasms on my own”?  Consider getting yourself some high quality sex toys. The men’s sex toy game has come a long way since the advent of the Fleshlight. And when you balk at the price, just remember that it’s an investment that will pay many dividends over time. If necessary, consider paying for time with a legitimately independent professional sex-worker. That is if you can afford it and don’t have conflicting morals about it. The days of picking up someone sketchy off a streetcorner are long gone. Google is your friend with regards to this. 

Eventually, you may very well meet a partner IRL and hit it off. Remember that for the past year the pandemic has changed the world for everyone. Someday it will come to an end, hopefully soon, and when it does people who have been starved for socializing will be out in force and incredibly excited about it. This will definitely impact the way people interact. We can’t know yet exactly how, but I would like to think that the odds of meeting someone naturally will be affected and in a positive way. 

Your frustration and pain is valid. Constant rejection takes a harsh toll on the psyche. But that bitterness and anger you feel has a horrifically toxic effect that is hard to overcome. I understand. I’ve been there. Thank god I learned to drop out of the game and love myself.
