You could die alone. That is a full possibility. Unfortunately, there is not someone for everyone, if there was no one would ever complain about being single well into their 40s, 50s an on.

You might die alone. This fear you have, this fixation on finding someone before you die, that‚Äôs a sign your not happy with being yourself. You need to be with dying alone and never finding a person.

That‚Äôs ok, there‚Äôs no shame in that. There‚Äôs so much more to life than finding someone. And there‚Äôs so much freedom without another person.

I notice when some people talk about standards in dating, what they wind up doing is making 'rules' for the person they're dating, and calling them standards.

I have no interest in controlling what my partners are doing when I am not with them, and I dont want their actions when theyre with me to be because I gave them some kind of 'rules' to live by. 

How do you communicate, or display standards without controlling, critisizing or making rules for other people?

Please avoid the ""Here are my standards"" convo scripts, I dont think its normal to be so acedemic when talking to someone you've just met or are dating. so calling them standards when you talk to people just seems odd. and honestly I think it makes it sound more like a request than a standard.

15,n5j0we,1620229593,How can a Guy remember all these dating advice in the moment?," From my experience, men's dating advice has been around for decades and at some point through all my readings of all the books that are out there, they all eventually say the same thing. So, I don't think it is about finding new information but applying the information that is the problem. And if that is the case, then what is the best way to be confident and stay confident? How do you retain the information and apply it accordingly?

My guess, is you find a way to make it practical. In the past, I would forget all my lessons and break down and double-text a girl or over pursue. The usual unconfident behavior. This lead to me being rejected a lot by a lot of girls who have given me a chance by my initial confident levels at the start of the courtship. But last week I found this little nugget on Amazon from a book ""Moves: Dating is a Game."" It takes all the skills and lessons we have learned from playing video games, and then the book shows how those same skills can be used in the dating world. Making it practical while using something all of already know. As it covered Texting, Dating, Marriage, and Online Dating with video game comparisons and scenarios, I felt like it was a great way of making dating easier and would help me retain the teaching in a memorable way.

17,n5jau5,1620230295,Ghosted After 4mo,"I [25M] started seeing my ex-gf [24F] near the end of 2020. We previously dated for a couple years and hadn‚Äôt talked in a few years after a pretty nasty breakup.

She says from the get-go that she doesn‚Äôt feel ready to be dating anyone, and I tell her that‚Äôs okay as I‚Äôm not loading any expectations on this and really would rather focus on enjoying each other‚Äôs time. Fast forward a couple months and we spent lots of time together, going on dates, spending whole weekends together. She even introduced me to her friends.

Then one night (4mo in) she abruptly starts crying and saying she can‚Äôt do this anymore and questions where this is going. I tell her that since we actively go on dates, it‚Äôs going towards us dating, as that‚Äôs really the active form of the word. Now what I meant is that we were casually dating (dating seems to mean different things to everyone nowadays) - she then vehemently says we aren‚Äôt dating and that we never said we were exclusive. She was right, we had not discussed this before, and I found it a bit odd how seemingly offended she got at the idea of us dating exclusively. Given how much time we were spending together, I would be a little bit surprised if she had time to really develop something on the side but I suppose it couldn‚Äôt be ruled out.

She then confesses she‚Äôs falling for me, and says she still wants to see me. I tell her I also feel a connection with her and that I look forward to seeing her again as well. She then leaves for the night. 

This is the last time I saw her.
¬†
After that night, she became very distant and ‚Äúbusy‚Äù every time I tried to make plans with her. This goes on for about 3 weeks until I finally ask if she is avoiding me and she says, over text, that we aren‚Äôt on the same page about this and finally, that it‚Äôs best for her if we don‚Äôt see each other.

I expressed my disappointment in her choosing to do this over text rather than in person as I thought we had developed a bit more of mutual respect for one another, that I was surprised given her previous expression of feelings for me, but that I respect her decision and feelings and hope she finds what‚Äôs best for her.

She then goes off about how I used her for sex, and that she would‚Äôve never started talking to me again if she thought there wasn‚Äôt a possibility of us dating. She then contradicts this by saying that my actions didn‚Äôt indicate I was using her just for sex, which in hindsight I think maybe she was saying to blame me for her developing feelings.

I told her there was no way I would‚Äôve been hanging out with her for this long and going on dates if this was a purely physical relationship, nor was that ever really a possibility given the intensity and tumultuous nature of our past. For context, when we first dated, she initiated us breaking up.

I told her if that‚Äôs really how she feels than we should meet up to discuss this in person because I felt there was a huge misunderstanding and I am very confused by the whole situation, especially if she thought I was just using her for sex. She said maybe, but then never made any effort beyond that and ultimately got annoyed when I called her out on that and said that I lacked patience and it just wasn‚Äôt a priority for her anymore. It‚Äôs been about a month now with basically no contact.
¬†
Can someone help me make sense of this? Are my feelings of frustration unfounded? Is there any path to reconciliation here? Should I reach out to her or just forget about it?

I approached this with a high degree of caution and it seems like right when I let my guard down for only a minute it went to shit. I know ghosting/fading and shit is common nowadays but it seems quite ridiculous to be seeing someone for over 4 months and for them to just drop out like that. Especially given the history. Maybe she‚Äôs as confused as I am? No idea.


TL:DR ‚Äì Starting seeing an ex-GF from the past, it starts to head towards something beyond casual. She flips out and expresses feelings which I reciprocate. Then she tries to ghost me, I try to make things right unsuccessfully. Now I am confused and a bit frustrated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5jau5/ghosted_after_4mo/
18,n5jn75,1620231128,"Rejection without explanation. Turning down a date, or another date if you've been seeing them.","How would you turn someone down, end communication etc if you've been seeing them (a few dates, maybe a few weeks, not a full blown relationship) or turn down first date, or a second or third date?

I dont want to be unnecesarily cruel to people that have been perfectly respectful. But I also don't like having to give a reason for not dating someone. I have a right not to date anyone I choose, and I shouldn't have to justify it.

\_

&amp;#x200B;

Can you help me figure out to simply state I wont go out with you again, without being insulting - but also without trying to explain or 'soften the blow'

Note: I think 'softening the blow' makes people feel worse. Because its insincere and they know you say that to everyone. So the more you try to let them down easy,the bigger deal you are making out of somethingt hat shouldnt be a big deal. so you telegraph to them that your expecting them to take this hard, and therefore that it must be a bad thing when you try and cushion it beyond ""No thank you"" 

I refuse to 'explain myself' to men when I choose not to go out with them again. They almost always try and 'debate' me about it. As if my preferences are something I can be wrong about and they want to argue with me about it. 

I will not, out of principle, offer reasons to men when I turn them down anymore.I will not offer reasons to men when I see them a few times and stop seeing them. I do not owe them my time and this is just a boundary I have now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't like the assumption that if you go on one date with someone there is a assumed obligation to communicate with them again, and that you have to have a mini 'breakup' with everyone you get a coffee with.

\-

Context

Every time I tell men the 'reason' - they argue with me about it (what the fuck is that?) - for instance I have a few deal breakers, it has nothing to do with their personality but if they are religious, we are incompatible, if they have or want kids, we are incompatible. Those things are deal breakers.  You would think knowing that it was a dealbreaker that preexisted and has nothing to do with anything you said or did would be a welcome peice of information - but it isn't. They often act like they dont believe I could have a 'valid' reason for not dating them. Then after those conversations I can give them a new reason, they are infantile and their behavior is repulsive. 

I also don't like 'explaining myself' when its a request for a first date with someone I dont or barely know, or after just a few dates - because all of my thoguhts and feelings and motivations are none of their business.I am not obligated to share how I feel about a person I barely know or offer them a lengthy psycoanalysis of them and myself and why I dont want to go otu with them again. I might have reasons that are extremely personal, and they dont have a right to that information.

Not to mention, sometimes the reason is ""I just don't""

Met a girl through handling a work event. She doesn't work in the same company as me. She's in another company that has worked with my current company a few times. I'm 26, Male &amp; she's 26, Female. First time meeting her today.

Our colleagues who are older (35 \~ 40 years old) in both of our companies were trying to play matchmakers and get 2 of us to open up to each other. 

After the work event all of us went for a meal together. She sat next to me. Small &amp; casual conversation,etc. I'm a little messy when I eat, she opened a pack of tissues and offered them to me. Don't know if these are positive signs, maybe I read too much into it. 

Turns out she lives pretty close to me so we took the train home and had more conversation. Ended up talking a lot about traveling and how Covid messed up plans. I asked for her instagram and we both followed each other. 

Couple hours go by. I DM her something generic saying ""Hey. Thanks for sharing about your travels. Great to meet you today. See you at future work events"" &amp; after 2.5 hours she replied ""Hello no problem! Nice to meet you too! See ya around :)"" . 

So now I'm just sat here thinking what should I reply back to her ? Ideally I think I should try to set up a date. Or is it pretty obvious she is showing no signs of interest and I should just not reply and back off (&amp; just keep a professional working relationship for the future) ?

I  (28F) had been dating a 28M for 3 months almost to the day until last  week.

The previous week we had  gone to dinner as usual and went back to his place to make dessert and  watch a movie. Everything seemed fine and based off what he said there  was nothing that happened to make him dislike me. But after I left his  place in the morning he went radio silent which was completely unusual, I  had also notice he had either unmatched me or deleted his Hinge profile  - another red flag. I waited about 5 days before reaching out to  basically ask what was up and to my surprise he replied saying that he  really liked me but that it was been super important for him to ""be  with"" someone of his own religious background to honor his grandparents  and that he had been seeing someone else of the same background and  wanted to pursue them instead and he was sorry if I felt like I had been  misled.

I absolutely felt misled  as we were seeing each other twice a week for the past 3 months and  always went on dinner dates or to the movies, etc. we never just showed  up at each other's places to hook up late at night and we were texting  daily. We had talked many times about our families, if we wanted kids  and religious backgrounds and he had always stated that he wasn't  religious. When I did reply back questioning him he ""clarified"" that he  didn't celebrate the holidays or anything but he wanted to pass down his  heritage to his kids. What I know see that I failed to lay out for him  is that he had basically said he was fine repeatedly sleeping with me  knowing full well from the beginning I wasn't of that same religion but  he couldn't ""see himself being with someone"" like me? How is that not  offense?

I've been feeling a  mixture of anger, guilt (as he basically blamed this information not  coming to light because I never asked for ""next steps"") and sadness  because I do miss him and I now question the sweet moments we had. It  seems clear to me now that he never ever intended us to become anything  because he wasn't ever going to date someone not of the same background.

I don‚Äôt give him a straight answer but I basically tell him well we aren‚Äôt exclusive and I thought we were through. We have more conversations back and worth but he does say he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find someone so fast and the fact that I said other people indicating that there was more than one. Eventually he said I should do my thing and that he‚Äôll survive. 

Anyway, I did tell him that I‚Äôll wait for him and keep to myself (aka not sleep with other guys). But now I feel so bad. Because I would have never slept with these guys if only I knew where his head was at. I told him this and also said I don‚Äôt want him to resent me for it and that I only ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù cause I thought we were through. How do I move on from this?

32,n5m95s,1620237640,Wheelchair advice,"I  was in an accident when I was 19 and now I am in a wheelchair. I had a radical operation called a hemicorporectomy and I lost my entire lower body. With my prosthetics, I look like a paraplegic. I've gone back to college, gotten a job and live normally. I sit in an orthopedic ""bucket"" that attaches to cosmetic prostheric legs, and then of course in a wheelchair.

Three years from my operation, I am totally recovered. My upper body has become incredibly strong. I graduated from college and have a good job, live alone in an excellent apartment, socialize, and am completely independant.

I think that there is a big difference between people who get this operation because they have debilitating and life threatening  cancer, and are already very ill --- and people like me who are in general  good health and are injured. 

This operation is more common than you think, probably because of fast accident response, helicopter ambulances, sophisticated emergency rooms, and well trained and equipped first responders. In my big city rehab center, there had been two others my age, one other guy and a girl. All recovered to perfect health. 

From what I saw in rehab, I am far better off than someone with paraplegia, who has all the multiple systemic issues what come with spinal problems.

I wear cosmetic prosthetic legs. Transferred from my wheelchair to a couch, chair, or sofa, I look like a very handsome, muscular, slim, healthy guy. 

So it's not all that big a deal except that, so far, no girl has gotten past her initial shock and disgust. Several times I've developed great potential relationships which reach the flirting and kissing stage. This leads to her hands touching my legs, which are obviously cold and hard. I explain that they are prosthetic. That's been the end of romance, so far, without even going into the rest of it.

So far, I've never really dated, as such, but because I am otherwise handsome and fit, girls my age have started conversations and been friendly, so I've ended up in several dinner or coffee dates, but the talk always goes to "" 
Are you ever going to be able to walk"" and then "" what happened"". I say I was in accident but don't go into detail.

I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas about how to deal with this. I'm also willing to answer any questions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5m95s/wheelchair_advice/
33,n5m9v4,1620237694,Rejected?,"Is this a rejection?


There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She would ask me what my weekend plans were/ i would ask her

She would also ask me what i was doing after work. She took a genuine interest in my life/school/ family. Would get excited when we had something in common

Very awkward and shy when she would first sit across from me. Only started the convo 40% of the time. Other times she would just sit there and look at me until i said something. Would always blush/smile. 

If my break was 15 minutes or so she wouldn‚Äôt leave until i got up and left. Seemed to genially enjoy talking to me. Applied the rule that if i were talking to another dude i would be uncomfterbal here with this type of silent behavior but seemingly just enjoying my presence. 

There is no way she is interested in me as she is a 9/10 in my eyes and im maybe a 3 at best. She is athletic i am not. 

I am genially friendly and a lot of people like to great me when they see me. Talk for 3-5 minutes. But usually don‚Äôt take breaks with them. When ever someone would great me i would try to include her in the convo as i know she is shy but she would only smile at look at them then get on her phone until i was done. Really cant figure this out. 

Seemed to get slightly annoyed if someone took my attention away from her. Or if she saw me talking to another cute girl on the sales floor she would turn around and flip her hair and i think intentionally made me see her walk away.  

Another thing i truly cant figure out is when i would be sitting down talking with her. On quite a few occasions she would speak so softly i couldn‚Äôt hear her and i would ask her to repeat herself 3-4 times until i would just go with it and act like i heard her. Really confused as to why she wouldn‚Äôt speak up. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i asked for her number and she gave it to me right away. She seemed to reach for her phone 4 or 5 times while the words came out of my mouth. Weird 

I texted her the next day and we talked for about two days, then when i hit her up on the third(basically said what are you doing today) i didn‚Äôt get a response. However i just figured she was busy so i tried again the next evening. And we picked up where we left off. 

Things were going well so i figured i should ask her out as it seems i had been stringing her along for 6 months. 

She made some of what i thought were hints in the past. Such as asking me if i had any valentines day plans. Made sure to tell me she was doing nothing. She also mentioned that shed been hit on by some of our coworkers but she wasn‚Äôt interested.  

But there it was as soon as i asked her out, a rejection. I really couldn‚Äôt believe it as i was so sure she liked me. She told me she didn‚Äôt think she could as she hasn‚Äôt really gone out since the pandemic. I gave it a chill understanding response. Then she told me she thought she had worded that weird and she had a household family member with health issues. 

I felt a little embarrassed that i got this one so wrong. I told her that i wouldn‚Äôt speak to her anymore because of the awkwardness but she told me not to do that as she really liked our relationship. Whatever that means. We went back and forth for a little but i finally agreed i would still talk to her and ‚Äútreat her the same‚Äù

A few days went by with no communication on either side until the next time i saw her at work. I tried my best to avoid her and i was embarrassed. She came and sat with me on my break and i couldn‚Äôt avoid her anymore. 

She got all dressed up(its a casual environment). She had her hair down and done, and make up done to perfection. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice this  as i already thought she was beautiful, now it seemed that she was doing this to mess with me. She was extra smiley and we talked for 45 minutes, 10 or 15 over our unpaid break times. She just really seemed to be picking up what i was putting down even more than normal. 

Im sure it had nothing to do with anything though. But once i saw her like this i realized i was in pretty deep. I texted her later and said i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. 

I then went on with two paragraphs i wish i could take back and told her i didn‚Äôt need space for ever that i would like to talk again sometime just not now. I told her she was a great person, it wasn‚Äôt her it was me. And i really liked her as a friend. 

She said its ok just don‚Äôt worry about me. I asked her what she meant and she said dont worry about me ill still be chill and your friend. 

Didn‚Äôt think much of that until the next time i saw her she looked sad. She also looked as if she had put no effort into her appearance. Heck she wasn‚Äôt even in dress code.  I knew i messed up and then tried to talk to her. She flat out ignored me. 

I texted her and told her it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work now. I said this like 4 different ways and got no response. 

I said i was sorry the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me. She then told me she wished not to speak to me anymore. 

Why would she be so sad/mad if she wasn‚Äôt interested and i agreed to be her friend i just needed time to get over my feelings for her so i could approach it with a clear head. 

If she liked me as a friend why didn‚Äôt she just say she liked me as a friend. I don‚Äôt get it as if someone i was friends with had feelings for me i would tell them this and give them time to get over it. 

I feel like she must have known i was into her as i was always asking her about her life and looking at her a lot. 

I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

To add on to this if she wasnt interested romantically but she liked me as a friend. Why wouldnt she tell me that instead of making up an excuse?

She also acted in a way as i could only describe as submissive to me. Idk how she did it but she almost made me feel masculine around her. 

TL;DR she said she enjoyed our relationship now she wont speak to me. Whats the deal?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5m9v4/rejected/

We started talking before she started nursing school. It took us four months for us to meet because she kept being indecisive(she‚Äôs indecisive about everything). The second date was at my place and we hooked up. She texted me a week after that telling me that she doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on because she felt like I was looking for something serious and doesn‚Äôt want to break my heart because school is her main priority. Anyways, she came back after I told her It‚Äôs not that serious since I am still going on dates(she started acting jealous thinking I am always with someone else after that whenever we spoke). Since then, I been to her area twice for dinner(which she has offered to pay and we also have hooked up in her car). She calls me and texts me everyday because we don‚Äôt see each other often(she says that‚Äôs her way of her caring). She finished her first semester last Friday and I told her thinking she would be excited since she has more free time now that if she wanted to meet up with me around my area since I always go to her area since she‚Äôs always busy studying before she leaves this Friday to California with her parents(which is true) and she tells me she‚Äôs going to be too busy getting ready for her trip and dealing with school things maybe when she comes back. I felt hurt and she didn‚Äôt give another alternative. She called me right after that which was awkward to tell me about her day(I feel like I should of told her how I felt during that call). She texted me after the phone call and I never responded. Days go by, and on that Friday she posted that she was around my area with her classmates celebrating and on Saturday she posted that she was out with her best friend for dinner somewhere not that far from me.

Dating is suppose to be chill and fun, getting to know people, not hearing out there childhood traumas or whatnot. Or confessing all our mistakes with your ex.

I don't get it. We all have our shit, but you are supposed to deal with it, not shovel it onto people who barely know you. Or did I miss a memo? And no, it's not a lack of empathy, it's a basic lack of boundaries and respect when people dump their emotional problems on strangers just because they think they are hot or paying attention to them.

It's not intimacy or bonding or whatever, it's manipulative and crappy to try and make someone feel bad for you to get them to like you, it's exploiting people's empathy. No stranger is going to magically come along and fix you or your insecurities or your past traumas... that is your job to do with a professional. 

I'm just so sick of people who seem to feel compelled to tell you how their parents divorce means they can't trust anyone, but then tell you how awful you are if you want away from their shitty attitude.

42,n5nbx6,1620240355,"Men in 20s are not providers , we've lost chivalry"," 

Hello relationships community. I am in my 20s and am currently multi-dating. I am really frustrated with men in their 20s that I have dated. There seems to more gentlemen in this age group anymore. For context, these men are not bums. I do not online date. Every man I have gone on a date with has approached me through my mutual friend group, work or people from my community centre. I work for a Fortune 500 company for background and date men who are educated and from good family backgrounds, yet they all want me to ‚Äòbuild‚Äô with them. They will never offer to pick me up for dates , after the 3rd date they are always looking for me to pay etc so I end up wasting my time on 3 dates and then not wanting to see them again. I recently went on 3 dates with a 27 year old man. On the first 2 dates things were good, we first met for a quick lunch, second time dinner, third time disaster. He invited me to Cactus Club and we had a great time, till the bill came. In front of the waitress he asks me to pay half, I was so embarrassed but paid without protesting. Then later when he asked me out again I said no. Another 26 year old guy I went out with for lunch embarrassed me so much. A burger at the restaurant we went to was $25 dollars and he straight up said ‚Äò25 dollars with a burger‚Äô so loundly he sounded like a country bumpkin. Obviously there was no second date. I cannot handle going 50/50. My sister went through the route of going 50/50 with a man and now is stuck working with a toddler and her husband penny pinching when she makes over 100k which is why I refuse to accept that. Honestly both my sisters and I calculated how much we spend just to be eligible to be in the dating market with waxing, makeup hair, nails , pedicure that I feel I have already paid for dates before I even show up. These are expenses I have to budget $400-500 for every month and therefore I expect the man to pay at least the same amount on dating me.

So here is the turn in the story. I recently went on a date with a 42 (from my company) and 45 ( from an event for accountants, he works as a partner) year old and oh my lord the difference was astronomical. One brought me flowers on the first date and both sent me an Uber. I have been on 5 dates with these men and one even went on a shopping trip where we had so much fun. The other donated 2000 to the charity for homeless youth that I volunteer for by the 6th date. My point is, these 15-20 year older men treat me like the prize. For context , I am not a supermodel. I have no problem getting men but I am just a cute looking girl, so my conclusion is that men love young women and will do anything for them. Also, I want to make it clear that I am not sleeping with any of these men. I am not a sugar baby either. That will not happen until I am engaged. From now on I am turned off by guys my age.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5nbx6/men_in_20s_are_not_providers_weve_lost_chivalry/

62,n5p81x,1620245228,My anxiety is making me feel confused about my interactions with this person,"Sorry that this post is kinda long, I just like to write out all that I can to provide context.

So I (24M) work with this girl (20F) and for the last couple of months I've slowly developed really strong feelings for her. I don't want to make this a big deal, but I will note that it is uncommon. I don't date, and I never get romantic feelings for anyone. I'll admit people are attractive, but that's about it. So developing feelings for someone takes a lot. There's just something about her that I really enjoy. She's interesting to me, she's extremely kind and warm, a friendly person, somewhat introverted and reserved like me, and I'm very comfortable when around her. I find that all of that makes her very beautiful. I'm starting to talk and get to know her more. I'm definitely going out of my way to interact with her. We also just started texting, albeit I'm the one who starts the conversations and they don't really go as far as I'd like, but it doesn't get weird. It always ends on a good note. I just would like more to come from that, I'm just terrible when it comes to texting. I'd actually prefer to talk in person in these situations which is weird because I'm very introverted and shy. Overall though I'm finding this very rewarding. Seeing her at work now is a highlight of the week for me. But, I feel like I'm getting too caught up in my feelings clearly. The main problem seems to be my anxiety, which is making me overthink and freeze up. A lot of that has to do with the fact that I don't know if she likes me like that. I'm terrible at figuring out social cues. I know she doesn't dislike me or anything, and she likes me as a person to work with, but I can't gauge if she likes me in a different way. Could she, probably. Does she, no idea. I will say that she seems somewhat aware of my feelings for her, at least my intention to hang out with her outside of work, but that hasn't changed our dynamic at all. We continue to talk and have a good back and forth, and we've started to get more personal so idk. I've asked her to hang out and she said yes, but it won't happen for a bit cause she'll be out of town this week. I guess the thing I'm worried about is that I don't want to get too enamored with her, and her not feel the same way, but more importantly that I've made things weird and uncomfortable, because I would like to still be friends with her. I definitely don't want to do the wrong thing here. Part of me just wants to tell her how I feel, but I'm so anxious to even to do it so I feel stuck. I know this doesn't really seem like a thing, but my anxiety is making it so difficult for me right now.

72,n5qf77,1620248334,It‚Äôs worth it when you finally get a win,"I know there definitely a lot of people on here with doubts, I know I was one. After all my last and only ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship of 5 months left me in a very bad place with an awful perception of what love and relationships should be like (more so than the dumpster fire that is my parents marriage). Turns out it‚Äôs not supposed to feel like a loosing war of walking on eggshells every day of your life. 

Anyways, I think I may have finally gotten a win. And the best part is that the guy in question has been my strictly platonic friend of 7 years and, one of if not, my longest friendship. I feel completely comfortable around him, can actually be my true self, and he already knows all of my shit good and bad. It‚Äôs just crazy how it never occurred to me before to even question if maybe just maybe that that‚Äôs someone I should be with. 

And since he knows me very very well he understands my ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù and trust issues. He was literally there to comfort me after the first guy I ever dated (his best friend) for only a month came back from a vacation completely disinterested after a solid 3 weeks of love bombing the fuck out of me. 

And when I had to deal with my ex boyfriend of that 5 month long relationship, he was the only person who didn‚Äôt make me feel like I was crazy or that shit was all in my head. 

Through all of my failed attempts at love he‚Äôs always been there. He‚Äôs listened to me cry and carry on about mediocre guys more times than I can count. 

And not once in the past 7 years has he ever pushed the boundaries of our platonic friendship or tried to get me to sleep with him.

Things only changed because the thought of there possibly being something more got put into my head and then after three days of it festering there in my brain I decided to act on it. He came over my house and with a little help from my friend liquid courage I made my move and let‚Äôs just say he didn‚Äôt leave my house until three days later. 

Now speaking from a couple weeks in the future from that day, we‚Äôve gone on our first official date and will soon be going on a second and I cannot wait. I am in a constant state of pure giddiness and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. This is all so crazy and new to me and all I know now is that I want to feel.

80,n5rrwx,1620251948,Should I ask her out or am I a rebound?,"So a few months ago I (24M) met this girl (23F) that I get along with really well, we kind of hit it off instantly, talking a lot every time we would be at the same party (we have some mutual friends). Only thing is that we were both in committed relationships.

We both recently got out of our relationships, I broke up with my girlfriend and she got broken up with not too long ago either. We had chats about each other‚Äôs breakup, she feels sad about hers but respects the decision of her ex-boyfriend.

Last weekend I had a party at mine, she ended up joining with some friends. Again we started talking to each other most of the evening and things became quite flirty, a lot of physical contact, eye contact etc 

We ended up talking in my room, when she mentioned that a few weeks ago she kissed a guy that asked her out on a date as she was curious what it would be like to kiss someone else as she‚Äôs been in a relationship with the same guy for the last 3 years.

We continued chatting, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I was curious about kissing someone new too. I decided to go in for the kiss, we started making out quite aggressively and eventually got to 3rd base which she initiated. We then returned to the party, stayed quite close and very flirty.

As the party went on quite late, we ended up having lunch with her friends/flatmates at a restaurant, before everyone went home and she stayed over to sleep. We didn‚Äôt have sex, just cuddled and kissed before falling asleep. 

The next day I had plans, so she woke up and we kissed each other goodbye. I texted her to ask if she got home safe, to which she replied ‚Äúyes, thank you for asking‚Äù, and I left it at that without us texting since (this was 4 days ago)

I‚Äôm now wondering: should I ask her out on a date? Or wait for her to text me before I make the next move?
On one hand we had a fun night together and get along great, and clearly there is some physical attraction between us. Our conversations are also very flirty (joking about how we‚Äôll fall in love with each other, how she‚Äôs going to invite me to her home town etc).

On the other hand, we both recently got outside of relationships and a date might be too early for her. Maybe this was just a fun hookup/rebound as she likes the attention, as from what I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs always been a quite flirty person.

What do you think? Should I just accept this night as a bit of fun in my life as a single person, or ask her out on a date? Should I take the next step to text her even if she hasn‚Äôt reached out since when I asked her if she got home safe?

Any advice is appreciated!

I'm assuming this will also mean that the guy will have to carry the relationship. Like this is the relationship that my sister and her boyfriend have.

She texted me a week after that telling me that she doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on because she felt like I was looking for something serious and doesn‚Äôt want to break my heart because school is her main priority.

She calls me and texts me everyday because we don‚Äôt see each other often(she says that‚Äôs her way of her caring). She finished her first semester last Friday and I told her thinking she would be excited since she has more free time now that if she wanted to meet up with me around my area since I always go to her area since she‚Äôs always busy studying before she leaves this Friday to California with her parents(which is true) and she tells me she‚Äôs going to be too busy getting ready for her trip and dealing with school things maybe when she comes back.

POF still has the ethnic search feature. Granted you could be missing out on someone because they are a different race but it is still your choice right? Why not throw in height discrimination, weight discrimination, people who only date outside their race? What about people who choose to date their own ethnicity/race.

Has society gone too far? Why does race have to be a factor?

Personally I like various types not all because i'm just not attracted to them, it's really that simple.

But some of my friends are saying its a little weird. What do you think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5sv5l/is_it_weird_that_i_20m_and_dating_a_17_year_old/
88,n5t3rt,1620255592,I'm a bit lost with dating,"Hi guys, so I'm now entering my late 20s and I've had three relationships that lasted longer than a year and one which was really serious where I lived with someone. While out of those relationships I dated loads and had loads of fun experiences. The problem is I've realised that I have yet to find anyone that really is into the same interests that I have, has a similar sense of humour, likes the same type of sex I do, wants the same things from a relationship that I do. On my dates alot of the time I was like the sad clown, making the girl laugh and all and I was pretending to be someone else just cause I knew that's how I could get them to like me. Then with my relationships I felt like I was going through motions or rather was trying to make them happy more than I was me. It was more like it would give me a buzz seeing them happy than me actually loving being with them. But no one ever really got to know me properly. And I get it sounds pathetic and all, and I can keep doing the same thing and have a few more notches on my bedpost but I don't want to. I genuinely do want to find someone. But at this point I'm a bit lost because I ain't interested in settling anymore. Anyone else been having this problem?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5t3rt/im_a_bit_lost_with_dating/
89,n5ta7a,1620256077,How to have higher standards for yourself!!!,"How you are treated is so much more important than how much you like someone

I have definitely have let people in the past get away with a lot of things just because I liked them a lot. My judgment was clouded because I was liked this person so much. 

When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Look at their actions and try to be objective. I know it can be hard to be objective so what I do is think, if someone was treating my best friend this way, would I tolerate it?

For some strange reason, I have higher standards for my friends and I've learned that I need those same high standards for myself. 

So the next time you find yourself in a situation justifying someone's actions, try to ask yourself, if some guy or some gal was treating your best friend this way, would you want your best friend to stay with them? If you wouldn‚Äôt tolerate it, I would rethink whether or not you would want to continue seeing / dating this person. 

This was how I learned to set the bar higher for myself!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5ta7a/how_to_have_higher_standards_for_yourself/

91,n5tipq,1620256758,How to stop the catastrophizing dating.,"So i have this issue and it stems from t r a u m a and I don't get to see my therapist until next week, so I thought to ask this.

So I met this guy, super sweet. Really nerdy, has chill vibes all around. I pretty much tumbled into a crush after two dates the the third we even got to smoochin. All good things. But, despite only going on a few dates and things being really good (minus both of us being awkward as hell) there is this voice in the back of my head saying,

""Cool. How should we (me, myself, and I) break up with him when the time comes?""

**eXCUSE ME BRAIN??** Like yeah, there are some awkward moments like all sorts of stuff that comes with real life dating. But does that warrant thinking about breAKING UP WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN OFFICAL? WE'VE. BEEN. ON. THREE. DATES.

I have a feeling that this comes from when I was younger and I dated the wrong people for too long (i.e I was groomed when I was 12 by a 16 year old, year long relationship with an emotional abuser at age 13-14). The only relationship I had that was actually good lasted a month. Then I got traumatized by a friend who basically wanted me to sell my body so HE could have money to spend (I was 17, he was 19 going on 20).  I had a fling in 2019, but other than that this is my first REAL dating experience since 2017.

I think personally my brain trying to guard me from being overly attached BECAUSE of all the stuff I've been through. I basically made it out in my head of how I want me relationship to end up (like a fantasy I do want to make this work out because he is adorable, and I just like the moments when we can lay together and the world isn't as loud. I know I like him because I can be alone with him and feel like I'm recharging when he touches me affectionately (autism + being an introvert tends to cause me to be repelled by people I don't want to be close to). 

I know this isn't exactly ""normal"" but has anyone else experience thoughts like this? How did you get out of that line of thinking? I'm flying blind as hell because it's been pretty much four years since I considered really dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5tipq/how_to_stop_the_catastrophizing_dating/

we‚Äôve been intimate (had sex) &amp; I feel really comfortable around him (to the point that it feels a little scary because I‚Äôm not used to being like that with people)

he recently told me that he‚Äôs in love with me, and I‚Äôm not sure how to feel ‚Äî he‚Äôs VERY affectionate, confident in how he loves, is caring, and it‚Äôs easy for him to be vulnerable, whereas with me... it is not lol

I really like him, but I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll *know* that I love him &amp; I also struggle with anxiety and low self-esteem, so I overthink A LOT (does he actually like me? do I actually like him? what if it ends? should I even do this?) 

So, at the root of everything, I‚Äôm just confused as to WHY he loves me, and I think that‚Äôs my biggest issue. 

any thoughts? I‚Äôm curious if people have similar experiences or insight to offer

95,n5tt55,1620257606,Does a guy not lasting very long with you (sexually) mean that he really likes you/how you feel? Or is he like this with everyone?,"So, I (F22) was seeing this guy (30M) for two months and every time we were intimate he would only last for about 5 minutes, I am not exaggerating. One of those times he literally came in two or three strokes and was like ‚Äúthis never happens to me‚Äù and I just laughed it off but internally I was like???? I need to get railed for longer than 30 seconds. Every time after that it was like 2-5 minutes of actual physical sex and he would always say to me afterwards ‚ÄúI have to keep telling myself don‚Äôt come don‚Äôt come‚Äù and I just would try not to cringe at his remarks. He would also always say I was the only girl that made him finish that quickly but I found that extremely hard to believe unless he really was just that attracted to me. Although I don‚Äôt believe level of attraction and time it takes one to ejaculate are that correlated but I could be wrong. Just kind of wanted some insight to this, especially from men. Is it really possible for him to only finish that fast with me? Or does this sort of thing happen, finishing too quickly, to men as they age? Or does this vary by partner?
