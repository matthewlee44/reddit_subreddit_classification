I'm pretty hurt but I wished her luck and I told her I hope she finds happiness and that special someone.

I apologized for screwing up our friendship and tonight will be the last time we talk but if her feelings change come talk to me if not this is good bye.

You guys were right you cannot escape just being friends but what hurts more is I lost my bestfriend, she's someone I would've married and have a kid with which is huge because before her I never wanted those things.

1,sajz1v,1642908457,Date was absolutely incredible,I 25F went on a date last night with someone I met off of Bumble. Our connection was absolutely amazing. We could talk about something as trivial as our favorite ice cream flavors or as deep as the existence of a higher power and death. It was so easy and I am so intrigued by him. He told me he wanted to pursue me whatever that looked like because he didn‚Äôt want to miss out on a chance of getting to know me (this is was our first date). I‚Äôm realistic and know it may not go anywhere but I was so impressed by his personality and seemingly deep kind heart that I think no matter what happens I‚Äôll pray for his unknowns. You know when you can just feel genuineness in someone? That‚Äôs how he felt and I hope I‚Äôm right. He sent me a song to listen to on the way home and it made me cry. It feels so strange being so happy and hopeful after only one date. I already miss him haha. After being hurt so much you don‚Äôt have as much faith in finding your person so it‚Äôs scary but I‚Äôm going to pursue him too because I don‚Äôt want to miss the chance of getting to know someone like him.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sajz1v/date_was_absolutely_incredible/

It's always a casual short hug that each of us go in for and expect.

Recently, I was on a first date with a 31F. You'd think a 31 year old woman would know the routine, or you know, be adult-like. We met online and decided to go out to a restaurant downtown. She's waiting outside and I walk up and we greet each other. I go in for the casual first date hug and she hesitantly hugs back and was like ""oh wow, you're a hugger."" I jokingly said ""haha you ever bin on a first date before?"" We have that awkward laugh and then we proceed to be seated. Instantly the conversation begins by her assuming I'm some fucboy and have ulterior motives. ""So how many dates have you been on in the last month? Are you sure you're looking for a relationship?? Do you hug all your dates? Do you invite all your dates over to your place for the first date?"" Then she said ""sorry maybe I don't know how this online dating thing works."" I again jokingly said, ""maybe this is why you're 31 and still single."" The date definitely could've ended right there but it didn't.

We both laughed and began straight up roasting each other for most of the night. As the drinks kept coming, our roasts turned darker.

We're essentially dating without the official title (his parents are homophobic to the degree of ""part of you died to me when you came out"").

Things have been sort of ""off"" since this past November. The last time we were together, we did nothing intimate (he playfully told me to stop each time I tried) and before I left to come his way last night, he sent me a long text saying he didn't want to pursue anything romantic anymore, but that we can still hang out as often as we normally would.

Tonight, I ended up having to stay at a relative's house a mile down from his place due to his mom showing up unannounced and inviting herself to sleep over. He felt really bad and apologized multiple times, saying I can stay an extra day to make up for it, which then lead to him saying we should cuddle for a bit, promptly leading to foreplay and sex before he dropped me off here.

I'm not really sure what to think. I have a feeling we'll just keep doing what we've been doing. His mood can fluctuate significantly due to him being diagnosed with/taking meds for severe depression, anxiety and ADHD.

We‚Äôve slowly worked up where we were going to make it sexual, which brings me to now:

The weekend before we agreed to hang out this weekend and sleep together. So during the week I made my plans to ‚Äúdo it right‚Äù.

I planned a meal with premium ingredients, and a 3 day prep. Found out her favourite drinks, and dessert.

Her son in law also works at the same company as us, and always asks her to babysit on Friday and Saturday nights; So I approached him and gave him $100 for a babysitter and/or other inconveniences (take note of this).

In the meantime I wanted to make a good impression as I‚Äôm a hairy mofo from taking testosterone for a deficiency, so decided to trim up a little.

While shaving I noticed a tiny skin tag on my leg and being self conscious thought ‚ÄúUh-oh. This doesn‚Äôt look too good. She might get the wrong idea that it isn‚Äôt a skin tag‚Äù, so decided to cut it off.
First came the nail clippers, but it too spongy for them.
Next came the nail scissors, but they were too blunt.
Floss was next on the list, but I was out. Then it to me‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll just flick it off with the razor!

So I threaded the skin tag through the razor held it in the fingers of one had and yanked the razor the razor down with the other hand to make it quick.
It was quick all right, but it also tore down my leg like a hangnail which left a long red line which soon started to pour out with blood.
Due to my lack of planning and medical supplies I ended up treating it with vodka  I brought for our date night and swabs.

Then for the actual date‚Ä¶.
I asked if she would would like to come around Friday night.

The answer was no, she‚Äôs watching her grandkid. Ho-hum. Maybe it was her other grandkid, not the one from above? No worries, that‚Äôs out of my control.

‚ÄúWhat about Saturday then?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo sorry. Since I don‚Äôt have any grandkids I‚Äôm going to the city clubbing‚Äù
- Going to the city clubbing here generally means to go to clubs looking to get laid.

37,sammho,1642917398,I am (26F) and I have been speaking to someone online (44M) for 6 months and am not sure whether to trust him.,"Hi everyone,

I really need advice on this as I seriously have nowhere to turn.

I started speaking to this man (44) last year on the basis of a Dom and Sub relationship (it was mainly based on that and I did not plan on it becoming emotional). As time went on, I fell for him as we would chat daily on Telegram. The moment he said ""can we turn this into a relationship"" I instantly said yes and as much as we still mainly discussed our fantasies around sex and positions within our roles as Dom and Sub, I still had these feelings to discuss more. By the way, this is a long-distance situation as we are not in the same city. As I started asking him questions that required vulnerability, he would close up, take a really long time to reply (sometimes days), I would mention that and he would either say that he's ""going through a lot"" or that he's busy as he owns his own business.

One thing that he highlighted early on is that he is non-monogamous sexually, and I will be honest, even though I agreed to it as I know some people are able to separate sex from love, it did give me some discomfort as I was far away from him and still am, and our situation is not solid so for all I know I am a placeholder for someone he really wants.

&amp;#x200B;

He went silent for four months after agreeing to see me when I was in his city and now he has recently reconnected, the feelings have flooded back. We recently had a conversation about the future and how he wants kids with me, asked me for the ring size and stone that I wanted, but he hasn't wh even confirmed when he will fly me down to his city as he had promised me before he went silent. He said he went silent because he had a stroke and was comatose for 3 months, which I am having doubts about at the back of my mind. He just expressed a fantasy that he would like me to be a part of which is a foursome, which I had slight objections to mainly because I find that he is quickly able to discuss things like fantasies but when it comes to solidifying our bond and sexual compatibility in person first he goes silent. Maybe I am being insecure but I believe that before he ventures out into an open relationship, I would at least like to establish a strong connection with him first and know where I stand. He says that he is in love with me but has not shown that and part of me thinks he's taking advantage of my feelings for him to gain my trust and later use me.

I am really starting to second guess my entire emotional self. I know I still have a lot to work on emotionally but I really am not sure what to trust. His words or my now overthinking mind.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sammho/i_am_26f_and_i_have_been_speaking_to_someone/
38,sammhs,1642917398,Regretting a breaking it off text,"So I‚Äôd been talking to someone from a dating app via text for about five weeks. It consisted of a daily good morning text followed by a couple of other text threads throughout the day. No dates or phone calls. There were some more provocative messages some of which I played into. I had the sense that this person may be a bit stuck on a previous partner or not over a break up because of a couple of songs he said he was listening to. He was very friendly, and his photos gave off really warm energy and he seemed very kind. I thought after some of his texts, that he seemed like an angel. He did look like a hornier person, which admittedly is part of the reason why I liked his profile. At first, I thought, I‚Äôm not sure about him, I will go on a date when he asks me when he gets back from visiting his parents, but I‚Äôm not sure it will go well. I also was crying a bit though when he would text me the first or second week because I think, I wanted more from him, like a call. Sometime during week 3 or 4 of texting I heard the ‚Äúhere comes the bride‚Äù theme song in my head, which I was surprised by. He attempted to jokingly invite me over to his place at a later date. To this I said, I probably would feel best doing that after some dates and a conversation. He responded positively. It was awkward the next couple of text threads.The following day another more sexual comment was made too which I said, I do want more than a winter man or some thing casual. He said same here. During another conversation he said please let me know if these comments make you feel uncomfortable because I don‚Äôt want to do that and will stop making them if that‚Äôs the case. I said well, I do like knowing that you have interest in me that way. The following day, in the morning, I said that I was still in bed and he said why don‚Äôt I join you there and we both skip work like that idea. I did say that it sounded like a nice idea. That was pretty much the text exchange. I felt turned on in the moment, but very uncomfortable later in the day and tense and anxious and not great for a couple of days afterwards. The conversations that we had following that exchange were more brief and awkward. I was contemplating just sending him a text letting him know that I felt uncomfortable and that I wanted to not text in that way now. Then I could see how he responded and how I felt afterwards. My friend called and I talked to her, and she pushed me to break things off with him. The text was as follows ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôve been feeling sort of anxious and tense over the past couple of days. I think it‚Äôs because I went along with some of the sexual comments, but we‚Äôve not yet met or had a phone call, and I don‚Äôt expect I‚Äôm the only woman being texted. Basically, I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I want to be married, and I want to be dating someone who is a potential future spouse, and is viewing me as a potential future spouse. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening here. Basically, I would just like to call it on this texting thing. I‚Äôve enjoyed talking to you though, and I wish you all the best.‚Äù To which he said ‚Äúok, I understand. Good luck:) and thanks for being upfront and letting me know‚Äù. Then I said ‚Äúthanks :)‚Äù, and he said ‚Äú:)‚Äù. It has been more painful than I anticipated not receiving his texts. More painful than some actual breakups that were in person. I feel now that I could have just gone with my original plan of telling him how I felt, and maybe also, that I wanted a call, which I probably could have done sooner, but didn‚Äôt want to push. I really miss talking to him and wish that I had not sent a text that was so final. Wondering if I can get some input on the situation from a broader range of folks. He does seem like someone I could be compatible with energetically and based on photos, I think there would be chemistry. A lot of people are not meeting up right now because the omicron numbers are so high, and he expressed he has not been going out. He is 30, and I am 33.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sammhs/regretting_a_breaking_it_off_text/

I've been busy with nursing school for the past couple of years and have really just been focusing on studies and my friends for the duration of college. Now that I'm seeing friends getting engaged and entering long-term relationships, I've realized that that's something I want. 

Honestly, I just need advice. How do I start dating? I've tried dating apps throughout college but I haven't been fond of it because you really only swipe based off of looks, and I prefer to get to know someone thoroughly before making a decision. I do like the idea of meeting people through mutual friends, but I will be honest and say that I don't have many friends, and the friends that I do have are mostly friends with girls. 

I've also realized that I don't know *how* to date, either. Of course I can go off of relationships that I've seen from friends or in movies, but it's different when it's you. I don't really know when the right time to have a first kiss or first sexual experience is, nor do I know when to call someone a ""boyfriend.""

45,samw70,1642918362,I'm lost,"I thought we'd be forever. I really did. We dated for 3 years, knew eachother for 4 and helped eachother through so many hard times in our lives. We shared great times and cried through others, and in doing so I thought we forged a bond unbreakable. It turns out all it took was one bad person at the wrong time.

Maybe I exaggerate, it was a number of things compounding to create the perfect storm, and now I'm stuck facing the fruits of my mistakes. I lost her trust by reacting poorly to her sorrows, I lost her commitment when I questioned her devotion, then all it took was some awful person to come in and swoop her away in the end. No matter how she denies it, that's how I see it. Now she goes to him with her problems, her challenges, her joys in life, and I'm left in the dust to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart.

I don't know how to move forward. I drink to feel normal again, but its not enough. She left a void in me I don't know if I can ever fill again even with alcohol, and maybe that's for the best. She's got her person to move on with, no matter how she denies it, and I have no one. 

I feel like I failed her, but most importantly I feel like I failed myself. Like there is no happiness to be had in the world anymore. I try to convince myself its not true but my heart does not listen. I must keep moving forward though. As much as I hate it, life keeps moving and I cannot stop it. I wish I could. But I cannot.

next time was my senior year of college. we were once again friends enough before i asked her out. i set up a surprise picnic at the park near my house, we talked for hours‚Ä¶that night i text her that i had a great time and i looked forward to getting to know her better, presumptuous much?‚Ä¶she‚Äôs very into her studies and i guilt tripped her into studying with me when she prefers studying alone, i tried not to but somehow couldn‚Äôt help it‚Ä¶i would compliment her frequently, she had low self esteem and i thought i could boost it‚Ä¶i would tell her how much i liked her and it wasn‚Äôt true, i wanted to make her feel good‚Ä¶for her bday i got her loose tea inspired by her favorite movie and a tea infuser inspired by her favorite show, we hadn‚Äôt defined the relationship‚Ä¶all we ever really did was watch this one anime in my room and awkwardly cuddle‚Ä¶i also feel like i neglected my friends a little bit‚Ä¶we eventually put an end to whatever it was after winter break

I (F26) went out recently with this guy (M28) on a first date. We met on hinge, and had been texting for like 2 weeks. We went out to a bar for a first date and ended up staying for a few rounds of drinks, convo was flowing. When he walked me home, I asked if he wanted to come upstairs. I didn‚Äôt necessarily have anything sexual in mind, it just seemed like the right thing to say? One thing lead to another and we started making out. It was super late at this point so he asked to sleepover. We hooked up again in the morning after waking up, before both getting dressed and leaving for work. He said he would text. I felt good about it the first day after, it was fun and I haven‚Äôt slept with anyone in so long. But now, it‚Äôs been a full day and I‚Äôve heard nothing. I don‚Äôt usually sleep with people after the first date but honestly the 3 times I have- we ended up dating so I think the rule is kinda bs; it depends on the person. Could I text him first?

66,sap0tj,1642926554,"I am tired of torturing myself trying to find one girl to date. I feel helpless at this point. Before I give up, I'd like to see if anyone has any advice for me.","I'm 25 years old. I've never had a girlfriend, I've never been on a date, I've never gotten laid, I've never kissed or have been anywhere close to a woman before. In high school, whenever I'd develop a new crush, either she had a boyfriend, didn't reciprocate my feelings, or there were a million other guys after her and I'd always lose the battle to some other guy. In college, I tried going on Tinder and using other dating apps, but they were ultimately a waste of time. I wasted about 4 years on apps and didn't land a single date. Hardly any matches, I'd just get ignored and randomly ghosted. I'd go out to bars and try to talk to women but usually got shot down right away. My friends would always get all the girls without having to lift a finger and I'd be left on the sidelines. I tried talking to a few girls from my college classes about things like homework, school, professors, etc. but they seemed uncomfortable that I was talking to them, and I could tell they just wanted to get away from me. After I graduated I successfully met a few women, but I always ended up friendzoned right away while I got to hear all about the guys they were **actually** interested in. Recently, I was talking to a girl and everything was going well. She'd tell me that she always thought about me, that she cared deeply for me, and that I was always in her heart. When I opened up about my feelings...she told me that she had a boyfriend. She never mentioned him once. At that point I lost all hope in ever finding a girlfriend.

Every girl I talk to these days either isn't attracted to me, sees me as just a friend, has a boyfriend, has a million other guys after her, or all of the above. It's so demoralizing watching some guy get unlimited and unconditional love and sexual attention from girls when I've been struggling with that very thing my whole life. I'm not even a bad looking guy. Maybe my worst physical flaw is that my face isn't the most chiseled or masculine looking but I'm in good shape and I don't even consider myself ugly. I've had girls tell me that I'm attractive and some even used the word ""hot"". People tell me that I'm kind and understanding and have a good heart. I don't come out guns blazing telling girls that I want to fuck them right away or some kind of creepy shit, I just try to be normal and be myself, I try to genuinely get to know them. I'm not saying that this means I'm owed attention from women but I don't want people to assume that I'm just some creepy bastard who lacks all forms of social skills. I feel that there's some deeper reason as to why I'm just not getting any attention from women...but I don't know what it is.

I've pretty much surrendered and accepted that I'll never find a relationship for the remainder of my life. Everybody around me is getting married and having kids, I'm still here without having been on a single date. Soon everybody my age will be married and settled down, and then I'll be too old to date and it will all be over.

I'm tired of torturing myself with unreciprocated feelings and unrequited loves. I hate that I've been programmed to naturally desire a relationship but never being able to find one. I always wanted to get married and settle down with someone, but I'm ready to give up completely on that whole idea. It just seems like a fantasy, a pipe dream at this point. But before I give up entirely, I just want to know if anyone has any advice on what I should do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sap0tj/i_am_tired_of_torturing_myself_trying_to_find_one/

75,saqcwc,1642932062,What could I have done wrongly?,"I (16M) have known I girl (16F) for around 4 months, she was the one who sent me first. Two weeks pass after we talk every day and I ask her out. She says yes we go out and the date went well. 2 weeks later I hang out with her and her friends and nothing pretty much happened between us. The next day, schools started and our free time got reduced as you can imagine.

We were still chatting quite regularly and we hang out again with her friends after a month. (I should mention that before we hang out I had asked her twice out and she had some excuses not to go). Anyway, after that hang out I realise that I might be friendzoned. I sent her a message the following week telling her to tell me when she is available to go out because I wanted to say something to her in person. After that message she kept initiating conversation but never told me to hang out and she also said that lately she doesn't have time for anything other than school. I should also mention that she told to a mutual friend of ours that I wanted to tell her something in person and that friend even asked me about it.

A month later we chat and I asked her about what she did today and she told me she hang out that day. I then text her this message: ""instead of: I don't have time for anything other than school you could have told me: I don't have time for you"". The conversation we had pretty much didn't lead anywhere and it was something like a misunderstanding though I managed with the use of humor to make the situation more chilled so it would be considered as a fight.

A few days later I wish her happy birthday and we had a small talk. A few more days go by and she wishes me merry Christmas again leading to a small talk. We didn't talk for more than a week after that and that's where I decided that I had to figure things out. I sent her a voice message where I told her that I was kinda confused about what our relationship is like and I wanted to make sure we are on the same page

We have quite a conversation there and the main point is that she told me that she didn't have energy or time for anything more that friendly. I told her that we should find a field where our wants are aligned and that just friends isn't in that field. She then told me: So, I have to do something that I don't want, or cut off with you?
I reply with: same goes for me. It was kinda late when we had this convo and she told me that she had to to to bed. I told her: ok gn but we have to sort this out later. She replied: I know. Two weeks have passed including by birthday and i haven't received a text. I was thinking of sending her as I thought about it and staying friends wasn't that bad of an option for me after all but I didn't want to be the one to reach out once again, as I would be seen as needy if I wasn't already perceived like that.

I wonder what I did wrong about this. There are also some random things to mention here. She has really strict parents, she is pansexual and on the first hangout she told me she was more attracted to girls, the mutual friend I mentioned above told me that when he asked her if I had a chance she said:""he is handsome, plays 5 musical instruments and 3 sports. What do you think ?"" Anyway that's all I have to say.

So what should I do? Should I give it some time and then tell her if she wants to have a relationship with me she will have to choose. Cuz I don‚Äôt want to be a fucking alternative or come in her way and act needy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sas6wv/what_should_i_do_now/

87,sasgl2,1642940296,Do Gen Z girls have an internalized purity-complex?,"I was having this conversation with a few of my female friends. Someone came up with the theory of society causing girls to feel like they should only do sexual stuff after 18, rather than when they feel ready. In my opinion it's very harmful, especially for children who grew up in a household that was less than ideal. Girls feeling like they should be this angelic, innocent type of angel instead of human-- it completely dehumanizes them.I think guys experience this too, but the other way around.

92,sasw9e,1642941894,Do I as a man really have to approach girls ?,Hi guys and ladies what I mean by this is do we really have to approach girls. For example when I am at a night club I was getting numbers here and there or when I was on the street approaching I a was getting some numbers but the girls always play games and at the end they aren‚Äôt really interested. They do it because of the attention and validation. What I have noticed at a night club if a girl really likes she will come to you start dancing with etc‚Ä¶ Otherwise most of the time you will just get played. I had girls coming to me and those girls in fact were easy to date because they actually Liked me. If I approach at the club the chances are she will give you the number just so you can fuck off then dance and leave with the guy she actually likes then she will either never reply to you block you or just reply and always telling you maybe when you ask her out. Which basically means yea if I am really bored and the guys that I actually LIKE aren‚Äôt available I may go out with you. Does anyone agree? I have been out and about and that‚Äôs my experience. I am 21 btw. Share your thoughts and let me know what do you think. Again that‚Äôs personally how I am finding it to be and in my opinion this the reality I don‚Äôt mean to discourage anyone or being negative motherfucka.

97,sati02,1642944021,Is it worth pursuing?,"I got really close to a guy who was part of my friend group. We‚Äôd talk nearly every day, we‚Äôre each others no.1 best friend on Snapchat (how much we interacted) and he suggested getting food at night and would hang out afterwards so I think he was interested. A close mutual friend, his best friend would tease me about liking him even though I‚Äôd never hinted or mentioned it and say things like ‚Äúyou make it so obvious you just want the pics from our night out to have a photo of [guy]‚Äù and asked me if I‚Äôd consider anything. So I guess he was gauging if I was interested for the guy?


One night we were drinking and we moved out to the smoking area outside with some friends and there were no seats so he insisted I sit on his lap instead of stand and this surprised me as he isn‚Äôt a very forward person or hadn‚Äôt flirted before but maybe the drinking gave him more confidence. I did and he sort of put his hand on my waist and nothing really happened. He invited me to the football with his best friend and his new girlfriend under the excuse that ‚Äúshe‚Äôd only go with another girl there‚Äù


Anyway, covid got worse and I had to move back home and sort of lost touch because I picked up a job and had study.

However I reconnected with everyone around Christmas time and found out my guy friend had just broken up with a girl he had dated for a month and had strong feelings for, I told him it was ok if he wanted to discuss it and vent as he was still a good friend and we stayed up until the early hours of the morning discussing it and reassuring him. 

She sounded really toxic and like she had major mental health issues, yelling at him him for making jokes and abusing him if he made a mistake and his friends if they called anything out then threatening to harm herself and abusing him when he got security involved. Yikes. He went to visit her the second night we were talking and she threw him out because one of her ex friends and the guys cousin contacted him about her and she saw the message. He said she was really pretty and he felt like she was out of his league and lucky and realised that was shallow and was glad she was moving back overseas.

Things started getting better and we were starting to become good friends again and he‚Äôd send me a funny snap each day or make contact every afternoon. He started to bring her up less . **I wasn‚Äôt trying to be predatory and get onto him now that he was single again and vulnerable just was happy to have my friend back**.


But 3 weeks later, yesterday I noticed (I‚Äôm not a stalker I was bored and was looking at maps to see where people were in our break) and noticed he was at her place out of town and it hurt. He was there the next morning so had stayed the night and then went to a nice cafe for breakfast and back to hers before work in the evening. He was there the next day. I don‚Äôt normally stalk friend but this was all I could think about and I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from checking. I don‚Äôt know if they were catching up before she moved back overseas or reconnected but I felt sad and angry that he promised his closest friends who were abused by her he wouldn‚Äôt go back and who told him she said to another mutual she was cheating on him and just used him as a fwb when I think she was insecure and he was the only one to indulge and put up with her.



Anyway, how do I handle this? Do I cut him off and just be friendly but not a friend irl? Or do I forgive him and will he ever show interest in me again or should I give up on him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sati02/is_it_worth_pursuing/
98,satlnj,1642944351,Dating apps are complete and utter garbage,"So I decided to give Tinder a try, since I was 21 and have never been on a single date, I needed help with my profile, so I got a female friend from nursing school to help me with it. In the past, she was a yearbook photographer and still does freelance work part-time along with her part-time job so I paid her for a pack of good quality photos. For some context, I'm fat, plain-looking, I have clear skin, and I have brown hair, hazel eyes, and I dress nicely I got on and started swiping for a while. But I only got 4 matches in a month, 2 were bots, one was a prostitute, and only one was a girl willing to meet me, but she never turned up to our date. 

I didn't give up and kept going for another 2 months with the same result, but my self-esteem was getting affected so I stopped. I decided to give up dating women, and that I would just focus on my studies, and doing hobbies I enjoy. Classes in person started back up recently, and I was speaking to the female friend I mentioned earlier, and she asked me how it went, and I simply said not well. Somehow, I ended up asking her out, and she said yes, I made it perfectly clear it was a date as well, and we are going out tonight. She texted me this morning saying she is excited for our date, and I'm going in a few hours, I'm taking her to the aquarium because we both like sea life. 

The point is if you're an average/ugly guy dating apps are complete garbage, and they will not work for you the only way to get a date on a dating app is being a 10/10 6'2 ripped model. Go off your phones, and meet women in the real world, join a club for a hobby you're interested in, or a cause you're passionate about. Ask any female friends if their friends are single, or ask your mates GF if any of her friends are single, go to church and meet a nice lady there, whatever you want. But dating apps are where a man's confidence goes to die",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/satlnj/dating_apps_are_complete_and_utter_garbage/
