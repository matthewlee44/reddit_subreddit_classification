This happend to me in the past and I thought that it was because I weight more than the usual person at that age. The past couple of months I have been working on that and lost quite some weight because of it. I felt proud and thought that any insecurity's would have flown away.

Last week I went out to a nightclub after a long time because of COVID. The same thing happend again and it's bugging me ever since. I try to think about what is holding me back but I can't think of anything.

Well we never met in person so back then we had to Skype each other. Play the movie at the same time and settle up with out pop corn and snacks. A concept that is archaic these days but cute if I’m being honest. 

I think that life is about time. How we spend it and taking the opportunity to spend it how we please. There were plenty of times where we’d sit there and be really excited about this movie and everything had to be perfect so we’d count down on 3 and press play. Sometimes freaking out about every half second we were ahead because it did not line up with our perfect date. This was a whole life to me. I lived it and it was perfect. 

Recently I’ve been told abt how as people we go through 5 personality changes in our life but I feel like that’s not inherently true. I mean it only makes sense as a trauma response and even then. No, I think that was one of the five lives I was meant to live. Coming to a terrifying home and finding a way to peel back the terror with someone in an equally terrifying home far away. After all that we healed or started to heal causing us to live our next life. It reminds me about a Grimm story about how humans got to live so long. Basically stating that all the other animals only wanted a small life but humans got greedy.

My next life was still hectic but getting put together still. I hadn’t healed so much as wanted to heal. I wanted to heal so bad that I never got around to it. It was like watching a train get derailed in slow motion or like a car wreck. That life ended with everything crashing and colliding together. Not knowing how to handle everything was the direct factor in mishandling everything. 

Now I’m in my fourth life. I don’t know what to do with it and I don’t know how to describe it. I feel like I learned a lot this life. I feel like it’s coming to an end and I feel like I’m not ready for the fifth.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,886237,public,self,I’ve been thinking about our movie nights,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogjgu7/ive_been_thinking_about_our_movie_nights/,all_ads,6,,,,

So the thing is I like a girl but I'm hesitating to tell her. It's not like I have been completely shy, I mean I can converse well with everyone around me, including her but a lot of thoughts go in my mind, like what if she has a bf or what if she says she wishes to remain single etc.

In my past I had approached two girls (both of them during different phases of my life, first one during my 8th grade and the second girl after I finished my high school) and I was cheated by both of them because I was naive and very young to exactly know how to date someone.

I'm 25 today and I haven't yet properly dated any one. This has been shattering my self confidence and has made me really hesitant to approach someone I like.

I've been talking to a guy casually for a few weeks now but not super actively as I've been pretty busy and tired when I get home. He's seemed like a decent guy through our minimal contact. The other week he said he was at a local hangout and I told him that sounded fun and he said I should join him and his friends. I turned it down because I was already home doing stuff but I liked the confidence!!

I remember from his profile that he was a divorced dad with adult children that liked going to his cabin every weekend. 

*Red flag number 1*:. I don't have time during the week and he doesn't have time during the weekend.  This doesn't look like it will work. But lest I persisted. Haha

So he did ask me out again but on a normal date and to a fairly nice restaurant that I liked and I accepted. 

I texted him that I was leaving work 30 mins before our date and that I was on my way. No response. Well, I wasn't going to show up to the restaurant since he went silent. 

*Red flag number 2*

But it's close to my house so I pull in a near by parking lot and answer emails. Then I get a text that he got us a table. Oh ok. I tell him I'm almost there and I drive to the restaurant and park. 

Seems nice enough. But honestly I forgot to check his name on the app before walking into the restaurant and I'm starting to think I didn't even vet this man and I can't even remember his name. Like wtf am I doing. I'm being dumb. 

We say hi and stuff and something about alcohol reminds him of the joe Rogan podcast and he tells me about it. 

*Red flag number 3* more times than not they are going to be a libertarian. And I realize I didn't even ask that basic question before hand. I always ask it. 

Conversation is descent. I talk to strangers for a living so I'm always fine in that department. He's a bit more socially akward and fidgety. He might even be in the spectrum. But that's fine, none of that bothers me. Then mask talk comes up and guess what guys?! Of course he's a libertarian. 

*Red flag number 4*: That's a huge deal breaker for me. 

He's not a horrible person though so it's not like I get up and leave lol. I can still enjoy my dinner and company. I don't even disagree with many of their beliefs but they always just end up being this certain type of guy. 

The discussion is a little political but nothing crazy in my eyes. There are a few times a say ""I get what you're saying but I don't think it's always that simple"" I might have given an example or two. I'm not even aggressive or confrontational or argumentative. It actually seemed like a normal, healthy conversation but I could tell that he was getting a bit frustrated because I was challenging his thoughts. Because he would give up his point in the middle of making it. I wasn't even interrupting him either I actually was interested in his point of view. 

*Red flag number 5*: he doesn't seem to like woman challenging his point of view. 

So the check comes and he lets it sit there for a few seconds. As he is reaching for his wallet I ask if he wants to split it and he said that would be perfect in a really irritated voice. 

*Red flag number 6*: he asked me out, he picked the restaurant. I'm sorry did his mama not raise him right. You don't only pay for a date if you like someone... You pay for it because you asked them ou. There isn't conditions with dating. You ask someone to dinner your treat them. My whole family is that way. My dad will invite the fam out to dinner (extended family and everything) and he picks up the entire tab. If I ask my friends or a date out I pick up the tab. 

But then he gets up and just leaves. He left me at the table as I was putting my card away and gathering my belongings. He was out of the restaurant before I even had a chance to get up lol. 

Before I got to the car he had already unmatched me. Which honestly; all of that is ok. I'm really just mad at myself. I didn't screen this dude at all and this is the result. I wasted an evening and $45 for this. I never do this. I normally don't waste my time because I would have asked all these pressing questions before the date. At least when I typically screen my dates better, the worst I've experienced is no spark but still a super fun evening. 


So moral of the story. 

1) vet/screen before the date. Don't waste time on a date to feel their vibe. Ask all the pressing questions first then go out to see if the chemistry matches the compatibility. 

2) have standards/deal breakers. Stick to them. I never would have dated this guy knowing these things. Yet the consensus on these advice subs to women tend to be ""give the guy a chance before jumping to conclusions"". No thank you. I know exactly how this would turn out and it turned out exactly as I predicted if I knew these things about him. 

3) trust your gut. I was so close to bailing. Deep down inside I didn't want to go on this date. I was tired from work and I knew I didn't invest much into screening him before. I was thinking... What the hell, why not. I thought it was weird that he didn't text back to let me know he was on his way too and I almost drove home because of it and I should have.

I matched with a guy a week ago on Hinge, we had good conversation and great banter. He sounded really genuine and seemed very interested, I expressed the same. He was everything I’ve been waiting for whilst mindlessly scrolling the dating apps these past months – funny, good looking, has a great career and very sincere. We seemed to have a lot in common, we shared some private things that I literally have never talked about when I match guys on apps. I’d say we sent each other 5-10 long messages each a day, so have gotten to know each other. He even said that he's never been so excited about anyone in awhile.

So here's where it goes downhill.... the night before yesterday, shit hit the fan with my work and we were struggling to resolve a conflict up until now. I had to work overtime almost 14 hours total each day, physically and emotionally exhausted after work, I passed out in bed and didn’t bother checking or replying to messages. I was basically on autopilot robot mode, my phone battery has never been more full these past 2 days. 

Well, work finally slowed now as we have things under control and suddenly I realized I never replied to his last message, which was the day before. So I open my Hinge app, and of course, our chat is no longer there, which means he unmatched me. He clearly must’ve thought I was ghosting him or lost interest, when I am actually head over heels over this guy. From what I know, seems there’s no way to re-match and he won’t show up ever on my deck again :( I'm feeling terrible and I know my emotions may be overblown considering I haven't even met him in real life but... still sucks.

Key take-aways so you don’t experience my mistake, on either end:

* Always send a quick message if you’re going to be away, don’t assume the other person will be there waiting for you no matter how great the chemistry is (\*tears\*)
* Don’t unmatch people for “ghosting” you, you’ll never know why they’re not reaching out to you – it could be an emergency or yeah simply they just don’t like you, but no harm of keeping the chat open
* Don’t let work get in the way of your personal life and happiness (not really dating advice, life advice)

We exchange a bunch of messages, she asked me some questions that I answered, I asked some questions to and tried to move forward a conversations, but it still look like a question/answer exercise so far.  


Even  am 30 years old, I haven't experience on dating, or online dating, so I am not sure what I should do to keep her interested and move forward.  


Even I don't even know if it will be the case, I am under the impression It would be more natural and easier if we were speaking in front of each other in person, but I am not sure I should ask on on a date, after exchanging message in a 3-4 hours period. On top of that, she wrote on her dating profile that she is looking for someone who is ready to follow her rhythm (in a way of not going too fast).  


Is that a normal situation, and have you an idea of a way I can launch a discussion without been trapped in a series of questions and answers?  


Should it be a good idea sharing this directly with her and be 100% honest? Telling her that I am really fond of her so far, that I am looking forward continue to learn more about her, but even if we don't know each other a lot, it would be nice to meet? Is this too soon?  
Thank you very much for your help. I try to go with confidence and don't doubt about myself, but at the same time, I don't want to screw it and keep the chance to interact with her in a smooth way to really see if a relationship can be build on.

In the beginning, we were only looking for something casual but our relationship eventually became a lot more than that. I had developed feelings for her, and she knew about them. She told me that she felt very similarly about me but was afraid of commitment due to bad experiences in the past and enjoyed her independence too much to enter a relationship, but within a few weeks,  we were basically in a relationship just without the title. Understandably, that's when things got too serious for her and she couldn't keep going, but she felt that we couldn't keep things casual and that we would just end up there again, so we broke things off. I wasn't too hurt about it but I just could not stop thinking about her, I felt like she was the right one at the wrong time. I tried my best to move on and even talked to and went on dates with a couple of other girls but I just didn't get that same feeling of connection I had with her. About 3 weeks after she and I stopped talking my friend convinced me to text her. The idea was that I was never going to see her again unless I took that risk and let her know how I felt. Maybe I could get her to reconsider or at the very least get closure. So I did, I texted her. And you know what she tells me? That she had started dating a friend from high school and that things were going well for them. That was the LAST thing either of us expected to hear. This was far worse than if she had just not responded or said she didn't feel that way about me because this means everything about our ""relationship"" was a lie. The reasons she claimed she couldn't date me were fundamental issues that don't just change overnight. She also told me that she wasn't talking to any other guys and wasn't looking for anyone else at the time either. But the idea that only a couple of weeks after she and I stopped talking she changed her mind about everything and started dating some friend from her high school is ridiculous. That doesn't just happen. She had to have been lying about literally everything. About what she was looking for, about her commitment and independency issues, how she really felt about me, etc. She should really take up acting because she sure had me convinced. I am far angrier about the situation than I am heartbroken. I didn't respond so I didn't get any explanation from her, but my theory is that she just didn't want to hurt my feelings. Every time a girl does this they end up hurting the guy's feelings even more than if they would have been honest and upfront in the first place. Two months after my ex and I had started dating she lost feelings, but instead of coming to me and saying ""Hey, I'm so sorry I'm realizing that I wasn't really ready for a relationship and I just don't feel the same way anymore,"" she dragged it on until our relationship fell apart and I simply couldn't handle it anymore. Had she been honest with me it would have hurt, but far less than what I actually experienced. I'm sick and tired of putting my heart out there and getting hurt.

Because recently the idea of dating and relationships just seems hard, too much work and too much time for very minimal payoff and I sometimes wonder why anyone would ever want to be in one if they’re so much work.

I sometimes like the idea of a relationship but that’s where fictional characters come in, embarrassingly enough but for me it’s easier than finding someone in the real world. 

Im also a complete virgin, never had sex, never kissed anyone and never held hands which is….. ok. I plan to keep it that way because I feel like they should be reserved for someone I care about but I dunno… the entire idea of it all is just starting to wear me down.

Met her on bumble about a year ago at the start of the pandemic in the spring. We talked a bunch and went on a few outside dates and were super compatible. Started dating in September after she moved back to college making us closer in terms of distance and made it official end of October. We were dating pretty seriously and met each other’s families. During this time I was finishing pharmacy school and was doing 40 hours of rotations a week plus working another 30ish operating cnc machines in the evenings. In January I started supporting myself financially by playing poker once casinos opened up. I was getting exhausted with my work schedule and only could see her after I was done work at 10 pm or weekends. Poker allowed me to make my own schedule and I was very successful making around 18k in 2.5 months. I did not tell her about this at first because I wasn’t pursing it as a career but rather as a short term gig until graduating in a few months. However she was aware from early on that I enjoyed playing poker so it’s not like this was completely new information. So she confronted me about it eventually in late January after noticing my snap location a few times. I explained everything and although she wasn’t thrilled with it I think she tried to understand that it wasn’t straight up gambling and it was ok for a while. 

Breakup: One weekend early March I decided to make a trip down to Atlantic City rather than my usual Cardroom. On the drive back next morning I was rather sleep deprived and ended up getting in an accident by nodding off a second and swerving into the median. Car needed some work but I was fine although that seemed to be the final straw for her. The following week she tried an intervention on me telling me I needed to see this therapist and I needed to stop. I was pretty ticked off by how the therapist had made a diagnosis and recommendations without ever speaking to me first. I was willing to compromise by cutting down the amount of hours I was playing but I wasn’t willing to stop completely. We said our goodbyes through tears and that was the last time we saw each other. I reached out a few more times often while a bit drunk but stopped around early May. 

After about two months of no contact she reached out to me this week. I’m on vacation for the week so wasn’t thrilled to have to think about this all week. We have one phone call and have been texting. Tells me she misses me and asks if we can be friends. I say ok but am pretty hesitant bc why now if nothing has really changed in terms of why we broke up. I expressed my general hesitancy, say it will be hard to be just friends, and asked about her expectations. She says can we not put a label on anything whether it’s friends or something else. She just can’t be putting labels on things atm. All she knows is that she misses me. But doesn’t want to think about the future rn. She also asks to meet up at this point which I agree to and we also agreed that we are not having sex. However I feel like it is inevitable especially if we continue to meet up.

The reason I picked that timeframe is because there’s a video game tournament happening in the first 2 days of October that I will be competing in, so qualifying and practicing for that will take up a lot of my time. Also, by then, anything that makes me childish like watching age-inappropriate shows such as Spongebob will (hopefully) be faded out. I will also hopefully have a permanent job by then (I am currently a summer intern but I could potentially be on for the long haul later) and move out of my parents’ house (when I can afford to). I’m also hoping to adopt a more optimistic personality and maybe work out a bit harder. All of these things (and did I mention I’m 6’3”?) should give me an advantage in online dating, and dating in general, but I still have my fears and they are real and scary.

Firstly, I’m afraid of being hurt again. Let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way first. I’ve had crushes before. We all have. But there was one person that I shared something really intimate with. We lived out a lot of fantasies through text, and it made me develop a really close emotional attachment to her despite us never meeting in person because of COVID and distance. But then, she got herself a boyfriend, who she met while we were still talking. I reestablished contact with her again a little while after that, and she also started giving me some mixed signals like wishing she was with me, calling me cute, etc.. I tried being friends with her, but I couldn’t do it, especially when she still allowed the text roleplaying with me even though she had a boyfriend. The feelings didn’t last long on her end and she knew that what she was doing was wrong. It ultimately did not end well and I’m still healing from the hurt, and it’s been 3 months. I’ve deleted everything about her and blocked her on everything but not a day goes by where I don’t think about conversations that we had, sexual or otherwise. I really don’t want a repeat to happen and I’m scared that it will.

Second, extending on this, I don’t know if I will ever share the level of intimacy that I shared with my ex-crush with someone else. I know that I have to move on, but I have developed a bit of resentment towards her. I don’t think she had any bad intentions but I do believe that she shouldn’t have done what she did.

Thirdly, online dating is expensive. I don’t care which dating app you use, Match, Tinder, Bumble, PoF, they’re all going to charge you Premium just to use basic features. Why do I have to pay a monthly fee for something that is supposed to help me find love? I hate that the companies behind these apps are basically exploiting a basic human need for money. It’s almost evil in a sense.

Fourth, online dating in general has been, for me, a miserable experience. I tried online dating in the fall of 2020, which was not a smart decision on my part as the pandemic was at its worst. I got few matches and when I did get matches, they sometimes turned out to be scammers and they end up ghosting you. Also, pretty much every match I got wasn’t exactly the most physically attractive. I’m also autistic even though I’m really good at hiding the fact that I am. I’m basically trying to become as normal as possible and then maybe disclose that information. But I can also do things that some autistic people can’t, such as driving and holding down a job.

Fifth, I’m scared of taking advantage of someone whose love I don’t reciprocate, just so I won’t be lonely. Sometimes I don’t feel all that comfortable in my own skin and this often results in desperation to be with someone. But I’m not making that mistake again.

Well, that ended up not being as long as I thought. But these are the reasons that I’m really scared to date again, even though I do (or will) have things that do give me an advantage. Can anyone else relate to this, and if so, how do you suggest I overcome my fears?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,886541,public,self,The thought of trying online dating again TERRIFIES me.

[This post follows on from an incident yesterday - see link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ofxcne/sent_screenshot_to_my_date/h4fvkhk/?context=3)

Basically, I've been on 2 dates with this girl that I have been set up with through a mutual friend.

Date 1 was great, we agreed to see each other again, and we marked Sunday evening to see each other. We had some drinks, then agreed to grab a bite as we both were having a great time, held hands on our walk back, and just had an overall nice time. When i texted her the day after the date, she offered to meet up early in the week, or otherwise tell me asap if she can do Sunday because her parents/brother were visiting. I usually see this as a bad sign, but in any case, she messaged me the next night and offered Tuesday/Wednesday as she was having her parents over.

Date 2 was set in stone for Wednesday night. We had a 2 hour dinner, and at the end, I invited her to come hang out with me and my puppy on the weekend. She immediately said yes and would message me to organise when. I then jokingly mentioned how an idiot friend mentioned a theory about how when girls say 'I'll let you know' they never do - she laughed and said I should tell him he's an idiot, and she re-confirmed she would message me to organise.

Now in between date 2 and right now, the incident above happened. I sent her a screenshot of our conversation, which was intended for our mutual friend who wanted an update. The screenshot had nothing that would be deemed private. She doesn't text a lot, is very short/forward with everything, so our messages were just setting up logistics / saying we had a good time on the date. Nothing else.

She ended up replying to my message with a **crying/laughing emoji** and said '**its ok**'. I didn't reply as I have previously initiated conversation and whilst she reciprocates, she clearly is not a big texter (our mutual friend confirmed this too). She's very brief with her responses, takes hours, and we haven't texted a whole lot between dates, just because I don't want to come off as over the top.

It is currently Friday afternoon, and I have yet to hear from her about the weekend. I obviously know her plans for the weekend, and she knows mine. I'm a bit of a planner, and like to organise. I guess not hearing from her is giving me slight anxiety (which I know is my problem). Our mutual friend has given me the advice that I am overthinking every single detail and trying to plan this out, and just need to chill.

So my question now is, should I still be waiting for her to message me about this weekend? Or should I reach out myself if she doesn't message me by tomorrow (Saturday). Its currently Friday afternoon just after lunch, and I know she's got plans with work colleagues tonight (same as me), so I sorta dont want to ruin the vibe, but also feel like finalising our plans would be nice?

I guess if she doesn't message, I'll know. If I message and ask, her response or lack of may also answer my question.

Here’s my situation; I dated this guy a few years ago, we didn’t work out cause I was suspicious of him messing with his ex. I was correct. 

Fast forward to sometime last year, we started speaking again and began to be fwb. I called him out on his actions. He took full responsibility, apologized, and asked me if I could start looking into us moving past that and me forgiving him to see if we could be serious. I told him it would take some time, but that I would try. I also informed him that I would continue to date as I saw fit, and that I didn’t trust him yet. A few months ago he got drunk and told me he loved me. We discussed it later when he was sober and he stuck by what he said. He also said 


Here’s where I’m struggling. I don’t feel as if there’s any intimacy in this situation. There’s no romance as far as I’m concerned, and it doesn’t feel as if we’re dating. It literally still feels as if we’re fwb and we just spend more time together. I don’t feel like I’m a woman he loves or wants to actually invest in a future with.

At first I had no interest in her but she apparently had a crush on me after our very first conversation that lasted after a few hours. We started slowly talking more and more and more and about a month in I started to fantasize about being in a relationship with her. 

Once our friendship started to heat up she started saying “I love you to me” in a jokey flirty way… and sometimes I would say it back in a similar tone but most of the time I would laugh and just ignore it. Eventually it got to the point where she was saying it kind of serious and I wanted to say it back but was simultaneously trying to subconsciously not be in a relationship because I was scared (separate issue), and also nervous about telling her my true feelings. But eventually about 5 days ago I did tell her about my true feelings. I developed an interest in her romantically, and she reciprocated it. She said “I love you” and I said it back but I had a bit of doubt of how i loved her. As a person? A friend? In love? The next night I asked her what she means when she tells me this and she told me she just loved me as a person. But over the next few days of us talking more our feelings for each other strongly intensified. 2 nights ago we confessed to each other how strong those feelings were. The problem for me is… I genuinely don’t know if I meant it in a romantic way. But in the moment I definitely believe I did.

Usually people describe romantic love as getting butterflies and stuff.. or things like “commitment”. I have never had butterflies while thinking of her. I’ve never had those moments while talking to her that make me go “Wow” or anything. I just love talking to her because we fit so well together. I am a huge overthinker and she is crazy smart and thankfully not an overthinker so we balance each other out. I love her presence, and I deeply care for her. She is so patient and understanding with me when I explain to her my anxiousness about our relationship (I have terrible relationship anxiety and terrible anxiety in general)… Yet every time the “I love you” thing gets brought up I say it… and mean it… but I don’t know in what way. But I know the way she interprets it, and I feel like I can’t explain this to her because I don’t even know how to interpret it. 

Last night towards the end of us talking for about 6 hours straight.. the last 60 seconds on the phone call I had the weirdest thought that just popped into my brain and said “you don’t love her as much as you think you”. I immediately felt a hot flash and was sweating and could feel the anxiety coming on. I hung up on her and just kept telling myself to sleep it off. I woke up this morning with the same thought intruding into my brain and eventually I calmed myself down after a couple hours. But I was so scared. I want to love her romantically so bad but I feel like there’s something in me that won’t stop doubting it or just won’t let me and i don’t know why. I don’t know what to do and I’m so confused. Is it because it’s long distance? I haven’t FaceTimed her yet… could that help? What am I doing wrong? Are my expectations wrong? Should I even be concerned over this? 

TLDR: I think I love a girl romantically but I don’t get any emotion or butterflies when I think of her and my doubts of me not loving her in that way can feel just as real as me actually loving her.

If you want to be successful in getting women, hooking up, ect... do not give in to them, they thirst for attention, so if all single men around the world started to not pay attention to women, im telling you now women would be so frustrated to the point that they'd do anything to get a man's attention... Hell. even pay maybe. So yeah If all men started to ignore women I'm telling you that you'd get more women. And then when you'd decide to let them meet up with you... don't be too easy, make it a challenge for them cus that's what they do to us men right now and most of the time we get rejected... especially men that don't know how to properly flirt. If you do that strategy, even you guys that can't flirt for shit can get girls, because they would become desperate for both attention and sex. so if the tables turned, the women would finally chase after us instead of us after them.

I offered to pick her up from her apt which she said would be great. After picking her up I took her to a open mic night where we spent about 2.5 hours there eating and drinking as well. We sat 1st row got picked on a little by the comedians but she was laughing a ton and seemed to have a good time. Afterwards we walked up the street to another bar where we spent another 1.5 hours. All night she was super chatty and would grab my arm/knee, sit in close and other subtle signs talking our compatible zodiac signs and other stuff we both like.

I drove her back to her place at the end of the night where some people were outside in the car next to us so I gave her a hug in my car and we talked for a bit and as the people walked away I gave her a final hug while trying to kiss her she kind of turned and I just caught her cheek.

While leaving she told me to text her when I got home. She then texted me like a half hour afterwards ""thank you for tonight, I had a great time :) i'll see you soon!!! goodnight"". I later responded anytime, I really enjoy spending time in your company. And next time we have to checkout a certain movie we both want to see and she hearted my message and responded forsure :)

Date experience is outlined below. Not sure what to do from here, do I message her again? Plan a second date? Wait for her to text me? I got home a few hours ago and haven't heard anything even though I told her to text me so i know she got home safe.

Experience:

I've been talking to a single mother on a certain dating app for the past week. She's a bit older than me (35) and has two kids. We'd have conversations throughout today, although if i'm being cynical it was mostly her just messaging me ""hey what are you doing"" every couple of hours and then that mini conversation dying out because i was too busy or there was not much to talk about. but she seemed interesting so anyway, asked her out and turned out tonight was her only free night this week. appreciated her making time for me on short notice.

i venmo'd her some money so she could take the subway out to my part of the city. it was pouring so i picked her up. didn't really know where to take her and she was nice enough to say she's fine with anything, so we went to a white castle and got a crave case. i had a few burgers and we talked. mostly about what we wanted from a relationship and i think we were on the same page. i can't tell if it was the excitement of it all but i dont know what else we spoke about. idk if it is awkward to ask a girl her birthday, last name, and all that other identity information if it's a first date.

anyway we drove around my hood for an hour and listened to music. it was nice to have company. i'm trying to be more accepting and thoughtful but she was also on her phone most of the time and would delay in responding to questions i asked because she was texting. idk if that's a red flag or something i should ask about and maybe she can improve on? maybe it's too much to improve on?

i ended up dropping her off at some hotel she said has a shuttle she can catch to get back home so i gave her some cash for that. i probably pussied out on hugging her so we shook hands and that was that. been home a few hours now and i'm absolutely thrilled to have met a woman who is interested in me. i dont want to come across as too desperate or i'd have shot her a text by now but i figure if i dont hear from her by tomorrow i will call her",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,886668,public,self,"Had my first date today, how to follow up?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogocx7/had_my_first_date_today_how_to_follow_up/,all_ads,6,,,,

We have already been on 2 dates and I am wondering how into me he is. I think both of us are new to dating because on our first date (lunch) there were moments when we both didn't know what to talk about. He asked me out on a second date via text after the first date and we went to the movies night before last. I had a really good time and we hung out by my car joking for about 30 minutes. We made plans to hang out at his place when he gets back from his trip.

But idk how into me he really is because I tried to flirt with him and he doesn't flirt back. Like he didn't make a move at the theater (maybe he couldn't because the chairs were the reclining kind so it would be awkward to maneuver?) and just said he loved me hair and offered a hug as we were saying goodbye (we did a handshake on the first date lol)

Tonight I sent 2 flirty messages but he didn't flirt back. The first one he mentioned that one day he might take me on one of his trips up North and I said that be nice we could find a romantic spot with a winky face. He just said we could crash at his friend's place. Later he sent me a picture of him on a train and it really was a very handsome pic of him and I told him that with a winky face and he just said it was old and not really into it. He didn't try to flirt back.

Idk im feeling kinda down and wondering if I'm pushing it or if he is losing interest. The last guy I talked to we got really into dirty talk for 2 weeks and planned to have sex but then I chickened out about not wanting to get a hotel room and he got mad etc so that it was awkward afterwards and he asked me to be his girlfriend but the next day he said he was drunk when he said that. We slowly stopped talking afterwards.

So I didn't want to mess up a possible relationship with this guy and I really like him because he's sweet and adorable and chill and we have similar goals in life. Therefore, I haven't said anything sexual and 90% of our conversations are about our pets. He sends me pics of his Yorkies.

It's been about 17 months since it ended, and I have been single in all that time. I did get exactly one date, but the girl ghosted me afterwards. Now, Im not exactly the textbook definition of boyfriend material. 

Im under the average male height in the US at just 5'7"", Im overweight at 175lbs, I have a sunken sternum, Im on the autism spectrum, I have severely low vitamin D and b12 that leaves me constantly tired, Im just not that handsome, and I have no interesting qualities or hobbies. 

Ive been trying online dating for over a year now and that one date has been all that's come out of it. Nowadays the rare occasions I do get matches are just because the girl wants to sell her premium snap. I know I should just delete the dating apps cause Im just one of many guys who end up in the trash bin, but I dont have any way to meet girls in person. 

I dont go to college, all the girls my age I work with have boyfriends, my only hobbies in life are listening to a cappella music, watching Marvel movies/shows, and playing a very narrow selection of video games. I don't have any interests that align with public gatherings where I could meet people, and I have terrible social anxiety so sitting at a coffee shop and striking up conversations is off the table. 

In these 17 months, I have heard many different ways of saying ""you're cool, just not boyfriend cool."" Most notably, an old coworker told me that I was ""adorable in the same way a kitten is adorable."" 

One of my new coworkers said that ""we dont have any attractive guys here"" during a conversation we were having. She then realized what she actually said and apologized to me. 

I will note that there has been exactly one girl who's shown genuine romantic attraction towards me, but quite simply I just wasnt attracted to her, neither physically nor emotionally.

i (26f) have decided to call it quits with my bf (37m) after 6 &amp; a half mostly miserable years together.

the decision to do so came to me in less than a day.

i sat on the phone with my best friend &amp; cried about how miserable i am with him. how terribly he makes me feel. how unwanted &amp; worthless he makes me feel.

i told her how i, a female that’s almost 27 years old, am losing my hair because of the unnecessary stress he’s caused me over the years. i’m losing CLUMPS of hair every time i brush it. i lose multiple strands when i simply run my fingers through it.

it used to take me an hour &amp; a half to straighten my beautiful thick hair. now? 20 fucking minutes.

i saw my scalp while i was casually looking in the mirror the other day. once i saw it, i cried. cried like i had just lost a child.

when everything looked disgusting in my eyes, my hair was the only thing that made me feel even an ounce of beauty.

now i’m losing a lot of it &amp; it’s been hell trying to wrap my head around all of it.

but now i’ve decided that it’s time for me to stand up for me.

it’s time for me to choose my own happiness &amp; choose me for once.

*no more worrying if i’ll say the wrong thing &amp; upset him.*

*no more walking on eggshells.*

*no more avoiding addressing issues for fear of him blowing up.*

*no more fake apologies.*

*no more wondering if he broke another promise.*

*no more begging him to be an actual boyfriend.*

*no more crying myself to sleep wondering what i did to deserve this.*

*no more wondering if he’s going to keep his word today.*

*no more repeatedly broken promises*

*no more accepting his gaslighting &amp; abuse.*

*no more wasting my time.*

after allowing depression to take a strong hold on me for years, i’ve finally mustered up the courage to go to the doctor &amp; address the hair loss.

i deserve love.

i deserve happiness.

&amp; most importantly, i deserve the right to choose who i want to be happy with.

But no. This post simply talks about being in a relationship, some ""tips"" I hope can help, and my opinions on relationships as far as I can tell. (Cause I've never actually been in one before lol)
To start, it's obvious relationships are no easy task. Especially as a teenager. Most of the time you and your significant other are being what I like to call, ""hormone bashed"". This can make it hard to cooperate in most relationship situations, such as decisions. Now, already I hear some of you saying, ""If you've never been in a relationship before, why are you acting like you know so much about them?"" Well, to be honest, I don't know much about them. This is simply just speculation based off of relationships I have witnessed around me (I've witnessed more than I think I should).
Second, why is it so hard to find someone? For most people, they date around until they find someone they wish to settle down with. But if you're like me, you DON'T want to date around. Now, I'm not saying I don't want to meet woman, cause yeah, I totally do (lol). But what I'm saying is I don't want to officially be with someone unless I know they're the one. Some of you are probably thinking ""so, you wanna screw a bunch of women until you feel satisfied with one to call a girlfriend?"" Well, no. I don't even want to get touchy feely in any way until I know this person. Not like, ""what's your name?"" And ""What's your favorite color?"" But a majority of the details like, ""what do you prefer to do on your free time?"" And ""How do you normally dress on a daily basis?"" The last one may sound odd, but there is a good explanation. 
Most women now a days are... Eh... Very showing (which can lead to trust issues)... And in a day and age were we use technology to communicate most of the time, it's guaranteed that most people hook up on the internet. Especially with Covid still lingering around. Some of you are probably asking, ""what's wrong with revealing women? They're hot!"" Now, I'm not saying they aren't pleasing to look at, what I'm saying is most of the time, they aren't dating material... Most women would probably be outraged by that type of comment, saying things like, ""How does how I dress affect my dating skills??"" Well, while most women won't admit it, they dress like that because they don't have any other ""skills"" besides there body. So to make up for this lack in ""skills"", they show lots of skin in hopes of becoming a dude magnet. And of course, it works. Why wouldn't it? Most dudes, especially teens, are horny as hell and will f*ck anything that moves. And most of the time, those dude's they get with, are also not dating material. Which should be no surprise... So by knowing most of the details about someone, it allows you to determine who they truly are as a person and can help you avoid people like this. Of course, you would also trade off things about yourself, It'd just be weird to ask someone most of everything about them and NOT tell them anything about yourself.
 And third, trust. In a relationship, you and your partner are equal. So it's important that you know them, and they know you. No hiding anything serious about yourself from them (and vice versa, if they hide something from you, that means they don't truly see you as who you are claiming to be OR they're scared to lose you. Which is good, that means they like you). In a relationship, the old phrase "" treat someone like you would want to be treated"", is more important than ever. You should always treat your partner with absolute respect and love. Doing violent things and cheating, is some of the worst things to happen in a relationship. Doing everything I've said so far should be a damn good way to avoid it. (I hope, I haven't gotten to try it myself)

With all of that being said, I hope I helped some of you a bit, even with being as un-experienced as I am, and hope I got to talk a little about who I am and who I'd prefer. For all of you currently in a relationship, I wish you luck on your magical love life (lol that actually sounds really cringey XD)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,886900,public,self,Relationships...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogqm9g/relationships/,all_ads,6,,,,

The ""How could I have not seen this  coming?"" ""How Could I have let this person do this to me?"" All of these  posts have one thing in common. It's people who think that there is some  magic bullet that if they had known sooner, would have stopped them  from being vulnerable to abuse and manipulation. And this is the part  that might sound depressing, But there is no magic bullet. EVERYBODY is  vulnerable to manipulation. While some people (Specifically people who  were raised in good homes and have very little trauma to cope with) may  be more resistant to falling into an abusive relationship. It is  IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to be immune from it.

I  will provide a link in the comments(Dating doesnt let me put links in  the post for some reason) to a website that lists alot of the different  forms of manipulation, and their names. This is really important because  while you may instinctual know that something being done to you is  wrong. But without a name added to it as validation, most people will  doubt themselves wither or not they \*should\* have felt like they were  being manipulated. When there is a actual name added to it, you can gain  the confidence to know that the reason it feels wrong is because it IS  wrong! I know it helped me tons when dealing with manipulative people.

HOWEVER........ more bad news

Even  with knowing all the offical names of manipulations you will still not  be immune from it. And this is because of a certain quark of people who  are predators. These people have more or less spent their entire LIFE  literally obsessing over how to manipulate people. Which means by the  time you are in your late 20's, you are facing off against someone who  has been practicing how to manipulate you for nearly 2 decades. Ask  yourself if you would feel bad if you were to get into a competition  with someone with 2 decades more experience than you and then you lost?  Maybe a tinge of sadness yeah, but then you tell yourself it just makes  sense. However when most people are manipulated by someone who has been  practicing the art for decades they will often degrade themselves, tell  themselves they should have been \*better\* or \*smarter\*. They don't often  realize that them being victimized was not a reflection of their own  competence, but a reflection of just how good some people are at  manipulation. (i will provide a link in the comments to a video of the  interrogation of a serial killer, the video shows how easily the  sociopath controls the conversation. And while it might seem obvious to  you when watching the video, to the people who were there, they didn't  realize it was happening until they later reviewed the tapes and  realized just how much the sociopath controlled the situation and these  are people who are literally TRAINED to spot it.)

This  might come across as a weird mental health post in a dating subreddit,  but my heart aches whenever I see someone degrade themselves as if them  being victimized was their fault. Cause while yes, there are things you  can do to help you spot it and pick up on it to protect yourself. No one  will ever be immune. And if you then proceed through your life being  paranoid about figuring out how to spot these people before they can do  damage, you will only make yourself more vulnerable to it.

I  suppose my real point is to stay safe, do research on how to spot toxic  people and be proactive about your own mental health. But realize that  if in the future you are taken advantage of, its not because there was  magic tactic you should have known, its because we live in a world that  only cares about who survives, not what they did to survive. You being  cheated on wasent because you are lesser, it because the cheater was a  predator who knew how to target you. You being abused wasent because you  deserved it, it was because the abuser was a predator who knew how to  make you feel like you deserved it. And honestly the best tool you can  have to combat them is self love. Because the more you respect yourself,  set solid boundaries and take care of yourself, the more resistant you  will become to manipulation. But it will never be foolproof, and there  will always be someone who knows exactly how to get to you. It's kinda  like the idea of being struck by lightening. Yes it can happen, yes  there are things you can do to mitigate the damage, but no amount of  obsession over preventing it can truly protect you if a freak accident  occurs. So it's best to give up on the idea that you have total control  over it. And instead just concentrate oh the things you can control.

Stupid question I know but thought I’d try anyway. 

About three years ago I developed intense feelings for a truly wonderful man I worked closely with. It grew over the course of a year or so and it took me by surprise when my fondness and admiration one day became something like love. 

In my mind, at the time, the connection we had was off the charts, the “chemistry” between us was palpable and electric (at least I thought) in a way I’ve never ever felt before or since. We had so much in common it was at times eerie. Like “soul mates” if I believed in them (I don’t). But it felt like a meeting of minds and I thought there was a mutual intensity and attraction . 

But I was mistaken. I built it all up in my head apparently. It was all professional and he didn’t love me and was in fact even in a relationship. I had misinterpreted everything. 

I can’t get over him though. I feel embarrassed, humiliated, rejected, and like I’m not good enough for him (I’m not truthfully, as he has been much more successful and distinguished and he is quite a bit older than me). I feel a deep sense of loss and heartbreak too even three years later. I still work with him a bit though less than before and things are good. We get along great but it’s not like before or how I thought it was before. I always leave netting him happy and admiring him but also very embarrassed and rejected. luckily he
Handled all of it very well and didnt make a big deal of it. And luckily I never made things too awkward or *explicitly* addressed my feelings but he got the hint and made it clear I had misinterpreted him and he feels nothing close to that way towards me. 

I know he’s not perfect and there will be others and I’m focusing on myself as much as I can. It’s going fine and I know should be happy with my successes in work and progress in other areas but he’s still all I want and I still cry (including as I write this). I have finally made good friends , and I tried dating and meeting people but so far I’ve had so many things that go no where and a great difficulty feeling attracted physically or emotionally to anyone for long. I’m afraid I can’t/won’t love anyone. Maybe I’m too picky but I’d much rather be alone than with any of the men I’ve tried dating. 

I know there probably is nothing that will help much, and that this is as common as it gets and not anything special. Im just amazed at how humiliating and how much it hurts way, despite rationally knowing it doesn’t really mean anything about me. Still it feels like it means I’m just not as attractive or good or loveable enough. I only care what he thinks. Nothing else matters much  (in terms of how much I *feel* about myself or life in general ) as irrational and pointless as that is,",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,886952,public,self,"How do I (24, f) manage the pain romantic rejection?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogr805/how_do_i_24_f_manage_the_pain_romantic_rejection/,all_ads,6,,,,

I'm pissed that he gave me no communication and dumped me so coldly, and is still asking me to do things for him. The audacity of it all makes me sick.

We had been talking online for a few weeks and then recently met irl. Turns out I don't like his overall vibe. I could tell he meant well but he was kind of mean in a way that his few jokes were all kind of making fun of me. He kept on focussing on doing things in 'the right order' which ruined the mood imo, and he would grab me by the shoulder to move me to the side if someone wanted to walk past us or if there was traffic coming our way. I'm a grown adult, I can move by myself, don't just grab me ffs. I didn't feel a connection at all but I told myself to at least try and have fun. 

However, he is now already planning a followup date and acting like he's my boyfriend.

In the last month he’s hit a deep depression. He broke up with me last week saying he doesn’t know what he wants and needs to figure himself out and then wanted me back again after realising he still wants me. (Also keep in mind I’m one of the only girls who have met his family which is a maaaaassive thing for both him and his family) However, he said he doesn’t want to put a label on things simply bc he is depressed and doesn’t want to be fucking me around. I really love this man and he feels the same. I’ve asked him if it would be easier if I took myself out of the equation so he can work on what he wants and himself but he disagreed and said that would make things worse. He said he doesn’t feel good when I’m not around and loves having me around and that I’m everything he wants in a woman and can see a future but said he just wants to see how things go for now as he doesn’t know how long he will feel depressed for. The question I’m asking is should I keep doing what we are doing and have fun and be there for him while he works on himself? I do admit I have been quite pushing with the whole “label” thing. And I can be quite needy which I am working on. I just need some advice (please be kind I really want to work it out with him) thanks",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,887016,public,self,Guy I’m dating is confused,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogs16r/guy_im_dating_is_confused/,all_ads,6,,,,
