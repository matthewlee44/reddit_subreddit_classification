1,s1noey,1641935385,What do he want thoooo!!?,"Ok so I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible. Anyway, a couple of months ago I (20F) match with this guy (22M) on a dating app. Immediately hit it off and text/snapchat everyday for about a week until we meet up and it’s great honestly. We keep talking after that- everyday for another couple of weeks and I tried to hangout again. But, he seemed back and fourth about making plans. Anyway, then he texts me saying that he’s having a tough time with his mental health and that’s it 100% on him and nothing I did and that he just needs to focus on getting himself better. I don’t think he was lying because he seems like a good guy and I know he struggles and whatnot-as I do too. He also had just gotten out of a long relationship over the summer. 

Since then, we’ve still been snap chatting every single day, just not texting. I’ll occasionally send him something through text though and he’ll always answer. Also he’s started responding to my Snapchat’s very frequently now and even sent a casual shirtless pic in the mirror which he’d never done before. I asked him if we’d ever hang and he said yeah. 

Basically need advice on what this mans could possibly want. I’m going to try to make plans I think and see if it actually happens… but like… is he into me if he’s still talking to me? Personally, if I wasn’t into someone I would’ve stopped talking to them. I would not have even tried to “be nice” by continuing to talk to them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1noey/what_do_he_want_thoooo/
2,s1nsed,1641935637,Texting,"Hey guys recently I met a girl on Tinder in fact I matched with her on Bumble as well I got her phone number and Snapchat. Sometimes we had deep conversations others not so much. Sometimes she was reaching out first and when she did I was at the gym I like keeping fit so I asked her to send me a picture so I can get motivated and get a better pump btw I asked for normal pics not nudes or any of this. She did send a pic in fact she did multiple times when I was lifting. She even send voice recordings so I could hear her voice. We agreed to a date but unfortunately she got COVID and it didn’t take place. One day she reached out first and we started texting. I was at the gym and asked playfully for a picture as usual. To which she replied 
Her: I could but maybe not today I am sorry. You can always ask someone else
Me: No worries no need to apologize I am not gonna lie I will probably ask but they will never be as good (I was just kidding)
Her: ahaha they probably will be you can ask them from now on too 
Me: that’s a bummer 
Her: not really 
Me: How come 
Her: cause I said 
Me: fair enough 
Her: yep
I stopped bothering her of course but this really fucked me up. I don’t know how I messed up and why she did this. She hasn’t blocked me on anything and she is still watching my stories which doesn’t mean anything.

3,s1nv0b,1641935827,How do I stop caring what he thinks?,"Recently ended a situationship with a guy. We were exclusively seeing each other, but didn't make it to labels. It didn't end well with me asking if it was truly over, him insisting we can only be friends and maybe more down the line if he ""gets over it"". When I told him I couldn't be friends, he was extremely short with me and made it very clear that he didn't care whether we were friends or not. He ended up getting irritated, being callous and hanging up on me. I followed up with a text right away and apologized, told him I'd leave him be and wished him the best. He responded soon after and wished me the same. The following day, he sent me a text saying he didn't like how our last convo ended(well duh, you hung up on me), how sometimes we both say things we don't mean, sucks we can't be friends, he'll always be there down the line and wishing me the best once more. For the first time in my life, I didn't respond impulsively. I sat on the text (which irritated me a lot because it wasn't an apology) and ultimately decided not to respond and deleted the message and his number. It's been exactly one week and I think of that message every single day. I flip flop between things I wished I said and called him out on, letting him know that maybe we CAN be friends or just letting things go. If I call him out, it won't achieve much, I don't think he'll care. Letting him know maybe we can be friends is giving myself false hope and setting myself up for further hurt. Letting things go is probably the best option, but I cannot get over how stupid I feel over being so vulnerable and him thinking I can't be friends cause ""my feelings are too strong"". Also, not responding to the text felt like a permanent close on this chapter which is the right move, but I don't know if I'm ready... How do I stop caring what he thinks? I don't even know what I want at this point. I want him to come back and ask for another chance(which won't happen), but I also want to knock him down a peg or two and let him know that he owes ME an apology for how he treated me throughout our situationship.

First of all I dont know if this was actually grooming or what since I was not under 18. Basically I was dating this guy last year when I was 22 and he was 48. I don't even really know how I got into this situation but fuck it messed me up. He lived with his dad and I had my own apartment so he was constantly showing up and spending the night even when I told him I didn't want him too. He was controlling, for example he only wanted me to wear short sundresses when he came over. We had sex every single time he came over AT LEAST once, I couldn't say no because he wouldn't stop his advances and leave me alone untill I had sex with him. Somtimes I would wake up in the morning and he was eating me out or fingering me to wake me up which I did not consent to. I feel taken advantage of because I was all alone in a city across the country from my family and he knew I was lonely. He also prayed on the fact that I have mental illnesses and would tell me that he is the only one who understands how I feel and that I'd never find anyone else to be with. I spent months with this man and one morning after he spent the night I flipped out and started screaming at him to leave my apartment and never come back and that I never want to see him again. He kept trying to contact me and coming to my door untill I told him I would call the police. There is more to the story just creepy things he would say and how he acted. I didn't realize how much this relationship affected me up untill a few months and im having horrible anxiety about it and im just super stressed and can't stop feeling gross and thinking about it. I havent been in any sort of relationship since and haven't even gone on any dates. I just want to stop thinking about this and feeling gross. I know people are horrible abusive relationships so im feeling guilty about even being effected by this situation that I put myself in.

Then a couple of days after he messaged me to tell me he had covid. I asked a follow up question and he didn't even open my message. He kept looking at my stories on instagram and updating his twitter; just not answering or interacting with me like at all. I asked him if he was okay a couple days after. No response. A couple of days more go by so I text him asking if maybe he'd just rather not talk to me at all. No answer.

I'm a very sensitive person, and I was very confused. I was thinking, if I were in his shoes I'd probably have fired a text or two to explain that I didn't want communication rather than leave a person completely dry. But that's me.

Today I called him and asked him if everything's okay. He said, yes, he's fine, but he's been very sick and my text to him made me out to be a victim and he didn't feel like explaining. He's feeling better now, but he doesn't like sensitive people because we're too dramatic so it's not going to work between the two of us.

13,s1p5pr,1641939101,What else can one do?,"This is going to be a long post, thank you in advance for going through it. I am just venting here, I am sort of seeking not just dating advice, but also life advice.

Background

\- I am 30 year old, successful professional with a stable career. I am highly educated, make decent money, and live comfortably. I have no baggage emotional or mental whatsoever. I have loving parents and siblings, we were poor growing up but that is not a problem anymore. I live alone in the US and my family lives in another country, so I live a pretty chill life. My whole life I have been focusing on my studies and career and as a result, never really dated, with the pandemic, dating became even harder. I have never been the hook-up type, I can't be physical unless I am dating the girl. At age 29, I had dated just one girl during my bachelor's, we were friends for years but dated for like 2 months only. I was content being single at this point, meaning, I was never lonely, I have good, time-tested friends who had proved that they would take a bullet for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Girl 1

This girl came into my life in 2021. In my mind, I had simple criteria, I want a girl who is kind at heart and ambitious about her career.  Since I was 29, I was clear to her, I am dating with the intent to marry and no games. She was pure of heart and ambitious about her career and met my criteria. I dated her for 4 months, always paid for all our dates, brought her expensive gifts (spent like $5000 on her in 4 months), helped her with her homework, and basically everything as in my mind she was already my wife. I didn't know that my inexperience with dating was biting me in the ass. Though she had a kind heart, she grew up in toxicity unimaginable to me. It had affected her so much that she couldn't really differentiate between what's toxic and what's not. One month into the relationship, just after I had spent 4 hours doing her homework for her since she was sick, she lies to me that she is pregnant just to check my reaction. She used to live with her parents, she would make me pay for her family's grocery too, and when I asked for payment, she lashed out at me and started comparing me to her father and ex and how they would never care about such money matters. I am 29, so I didn't go to parties and drink, I am staying in or getting lost in the wild type of guy, but she would always go for parties all night and come to me in the morning for help taking care of her. This kept happening repeatedly and in month 4 of our relationship, she would spend all her time with her friends and family, while I help her with homework and exams. We stopped going for dates and whenever I asked to see her, she would basically verbally abuse me, calling me needy, selfish, jerk, obnoxious. Eventually, my patience evaporated, and I took a stand, and she unwilling to change her ways, we had to break up. 

Throughout the relationship, even while breaking up, I never said one negative remark. She never knew this but I kind of have my 5 commandments of relationship - unconditional love and care, always be available, blind faith,  never be egoistic, no mind games. However, she repeatedly said hurtful words and crossed all limits while breaking up, toxicity to its fullest. This made me regret my decision of not lashing out but now I just think I did the right thing. In the short term, yes, it hurt me more but I can take it. She on the other hand, with all the toxic family and friends drama and all kinds of mental issues, would have been seriously hurt if I had spoken up. 

Girl 2

I started dating her as she met my initial criteria and my new criteria of no toxicity and baggage. We used to go on affordable dates as she was unemployed and initially liked to pay for herself. However, somehow I started paying for all our dates in this case as well. This girl had a unique problem of her own. It had been 3 years since she graduated, she needed a job and but had only interviewed twice since graduation. From a professional perspective, she was sort of immature and naive. She had no idea what sort of job she wanted to do, had no skills and her resume was total garbage. As a result, I ended up helping her with proper career counseling, resume writing, job searching as a whole. However, eventually, this girl became lazy and started taking me for granted. She would basically ask me to do everything for her, modify resumes, apply for jobs. When I tried to talk about this total disregard of my time and effort, she broke up with me. Saying I was expecting too much of her. Thinking this girl had no respect for the effort and energy I was putting into this relationship, I thought that breaking up was the best thing to do as well. We only dated for like 45 days.

Hey,

So I just want to know if there is something wrong with me lol:

There is this guy that showed interest in me and we chatted (I know him in reallife but he slided in my dms on instagram) he was not really my type but seemed chill so I gave him a chance but I have this wired thing where I stalk tf out of any guy I talk to because I don't want to waste my time.

So I went on his instagram and scrolled through his followings (yes, creepy behaviour sorry) and I discorvered that he followed like 4 ,,Instagram cosplay'' girls that posted over sexual (is this even a word) pictures and I immediately was turned offfff because 3 of the 4 girls looked nothing like me?

they had big boobs and I dont know maybe I was insecure? But normally Im confident and like the way I look... Something similar happend with 2 other guys (one followed a facebook page named ,,big boobs'' ??? like whyyy

So I just don't know if I get insecure because I dont look like these woman they followed/liked and also always get compliments on my ,,angel face'' (eye rolling) and maybe I wonder why they dont compliment me on my body? but also I wouldnt feel confortable if one did so lmao what is wrong with me? also maybe I get turned off by the stupidity that they dont try to hide these things lol

18,s1pidl,1641939972,"Are Hinge, Match, Coffee Meets Bagel, &amp; Facebook Dating the only dating apps where you don’t have to pay to see who likes you? Or are there others?","There are supposedly free versions of pretty much every dating app out there. In my (24M) experience, however, I have had to pay for pretty much all of them. However, this urge to pay may have stemmed from desperation to be in a relationship with somebody, and I guess I figured that if I pay, it will get me into a relationship sooner. I know now that this is not the case, but before I completely accepted the idea of “You have to pay for every dating app you use,” I decided to give a few apps a chance to prove me wrong or right. These are all apps I had downloaded or used previously. Specifically, I brought back Tinder, Bumble, OkCupid, Match, Coffee Meets Bagel, &amp; Hinge. I did previously download the last one, but I didn’t really use it because I was afraid of not getting likes on it, which was the problem I had with every other dating app. I think I swiped on maybe one profile and then I immediately deleted it. That’s how early I chickened out.

Even though I brought these apps back, I didn’t actually do any swiping on any of them. My profile is still muted on all of them. In a dating app, there are some basic features that, in my opinion, I should not have to pay for. I should be able to swipe on profiles, see who likes me, and send as many messages to them as I want, all without paying a single cent. It would also be cool if I could see profiles who swiped left on me, so I can forget about them and know that they are not interested instead of being kept waiting, but no dating app that I know of does that.

On Tinder, Bumble, &amp; OkCupid, I had to pay to see who likes me (if there is anyone). AFAIK you didn’t have to pay to message anyone. I did recently try Bumble again a few months ago with little luck, and when my premium period expired (it was only for one month), I suddenly got 6 likes. Before I was getting no likes at all, so unless they were bots, there was no way that I was getting likes as soon as my premium period ended; that would have been too coincidental. I think they were just trying to prey on my wallet. The same thing went for OkCupid.

However, Hinge, Match, &amp; Coffee Meets Bagel did not show me any message that says “Upgrade to premium to see who likes you.” It also did not pixelate anyone to tease me with likes that don’t even exist. However, Hinge did say to upgrade to access all my likes AT ONCE. Idk what that means but I’m guessing that if I use the free version of Hinge I can see who likes me, but in a rotation form? If I can still see who likes me in a less convenient way that will let me keep my money, then that’s fine.

When and if I choose to get back into them, I want to spend zero dollars and zero cents on dating apps because I have to use my money for rent, food, and other things. As soon as I give dating apps money, finding a girlfriend becomes a business transaction that will only become more expensive the more time I spend searching.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1pidl/are_hinge_match_coffee_meets_bagel_facebook/

21,s1pptb,1641940470,I don't know how to interpret his reaction to my teasing,"My male friend (24) has been dodging me (24) lately, which I assume was a natural reaction to the fact the it felt awkward between us after I've confessed my feelings for him.

I confronted him for acting distant in the last trimester and his reply seemed quite confusing to me: He said that He wants to keep me around and values our friendship a lot, but in the same text He also asked ""which kind of friendship could we have?"" and ""what could we share given the fact that we can't meet so often?"" (we now live 300 km apart and we could meet whenever He is around in the region to visit his family). 
I believe those questions were just rethorical. However, adding to the fact that in the past I had innocently stated that I wasn't looking for a relationship with anyone anytime soon, they raised the suspicious that He was fishing for a FWB.

In the last 3 months He didn't arrange anything in order to meet up with me although He visited his family quite often. I knew He needed space and I didn't want to act clingy and confront him again, but I threw in a teasing question ""are you afraid that I would come on to you if we meet in person?"". I wanted to test his reaction... 

Obviously, He ignored the teasing and replied only to the rest of the message (He's very shy and prude by the way).
However, to my surprise, in his last text He suggested that we might catch up in the next few weeks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1pptb/i_dont_know_how_to_interpret_his_reaction_to_my/
22,s1pq54,1641940496,Protecting yourself while dating someone going through a divorce.,"I’ve been with my partner for a year. His ex has been dragging out their divorce for near 4 years. She lives in another country and refuses to agree to any type of division of assets because she is asking for insane amounts of money. No exaggeration here. 

He admitted when we got together that he let it drag out for too long because he was tired of fighting but since we met has been wanting to finalize things so we can move forward. 

It is clear his ex is spiteful. I am wondering what I need to do to protect myself. We clearly can’t make any large purchases together such as a home. Is it safe to move in together?

26,s1pzhq,1641941173,My boyfriend got caught,"I’ll admit, I flipped completely out. I haven’t in a really long time but I instantly got upset.

I, 22 female and my boyfriend, 21 male have recently celebrated our 3 year anniversary. Today we were talking on FaceTime. He wanted to do a nice gesture and I accepted. Usually I never let him buy me things because we are both struggling college students. He insisted and I said yes. Because of the pandemic, we couldn’t shop together in person, so he went on to a well known website and used screen share to show me some of the things he wanted to get me. He had me pick 6 items and he put them into the shopping cart. 

I asked him what made him decide to want to buy nice things for me suddenly because it was out of the ordinary. He wanted to show me an outfit that he saw an old friend from high school wearing and how he found the site. I told him to hold on a second so I can see if I have any coupons for the website since I use it pretty often. He went onto her story and a video of his old high school friend twerking popped up. I clicked back onto screen share and saw it. Okay fine, that wasn’t the problem. I am very secure in my body and relationship and wasn’t too worried. He just simply let it play. I’m pretty sure he didn’t know that I even clicked back on to screen share. I asked what he was doing and he clicked off it really fast, almost as if I startled him. I instantly got upset because of him trying to hide the fact that he did it. 

This is something that we have discussed before and we both agreed we would like to keep our social medias as clean as possible to avoid situations like this. Having a healthy relationship and making sure we are both comfortable is top priority. He says that he didn’t know the girl would post things like that and I believe him. The issue from my point of view is the lying about actually watching the video. If he had told the truth and apologized then I wouldn’t have been upset, but lying about it is where I draw the line. I admit, I did yell. Nothing I said was something I would regret later, but our communication was scrambled in that moment. I feel horrible for yelling because my anger issues is something I have tried working on. 

I also felt upset because throughout our relationship, I have never put myself in a position to jeopardize our relationship and make him feel insecure. In fact, I reassure him on a daily basis that I don’t look at anyone else’s body in a sexual manner and he is the person I want a future with. 

He’s actually an amazing guy. He’s never cheated and he’s always been good to me. Once in awhile he will do something stupid lie about it. Somehow it only gets under my skin this badly when it involves another girl. Yes I’ll admit, I’m the jealous type sometimes. 

Now my mind is running. Im definitely an over-thinker. I don’t know if I overreacted. I don’t know if I should just end things or talk it out. I don’t know why he would even try to hide the fact he was watching it instead of just apologizing and moving on.

28,s1qb3q,1641942025,What's it like to be with someone? Worth it?,"This is just out of curiousity:

I'm M22 living in a very isolated part of Norfolk. I've only been able to see a good friend on average once every 3 months after moving when I was 5 away from best friends and struggling to find new ones here, so i've fallen behind but eventually adapted to look after myself. I work and from the first lockdown, I started restoring antique cast iron cisterns etc. Also being active on a small community too. Really enjoy it. Unfortunately after a year they've all suddenly stopped coming up for sale for a good 2 months and i've not been in great spirits since and overthinking.

So i've been looking back, found these threads &amp; I remember I lusted to have a girlfriend to look cool at school as that was how it worked. When I left in 2015. I remember a pic of someone came up who caught my eye. Before I knew it, I wanted to be a better person, change things and I found myself doing new things I enjoyed. Had no idea how. If I thought of her during anything challenging, I'd feel at peace. I told her how I felt and we were both messaging every now and then afterwards. If she messaged me or replied to one from earlier if I felt down. It would literally leave me and I get with a beautiful peaceful feeling. I wanted to see her again in person but it never happened. Still had depression etc &amp; the worst social skills due to the events od moving away from my friends years ago so I soon told her I didn't want her to continue to deal with my problems. That was it. 

Beyond that, i've not felt anything like that since. I'd like to know someone like her again but I also have not really had any real sexual attraction, preference to women or men, or expect it to happen again. Mainly the eyes &amp; vibe they have catches my attention. I've seen a few women &amp; also a few guys who've caught my eye ether in pics or in person who seem to have a similar peaceful creative nice vibe she had. I cant imagine how it would feel if I saw her in person, hung out and was talking. Let alone the feeling if me and were became properly close. 

So in short, i'm wondering if there are others out there who have felt similar and can explain what it feels like to be with someone who makes you feel at peace and gives you happiness just from knowing or being with someone who makes you feel this way. And this just more than just getting messages back from them. Like what it feels like with talking, holding hands or kissing them etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1qb3q/whats_it_like_to_be_with_someone_worth_it/

But we matched and we spoke and caught up a little but I haven't seen her since I was 14. I thought well I best just shoot my shot and I did and I've organised to take her on a date this weekend.

Common problem I have is seeming aloof but also not appear totally disinterested. I tend get feelings so in the beginning so I try to hide them the best I can.

I started talking to this girl and we really start to hit off. She was replying right way to my messages. I was doing my best to mirror her replies. She was sending pretty long messages so I was feeling pretty confident. We talked about or careers and interests etc.

When I was at work my reply times where pretty bad. My productivity is heavily monitored at work. As soon as lead comes in, I'm timed to see how soon I can contact the customer. My boss also barges into my office at random times so I'm very careful of my soundings when I text. Job can be quite hectic at times although it's a fantastic company. Anyways I'd text her and she'd reply right away and wouldn't get to it for at least an hour or 2. I told her that I was sorry and she didn't seem too bothered. We had a much when I got home I was able to reply much faster. We were able to have a decent conversation then she randomly left me on read. I assumed she was busy and I left her be.

The next day she sent me a selfi, I assumed it was a mass send so I didn't reply. I didn't feel like it wouldn't be polite either to double text her. The next day I figured I should post something interesting on my snap story. It was a video of me playing guitar from a few months ago. I had been working on the riff for quite some time. I waited unit she looked at and an additional 4 hours to text her. It's been 5 hours and she still hasn't opened it.

&amp;#x200B;

All signs point to ""marry her someday!"" But a couple yellow flags....

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Our relationship is good, tons of communication from bedroom to living room. We both ask what each other is comfy with in the relationship and answer accordingly. There is however a LOT of stress going on with my girlfriend at this point. Family stress, job stress, hormonal stress. It seems there's so much (maybe even stuff she can't tell me) that it gets in the way of her having a good time a lot of the time now, and seems to have started when we got serious. She will have periods of woe is me, and I'm there for all of them no issues with that, but there are SO MANY. Am I the problem here?

2  - Radically different parent styles. I yell, she's peaceful parent. I strive to be that, but I'm a man a rough around the edges and rule authoritatively. She is a passive parent for the most part and we've already discussed butting heads when it's time to co-parent. I think we can work this one out honestly.

3 - Two things she said that bother me in the past few weeks:

a) ""You've never seen me unmedicated and not in therapy, there's a lot going on with me""

b) ""I don't feel worthy of how good you are to me""

&amp;#x200B;

Point A, she's right. Prozac, even a low dose, can manage and numb a lot of bullshit. Also as much as I love therapy, when we've talked a lot out and things are good and our MCMI and SYMBIS comes back ready to rock and roll...why keep going? At least why keep going together?

&amp;#x200B;

Point B, I've heard this right before I'm about to get fucking dumped. In her case she's showing no other signs but that's a clear red  flag for me more than anything. So she's not worthy of me being nice, fixing things up for her, being a gentleman. I'm sorry, but I don't treat my women like shit because they have a gluttony complex.

&amp;#x200B;

So...here we are. I'm optimistic overall, the yellow flags worry me, the one red flag really bothers me.

I've heard advice to be open about not wanting these kinds of head games and valuing honesty and open communication, but really there's no way of protecting myself from it. Someone who's manipulative, which feels like 99.999% of people, could just say ""yeah I really value honesty and open communication too"", but not actually mean it. 

And don't get me started on those ""BREAK UP WITH YOUR PARTNER IF THEY DO THIS"" or ""HERE'S A PERFECT TEST TO SEE IF THEY REALLY LOVE YOU"" tabloid articles that you see everywhere. Fuck. Maybe try communicating and working through issues instead of expecting 100% perfection? (I mean, unless they're clearly abusive or manipulating, in which case yeah, run). 

But no, it seems like everyone wants an absolutely perfect partner who they never have to work things out with, never have to compromise with, where everything's pure sunshine and rainbows 100% of the time. Like if that's what you're looking for then fucking clone yourself or something. 

I've been on exactly one date in my entire life and that involved me being catfished. I've had no luck at all beyond that and I'm feeling like I shouldn't even try anymore. I feel like there's no honesty or maturity left in the world because people are addicted to shitty high school-type drama and playing head games with each other.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1tl6p/25m_as_a_neurodivergent_person_dating_feels/

We didn't really hit it off on our first chatting so communication went dark for a while as well as I kinda realized I wasn't quite in a great position and decided to focus on myself. Anyway, about a month passed and I felt ready so I messaged her and we started talking again and actually hit it off this time in my opinion.We talk every day now, and have been for a month, and we have quite a bit to talk about since we have similar interests. 

She's very independent and strikes me as antisocial. She loves spending her time alone just watching movies and reading, which is really attractive to me, I don't care for outgoing types. I have made it clear to her that I'm really attracted to her and want to pursue a relationship. She seems like a shy type and one who holds their emotions close and without having body language and such to rely on, only text I'm finding it really hard to read her. She accepts and seems flattered by my compliments but she doesn't reciprocate,  and when I try to arrange times that we pull possibly meet up for the first time She always has plans, whether that be actual obligations or time she has set aside for her personal alone time that she really likes. It's either that or she dodges the question entirely. Which makes me think if she wanted something with me or atleast was curious to see where it goes, she would make time for me, even if that was just including me in on her movie watching and relaxing at home cause we both like to do that. 

I feel like I'm being lead on,  but at the same time I feel like there might be something there and she just hasn't come out of her shell. I really want to know how she feels, I'm not expecting her to be falling for me or anything but I'd like some confirmation that I atleast have a chance. As long as I don't bring up meeting up, we text through the whole day talking about all sorts of stuff with enthusiasm. I want to just ask her how she feels about me but idk how to do it without spooking her or ruining what might be there cause as I said she's definitely a shy, antisocial type, and I know that pressuring an answer from those people can sometimes cause a flustered flight reaction rather than an answer. 

How should I proceed Reddit? Do I just not bring it up and just keep talking to her for another month or two and see what happens? Do I ask her outright how she feels? Do I tell her how I actually feel, that I need validation that my advances are what she wants?

While she was leaving, I asked her if she wants to meet up again and she said she wants to. Also told me to text her for a time.

When she got back home, she hit me with “it was great meeting you”… So I responded with a similar text.

This post isnt about me but my aunt.She is currently a mess &amp; I have no idea on what do to help her. 
Basically 4yrs ago she met a man(49 &amp; she is 50) They got along etc &amp; she helped him come to the states he wasnt from the US. She has always paid for everything even do i have told her not to. Sha has bought clothes &amp; gave him money for the plane etc. 
Last year my grandma passed away &amp; it obviously hit her hard. The man was upset saying she was always crying &amp; to get over the death of my grandma. Since covid hit he wasnt able to visit the US. Which apparently somehow it was my aunts fault (??). So he stopped talking to her making up lame excuses that his phone stopped working or he didnt have signal. She was already a mess when she needed him the most she he basically wasnt there. Then 2 months ago when he was able to come to the Stated he called her saying he wanted to come visit Her really bad &amp; if she could help him out. She paid for his ticket &amp; in reality everything else. She picked him from the airport &amp; paid for food, clothes &amp; even took a bunch of stuff she has here electronics too. My aunt talked to him about the issues she had with him &amp; she told me he would never say anything nor respond. Here are my observations tho his notifications on his phone were always hidden &amp; he had a passcode. Also, every time she took him somewhere he took pictures just by himself &amp; never mentioning or tagging my aunt. Also he got non stop snapchat msgs. Finally on the day he left she thought they were fine then 4 days later he stops responding &amp; blocks her on all social media &amp; her phone number. In reality he wanted to move in with her but she wasnt sure because she wanted to get to know him more &amp; he doesnt have any money. When he was here he expected my aunt to wash &amp; clean, cook, pay for everything. What do you all think? He basically ghosted her without a word.

In the past, they feel the need to ""live their truth"" and confess that I'm not as visually good as other women naked, but that I'm very sweet, talented, and smart after a few months. Another guy said the thought of taking off my shirt doesn't cross his mind when I asked and that he likes me for other reasons- that I'm pretty, nice, and smart, what is inside counts more, I'm more meaningful, etc. It makes me feel so undesirable and sad because I just want to have my partner want me too. I feel wanted in other ways, like they talk about a future like marriage, children, etc? It's so odd to me.

I'm a thin girl, I have small breasts/butt. I like how I look a lot and never feel like I'm lacking until I'm in the bedroom and the guy I'm seeing doesn't touch me so much or want to take off my clothes.

I hate going out to crowded places and I love spending most of my time alone. Work is all the social interaction I can handle usually. Because being single was never particularly painful for me like it seems to be for a lot of people, I just never bothered to actively try to date.

There was always something else I wanted to put my energy in instead, and I didn't know if I would want to give up my total solitude. I'm not asexual or aromantic. Both relationships and sex are definitely appealing to me. But I was always able to pour myself into work and hobbies and be entertained by that.

All that said, I turned 33 a week ago and for the first time I really sat and thought about it. Like ""oh shit, I've never kissed a woman or even held hands."" My life is pretty great as is.

I do catch her looking at me and she looks away or acts like she wasn't looking. she does hold eye contact for what I think is a long time. and she will tell me about what she's been through with life and stuff. and about her upbringing. and the kind of mom she wants to be. idk if she remembers if she tells me these things but I heard them more than once. she told me she doesn't really like small talk when it comes to dating. one time when we were working together I was thinking about her and I guess she could tell because maybe I had a certain look on my face because next time I looked at her she had the same look as I did. maybe she is manipulating me or mocking? today at work she created an opportunity to spend our lunch break together. she also told me that she had a crush on this one guy and I asked her if she ever told him about it and she said yes. so im thinking that since idk if she likes me or not that means she's not interested or else she would tell me. she also helps me when I don't ask. I told her that I think she's pretty and she said thanks and she gets that a lot. I am currently in a relationship and she knows this. she also told me that she's about to find a new job. she doesn't really ask questions about me or anything she does all the talking. even when I don't seem interested. there is touching but not flirty. no hugging or anything.

77,s1w0za,1641958005,I took a guys virginity and now he just wants to be friends.,"So I met this guy at work, he’s 23 and I’m 27. I’ve never dated anyone younger than me and was kinda hesitant. But he was super cool and I liked working with him so I got his number and we talked and he said he really liked me but was too nervous to say anything so he was glad I got his. We decided to hang out after work and he was super touchy with me. Then we kissed and he was terrible and he got all nervous and told me he was a virgin. I told him that I really liked him so I would like to take things slow and he agreed. I felt like after that I was teaching him how to be with a girl really and I still really liked him. We did end up way too soon, like a week later. But things were going well I thought. He was texting me consistently, wanting to hang out even if we weren’t planning on hooking up. After we had sex once, we did one more time the next day and then I didn’t see him for a few more. 

We were both having a rough day at work and were planning to hang out at my place. He said he was really tired and I told him he didn’t need to come over if he wanted to sleep and he said he just wanted to come over and cuddle and sleep so I was like cool that sounds like a chill night. When he came over though, he wouldn’t stop trying to make out with me and touch me. I had told him multiple times that I thought we were just being lazy tonight and wasn’t in the headspace to fool around. After this same run around for like 30 minutes, he got grumpy and went to bed in my room and gave me the cold shoulder all night. I texted him the next day and he said he “expected” us to have sex because I was flirting with him at work all day. So I told him I didn’t want to hang out anymore and him telling me he expected anything made me feel gross. That I didn’t want a sex only relationship. Then he got Covid and I didn’t see him at work or talk to him for almost two weeks. 

He comes back and it’s obviously awkward but after awhile we’re talking like friends again and I did start to miss him. He texted me later and told me the same, that he really liked me and cared about me and apologized for that night and treating me unfairly. I stupidly believed him. He came over this last Friday and we had a great time. Talked, ate, fooled around, cuddled. I thought everything was going well. Weekend goes by and yesterday he was going to come over again and asked me to text him when I was heading home so I did. 

Two hours later I text him again to see if he was still coming and he said he wasn’t. I asked him to be honest with his intentions and just tell me what was up. He said he wasn’t looking for anything serious and we can still be friends and I just feel so completely used. Like if I’m not having sex with him, I’m worthless. I’m just bummed because I did like him as a person and even though I don’t want anything super serious, I don’t want to be used for my body. I was okay being alone when I wasn’t getting my hopes up and then bailed on and my feelings hurt. So I think I’m just going to focus on myself and stop worrying about dating.

79,s1w6xh,1641958494,Am I (33M) really missing out by never having dated before?," I think I just got comfortable in my singleness at a certain point. I'm a massive introvert and have no friends by choice. I hate going out to crowded places and I love spending most of my time alone. Work is all the social interaction I can handle usually. Because being single was never particularly painful for me like it seems to be for a lot of people, I just never bothered to actively try to date. And when you are a reclusive male who isn't actively putting yourself out there, it just doesn't happen. There was always something else I wanted to put my energy in instead, and I didn't know if I would want to give up my total solitude. I'm not asexual or aromantic. Both relationships and sex are definitely appealing to me. But I was always able to pour myself into work and hobbies and be entertained by that.

All that said, I turned 33 a week ago and for the first time I really sat and thought about it. Like ""oh shit, I've never kissed a woman or even held hands."" My life is pretty great as is. I make good money, I am thoroughly entertained by my hobbies, and like I said, I do love being alone. But I almost think I'm too deep in my comfort zone of solitude. I'm still human and I now know I really do want to experience a relationship and intimacy at some point. Am I really missing out on that much? Would it be a huge red flag if a guy just never bothered to try dating at my age?

80,s1wdex,1641959044,is he interested or just being nice?,"October 2021.  
I met this guy through a whatsapp group of my university course. I was asking for advice about a music school and some people offered to help me.  
Among these people, there was this guy. We immediately started chatting a lot and since I had so many doubts, he offered to meet me to talk about Music schools and piano (we both play the piano). Unfortunately, I had to postpone the meeting several times but he always made himself available in many different ways to see me, even if he’s really a busy person. I told him to not worry so much and so, eventually, he thought about calling me and at the end we talked on the phone for almost two hours about random topics,too. I've never had all this confidence with a stranger whose face I didn't even know. It was weird and if we hadn't had any plans, we would have been on the phone for more hours. After that day, we met at the university.  
Due to the pandemic, we couldn’t see each other much in Uni. I think I like him a bit but his behavior confused me and I don't understand if he is just very nice to me or if the interest is mutual:  


1.  He is really a very shy and introverted guy in real life (The first time we met he even struggled to take off his mask because he was embarassed) and I am the exact opposite: an extroverted ticking time bomb waiting to explode. LOL
2. Since we met, however, whenever we could, we had lunch together, he asked me to take lessons with him (even if I had already taken them the year before) and he offered to help me studying and playing the piano several times.
3. Those few times ( due to Covid) I followed lessons with him, he always kept me the seat in the front row of the classroom next to him (he even asked strangers for jackets or material to keep the place reserved to me!) 
4. sometimes he even complimented me for my dress or my personality and usually asked me to keep him company while he’s having a coffee. During one of these breaks, I introduced myself to some of his friends and at one point, a guy I didn't know from his group approached me and said “ah, so you're the piano girl! ""  ( D: well, it was weird and unexpected)
5. In real life, this guy has always been a bit clumsy-shy-nervous only around me but also very kind and helpful. He even always say “sorry” to me, everytime he touches me by accident during lessons.  
Then, from mid-December, we started chatting very often and in chat he is much moooore open, playful and we discovered we have many things in common. He always asks me so many questions, he even invited me to one of his concert and insists on hearing me play the piano. Sometimes he also said things like ""so admit you miss me a little"" or ""we should have spent Christmas and New Year together"" (during the holidays we chatted all day long). Then I told him that in March I will change my study course but that he will not get rid of me ( just kidding) and he said the same thing about me.

Now you’re going to tell me that he seems interested, but the main problems are the following:  
1) I am 26 yo, he is 20. Although everyone thinks I look younger and as well as he is very mature with extremely ""old  style” tastes for his age, I am afraid that this age difference could be a problem for him.  
2) Usually, I start the conversation in chat, even if then it goes on for days (late at night, too) and he writes long, not concise, messages.   
But a few days ago for the first time, he read my last message but he never replied, even if everyday he is always the first to view my whatsapp stories. I mean, it was a controversial message that could also close the conversation. Plus, he is really workaholic and we are currently in full exam session.

Does He never replied to that last message because he is very busy or because he doesn't really care, but he’s just kind and friendly with me? Should I write to him again or not? should I also stop posting stories and wait to see if he’ll write me later, or what?

**TL;DR** I can't figure out if a guy I like is just nice to me or if he cares. I'm afraid of the age difference ( 6 years) and I don't know whether to stop writing to him until he shows up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1wdex/is_he_interested_or_just_being_nice/

I thought it would be cute to door dash him some “get well soon” treats and snacks. He texted me saying I was the “absolute sweetest” then asked me to come over to see his new place. 

I went over had a good time but could tell something was off. I figured it was because he was sick but at the same time my gut feeling knew it was more than that. 

We kissed goodbye, he said “I’ll text you in the morning” and I never heard from him again. 

Waited till 4pm the next day and said “hey are we okay? Did I do something wrong.” Keep in mind, he was never like this until then. He opened it never responded back. I must admit, I texted again saying around 8pm “hey im really sorry if i did or say anything to make you mad.” No response.

85,s1wjlg,1641959558,What would you think of this behaviour?,"
1st date never asked me one question in a one hour coffee date (he only occasionally asked me a question about a topic I brought up he never asked me an original question). When there was an awkward silence he would fully turn his face away and stare at the scenery every time.

He asked to call me between 1-2nd date did not speak much and said he liked me at the end of call.

2nd date: better convo still seemed a lil nervous but he asked questions. Asked to kiss me. The kiss was tongue the whole time and I never gave tongue back my upper lip and near my chin was very wet. Again told me he liked me.

the next day he texted me at work saying he was distracted at work ;) emoji. I said hopefully not too distracted he said it was hard considering the way the date ended(referencing the makeout).

3rd date was going to be ice-skating. I was thinking of asking to reschedule but then before I could he told me he bough tickets. Does anyone think he is rushing or it was weird he told me he bought tickets? I feel like he did this because he sensed me pulling away and wanted to make me go on the date

1) I could ask random cuties I see in stores or whatever what my name should be

2) Approach ladies and talk with them until they ask what my name is and then have them guess, maybe make them guess 3 times and then collect the data and change to whatever is most commonly guessed 

3) And then just trying out different names as I introduce myself, seeing what works good

for years everyone has said that we would be a cute couple, and we know we want to try to date but dont want to ruin our good solid friendship. anyways, we used to say ' love you' as friends, like when were saying goodbye. does that kind of take away the meaning of saying i love you, in a more romantic sense?  

like for most couples, the first date, first kiss, first person to say i love you, are big milestones, but for us, we have expressed our love to each other already, so how can i say it, to show that i mean it *in that way*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1wqfz/dating_best_friend/

She has never had a serious relationship, and she doesn't do casual hookups either. She chooses to be single and doesn't seek out relationships despite receiving a lot of attention from guys. She regularly deals with anxiety, depression and deep rooted insecurities 

Ive been getting signs that she likes me, and is interested in me, but her current situation is keeping me at safe distance until she knows for sure what she wants to do.

95,s1ww47,1641960591,speed dating," hey guys 41m, this is about speed dating and your experiences.

better   than dating apps? that isn't working out too well for me, it's too   complex and confusing and there aren't many bites. maybe not enough fish   in the pond or something, not sure, whatever.

some   folks suggested speed dating, what do you think? i've never done that,   back when i was dating in the early 2000s it was a big thing but i  never  tried it. it seemed to work fairly well for some people i knew,  but i  never got around to checking it out.

i   might just go back to approaching women in person and talking to them,   but maybe speed dating is more expedient. but idk because i haven't  ever  done it.

&amp;#x200B;

i have a prob  because i  don't drink, i don't like dancing, and i don't hang out at  bars. i don't know how  anyone can meet people and talk to them when  it's so loud you can't hear  each other speak. but anyway, i'm not into  the bar scene, so i gotta look elsewhere.

can  you tell me a  little about what to expect, what it's like, are there  some good  prospects? i just hope there aren't too many single moms, i'd  be a  pretty lousy role model and i don't want to mess up any poor kid's  life  ;D

mostly i like being comfortable and myself, being chill and taking life easy, not sweating the small stuff.

do  you have to dress up, like is it required? i'm not even sure i own  socks anymore....i think i have a sweater in my closet somewhere, but  it's mostly hoodies, sweatpants, and sandals...i DO own a pair of jeans  though, so that's a plus...

But sometimes when I'm around a couple, I notice that some girls suddenly become overly affectionate with their boyfriends. Things they didn't do before. They started holding him closer, kissing him in front of me, and getting all kinds of PDAs (which made the room uncomfortable) while staring at me! And make sure I see it.

Is this to make me jealous, or to warn me, or to save their boyfriend from the big bad guys, or just not safe?
