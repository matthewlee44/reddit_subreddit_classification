1,qxbdqj,1637308632,Do not know if I am eligible to date,"Hello,
so as the title says, I just feel that the position I am in right now is making me not eligible to date anyone. So, a bit about myself:
I am a 26 year old guy, living with my parents because right now I am studying my masters (Clinical psychology) and it takes up so much time that I am not able to work, even part time. My hobbies are learning circus acrobatics learning to play the guitar and bass. I do not drink and do not smoke.
I wanted to give you all some background about myself, because I need advice on my situation on the dating topic. 
I do want to date and do want to meet someone that I would like and that she would like me, but I just feel that my situation right now does not let me date. I feel that at my age I should be living by myself, have a job and be much more mature in a way and because of that I am not mature enough I need to wait it out right now and take a break on dating. 
So I just want to ask others if you feel the same about me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxbdqj/do_not_know_if_i_am_eligible_to_date/
2,qxbf0a,1637308778,What should I [18M] be expecting from this girl? Is my thought-process reasonable?,"Hi everyone. I’d just like to preface this by saying that I’m in university, and I’ve never had experience dating or with girls. I’ve also been a lurker on this sub, so my perceptions could be greatly skewed compared to how dating actually works to which I will take it on the chin.

There’s this one girl in class who I’ve taken a liking to. Initially, we started off talking as we were paired within a group for class, and now a few months later, she refers to us as friends. I’ve always thought she was cute, but I’ve never really wanted to act upon it because I felt it’d be rude to pursue anything as we were just friends. However, she’s been saying things like how we should hangout or how she attended class because I was going to be there or else she would have skipped. She also frequently notices and waves at me when we cross paths. These signs aren’t glaringly obvious that she likes me compared to the more obvious ones that I’ve read on here, and I do also realize that she could just be friendly as every girl is different. As for some more context, we’re not in the same friend group, so I’d imagine that if we were to hangout it’d be on a one-on-one setting.

We’re friends within class, but we haven’t hung outside of class, and I’ve been told by friends and online sources that it’d be much easier to first become friends with a girl to which you could then potentially pursue a relationship, so I am currently going along with this route. I ended up asking her if she wanted to grab some food to which she said she wanted to ask me the same thing and sounded excited. I’d just like to make it clear that this wasn’t a date by any means. And so I thought this was another good sign, but it turned out afterwards she was with her friends yet reassured she would still be available. I messaged her at the planned time if she was ready, but she said that she was still with friends and that she thought she had told me. I was clearly not notified. She planned for a different day to which I agreed.

I’m already a little nervous putting myself out there as this is my first time in uncharted territories, and I don’t want to come off as desperate, so I’m not sure if I should reach out again to see if our plans are still on. Is it reasonable to say that if she doesn’t message me on the rescheduled day that she doesn’t care? If this happens should I just move on and stick to just being friends? Or maybe is being out with friends a legitimate reason as to why she didn’t notify me and make it? Lastly, I do want to note that I understand she does not owe me anything, but I’m still curious on my end.

I’d appreciate any feedback. Thank you in advance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxbf0a/what_should_i_18m_be_expecting_from_this_girl_is/

4,qxbjog,1637309306,Official Man’s Rule to the Second Date,"The second date is the most frustrating for most folks on both sides of the gender spectrum. But the frustration largely stems from ignorance. Fortunately there is a very simple set of rules that lets you know exactly where you stand after the first date.

A first date only has two possible outcome: sex or no sex. 

If you had sex on the first date, congratulations. You have succeeded at having an actually chance at having a meaningful connection with your date. You now may request a second date. 

If you did not have sex, you haven’t entirely blown your chances, but your first date was in fact a failure (sorry!). The ball is now in her court. Odds are that she doesn’t want to see you again, but she may want to! She will contact you if she wants to see you again and at that point you can decide if you want to reply to her request. 

I’ve arrived at this conclusion after 1,000s of hours of interviews with bot genders. Stop wasting your time and stop embarrassing yourself on women who aren’t into you.

12,qxc5g0,1637312035,Am I being breadcrumbed? What is happening? Need some perspective,"Hi all!

More of a vent, but would really appreciate your outside perspectives on my situation before I drive myself totally bananas, lol.

Back in August, I went on OLD open to meeting people, making friends/connections in my new city. So I (25M) started talking to this guy (27M) at the beginning of September. Initially great, having some good conversations. I ask early on if they'd like to meet IRL for a walk (I don't enjoy endless texting - *which.. just wait* \- so I always try to meet ASAP). He agrees, we go on the walk - again, good conversation, felt comfortable, just overall a nice time. We expressed mutual interest in getting together again. 

Now, on this walk I asked what he was looking for. I didn't really get a clear answer, but a couple days later while we're chatting I get: ""Hey, just want to let you know I'm not looking for anything serious/dating. I really like hanging out with you though."" Okay, maybe a bit disappointed, but I was okay making amical connections and I appreciated the honesty. Honestly, if he just wanted to hookup I'd be open to that too. So I suggest grabbing a beer as friends, which he happily agrees to &amp; we pick a date. The day comes, he cancels hours before because of work. That's ok, things happen. I ask if he's free the following weekend: ""sure""! That weekend comes along, I barely hear from him and then late Sunday he tells me he was having a bad weekend. Again, stuff happens, I understand. But this is where I should've probably bowed out...

On multiple other occasions I suggest we meet up or go for a quick walk or what have you (he lives 5 minutes away from me, it shouldn't be that hard). Never really commits to anything but expresses interest. At this point I'm a bit confused, but he seems interested, right? So here I carry along with the endless snapping. 

By October, I'm really starting to feel confused and anxious. He starts giving me hot/cold signals via Snapchat (main communication, even though he could text me). Generally some red flags start to surface that I naively ignore. At this point.. I just feel bloody confused and unsure.

Fast forward, one night I get a snap of a hickey... uhm, ok a little weird to show me. Then he's complaining about how he doesn't have time for boys blah blah (so you have time to go get a hickey, but not a 20 min. walk?). So I ask: ""If you don't have time for boys, why are you on Grindr and such then?"" No passiveness in that question, just genuinely curious. Crickets. Ok, sorry didn't mean to put you on the spot. Him: ""you sound like my therapist."" Me: ??. Like, that should be a pretty simple thing to answer, idk.

Last week he reaches out to set up a time to meet. We agree on a day. Day comes, I touch base with him- ""sorry can't. Work came up. I feel like an asshole but I do want to hang with you *soon* :) ). Just friggin' peeved at this point. I also woke up earlier while working nights to be able to hang during daylight hrs.

At risk of continuing this ramble, he still interacts with me daily but I feel like I'm checking out and I just feel wildly confused. Like, this isn't my first rodeo but damn.. why even interact if you have no intentions of hanging out? Wt\* is going on here?? And better yet why am I still here. I'm less responsive to him at this point, but I haven't been able to let it go. I'm not one to ghost but it's really tempting. Should I? I think the fact that he's not overtly mean or anything is making this hard.

Thanks for making it this far. What do you think is happening? What do you think is the best approach at this point? I'm honestly so embarrassed and frustrated - I feel like I've been terribly naïve and just plain stupid with this. I've had my share of bad dating/whatever experiences, but this is driving me mental. Please virtually slap me, lol.

That is all. Thanks friends :)

Signed onto a lesbian dating app for obvious reasons and got matched with a redhead cutie in mississippi. Shes 28 and I'm 24.

Ever since then, her replies are getting far longer inbetween. E.g: 9pm evening last message and then replies at 6pm the next day but still the same para length. Its been happening the last 4 days now. She apologizes for the delay everytime, giving a different excuse each time. E.g: being sick, having a busy day, etc but shes always on the dating app and online on WhatsApp, reads my msg but doesnt reply? It just feels like she doesnt make an effort anymore.

21,qxdf7x,1637317669,"Dear Bumble and dating apps in general,","My first encounter with a dating app (Tinder) was when my girlfriend cheated on me. She used it to get revenge on me for me having normal boundaries and not being 24/7 available to listen to her complain about the entirety of the world population in her vicinity, as I was overwhelmed with coursework and my personal hell at home, and she didn't appreciate ever when I was there for her.

I waited a year to get over this, she was my childhood friend and I never thought she would do this to me. I thought I would have healed but that wasn't true, so after a year of the breakup I dated again using Bumble a girl I would travel 2h by car to see. This was 3 years ago.

 She was immature and she liked me only for 3 months, after which she discarded and devalued me. I was in so much pain because I was intent on making it work for ever. She wasn't. She deceived me. She forced me to be the man in the relationship. She mocked me for being a woman. 

My younger cousin also has been using the app to enable her extreme promiscuity which is a feature of her borderline diagnosis. I have loved and supported her but when I was broken I could no longer overlook thaf she was looking down on me for not hooking up with strangers in public toilets like she does instead of realizing she is self trashing doing things like such. She dumped our lifelong friendship for her s*x addiction and ego.

Whenever I am on Bumble or other app I feel discouraged. I am holding out on love for years and focusing on my career which makes me feel deprived of affection and isolated.

23,qxdnd5,1637318663,Green flags,"Green flags seem unnoticed nowadays.

They say, healthy relationships are boring. But imagine someone makes you feel comfortable and secure, remembers little tiny details about you including your favorites, and giving you assurance even if you not asked it. Someone you can be vulnerable with, you can be yourself, you can be genuine without disrespecting you. Someone who has clear and vivid plans about your relationship. Someone who respects your time and boundaries and understands that you have other people in your life. Someone who makes time for you, care for you, and sees your flaws as ground for bloom. Someone who never lets you sleep with a heavy heart and never take advantage of you. Someone who communicates their thoughts because they care about your relationship; that disagreements are part of it and wants it healthy. 

Imagine having someone who is good for your heart.

We are blinded by red flags because they are represented by the color of love. We always think that we can change them; that they'll soon realize their mistakes; that they will have initiative to fix themselves. We assume and hope that the love we give will be an enough reason for them to be better. Or otherwise, we want plot twist, we want thrill, we want someone's not boring, we want to play games, that we forgot about peace. We forgot about the love we deserve.

More than likely just paranoid and overthinking but I feel like because it’s been set up by a friend (and he speaks about it a lot) there’s extra pressure for it to go well that there just shouldn’t be on a first date.

31,qxejz5,1637322444,It finally happened!," I (34M) met her (35F) via online dating. I was almost ready to give up on online dating after more than 4 years of having no luck. We matched and hit it off right away. Our interests, world views, personalities and everything just clicked. We had a few video calls before we first met up in person. It was almost 2 weeks before we first met in person as we both had prior commitments/busy schedules, but during those 2 weeks we chatted or video called every chance we got.

For our first date I recommended we do something different from the usual of go for a drink. She is a huge fan of a certain film series, and as we both live only around an hour away from where some of it was filmed, I recommended we go there so she could show me where different parts were filmed. Even though I live only an hour away I had never been there myself as I only moved to this city a few months prior.

We met around midday, and I surprised her by turning up in a jumper that was from her favourite film series. She gave me a warm welcome hug and laughed, and she said she totally digs the jumper and thanked me for the nice surprise.

I then invited her to go grab lunch at a place that has her favourite food on the menu. We walked and talked for a couple hours, getting along so well. She made me laugh with her quick wit and humour, and I vice versa. I could already tell she was every bit as genuine as she was in our video calls and texts. It just felt right, and to be honest the connection we were starting to build here I could already tell was special.

We then proceeded to the main event, whereby she showed me around the filming location and what happened in different scenes and where. I was completely taken back by her knowledge and passion. We sat down on a bench in some gardens and I told her thanks for coming and that I was having a fantastic day so far. She smiled and looked right into my eyes, and then it seemed like the world paused for a moment as I looked back into her eyes with a smile of my own.

I knew this was the moment so I leant it to give her a kiss and she reciprocated. It was an amazing feeling, a true kiss that felt real and with so much intent. As we sat there with our lips against each other it felt like nothing else in the world mattered. It was at this point I knew this could be something special.

The fun on our first date didn't stop there, we then went for hot chocolate and marshmallows. We talked more and by this time it was around 6pm and she had to travel back at this time. I walked her to her car and that is when it finally hit me that this had been the best first date I've ever had. I didn't want it to stop so I proposed an outrageous idea that I would travel back with her in her car if she'd have me, at least that way we'd get another hour together. Her face lit up with excitement, she seemed so happy that I asked this and she jumped at the chance. So off we went for another hour together.

We never stopped talking unless we were kissing or holding hands for a moment. Yes some will say this is crazy for a first date, but we didn't see it that way as we had been chatting/video calling an awful lot prior to this. Also there's no way to explain the instant connection and bond we formed that day, it was simply one of those rare special moments in life.

After we arrived back near her place she dropped me at the train station where we said our goodbyes.

This story is about our first IRL date, but of course things have gone from strength to strength since then and she finally now knows just how I feel about her, and I had almost forgotten what a wonderful feeling this is.

I hope my story can inspire other singles not to lose hope. Good luck to all of you singles currently looking for that special someone, I know the struggles as I spent more than 4 years doing the same. I can now say viola to the dating apps and focus on a new chapter in my life.

37,qxfqqp,1637326909,"Someone Hot and Cold I've Been in Love with Is Moving Away, Do I Tell her How I Feel or Just Leave It Alone?","A year ago, someone who I've always had feelings for (31F) reached out to me (32M) and told me she was unhappy in her relationship and that she always regretted pushing me away when we tried to date back in 2018. She was unhappily engaged to a gaslighty egomaniac (30M) and was apparently seeing her life flash before her eyes and thinking she was making a mistake. 

Over the course of the year, she and this person broke up and we spent a ton of time together, but she was always very clear that she wasn't in a place to have a relationship with me or anyone for that matter. I understood this and gave her space because I didn't want it to be just a rebound thing because I always thought we'd end up together when she was ready. But thanks to Instagram she learned that her ex had a new gf and it made her extremely depressed and full of self doubt. She announced to me that there was ""nothing left for her here"" in the major city where we live (ouch) and that the only way she could be happy was if she left town. Then after another few months she told me she had accepted a job in another major city and was leaving in December. She kept asking me if I was sad about it, and alluded to me visiting her and even asked rhetorically if I really want wanted to stay in this city forever. But since then she's basically avoided me.

It's obvious to everybody we know, including her, how I feel about her but I've never really said so. I don't really wanna be pen pals or waste my time pining for someone who doesn't live in my city any more, but I also feel strange just letting her go away forever without at least telling her that I have spent literally years wanting to be with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxfqqp/someone_hot_and_cold_ive_been_in_love_with_is/

42,qxgo4t,1637330037,Object Perminance w/ Men? ADHD or BPD?,"Recently went through a break up (couple weeks ago) after a couple years-long relationship. Told a friend that I am going on a date w/ a new guy in a week and they were shocked. They questioned how I could go on a date so ""quickly after a breakup."" They questioned if I ""even loved the person that I was with if I can move on so quick."" In my mind there's a difference between going on dates and entering a relationship. 

However, I'm wondering if it is abnormal to move on so ""quickly"" after a break-up. I truly did love and care for my ex, but the end of our relationship made me see them in a different light completely. 

In the past I've been told I have BPD and ADHD but different Healthcare providers have said different things, so diagnosis keep changing. Could this be related to one of those? Kind of like my ex is out of sight, out of mind? Or just black and white thinking? Has anyone else experienced this?

43,qxgroj,1637330355,I had a great first date with a guy and now he’s making me completely lose interest,"Last week on Thursday, we were supposed to get drinks and then I suggested we go to a last minute concert instead because my fav band was playing. He was game, we went, and it was a great time. Cut to the next day, and the guy is texting me… a lot. At first I was like, “oh cute, I can tell he likes me, he’s being chatty, he wants to get to know, he wants me to get to know him. Great.” i went along with it, albeit I felt like it was a bit too much too soon. He asked me out on a second date for that same Saturday and I said yes because i figured might as well keep the momentum. The second date was fine (he doesn’t really make me laugh though and there wasn’t a ton of banter, which are two things I really like) and he came over after for a little (we didn’t have sex) but it didn’t really leave me wanting more. I’m talking to a few other guys and not putting all my eggs in one basket, but even still, when I like someone and have a crush on them, I tend to have a stronger desire to want see them, like I *can’t wait.* i love that feeling of “I can’t wait to see you again.” I crave it even. Anyway, what I can’t get over is how much his eagerness to see me again (he wants to do something tonight) is turning me off! It’s also his vibe (a little corny), but more so his way of being so eager and not really playing the game is making any amount of attraction I had toward him slip away. I want to give him another chance, but I also don’t like the vibe (or lack there of) that’s currently happening.

We've been seeing each other online for a month or two, and never had time for a real date (I traveled, he was sick etc.) I thought it would be nice if we had a whole day to get to know each other in real life finally. He was looking forward to seeing me, we said we should meet around noon.. he overslept, woke up at 1PM and said to me he was preparing so we would meet in an hour.. later he postponed and said me to wait, he'll soon go out.. then it was another hour.. at 3:30 PM i called him and ask when will we finally meet and he asked if 5:30 is ok with me. I was pissed because I wasted my whole day off, and he doesn't have a regular 9-5 job and he probably doesn't even understand how precious a day off is. I wanna see him and hear his excuse, but I'm highly disappointed and feeling he's only playing with me since he let me wait all fucking day.

What should I look for tonight and how can I weight if he deserves a second chance? He's shy by nature and probably not organized at all because he doesn't have a real job and is partly still depending on his parents, which will not work for me in the future if that doesn't change, but that's another story.

64,qxjold,1637338909,Is it wrong to start talking to other guys if he hangs out with a woman he doesn't want me to know about?,"I (24F) met this guy (25M) and we have been dating for 6 months now. One month in I asked him if we were exclusive and he said ""I would hope we are"" (\*Hits forehead\*). Things were going great for a while but then he started hanging out with his female best friend more than me: going out to dinner with her, going to concerts, movies, fun activities and I just learned that they see each other almost every week. I know people can have close friends that are of the opposite sex, I have guy best friends myself, but I have not seen him nor has he taken me on a date for over a month now. Since the last time I saw him he's only offered to spend one night with me and that was so we could spend it having sex (we did not spend the night together). In the time that I have not seen him, I have attempted to plan multiple types of dates, with him, two of them being meals or watching a movie, but he will tell me he's swamped with work or money's tight.

A couple months ago we had an argument over him going on multiple last minute getaways alone with her and not telling me until after they got back. Two weeks ago they went to Vegas alone. This time he did not tell me about their trip to at all, I found out because she posted a picture and tagged him. When I brought it up to him he said they had planned this trip during the Summer but wouldn't say why he didn't tell me about it prior.

I have not met her and he will not tell me anything about her. I know that he's known her longer than me. I asked him if I could meet her and he left me on read for a few days. He ignored my question and texted me about something else. Based on his response, or lack thereof, my thoughts are that she IS his best friend but with benefits, they are dating and I met him when they went through a rough patch, or she is an ex that he can't let go of. He is important to her though, as she has stalked my social media a few times.

I have tried ending things in the past, and voiced that what he is doing disrespectful but he only repeats that she is his best friend. He'll also tell me that he loves me and that I'm toxic because I won't let go fo the past. Either he's a manipulative asshole or an asshole that sees nothing wrong, I think the former.

Should I just cut my losses with him? Of course there's a part of me that still likes the thought of being with him but I'm over being treated like this. I can't end things with him because he won't let me so should I just start dating other guys without telling him? I know that will make me look bad to some people and I would prefer to talk to him but he doesn't want to talk.

I know he won't change anytime soon and I don't want to stick around waiting for him to do so. I've already wasted a lot of time on him. I want to meet other guys, go on fun dates, spend time with someone who wants to be with me and move on already.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxjold/is_it_wrong_to_start_talking_to_other_guys_if_he/

68,qxk1y9,1637339991,My social life is a pretty big rut right now,"For context I’ve been in somewhat of a rut and I can’t take it anymore! I thought that when I moved to America, that I would be much more popular and social that I was back in PR. But it’s felt the same, barely any friends or texts. Constantly alone in my dorms even when I have a lot of meetups apps and belong to a group. And a lot of that is because of both covid and my inability to communicate effectively through text. I’m awful at texting, it feels inhuman to me. I can’t read people through a fucking screen, I can’t get their nuances, body language, their tone of voice, their eye contact, all of that etc. And it’s not like I’m awkward or shy or just don’t know how to communicate, it’s just that now our culture has ingrained texting into its main form of communication. I get so depressed seeing people on like discord groups, Facebook, insta, and WhatsApp all have really good communication with eachother, sending memes and keeping in contact for long periods of time. It makes me feel like the years of transforming myself from a very socially inept person into a more charming and likeable,social person went to waste. And that doesn’t even include dating and sex. So I see people constantly complained about how they haven’t gotten laid in x amount of time usually a very short month or two and it makes me feel like what am I doing wrong?! I don’t know how to get casual sex from people neither through apps or real life. I can get dates, make out with them same date. And then nothing. I watched a few posts about how guys miss hints and I felt I never had that problem. But my problem is that I think im just too friendly, and I don’t know (well don’t know completely) what girls do to try and get casual sex or hookups, besides bars and parties obviously. Im honestly stuck between am I socially inadequate or am I ugly? Which I’ve been told in both cases that im neither from both parties constantly. (I am overweight tho, but currently have lost nearly 25 pounds).Ah, the other part that I nearly forgot when I was talking about how our society has ingrained texting into our culture was the follow ups. This is what makes keeping a relationship or escalating one so difficult to me. Because it seems like it’s mandatory to text, and I just don’t know the social etiquette in order to pull this off. I don’t know if I should be texting this person everyday, or share a risky text or meme, I don’t know if I pissed them off or made them uncomfortable around me. I don’t know the timing of how long is a good time to wait until the next text. But worst of all is I simply don’t feel it in me to text. So I spend most of my days alone talking to no one watching Netflix or YouTube….I wish phones didn’t exist…..

I’m not ugly, you might even be surprised if you saw me and I told you I was a virgin.  My entire life so far, I’ve spent time flirting with girls in a reciprocated, but an unacknowledged liking for each other.

It couldn’t be more obvious that she was asking me out, but I rejected her.  A girl that I would have never expected to like me in the first place.  Gone, because I don’t know.  There’s tens of these events that have happened to me.  I’ve never asked anyone out before, but I don’t want to lose this girl in my class.  We only have one more class day together.

I get plenty of stares, comments, weird stuff when I go out on my own, but I’ve recently been going out with a guy who’s 5’6” and people have started being outright mean.

Some men have come up when he’s right there trying to hit on me. We both shut that down quick. What I have a problem with is (mostly women who I have never met) who tell me I could do better, or even worse, the judgmental stares. Like, I’m just trying to enjoy my night.

Granted, there are some people who come up and tell us how cute we are, but it still gets weird. For instance, a woman came up gushing about what a cute couple we are (nice) how I must love him so much and wouldn’t care if he was two foot tall (weird) and then proceeded to talk about our height difference for like five minutes while we were playing pool (please stop).

What’s a good way to shut this down? I don’t want to be mean but it’s jarring. And people almost always approach me instead of him to start talking about this stuff. I’ve never had so many random people coming up to me while on a date and trying to insert themselves.

77,qxkfke,1637341090,Should I date a cop?,"So, for some context, I am brown woman working as a police accountability lawyer in Australia. I work with indigenous clients and handle horrific police misconduct claims day in and day out. (I’d say 90% of my clients have been brutally beaten, strip searched or sexually assaulted by the police) I’ve done a lot of research on policing, have taken multiple criminology courses throughout university and have written several papers on state sanctioned violence and I know for a fact that our state’s police force is corrupt and racist as hell. I am deeply opposed to policing as an institution, and while I know that there are definitely great cops out there who do a lot for their community, I do not support the profession/institution at all. Recently, I went on a date with a guy I met last year. We met at a mutual friends birthday and became good friends but then fell out of touch and then reconnected about a month ago. I think he’s incredible - so sweet and smart and cool. We get along really well and have great chemistry. I haven’t liked anyone this much in a long time. Anyway, last year he was working as an occupational therapist. But when I went out with him recently, I asked how his job was going and he told me, “oh yeah, I don’t want to be an OT anymore, I’ve joined the police academy.” I was taken aback because I had no clue he had any aspirations to become a cop. I just said “oh...how come?” And he explained that he recognised police brutality as an issue but really thought that policing was a good opportunity to help people/protect the community and that’s why he wanted to do it etc. I know he means well and I do genuinely believe that he would make a good cop if/when he becomes one. But I also personally think it’s really naive to think that joining our state’s broken, deeply racist police force is a good way to serve the community. He’s a smart guy who is generally very left wing and very socially informed so this was honestly very surprising to hear. I pretty much instantly decided that I wouldn’t see him again because that is a deal breaker for me but when I’ve told my friends and family, a lot of them have said that I’m being too harsh and one track about this and that if everything else is perfect (which it is), I should give it a shot.

I used to date people I meet through friends or school and it was kind of risky and exciting but I had some success. I had a break for 3 years and come back again after covid hits. Only this time with dating apps...

I have been on many, had a few successes (I'm not photogenic and I have really terrible pics). Most of my dates and hookups ended with me getting rejected. Even tho I wasn't looking for anything serious, it kinda hit my confidence. This summer I met a girl (not my type, like most other girls I went on a date with). We kept seeing each other for 2 months as a fwb realtionship. We ended up breaking up (in the most friendly way ever) because I couldn't commit to something more than FWB.

A month later, I met this girl online (again). We had 3 normal and really fun dates. Although, I noticed some redflags about her (expect you always to pay, expect you to make her have fun, many rescheduling). After that she kinda started semi-ghosting to the point when we had a conversation about that and she said that wasn't looking for anything serious but still wanna meet me.

I met someone else about 2 days ago, lazy af, cancels dates because she is not in mood, doesn't reschedule but keeps replying fast and all.

I want to meet someone funny, attentive, and attractive who is not looking for anything serious but I am open to many things, maybe one day it's gonna turn into something big. Just go with the flow until you realize that's what I WANT.

He moved 5 hours away recently and said he didn’t want a relationship because of that. I understood and agreed to FWB. Fast forward a month later .

I thought he was just joking because it’s what I said the last time I saw him. But in the middle of sex he really said “I think I love you. Maybe we can make a long distance relationship work out. I want to see you again next week .” 

I felt that was very specific and not just someone randomly saying I love you when things get intense . After that he never brought it up again. It was like what he said didn’t happen.

He takes me on dates, we have long deep conversations and we seem to have a connection. He constantly checked on me to see if I was okay when I traveled to see him. I’m very inexperienced with dating and appreciate anyones advice. 

He’s told me before how he’s acted on his emotions quickly in the past and he didn’t want to do that to avoid anyone getting hurt.

88,qxlhv9,1637344054,"To Find The One, Be Yourself, But Never Stop Growing","One of the greatest lessons I have learned in dating thus far is that most traits about a person fall into one of two categories: personality and maturity. In order to find the one for you, take ownership of your personality while continuing to grow your maturity

Examples of personality: A love for dance, board games, fine arts, sports, ambition, laid-back, intellectual, high-energy, favorite shows/movies/books, etc

Each of our personalities are unique and we love certain things. You should never compromise what you love in order to try and fit the mold of someone you are attracted to. Why? Because then you will spend your life suppressing who you are to accommodate your relationship. Don't do it! Your personality was molded into you when you were born and is something beautiful and unique that the world needs! Don't be afraid to embrace what you love and let it show through! In order to find someone you will really connect with, you need to find someone that loves the personality that you naturally have, so you can live in abundance with what brings you life. That person is out there and you increase your chances of find the person who loves you personality, when you improve your maturity traits (see below)

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of maturity: physical health, emotional health, spiritual health, communication, empathy, responsibility, consideration, social skills, emotional intelligence, selflessness

While being laid-back can be a personality trait, there is a difference between the person who likes to camp in the woods and the person who never does their laundry. While your sense of humor may be sarcasm, that is never an excuse to be inconsiderate of others. Just because someone enjoys video games instead of sports doesn't mean that they are off the hook for taking care of their physical health. All aspects of maturity will enhance the beautiful personality traits that you have. Maturity traits are something that everyone can work on and will enhance your attractiveness while not compromising who you are. A lack of any maturity trait, whether it be health or quality communication, doesn't define who you are forever, and can be changed with determination and hard work.

I don't mean to harp on this, but I see so many people not growing in maturity and writing it off as their personality. That simply isn't true. I know introverts who have incredible social skills. How? They stepped out of their comfort zone and improved their maturity. Growing in maturity is often hard, because it is reshaping who you are. It will suck, but it doesn't take away from who you are, it carves that beautiful cherry wood personality that you have into an incredible sculpture for the world to see.

89,qxli0g,1637344065,22f Need dating advice,"This is my throwaway account. Sorry for rambling, I’d just like some advice.

I am a 22f who is both a virgin and never having been in a relationship. 

Why this is the case for me might be for multiple reasons. The biggest contributor for this for me is because of my depression. I have diagnosed Major Depressive disorder and anxiety since high school. I do go to therapy, and I am on antidepressants. However, I continue to have repeated episodes of depression and it’s been years.

I get sad to think about how I have yet to have a relationship (I am heterosexual) because I don’t know if I could be a good partner to a guy. It would never be my intention to hurt someone but I’m not the most mentally stable person. I feel like this makes me highly unattractive. I try to take control of my life and get a grip but seemingly out of nowhere I just become overwhelmingly sad and numb. 

At this point, I feel like depression will always be a part of me even if I keep pushing on and try to get better. I feel like it will lurk in the shadows. I don’t want to feel unlovable because of this part of me, but I also don’t think anyone would willingly choose someone like me. 

But if this is a part of me and no one will want me, I feel like I’m going to be single forever. It hurts my fragile heart that I don’t get to experience love, sex, intimacy, relationships, etc., the way my friends and peers do. 

How do I know I’ll ever be okay enough for a relationship? I’m not even sure there’ll ever be a time where I don’t have depression, and I don’t think any guy would actively choose me knowing this part me. Especially with how old and inexperienced I am, I lose hope for myself everyday. I don’t know what to do. 

I went on a couple dates pre-COVID but I never knew how I would be able to tell a guy in the future that I do have depression?

I'm not having a lot of experience since I cutter off or rejected a lot of those people and focusing more on myself , my projects , work ,study , and of sure trying to being a better and nicer person even thought life take you down a lot of time ( and believe in me , that requires time and energy ) .

This has yes some advantage , but also a kind of disadvantage , especially around young age , cutting of a lot of people make you a little bit solitary,  especially if you are not into a good circle and sometimes it takes times and energy finding a good circle of people.  
From my experience I ve observed that older women tend to be attracted or interested at least,  cause they think you don't want to play but only having something serious with them, that's what I think and what I want to do , but anyway I don't want want pass my 20s in solitary without someone near me , cause I'm selective but was growing up with the sense of the family , solidarity and the group/family who helps each other , that's cause a little bit of depression,  even thought I would never try to replicate the last thing , cutting away my values .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxm3l7/do_women_really_like_selective_men_and_men_who/
