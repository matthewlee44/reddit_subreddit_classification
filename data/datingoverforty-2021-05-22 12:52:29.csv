4,nivd3p,1621727597,Last night's first date,"Around the time the vaccinations started in the U.S., I (44F) met a fella (35/36M) over video, from a dating app. Says he's here in U.S. on a diversity visa (which I think = the lottery visa?), same as is his buddy from college. (Impossible coincidence?) Friend also lives in the city with his wife/4th? cousin... I guess they're members of the same tribe.. Sounds a bit freaky (cousins marrying) to my American ears, but the last guy I dated described arranged marriages in his (Middle Eastern) tribe too. I guess it's a way of life.

Well after our video, we'd texted just a bit. He'd never been too forward or trashy (no aggression/unwanted pics). Quite classy, although I gleaned that he's extremely lonely. His was the last text in that thread. I had left it at that (and so did he) until yesterday, when I reached out and he happened to have the day off.

 He agreed to meet, though he kept messaging about seeing his apartment and maybe I could leave my car at his place and we could visit his neighborhood bar, driving in the same car. Normally red flags, though I recalled from dating a Frenchman, some guys are suuuper insistent on driving or (in the case of the Frenchman) flying together. 

Well we first meet at a restaurant. I'm not as attracted in person as in pictures/video, but don't assume he is either and definitely trying to be open minded and optimistic. I think it was that his style was just nerdier or something than I'm used to (he's in engineering). Anyway, conversation is a bit tough, in part bc he only began learning English when he arrived in US 3 or 4 years ago. Also, at one point he described both of us as ""shy."" Probably true, although I felt that he didn't express much curiosity about me. Then again, I had such a hard time understanding his accent, I was almost scared to ask questions, for fear of having to give the blank face or keep asking him to repeat himself...  Awkward, for sure. 

After dinner (he insisted on paying), we'd discussed the possibility of checking out the bar by his place, though he kept inviting me to his home, saying we could drink and talk on the balcony. Plus he mentioned that the bar got more noisy/boisterous the later it got. It felt like a quandary. I very much wanted to continue talking, but the thought of a loud bar seemed unacceptable. For communication, or if it turned out to be a really fun bar/night, that might be worse, bc I didn't want to get carried away drinking.

So (maybe completely stupidly), I agreed to drinks on his balcony. I was also having visions of that show, Married at first sight, where Dr Pepper goes in to inspect the home, see what she can learn about a person. I'm just nosy.

It basically turned out to be fine. We communicated more freely, he and his place were interesting to me. But then half after midnight, I felt like.... date's over. Possibly bc he mentioned something about kids (in the future). Now, I'm not totally opposed to trying to have kids with the right person, but ... I don't know? Someone not looking for kids is probably a better match for me.

Other potential red flags:  his birthday came up and I tried to clarify his zodiac sign. He said something completely off kilter. Who the heck thinks they're a different sign than they actually are?? Could he be adopting a different identity, like as a refugee? (Not the first time I've wondered this about a date.) Other potential red flag: 2 toothbrushes in the holder.

Well... I felt ready to ""digest"" everything. He walked into the living room as I was putting on my shoes to leave. He was having NONE of it. Now, I am absolutely not a ONS kinda gal. I'd like to get married someday and don't want to date if there's zero chance of that. Plus, I need time to get 100% comfortable with a guy, in and out of the bedroom. 

But he talked me into staying longer. _Neither of us have work tomorrow_ / _We're having a nice time_ / _Pick a movie for us to watch_ / _If you get sleepy, I'll make you comfy, let you wear my clothes_ .. etc. It was like... almost violently friendly/accommodating. I feel like there's a movie scene somewhere in the back of my mind that captures this sense of overwhelming hospitality, (maybe when Jerry S. and his father argued over who pays for dinner.) Generosity and gregariousness seems like the basic demeanor of Mediterranean and Eastern people, as far as I can tell. He kept saying _This home IS YOUR home_

Anyway. Ok, I give in. He's looking more adorable and I'm getting sleepy and cozy, in his arms. He starts kissing me. We end up making out with some serious heavy petting, but I have to put my foot down at some point. First date sex is simply not going to happen and (as I've had to do numerous times on dates with guys who it seems are only out for one thing), I hold my ground. He makes it known that he doesn't understand why. (I can't believe even at this age, I'm still putting the brakes on my dates!) However, he didn't push things too far. We fell asleep. I woke up early to leave, kind of gently shaking him to say goodbye. He mumbled some sort of acknowledgement.

Now what, I wonder? At one point in our conversation, I'd suggested something about maybe just being friends, I'd help him with his English. He looked down, seeming to not really like that. 

If he was just looking for sex, not a serious relationship or marriage (with me, anyway), I guess I'll never hear from him again. Obviously, if we continue dating, we should talk about what we want from our futures. But at this point, I guess just wait to see if he reaches out. Or should I assume this isn't MY guy and (mentally) move on? (tho I don't feel like getting back on any apps right now.) Or did I already somehow handle everything all wrong?

Any opinions or insight? ... Do a background check? I'm pretty sure he really does work where he said he does, and is from the country he claims to be, so wasn't feeling rushed to do that.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nivd3p/last_nights_first_date/

6,niw73y,1621730373,Question about communication,"I would like advice on something. Tomorrow I’m going hiking with somebody and it’s our third date. I posted about him a couple of weeks ago and said that there were some red flags on our first date where he seemed a bit over-eager and talked over me quite a bit. He and I were both traveling for work, and so I didn’t see him again until last night. Between then and now we texted quite frequently and I’ve come to really like him. I had a great time with him last night, also. 

But, (Isn’t there always a but?)He really doesn’t ask me about anything about me and he talks mostly about himself. If I offer some thing about myself he does seem to listen very attentively. And he does seem to remember things I say. But he’s not asking me questions and at this point I think I probably know a great deal more about him and he knows about me. I would say 80% of our conversation is about him. 

So my question is this. Would you say something? I think communication is important and I think there’s a good chance that this may be a difference in communication styles. There’s also a chance that he’s just selfish or self-involved. When we’re hiking tomorrow if he still doing this after a while I was considering saying something very simple like, “I’ve noticed that you don’t ask me a lot of questions about myself and it makes me feel as though you’re not terribly interested in me as a person. I’d like to believe that I’m incorrect. I’m hoping that maybe this is just a difference in communication styles. What do you think?”

Or, would you think that this man is 49 years old and if he doesn’t know by now to do this it’s probably simply not worth pursuing. As much fun as I had last night and as much as I have enjoyed getting to know him, I considered not seeing him again because of how much this bothers me. 

So talk to him about it or just let it go? Thanks!

Also, if you look at my post history you’ll see that I am separated and not fully divorced. It seems like whenever I post, I get lots of advice about how I shouldn’t be dating at all- regardless of what I’m asking. I get that some people think that and you’re welcome to your opinion. He and I had a thorough discussion about my status and the level of a relationship that I can commit to right now, and he understands.

I have been in relative isolation for several years. I have tried online dating, but can’t even trust my moods to carry a conversation. I’ve basically determined that I am undateable until I can feel ok and trust my moods. There is a huge void in my life that was once filled with family time and love. All the divorce advice I’ve gotten is like “get a hobby!” “Go rock climbing!” “Do all the things you always wanted to do!”  Yeah. I know. But there is a hole in my heart that I can’t fix because of this bipolar. This weekends when I have time to myself are the worst. I start dreading them midweek because I go to the gym and then don’t know what to do with myself. I feel like an invisible person and there’s no light at the end of the tunnel.

For example one guy asked me to take the morning after pill after consensual unprotected sex, another asked me to an event, then pulled the invitation the day of the event , another guy wrote some pretty mean things about me to another friend that I later found out about. These men later apologized, but I couldn't get over the sketchiness of it all.

I’m 52 and been single for awhile like 5 years from a serious relationship.  I am still sexually active but more of FWB. 
So I matched with a woman.  She is definitely not my type and I am not hers either.  But we met and there was some kissing, which was long overdue and very good for both of us.  So we were talking about then next step and she has only had sex with her husband for the past 24 years. 
So we are in the phone.  Her friend tells her to be honest about what she needs, what she’s used to and what she enjoys. 
I am completely into this because I enjoy satisfying her more then myself.  
So her expectation is what she has been doing for the past 24 years.  2-4 hours of sex every time.  
Every time for 24 years.
I have had them when I was younger but that was I call a marathon session.  Stay in bed all day. 
She’s had no quickies (which she thinks is a 30-40 minute session) which is what I’m used to as normal.  A quickie is 10-15 minutes for a spontaneous, hey meet me in the Starbucks bathroom thing.
I thought she was joking but dead serious. 
I really don’t think I am interested anymore.  Even if I meet her and it’s great.  It’s still wouldn’t be a 3 orgasm over a couple of hours. I am not worried that I am inadequate.  But there’s not really a way for me to feel that I was as from her perspective. 
Lots of other issues that are secondary. 
But my question is what would you do?  How much of a train wreck is this? 
I see a good friendship.  But probably not much on a serious nature.

The whole time we were dating he was badmouthing his ex, such as (these are his words) she was a narcissist, bipolar, verbally and mentally abusive, not a nice person, and mean. He never felt he was wanted. For example she would call him fat all the time and tell him she'll leave him if he doesn't stay fit.

I felt genuinely sorry that it happened to him. His stories made me really hate his ex. I really cared about him (probably too soon) and I made sure he feels appreciated and wanted all the time. He was nice to me. But I guess I was invested too much too soon in this relationship. And it's all my fault.

* She’d say awful things, and I thought she might be being sarcastic but she wasn’t. Or sometimes she was. But it was always my fault for not understanding how she communicates, and unacceptable that I had to ask for clarification.
* She did one of my least favorite things, arguing angrily with me about something I actually agree with anyway. 
* “Corrected” me about several factual things that I was not actually wrong about. 
* Was elitist and treated me like I was lucky to go out with her ... based only on aforementioned incorrect assumptions about me. (Was surprised to discover I had any creative ambitions, because I'm ""not an artist"" and ""work in payroll or something."" (I do not work in payroll. I write and paint daily.)

We are both 42 and met in September. He moved in around February- I was not in a rush to start dating him but he swore I am the one and still stands by that. I am at a point in my life where I'd really like to have a real partner to love and cherish and treat well. I love him but he rubs me the wrong way often. I cant help but feel uncomfortable about his attitudes towards women. He's an obvious flirt (with attractive women only) and while I'm not trying to draw attention to my jealousy he has pried it out of me a few times when sensing something is wrong and then made me feel stupid or called me crazy for sharing my feelings. 

One big thing that bothered me quite a bit that I'm not sure if I'm being irrational about is that he keeps company with a lot of kids in their early 20s, and is still friends with younger girls he's been with. One girl is 22 and he slept with her 2 years ago when she was 20 and he was 40. To me this seems like a red flag, but he played it off as totally normal- I mean, I know its legal but honestly it bothers me and feels predatory. Another girl he says is just a friend that's 24 and calls him her uncle- he told me not to be worried because she's too young for him, yet I know about the other girl that's 2 years younger.  He does have other friends our age group, and I like most of them and they like me. But it bothers me that he wants to keep close ties to such young women. He at first tried to introduce me to the 22 year old and I firmly told him I never want to meet her... maybe that was wrong but that's how I feel. I have met and hung out with the 24 year old and have slowly accepted they are just friends (although I cant see what he's getting from the friendship, she seemed immature for her age) but he seems to be upset with me for questioning him at all, and sort of turned it around on me as being a jealous weirdo. 

There are other things too that have degraded my trust, but only because they have aroused my suspicions- so far I don't think he's actually done anything I should worry too much about.  Im typically not the jealous type, I feel I am attractive and talented and a great catch, and yet I'm left feeling insecure instead of reassured. I am worried this guy is going to get bored of me and leave me in the dust. But, he swears I'm the one and says he wants to get married, and that he would never hurt me.

I'm happy in my body, it's warm, squashy and a good cushion. However, feedback from people around me is I need  to loose weight to make sure if I meet someone they won't stray. This advice is on the back of my ex having cheated on me with a lovely waif like woman.

I'm just wondering if this is really true? If I stay happy and fat as I am, does that mean any man I get with will leave or cheat if he gets a chance with someone more attractive?

I'm not fishing for positive affirmation about my body, I just want to know the real hard truth! Do I/women really need to be under a certain weight in order to have a secure (&amp;sexy!) future with a man?

34,njm24c,1621818683,Small Victories,"TL, DR Version: Recently approached 2 women (not at the same time!), found out through conversation that they have boyfriends, may have gained 2 new friends anyway. The fact that I approached them is a small victory for me.

Long version: My ex-fiancee and I decided almost 3 years ago that things just weren't right for us so we mutually agreed to end our relationship. We have maintained a friendship though we aren't as close as we used to be which, I feel, is natural. I only recently began to consider the possibility of dating again. 

Historicaly, I've either been set up by friends or women have approached me. A lack of confidence and a fear of rejection (among other difficult things) manifested themselves back when I was a teenager. I certainly did not have good role models when it comes to relationship when I was younger either. There have been times when I've been totally clueless when a woman is expressing interest in me, too!

I regularly visit the gym and have made conversation with these 2 women in the past so, after I finally decided that ""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", I stuck up conversations and found that they have boyfriends. I asked one if she would be interested in talking more which is when she told me she has a bf but also said she's open to making new friends. I felt a littte awkward after that exchange, TBH. As for the other, the conversation was a bit more casual but I found an opening and was able to ask if she has a significant other and she said she did. Our conversation continued to flow so that was more comfortable overall.

For someone who has had lots of challenges when it comes to feeling confident enough to ""put myself out there"", I view both of these experiences as victories for me. It's also been that way for me when it comes to just making friends. I usually make them through work but am interested in widening that circle. I have made some nice friends at the gym - we'll workout together or just socialize a bit. I've looked into some volunteering at a place I support through my membership but they are holding off on that for a little longer. I looked a little bit online at Meetup and may dig more into that. I consider myself a more reserved, introverted person but that doesn't mean I want to be a hermit living in a cave for the rest of my life, either. Having a companion would be nice to experience life together and if it leads to an intimate relationship, then that would also be quite nice.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading this lengthy post. I've lurked in the sub quite a while and have commented at times but this is the first new post I've put up here.

36,njnf4o,1621823191,Any advice?," I'm looking for as many opinions as possible. Reaching out for opinions online from total strangers is perfectly normal right?

I have a second home in a very rural area in the mountains where cabins and homes are spread out. The area provides loads of recreation year-round and is a popular place for tourism. This summer, my plan is to do more hiking and get out to areas I haven't yet seen. I recently met the neighbor lady who is a full-time resident out there and she needs someone to hike with so it's a perfect setup.

We've been on a couple of hikes now so we've spent many hours in the woods alone, walking, climbing, and talking. It's great and I look forward to the next one. We laugh and relate with each other but are very different in some ways as well. We are neighbors. She gave me a quick tour of her house, I did the same a week later. We borrow things from each other and can talk comfortably about many topics. 

2 things:

**I'm developing a crush on this woman.**

**She's a widow of just over 2 years.**

I'd just like to hear some opinions so I can maybe turn my brain off about it. She grew up in a foreign country so any little signal at all that I pick up on is most likely not a signal and just wishful thinking on my part. My brain is telling me to not rock the boat and be happy with what we have but then my other brain is telling me to ""shoot my shot"" and possibly mess everything up. 

The widow thing is huge. She was in a very good marriage full of travel and adventure and I believe she still struggles with the loss. I wouldn't say we flirt at all in the traditional sense and she has in no way lead me on. She's a super-intelligent, talented woman who hasn't yet figured out what she wants next in life. I've been divorced for a year with 1 post-divorce STR under my belt.                  ",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/njnf4o/any_advice/

So, about an hour into our hike I just simply asked him why he wasn’t asking me more about myself. I told him that it felt concerning to me that he wasn’t asking me more questions and seemed to indicate a lack of interest in me as a person. But, I also pointed out that I was really enjoying his company and found him to be a very kind and considerate person- so I assumed it was a misunderstanding of communication styles. 

He was completely stunned that I would think he was not interested in me in any way. He told me that he felt like if he was quiet and allowed me to talk, I would be more likely to share the things that were important to me- and that he had been waiting for me to do that. We talked about it for a while and for the rest of the day met in the middle. He did ask me more questions but I also spoke more openly. We had a fantastic time. I think he’s awesome and look forward to seeing him again.

38,njoidk,1621826943,Boyfriend (50M) broke up with me (41F) because of my crazy ex,"I have been dating this guy for 5 months on and off. He was a good guy and I was proud of myself not picking another a.hole like I did for a husband. 

He had trust issues because of his previous marriage and just would stop communicating with me or breaking up a few times because he was trying to protect his feelings instead of resolving issues by talking. I was patient with him as I understood that feeling. He came around each time and apologized so we moved on. 

Everything was going well and we were having so much fun together. I didn't have big expectations as it had been years since I was in a relationship and I just wanted to be happy in the present without thinking 10 steps ahead. 

We were gonna meet today. He called me and told me basically he is breaking up with me because: He has only 4 years left until his kid turns 18 years old (When he said he has only 4 years left I thought he had cancer or something) so he doesn't have to deal with his ex. However, I have 10 years left before my kids turn 18. He doesn't want to take on responsibility for my kids and my crazy ex and doesn't see himself being in that situation. 

He has not met my kids or my ex-husband. He only knows what I tell him. I am going through some stuff with my ex-husband but nothing about the kids at the moment as custody got resolved even before I met this guy. 

I am shocked that he would break up with me today for this reason. I knew he always had issues with resolving conflicts but I didn't think he would break up with me for this reason. He knew from the beginning I had kids and not a very nice ex-husband. 

Does this happen often as a break up reason? I had not been dating since my divorce so the dating scene is quite new to me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/njoidk/boyfriend_50m_broke_up_with_me_41f_because_of_my/

I also frequent certain places to read or crochet (surprisingly this has been a conversation starter with two guys my age, one saying he didnt know any women that even crocheted anymore). However. Having at least Match free version is giving me perspective on who is out there and some dates from that is great.

So, it was a refreshing change that both that I had been communicating with were willing to stay in touch.

But it's nice to feel like I can fully implement my plan to meet new people (in general). Anyhow.

I've started OLDing again. I talked to one guy and we had a decent conversation. We planned a date for the weekend. The afternoon after our first and last phone conversation he calls and said the battery went out on his truck. OK, that's tough. He said a tow truck driver was there but he was charging $75, but he only had $30 and left his credit card at home. Poor baby. He said he had called his brother for the $45 but the brother wasn't answering. I told him OK, try your brother again he might answer now. I hung up and blocked him. He started back to back calling and texting me. Asking how can I leave him out there, and he thought I had his back. I never even met you but now I'm your emergency contact? For a bs emergency, I told him to call Uber. But I blocked him because he said he had triple A, but it would take them an hour. So you rather ask me then wait an hour. He sent me his cashapp ID.

I talked to this different guy on the phone about a week. We met and were planning our next date. He says babydoll whatever you want or need I will finance it, you don't have to worry. I said ok. But I wanted to laugh in his face. I probably make more money than he does. Hearing this had no effect on me at all. Anything I want or need I can pay for myself that's why I go to work every day.

If you etc..

I mean, it sucks you had a bad experience or your ex did horrible things to you. But Karen, yes you Karen are standing in the middle of a crowded room complaining about your problems. There isn't much space there, perhaps fill it with more positive things about yourself and what you enjoy?

56,nkh6be,1621917233,Guys: please go ahead and ask for the date and be specific PLEASE,"We all know that OLD is awful and time-consuming and depressing. However, it’s also the biggest game in town for modern dating. But personally, I find it MUCH more pleasant and successful when an in-person meetup happens sooner rather than later. 

Endless app messaging and texting is boring. I don’t care how cool we both are. Also, keeping it entirely PG for days and days is sort of odd, but going down the sex-talk road before meeting in person is often a bad choice for a host of reasons. Getting a daily “good morning” or “how was your day” text from someone I’ve never met just ends up feeling blah. 

The solution is pretty simple. Within the first 48 hours, ask for a date. Something simple, short, and inexpensive or free. A coffee, a walk, a drink if you’re so inclined. Meet in person in a public place. See if you vibe. No you don’t have to buy dinner or plan something extravagant. Just hang out for an hour and chat. 

Nothing, including phone calls and video chats, can take the place of talking in person. And nothing makes it clearer whether or not you’ll want to keep seeing each other. 

I’ve had SO many guys keep messaging for days without asking for a date, and I’ve reached the point where I usually drop out after 3 or 4 days of this. I just don’t have the energy. If I really see potential, I might hint around; if they don’t get the hint, I’m out. 

I want to be clear and say that YES, I know women can also ask. But years of dating have shown me that—especially in the over-40 demographic—guys don’t really love it when women do the asking. Hints maybe (“I wonder how we will get along in person!”) but not the actual ask. It would be great if that gender bias weren’t true, but there you go.

57,nkij2r,1621922261,Looking for baggage that goes with mine… and afraid?,"Anyone else so nervous about being in this dating pool with baggage? I am, my certainly, not in a glass house throwing stones. I have a spouse that had an affair (of which I had no idea and happened to be out-of-state with my first cousin’s wife!) and then held the pieces together for our then 14- and 16-yo daughters. Currently manage an ex-relationship with a true narcissist and - the icing on the cake - live NEXT DOOR to his parents/my former in-laws. It’s a Lifetime Movie of bad on which I’d change the channel if it wasn’t my life. 

And, yet, I’ve surprised. I’m here and still hopeful. I feel like I’ve grown and (mostly) moved through it as time has passed, we’ve divorced, I realized my resilience and strength. 

But I’ll never forget my female lawyer saying to me at the end of it all that what she sees as a result of decades of being a family attorney specializing in complicated divorce is not a person coming out and blaming the opposite gender for faults, it’s doubting her/himself in a future relationship.

So I dabbled in the dating world premiere-covid with an app. It was likely too soon (and pre-covid). Chatted with one guy who seemed great - wanted to only meet at bars and hook up post wife. Second guy seemed fairly great - nice, talkative, common interests. Only when were offhand talking about dealbreakers did he confess to having an affair, staying with her until literally the week he asked me out. 

I missed the signs. I know we’ll have over forty “baggage” from a live lived. But how do I know to trust the possible partner? One version of an end of relationship is all we hear. Intentions that focus on self-needs or self-preservation at this stage. 

I don’t know. It seems so risky. But I’d like to believe I’ll be someone special for another someone. 

Just venting, I suppose. But would love to hear from others that feel the same way.

Matched on OLD, and we have met for coffee once and two dinner dates. We have a lot of fun during the dates and our texting styles really match up well (neither of us likes to text much, so this is great). Conversation has been great. Good kisser! 

However. 

I've initiated all three meetups (plus one more proposed meetup that didn't happen because he was busy). I initiate almost all of the texting, when we do text (mostly to make plans). Which is fine, I don't have any truck with gender roles. However I do want reciprocity and I don't want to be doing *all* the initiating! 

So on our third meetup (second dinner date) I mentioned this explicitly twice, like, ""I am looking for a partner who can reciprocate my effort in a relationship, like planning dates and just making stuff happen for us,"" and later at the end of the date, when he told me he would love to see me again, I said, ""Let me know what we're doing next time!"" 

That was last Thursday. There has been only one contact between us since, and that's when I texted him on Saturday morning from my solo camping trip over the weekend. He responded to my text immediately but no contact since. Normally that's fine by me! But now my friends are contacting me to make plans for the upcoming weekend, and I'm almost fully booked up already. 

Should I warn him that my plans for the weekend tend to get firmed up by Tuesday or Wednesday, so if we want to meet over the weekend we should plan something now? But that would be me initiating contact and initiating plans *yet again*, and I really don't want to do that. I want to sit back and see if he is interested enough to do some of the work.

Physical closeness. I come from a physically close family as well- but she will climb into bed with him and cuddle, and even pouts if I'm there...like a girlfriend who doesn't want to share. Again- I'm not a stranger to physically close families, but this feels...creepy at 26.

There are other, little and less obvious things: I've caught him lying about where he's been and it'll turn out that he's been with her (why lie about visiting your daughter??). He won't say no to her or draw *any* boundaries about anything- He will go to great lengths to avoid upsetting her. The only argument I've seen him willingly have with her was over the fact that he didn't like the guy she was dating. 

I've been wondering if I'm reading into things, but something recently came to light that was a full stop for me. W/o going into detail, he basically helps manage distribution of her pornographic material. He claims he never sees it, but I'm not sure that matters, because regardless: I believe that there should be a CLEAR AND FIRM boundary between sex and your kids, and this, to me, is at the very least WAY too blurred for me to handle.

He says that part will stop- but I'm not sure I can get past it because to me it's a sign my instincts on the other things are right on.

Am I a overreacting? Or is this all as creepy as I think it is? Honestly, my heart is broken and I feel like vomiting, taking a hot shower, and packing my bags.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nkw0vr/unhealthy_adult_daughterfather_relationship/

64,nl1aly,1621980316,Need advice: Ex (33F) is staying with me (33M) for a week. She and I want a child?,"She is flying in to visit friends and is staying with me for a week. She and I are getting older and both hear a bio clock ticking.

We broke up three years ago when our relationship became toxic she left for a job halfway across the country for  50% less and in a career she hates. I really have no idea why she took the job, maybe to get away from me.

Over the last three years, we talked every day and I visited her numerous times and her me. I feel like I'm getting better but she has severe depression, is full of hate and resentment. Part of her resentment is me never proposing after in the relationship for 5 five years (we broke up at 9 years).

Anyways I say all that to say this. She and I are getting older. She made it clear she wants to have a child and wants to have plenty of sex while she is in town.  We are both single. I do want a child,  I always imagined my first child would be in a loving marriage. Online dating has been a dumpster fire for me and although I've dated a number of women none of them was anyone I would want to settle down with by choice.

This seems like an opportunity to have a kid before its too late. My only concern is my ex (who I love) is horrible at making decisions.  For instance, she makes shitty financial AND health decisions all the time and then I have  to bail her out, OR she just suffered the consequences without saying anything. She is horrible at long term planning.  However, I know  she will be a loving mother.  To be honest I'm kind of worries this is my last opportunity to have a child with someone I love... But  I'm not really sure what to do.

Any advice?

69,nl6cub,1621996524,Update: Had my date with “overtexting guy” tonight. Was a total letdown. I should have followed my instincts that he was too much too soon.,"
Hi all! Many of you asked me to follow up after taking advice to deal with a guy who was sending me frequent low-quality texts right after we matched. 

We talked on the phone and had easy conversations and I didn’t pick up any red flags. When I told him my preference about texting less, he seemed understanding and backed off for a couple of days. 

Then he ramped back up and started love bombing me with messages about how excited he was about our date. 

He canceled our date at the last minute on Sunday with a story about needing to help his young nephew who recently lost his dad. I should have just blocked and deleted, but the story seemed plausible so I offered him a chance to make it up.

We made dinner plans tonight and texted for hours on Monday and Tuesday. Really covered all kinds of ground and seemed to have tons of interests and attitudes in common. He kept telling me how he wanted to give me a big hug and kiss me, though. Which made me feel uncomfortable enough to ask him to cool it.

This morning he texted me before 7am to say good morning. And I told him I needed to stay off my phone to get some things done since I had spent so much time texting with him the last two days. He kept on texting me about the date and the kissing though. And I started to dread the date. 

When he showed up he was really attractive like in his photos and we walked to a restaurant about a half mile away. He talked about himself throughout dinner and didn’t pull out my chair for me, even though I stood there waiting for him to do so.

We walked back to my neighborhood where he had parked and I kissed him goodbye. It was a nice kiss. But before I had gotten back in the house he texted me that he had a hard time controlling himself. We had made a second date and I told him I found him attractive but wanted to get to know him better before we got much more physical.

He told me I had already gotten to know him and had been giving him different signals with our texting. 

I texted back that I was sorry I had given him the wrong impression and didn’t intent to waste his time or mine. Then I blocked him and deleted our match online. 

So back to the drawing board for me. I feel good about going through the experience this week because I really learned that when I feel irritated or unsure right off the bat, I should listen to my instincts.

My life now is pretty ok. I have a good job, a nice place and the best dog in the world. I’m seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and am trying to work through my trauma so I don’t repeat the same thing with any future partner.

I’ve started thinking about dating again, and given my age, the pandemic, and the fact that most of the friends I had pre-marriage moved away, I thought I’d give OLD a try. It was how I met my last two partners so I’m not new to it. 

But this time, I just hate it. I find it really scary but I don’t know why. I can find something wrong with everyone and am pretty convinced that most people are either narcs, catfish, or have some other toxic baggage that I’m too scared to discover. I turn on my profiles only to hide them the second someone likes or messages me. I even paid for a premium service only to ask the company for my money back once I saw likes and messages, which overwhelmed me. (I’m not engaging with the messages so I don’t think I’m being an asshole by not replying, but I do worry about that too.)

Met this guy at my apt complex dog park. Had some good conversations that weren't just about the dogs. Saw him three times when we were the only ones there. I thought there was a connection. We were just hanging out and out of the blue he says he has to go and quickly leaves. 

Next time I see him there are a bunch of people there and I start talking to a guy I have known for three years while this other guy is hanging out away from every one else. I made a point out of saying hi and he was really distant. I just went and hung out with other neighbors and met a woman I really hit it off with. As a friend, I'm straight. 

So then the next time he was still stand offish but then asks if I've been vaccinated? I talked to him and another woman about vaccinations and going back to the office etc. He also said that he was moving to a rental house and looked sad. 

Then Saturday I was at the pool sitting on a lounge chair minding my own business looking down at my phone and I see him walk by out of the corner of my eye. He sits down three chairs away, goes and puts his feet in the water and gets up and leaves after 5 minutes. 

What the hell? Am I missing some thing? Is he nuts? Who stays at the pool for 5 minutes? 

Saw him again yesterday and asked when he is moving because honestly its getting awkward. Not until the end of July. I said ""oh so I will see again"" and smiled awkwardly. I didn't tell him its awkward.

86,nlvc7h,1622074639,Reasonable or Red Flags?,"I (48f) have recently moved to a new city and waded into the OLD scene. I have had many successful dates and a few very disappointing experiences... 

One thing important to mention is that I moved just before covid lockdown and did not have the opportunity to make friends or build a social circle. I am living by myself and as a result very bored and lonely. This is important as I feel it puts me in a disadvantaged position and may skew my behavior/ perception. 

Currently I am chatting with a (37m) considerably attractive, established, career oriented man (albeit younger than myself) and I am very confused by his behavior.

By virtue of the playful nature of our texts, we have seen each other several times in the past weeks, but always in a  spontaneous and quirky way ( to get a cookie from a batch I had baked not related to him; to try out the new shower head I had purchased). We have not had sex, or even kissed but the encounters do have an underlying sexual connotation.

While all this has been light and fun, it seems to be nothing beyond that; I mentioned that I was being to wonder if he was actually interested in me, and he assures me that he is but he is really busy and moves very slow.

Please let me know if the following sounds reasonable or like red flags:

- texting is generally reasonable, but takes a while to respond; will respond at very odd hours sometimes.

- is responsive but doesn't share much; will answer questions but rarely asks questions of me.

- Has been having issues sending / receiving texts. Seems he is not getting notifications of my texts and sometimes states 'why aren't my texts going through?'. I was starting to think he is just playing me, but the timing seems random and he continues to engage me after these incidences.

- while he is responsive during the week, he generally does not text on the weekends and seems to have a very busy social life.

- while trying to keep it light, my attempts to make plans and arrangements aren't going anywhere; he seems uninteresting in making time for me.

- when chatting casually / playfully (what should I bake next to lure you over, etc.), he will drop a 'just finishing up and I am out of here for a week'; then he goes radio silence.

- he is not very expressive and very hard to read; I did bring this up with him and he said that yes he is not expressive at all and he is aware of this.


I have been to his place twice and know he is truthful about his occupation and absolutely believe that he is busy.
And also believe that he has a full and previously established social life.

He is very attractive, successful, and increasingly interesting  as I learn more. Which frankly I was surprised by as I was being to think he was too pretty to be interesting.

Overall I am very attracted and intrigued, but wholly confused by his behavior. I can't help but think that he is just fucking with me.
But, I have never experienced a guy that wanted to take things slow and not try to get in my pants on the first date.....

So, does he sound legitimate or is he just entertaining himself at my expense?

TL;DR  I am looking for advice on if I am wasting my time with this person or if he may have genuine interest in me. His particular behaviour is foreign to me and therefore I am unsure if my typical interpretation is sound.
And, given living / being alone during the isolation of covid, I am having a hard time trusting my instincts.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nlvc7h/reasonable_or_red_flags/

91,nlzay6,1622088920,Relationship status lying or bait-and-switching?,"I read a tweet today from a stranger (@3366bb) who said:

“Never ask a man if he’s single. Instead ask him ‘Is anyone under the impression they are in a relationship with you?’ “

I had to sit down for a minute with that one. And it can apply to either gender. 

Now, I’m coming off a divorce where my spouse had an affair but she was known to our family (a relative, actually), so they both knew they were married. 

But as I think about dating over forty, do you all find that people fib about their relationship status often? Either married and on the prowl still? Or say they are divorced but they aren’t? Or seriously dating someone but looking for that greener grass?

The idea sort of floored me - it’s a smart rephrasing of the question, but do y’all think it’s necessary?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nlzay6/relationship_status_lying_or_baitandswitching/

93,nm5ldn,1622115939,..And he was actually rounding 60 (a tale of why deceptive age/photos shouldn't be done),"Hi all, some of us have shared stories about showing up and either the man or woman (we discover) looks obviously and significantly older and/or we learn they lied about their age. In sharing this week, yet here is another time that has happened.  Moving forward: I'm going to kindly and flat out ask men to tell me their age and how old their photos are if the photos aren't dated. I keep mine within 3 months and date them on the caption. I think with this OLD it is reasonable at this point to be asking. 

Keep in mind I'm 44....
His profile said 55. 
His photos looked ok for that. 
He walked into the place, and I didn't even recognize him. He looked frail/much older. I did a double take but it took his introducing himself at the host stand to fully realize it was him. In the photos he looked bulky and much younger. As this wasn't a matter of photoshop being used. Now, if he had been recently ill and lost a lot of muscle mass/or weight, he did not mention. If that were me and would have been the case,  I would have been taking updated photos or at least said oh hey before we meet Fyi I may look a little leaner right now due to (fill in blank of illness or situation) as it is that obvious in his pics. Esp if say a person gained 15 pounds recently out of thr norm but historically the photos used is how they always look and they are working to get it off. I can see that maybe happening also. With explanation, that can be understandable. 

We were talking for some time, and then discussing ages of kids and hia college years etc. And I get him caught up where he said in a way that was not convincing how oh yeah, he is actually 59 but ..and here we go with this BS that we always here, ""the app messed up my birth date"". Right. 

Here is the thing, if you created an app and it ""messed up thr birthdate"", they do ask for you to verify/confirm it then you click to the next step. I had to do this, so the ""they messed up"" is BS as YOU are the one entering the info. You can also contact customer experience team to correct if it is example Match. You can also delete and start over since you hadn't gone too far down the road in creating your profile yet or on off chance you paid for a subscription and didn't want to mess that all up, at minimum write in profile about the error and actively work on getting it corrected. 

To show up on a date and then it takes my line of questioning to share how old they actually are is wrong. 59 is near 60 (and I think his birthday is coming up). (My mom is 65 example). 

I just can't imagine how put off a guy would be if he was in his 30s and I said I was 39 (and used younger photos) then showed up and he sees it doesn't add up that I'm 39 then I say oh, well, I'm actually about to be 45. And expect him to be ok with that.  Don't assume that a few extra years shouldn't be a big deal to someone that doesn't mind some bit of age gap. It's deceptive and making an assumption that isn't fair to the other person. 

I just had to share that for our wonderful Reddit Over 40, if anyone has thought of fudging their age. And I have been told some men do it to play the algorithm and get in front of younger women. Esp the 'I feel young for my age' crowd. Equally, some women do it if they feel they ""look young for their age' and want to be aure their profiles get in front of younger age brackets. However, let's not lose sight that inaccurate ages and old photos is being deceptive.

95,nm89xw,1622124502,I think I have to walk away and I’m heartbroken.,"I (F40) have been dating M51 for 20 months.  We both have busy lives, what with work and kids - I have 3 teenagers and he has 2 under 10.

I am a full time mum, though now my kids are older they are relatively self sufficient, he is a full on dad but has the kids in a rotation pattern meaning that he has every Wednesday and Thursday free and every other Friday, Saturday and Sunday free.

I mainly see him every Wednesday and then Friday night through to Sunday on his free weekends.  I also pop in for the occasional cup of coffee.

We’ve both met each other’s kids, had the occasional dinner etc, but our kids haven’t met each other.

We have connected on every single level and we both see each other as best friends and lovers.  I am 100% sure of how he feels about me.

So why am I thinking of walking away?!

I just don’t see enough off him!!

I’ve brought this up a few times, the last time being a couple of weeks ago.  I said I’m struggling with the amount that we see each other and the amount we communicate outside of seeing each other.  He said he was completely shocked by that, that he has no more of himself to give and that you only get one life and I should really think about what I want.

We chatted for a while and he said he doesn’t do well when he feels pressured, especially when there’s nothing he can do about the situation.  In the end I said his response made me angry and sad, but that I want him and us.

We had a really lovely weekend together, as well as more communicating about ourselves.

So since the restrictions have lifted (17th May UK) and his boys can now go back to their sports clubs, two Wednesday’s on the trot he has taken them to club.  The first Wednesday I went round after and then the second Wednesday (yesterday)I said I wouldn’t be coming round.  Then tomorrow what should be our Friday he is away with work and won’t be back until late.

I am spending Saturday and Sunday at his.

Wednesday is supposed to be his free day, and his ex should and would take the boys to club.  He already takes them to other clubs Monday’s and Tuesday’s, Saturday’s when he has them and Sunday’s every week.  I have already said I am struggling about lack of time, and now this is cutting into our time even more.

He is a wonderful dad and his boys are, quite rightly, his priority.  I feel so guilty about being annoyed that he is spending time with his boys.

But this is making me so sad at times.  I think my main issue is I know that there  is no room for manoeuvre on this.  As soon as I bring it up again, he will say again that life is too short to be unhappy and I should work out what I want.

He has never mislead me about his time, but lockdown has!  And maybe if I’d have realised this 14 months ago I wouldn’t have let this relationship go so deep.

I think I need to walk away, but I’m heartbroken.

96,nmaj7l,1622130857,How is dating supposed to go anyway?,"So after my divorce I find myself back in the dating pool and I'm having difficulty navigating the waters. Most of my relationships were always clear cut and monogamous right off the bat, so this new style of dating that is the norm nowadays is leaving me so confused. Am I supposed to be in contact with the gentleman I'm interested in daily? Or should I wait a couple of days in between? How often should we be seeing each other? 

I met someone on Hinge, we went on two dates, texted daily, which then slowed down, a relief actually because trying to keep up conversation can get kind of boring. I texted him today after two days of not hearing from him and he replied within a reasonable timeframe. Is this normal? I don't know how this works (partially because I'm from a different culture where dating isn't really practiced, you're either a couple or you're not).
