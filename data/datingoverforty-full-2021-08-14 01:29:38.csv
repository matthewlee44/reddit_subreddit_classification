Like they are way more open and vulnerable with feelings than the men my friends date… I am familiar wi the love-bombers (married one, identified red flags in therapy every since and now really good at spotting) but this isn’t it. 

Basically they keep at the vulnerability/closeness stuff… really get into me… especially more after we get physical… and then suddenly… once I am starting to catch it back, they back off. If not a ghost, then something of a “you deserve someone better, I can’t be the right person for you, or, sometimes, they fall into a deep depression and check out to care for themselves.

This time with better boundaries around topics of discussion and ranting, and trusting that the other person will say when the need to “tap out” of a convo. Honestly, so far it’s been even better than before.
Something that has come up in my head about us though, we’re technically long distance. Now it is only a 90 minute drive but that’s still significant to the shape the relationship begins to take I think. 

So what I’m wondering is:

How has the long distance affected relationships you’ve had? Or if you haven’t had one, would you? A 90 mins drive away is significant enough that it disrupts normal life. I have to get someone to feed my cat. I can work remotely but I am still “going out of town” when I go see him. 

Some back story: My ex fiancé and I did long distance the first two years we were together. He also happened to be a 90 minute drive away. We were both about 25, both in school, and we’d switch off weekends to go see the other. I’m convinced, however, that it allowed us to completely miss/ignore some key compatibility issues. Namely his level of introversion and my level of extroversion. I stopped having friends bc I was always with him or out of town with him. And you can’t very well do the living together “test” by essentially staying at each others’ houses often - but still getting to live your life. You’re basically constantly on vacation every time you see them. I feel as though I haven’t really had any boyfriend who I was this into since him (besides surfer boy), who also lived relatively close to me. (The why of that is a whole other post entirely lol…)

So, can long distance give you a false sense of compatibility? Even at this age with this amount of wisdom and experience?

He texted me while I was shopping with a few links to places he'd like for us to go on our first date and tip tell me that it had been one of the best conversations he'd had on a long time. I replied that I enjoyed our conversation, one of the places looked fun, and that I'd enjoy it with him. A few hours later he texted ""Are you OK?"" I replied that I was good and spending time with my family.

Fast forward to today. I was helping the family this morning, and then went to the gym. When I left the gym I called him to say hi and chat for a few minutes.

He was really cold and abrupt. I commented along the lines of, ""why do you sound so serious?""

He responded that I needed to be quiet and listen. I was taken aback by the comment. So I just said, ""OK"". He made some other similar remark, and I said ""OK, bye"" and hung up. 

Then he texted me just saying ""idiot?"" I wasn't sure if he was asking a question or insulting me, so I just sent back a ""?"". To which he replied  ""the definition of an idiot is someone who thinks they're so smart that they don't listen to anyone. You need to listen.""

I said, ""I'm not sure if you're trying to insult me or not.""
He said he was, and ""I listened for 30 minutes straight to see if you'd stop and let me talk. You need to listen."" He followed it up with ""f*** off"".

I was stunned. But, I couldn't let it rest. I said I apologize if I upset you, but that was unnecessary and that he could have hung up at anytime. He basically kept repeating his earlier comments. So, I pointed out that after hanging up he had researched places to go (he just moved to the area) and shared them with me. I also mentioned that he had texted me that evening too. So he'd had time to think about our interaction for several hours and was still interested in talking with me.

He continued with the same comments. So, I took the time to type out all of the things I could remember that he'd talked about during the 2 hour conversation. It was pretty lengthy. I sent it over to him. His response was ""See, all of that. That's the longest text I've ever received.""

I replied, ""it's a recitation of the things you talked about. It disproves your exclamations and insults. You talked a lot, and I was listening.""

His response, I kid you not: ""OK, we need to kiss hard and see if we connect.""

Me: ""not after you've told me to f*** off."" 
Him: ""OK, just meet with me."" 
Me:  ""you insulted me and told me to f*** off. That's not exactly date material."" 
Him: ""Sorry"" 
Me: ""learn not to be an ass""  (a dig at his ""learn to listen"" comments). 
Him: ""Love You"" 

WTAF! ""Love You?!"" In 24 hours you've gone from ""best conversation in a really long time"" to ""f*** off"" to ""love you"" and we have never met.

I have NEVER been with anyone who makes me laugh. I am always the “funny” one in the relationship and being single now for the first time in 17 years has me making a mental list of what I’d prefer in my next ex husband, rather than just making due with what comes along because YAY SOMEONE LIKES ME! I’d like to not be pathetic this go around. 

Humor. I’ve decided he needs to make me laugh. But a “funny” personality requirement is as vague as “must be hung”. So many opportunities for interpretation there. So in an effort to classify what I mean by “funny”, I came up with Monty Python vs Mr Bean personality “test”, if you will. 

I have never found anyone who enjoys both equally. You’re either a dry, British wit aspiring (unless you ARE British, in which case, well done you!), sarcastic filled, realism vs optimism like fellow….or you think Mr Bean is snort inducing. 
I’m all for physical humor - I cannot ever get enough Carol Burnett/Harvey Korman/Tim Conway (fucking trifecta of humor). But Mr Bean doesn’t even orbit the same planet in the same solar system of those founders of TV skits. 

So how to find MR. AMAZING? Do I throw out MP vs MB and see what happens? Do I do that FIRST THING? Because nothing would upset me more than matching with someone and hitting it off just to find they think MP is overrated. 
Ok, perhaps finding they’re a reformed ex con that served for pedophile crimes would be *worse*, or WORSE THAN THAT - a science denier - but stop judging my hyperbolic sentences. It’s rude. 

Do I just scrap Bumble (because honestly, it seems everyone on there is either a copy/paste whore or has zero self awareness and sense of humor (before you come after me - I’M also on Bumble, so shut. it. ) - and instead put a call out here, in the depths of despair (aka Reddit)? Something like CALLING ALL MID 40yr OLD DUDES WHO TOOK THE PEPSI CHALLENGE RE MONTY PYTHON AND MR BEAN (DM me but for the love of baby Jesus no dick pics, what’s wrong with you??)?? I mean, is that the route??

He has been separated for over a year, but continued to live in the same house as his wife to take care of their young children.

We started dating in late June and saw each other frequently for a few weeks, but then we were both traveling. We texted and talked on the phone, both excited to see each other again. When we returned in early August, we had an amazing weekend together. I began catching feelings. 

But the following week, he and his wife had to pack to move out of the house. She had to decided to move herself and the kids an hour away; he was planning to stay nearby. However, his living situation fell through (not due to finances) and he was undecided about the best path forward. For now, he has moved his things into storage and went to stay with friends near his kids' new house, to help them adjust. He's also been dealing with a lot of emotions - about leaving his long-time house, not living with his children, not having a place to live yet, etc. In essence, he is a mess and his life is a mess right now. 

I last saw him the evening before his move (into storage). We texted briefly once a few days ago. Otherwise, we haven't been in contact. I don't want to overwhelm him or add to his stress/emotional burden, but I also feel like I need more communication than this. I don't feel like a text every day or so is that difficult. But I also have never been in this situation.

I like him a lot and we connect so well physically and mentally, but I am torn because his life is so messy and complicated right now.

This time with better boundaries around topics of discussion and ranting, and trusting that the other person will say when they need to “tap out” of a convo. Honestly, so far it’s been even better than before.
Something that has come up in my head about us though, we’re technically long distance. It is only a 90 minute drive but that could still be significant to shape the relationship I think? There’s a few other factors as well. 

So what I’m wondering is:

How has the long distance affected relationships you’ve had? Or if you haven’t had one, would you? A 90 minute drive away is significant enough that it disrupts normal life. I have to get someone to feed my cat. I can work remotely but I am still “going out of town” when I go see him. 

Some back story: My ex fiancé and I did long distance the first two years we were together. He also happened to be a 90 minute drive away. We were both about 25, both in school, and we’d switch off weekends to go see the other. Yes we were both way younger, but I’m still convinced that it allowed us to completely miss/ignore some key compatibility issues. Namely his level of introversion and my level of extroversion. I stopped having friends bc I was always with him or out of town with him. And you can’t very well do the living together “test” by essentially staying at each others’ houses often - but still getting to live your life. You’re basically in vacation mode every time you see them. I feel as though I haven’t dated anyone I’ve been this into since him (besides surfer boy), who also lived relatively close to me. (The why of that is a whole other post entirely lol…)

I get random messages on this platform (I post a lot in lots of groups) and UNIVERSALLY if I get a ""hey"" AND I choose to engage it's a time waster.  

You don't have to write the Magna Carta.  You don't need to compose War and Peace.  A simple 

""Good morning!  You seem like an interesting person.  I'd love to chat if you like!""

or 

""Afternoon!  So, you seem to be an interesting person who's on the go.  What's the most fun thing you've done in the past four weeks?""

These opening messages will radically improve your response rate.  It will open the other person up to having a conversation other than mindless small talk.  It's easy and free.  You don't have to overthink this.

I m also a proud single mom of 3 daughters. I live in the US while im from the Middle East.
My ex husband was the only man i knew, so getting into dating is such a struggle. I took some friends advice and used dating apps. However, my pool of people is very small because im looking for someone with the same cultural background &amp; values. I find one who seems ok. Im a kind of person who never cared about looks. His profile was pkay and he is 44, i thought great.
I liked his profile amd things got rolling. That started in April 2021.
Thing is , i never had a normal relationship in my life, i do not know what is the norm. The first time we met the chemistry was instant and mutual. He has 3 kids and lives 30 miles away, so meeting frequently isn’t easy.
Suddenly he started to pull away. I noticed that im the one initiating communication almost all the time, im the one who asks to meet. One day I didn’t text and thought I’d wait and see……one week went by, he sent one text. Then another 2 weeks went by and nothing. I send a casual “hi”, he replies telling me that he jad his kids the past couple of weeks and they were away…etc (although i never asked). Then things got rolling again, but only if i reach out.
He told me he is an extremely indecisive person.

It feels genuine when we meet or talk. So im kinda baffled. Is he interested or is he ghosting me?
Also its been 4 months, is it okay to ask the question (what are we?)

The children often act spontaneously, freely, and without fear of judgement. The child's mind is fully in the present moment as he expresses his true honest feelings. Seeing such a child's performance most likely left you with a positive feeling inside.

Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, many of us lose the ability to express ourselves as freely as we once did. However, deep down inside we all still yearn for the freedom that the child embodies and for his unbridled spirit.

In a world where most are bound by rules and restrictions, there is nothing more attractive than a person who retains the ability to act freely with unapologetic authenticity.

I’ve known this man through a previous work connection, and in the periphery for the last 10 years or so. He was hired on at the firm I work for in January. 

We both have maintained as view of not dating people you work with for our entire professional careers. This is not something either of us will take lightly. 

While I think there has always been an attraction, we never acted upon it until a little over a week ago. We were hanging out after work and we just kissed. It just happened…kind of out of nowhere. And then the floodgates opened. We’ve both been having feelings for each other for a while and just let it come out. 

I haven’t slept with him, and I’m not sure if I will anytime soon…even though it’s been a long dry spell for me and there is definite chemistry haha. 

The thing is…I’ve been dating for about 3 years now since my divorce. I’ve not found any guy I could see a real “boyfriend” material…someone who makes me feel smitten but also who is mature, and smart, and has their shit together. 

We’re so compatible on so many levels. We make equivalent income, are both very dedicated to work and family, play music, watch the same shows…the list goes on and on. So of course, with my shit luck, here is this amazing man on a silver platter that I’m terrified of. 

Let me assure you that I am not seeking anything with a man. In fact I had recently turned off all apps because I really just don’t seem to find quality guys, and honestly I’m super happy with who I am and where I am in life. I want for nothing. But he just makes me smile and I can see a real future with him…but we work together. Very closely, in the same department, at a small firm. 

For now we are just taking it slow and seeing how things go. However, I feel so split on just wanting to say fuck it and just let myself feel all the feels, and also just saying we should stop now before we get ahead of ourselves. Ughhhh. I feel so torn. All of my friends that I have told are super supportive of me pursuing this…but I don’t want to make things weird for the other folks we work with.

Nice guy, great conversation, great company, great sex, very affectionate towards me, he has his stuff together as far as his personal situation goes, we have some (not all) of the same interests. He lives 10 minutes away (not to close not too far)… I mean basically, it’s pretty awesome. We see each other every weekend and usually are so engulfed in our careers during the week that we usually just say hello every day via text or sometimes we will talk in the phone for a few hours on a weeknight. But for the most part we wait til the weekend to see each other. 

He has done very nice things for me like gone shopping before I come over to cook meals that he knows I like, offered to help with my yard work multiple times, although I haven’t taken him up on it yet, but ya know ‘partnery’ things.. He has also referred to himself as my SO (still conscious of not saying boyfriend)…. 

All the above is fine, my frustration is that he has never spent the night. 

We talked early on about not seeing other people but that we both wanted to take it slow and build a friendship first. But it’s been almost a half year now and I’m okay will still taking it slow but despite the nice things he sometimes does for me, I’m starting to feel like we have settled into the FWB zone because of this. We get together every weekend, have great company, sex and then we do it again the next weekend. 

I’ve asked him in the past to stay, but he said he didn’t leave any lights on at home and his pets (cats) are there. Last night, he was at my place til 4am and we practically fell asleep on the couch together. I asked him just to stay over but he said he wouldn’t be able to sleep, so he headed home.

I definitely know he is truthful and don’t think it’s me. I think he is an introverted guy who’s home is where his heart is.

An important fact, is that he is a widower of 5 years. I believe he is in a healthy place with his grief. In fact he is a mental health counselor and we have talked in depth about grief as I have lost very close loved ones as well, although not a lover. The point there is that we have spoken about it and I am not threatened or anything about his situation nor has there been any reason for me to believe that he was not ready to move forward in his dating life.

Well, I wrote him a letter a few weeks back, and he responded immediately. We reconnected and there was lots of good chemistry and feelings.  We had a nice long talk and a nice long kiss, which felt amazing. Being with him felt like 'home'.

We've been spending some time together over the past week, no overnights yet b/c of our kids. Our kids were friends (that's how we met at the park) and so we had a couple play dates together plus on evening of us visiting each other alone.

We talked about making plans for this coming weekend yesterday. He knows a few places I like to go to and things I like to do.

When I arrived at his place for dinner he shared with me that he got us a weekend away plus tix to a concert for Fri and we'd stay Fri-Sunday.  I'd made plans w/a friend on Friday night and told him.

He admitted he should have asked me first, but I was SO EXCITED that a guy would go to those lengths for me.  This has not happened in a while.  I decided to ask my friend if we could post pone (no plans set in stone).  She said she had concerns about him making such elaborate plans w/out asking me.  


Then I started freaking out that maybe he's a controlling guy.  I am working on codependency and setting boundaries and thought, hmm...maybe she is right.  

so I called him and shared that I'm so grateful for his thoughtfulness but that I'd like to be included in plan making, or at least the general idea of plan making moving forward. I shared that we are still really getting to know each other and that  we need to know what each other needs in a partner.  He said okay and that it just came from a place of being excited and knowing I liked all of these things. I reafirmmed that it was not the actual plans, but the idea of just not checking w/me first.

Now I'm conflicted about my approach. I prob should have waited until I saw him in person to say this, but I didn't want to chicken out.  I start to question myself. 

So, I open it up to the good people of Reddit- 

Is it a red flag for a guy to make a weekend plan (and pay for it BTW), or could it simply be a really kind and loving gesture?  We are 'new' to dating but have known each other a year as friends who learned a lot about each other the first 6 months then didn't speak for about 6 months.

Othewise he's been honest, open with his heart and home, and cooked dinner for my son and I and his kids tonight.

He is separated (never again) and living in separate household and getting divorce that has become very contentious.

He told me he loved me and wanted to marry me within a few weeks of meeting and we spent night and day together when I didn’t have my children.  We got along very well and my children adore him.  About 6 weeks ago I became sad because the reality of dating a married man consumed me - I don’t know his children or his family.   I informed him of the concerns I was having (bad timing).  He assured me he loved me and told me things would change at end of year but he was self reflecting.  He said he wanted to continue seeing me but we have been fighting over little things past month like we are testing each other (misinterpreting a text or getting easily offended by what used to be humorous).   We had a real fight last week him over him feeling ignored and me feeling insecure that was blown out of portion.  We made up and then yesterday out of the blue while at his home something that would have been minor became contentious.  I saw it happening and told him i didn’t like it and it just escalated into a terrible personal attack on one another.  he told me to leave and I was hurt and left and he came running after me and told me not to leave but he wouldn’t apologize instead he was reprimanding me so I told him his behavior was outrageous.  After I calmed down I asked him if he wanted to talk and I thought everything would be ok excited as he is nice and forgiving but he was sarcastic and a jerk in his texts and I shouldn’t have but I unleashed on him as I was done with the relationship and did not hold back.  We have never said things like that to one another (i made comments about his divorce and called him a coward which he also texted to me .  He alluded that he used me.)  This triggered me and I told him I hated him and he said now it’s really over and we ended our relationship.

I’m pissed.  10 months and it ends like I was provoked or he wanted out and needed a reason.   I want closure on why this happened.   The same day he told me he loved me and I was the best thing that ever happened to him.  I now wonder if this relationship was doomed from the start and he was hiding his true personality or if I’m higher maintenance than I think I am.

I don't see it as an issue and I'm told I look around 30-35 (never sure if those comments are sincere haha) so I do vibe younger, but would this be an issue with men generally?

We had so much fun together and made out a bit. Is that too soon? It felt right and we are both very attracted to each other.   


Which leads me to feeling some anxiety over the 3rd date, which is set for this weekend. Is he going to expect sex? I think I need to mentally prepare for some boundaries in advance, as opposed to winging it like the past 2 dates. We're going to spend time at a nearby park and I'm contemplating inviting him over for dinner, but I'm also scared that may seem like an invitation to sleeping together. I'm wondering, when do people generally have sex with their dates? I don't want to start off too soon as I am leaning toward hoping for a relationship with this person and I've heard sex too early on isn't helpful for that.

I'm not sure which.

A woman I work with (who I admit I think is inteligent, witty, and beautiful) keeps putting herself in situations where our bodies touch in some way. I am always standing still, and she always intentionally walks up to me and stands very close in such a way that bodies come in contact -- usually our upper arms. In all of these cases, there were other places for her to stand. In all of these cases other people were present. On two of these occasions she lightly bumped into me from behind, and I never saw her coming.

I like to think I am a very respectful person, and I try not to get too close to people, and I especially try not to touch people accidentally.

The first one or two times, I thought it was just accidental, but this has happened six times now, and now I started thinking about this more.

Is she just a person who has more a more relaxed sense of personal space, or is there a reason she keeps doing this to me? (I haven't observed her bumping into or brushing against other people, but then again, I don't see her every minute of every day, so I can't be sure she doesn't do this with others.)

I'm afraid to say something because I don't want to offend her or make things awkward at work, and her coming in contact with me doesn't bother me. If I'm really being honest here, I like her being close to me.

If she might be indicating interest, though, I'd be interested in seeing where this goes.

Right now, platonic relationships are teaching me about what I need and want from the people in my life.

For all of 2020 till now, I sought love and support from friends, old and new. A person I became fast friends with over six months assaulted me and caused some loss of faith, but not too much. I'm very glad I chose to invest in friendships. Some investments are paying off more than I thought they would. Over the pandemic, I drifted from one friend because of differences in opinion/perspective on racial justice. Casual acquaintances became close friends. I heard that someone I don't even know thinks I'm incredibly annoying. After the assault, a couple of men I didn't know well or didn't expect to be particularly kind or thoughtful had my back. I learned that I am mostly well-liked, even given my goofy nature and social awkwardness. Here, I thought I was invisible the whole time.

The accelerated racial justice movement in 2020, the pandemic, and my assault taught me so much about what real friends are. Learning about how my behavior is perceived has made me express myself more clearly. This carries over to who I'll look out for romantically in the years to come - and how I'll make sure to convey exactly who I am and what I think.

I've found out that I need some emotional support and that some people are happy and capable of giving it. Sexual assault is a difficult topic to discuss. It terrifies people. Yet, there are people out there who aren't afraid to look you in the eye, acknowledge how difficult it is to contend with, and offer their support in words, time, and attention. Some men have been assaulted. Men who have never been assaulted can care quite deeply. I found out that clearly, verbally expressing my need for support helps others give me what I need and shows me who they are. In the past, I kept everything to myself and soldiered on. Having this support makes me feel loved and seen in a way I never have, and it makes me feel brave. I am not a brave person. I think what blows me away is that people (men and women) know this isn't the easiest thing to navigate, and some people are willing to go through the exercise of figuring it out with me. I may not follow their advice, which I seek, but it's the process of talking things through that helps me determine my own path. The examples of these wonderful people have taught me how to ask better questions and express my own support for others.

Having people in my corner changes everything for me. My ex-husband didn't give me that. I was always proud of how independent we were, but what I really need is to be part of a team, a community, a family. I also learned that I need people to verbally express their support. If you quietly support me, deep in your heart, how will I ever know? Sadly, people that have come and gone from my life will never know the love I felt for them, either. I hope to change that going forward.

Good luck to all of us.

He said he could tell I was high maintenance that was a turn off for him.I kinda resented that.

For perspective Im 44, a WOC and a fat woman. I only mention this to give perspective.

I live alone. My place is small ( a 1 bedroom) but decorated nice. I have mostly all new furniture with matching and coordinating rugs,  pillows, some nice figurines  and African American style art on the walls. 

My bedroom suite is also new,  with a coordinating comforter set and matching rugs. I do admit to having a love of very good expensive perfume. Two of my favorites are Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent Opium. Both are now pricing at over $100 a bottle. I only buy my most expensive scents twice a year cuz thats all I can afford. My dresser is covered with lots of make up and smell goods. I also use a very expensive ($180 a tube) prescription only skin cream for my face that insurance doesnt cover. I do have a dedicated skincare routine including at home facials several times a week. Im getting older and dont want to wrinkle prematurely. 😊
 
Every 2 weeks I get my nails done. I do have acryllic tips with a french manicure and I also get a pedicure and biweekly eyebrow wax. My hair color is retouched frequently and I go to the shop every 2 weeks to.maintain my short style. I also purchase and wear nice clothes with an eye to age appropriate fashion and have things tailored when needed so they fit me nice. This includes my scrubs for my one job.

I tried to explain that just because Im a fat woman that doesnt mean that Im dirty or have to just be sloppy and not care about myself or living environment at all. I also explained that if he wanted to see me again it would not be at my house because I can netflix and chill on my own couch. That we are adults and I dont need a date for that. I was expecting more. Not a 5 star dinner but more than a hang out date. 

He looked around my apartment and told me he could tell by meeting me I was high maintenance and not worth the headache. I tried to tell him the things I do for myself are just good grooming habits nothing too out of the way.  I enjoy having a nice place to come home to and have it fixed up nice so if I do have company I wont be embarassed. Is it me? Or him?

My preferred lifestyle is to spend most of the year traveling (I work online), so it's hard to meet men who want the same kind of lifestyle on top of being compatible in other ways. Anyway so this guy seems perfect and he seems really into me, we have been on a couple of dates. On the last date I found out his last name so of course the next day I Googled him. I found his Facebook and there were still lots of photos of his last relationship, which ended a couple of years ago. Then I clicked on the (ex)girlfriend's page, and was confused cause there were photos of her that looked like she was playing on a high school basketball team. So turns out he started dating this girl in 2014, a few weeks before her 18th birthday. He was 36. When they met she was on summer holidays between Grade 11 and Grade 12 and she lived at home with her parents and 11-year-old brother. Anyway based on Facebook, the girl's family accepted the relationship and they were very active on social media; their relationship lasted 4 years and they even got engaged before ending the relationship a couple years ago. 

I am just feeling so ICK about this. I cannot imagine dating a teenager, especially someone who was not even 18 yet when they started hanging out! Clearly he is looking for women closer to his age now, since he is currently pursuing me. But I don't know if I can get over the fact that the last 'woman' he pursued was a teenager in high school! Her posts around that time are like, complaining about how math class is hard, she can't believe no one asked her to prom, and her parents are being so lame, typical teenage girl stuff.

Nothing from him. Yesterday he texts (i went and did the so and so tour…etc). I left the text on (delivered). And opened it today, but did not reply. Actually i have nothing to say.
Honestly I’m so turned off, and especially after all of your advice here. However, I don’t want to make any quick decisions and regret it later. 
Do I text him and ask for a good time to talk on the phone? And nicely say, I was really interested in getting to know you more but it looks like we’re not on the same page, and this isn’t working for me.
Do I just wait and see? 
Do I text back like nothing happened?

I apologize if this seems stupid, but this is all new to me and I’m already a very anxious person. I also do not wish to hurt anyone.
