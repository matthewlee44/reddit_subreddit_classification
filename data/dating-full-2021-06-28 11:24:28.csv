It’s worse because I don’t think I am bad looking. I do have a bit of tummy.  But sometimes I just feel that I am invisible because of how I look. I am not even very selective.

It went well minus a failed attempt at a hug, she didn’t feel comfortable and revealed later that she didn’t really enjoy being touched by anyone but the closest people. Fine with it, understand. She agreed to a second but had some mental health problems she had to deal with. I saw her on tinder in 2020 and decided to follow her Instagram. Learned she had borderline and bipolar disorder. She told me texting can be mentally draining sometimes and I usually got answers back after a day or so. I tried playing it cool and just messaged her every other day.

We talked and hit it off pretty well. Sharing common questions, chatting about a variety of things and sorta just getting to know her. She told me she was gonna be moving up north for a bit but would be back in the fall.

We met at a park and had a small outing before she had to go home to pack. It was wonderful and we lost track of time noticing she had 5 minutes to get home but lives further out than that. She gets excited and says she wants to see me when she gets back down for a visit.

Conversation inbetween the next time we saw eachother was limited and mostly through Instagram. I caught Covid and was possibly not going to make it. I said “fuck it” and messaged her that I had a huge crush on her and she asked me to call her. I couldn’t because I was rushed to hospital.  But I updated her and she got really happy that I was updating her and that she wanted to see me even more.

Some awkward small talk on Instagram for a month &amp; texts. Kinda hard to do long conversations with someone who gets burnt pretty fast, and someone who is 3 hours away.

But I really like them. She makes me happy. I asked her this past Friday if she was coming down so I could see her. She said she was actually coming down and would love to see me 8:30-9:30.

We meet at the same small park and go on a walk around it’s teeny perimeter. The first 5 minutes are a smooth conversation and catch-up. We talk lots. Conversation is kinda awkward with pausing in between but it’s fine in my opinion. We go to a waterfall and I try a silly and not gross pickup line.

“My hands are cold even in the summer, would you help warm them up?” 
Every girl from my past? It worked. Her reaction was confusion for a moment and then 
“No, sorry”

I say “can’t blame me for trying”
Awkwardness. 

A few minutes later she said she had to be home to see her sister before she goes to stay with her boyfriend a few cities away. I say “no problem”

Look down at my watched. 8:55. 

She left really early and asked that i text her when I get home. Okay. I got a little buzzed that night and texted her:

“Hey, thanks for a great time, sorry I made it weird for trying to hold your hand. Hyped to see you again.” 

No reply. Not uncommon. Sometimes she doesn’t reply cuz she can’t handle much conversation as mentioned. But man do I regret sending that text.

She’s viewing my stories on social media. Orbiting.

Was I just boring / there was no chemistry? Does she just want to be friends, or was she just not down to hold hands?
Is it over?
Is it redeemable?
Am I just overthinking?
Do I message her or was a hint given she was not interested?

So many questions on my mind. Did I fuck up? Where do I go from here.

Over analyzing a lot, but this is important to me. Never stopped thinking about her and what could have been. Really want this to work out.

But man that relationship was special to me. At first we had this unspoken thing that we were having fun but i got attached, and when it ended on her behalf i got hit bad.

I'm far from over it, for i found myself thinking about her or wishing that she was with me in many occasions. The thing is i'm not very good at making myself happy, mainly due to my depression, i'm not at peace with my own mind. I'm trying to work on myself in that regard, pushing aside the thoughts that i'm lonely and that i need someone to make me happy. So far its not working very well and here comes the dilemma.

I'm a fairly attractive guy i get flirted with often, and i got multiple hints from women to go on dates etc in the past few months. The thing is i'm done dating ""just for fun"" or just because i'm lonely or just because i found soneone interesting/beautiful. I want to take this period to self reflect, better myself mentally, be self dependent concerning my happiness. But its hard you know, i'm tired, i want someone, i hate being alone, i have very good friends but a hug, a simple i love you or a kiss, words of encouragement come different from a SO.

I'm really drained though by all these heartbreaking experiences, i don't know if i should continue with my plan to be emotionally self dependent (mainly because i have doubts that its working, i haven't seen progress) until i find what i call my ""wow"" person or if i should go on dates again, meet people, maybe numb that loneliness and pain until that heartbreaking moment comes again, because i'm sure that with the people in my life rn it's not gonna end well.

We studied together quite a few times during the exam season, and had dinner after our study sessions. I found that we had quite a lot in common, and she was quite cute, so I asked if she wanted to hangout after our finals. We had dinner together and shared some desserts after (we went dutch). That was about ~ 2 months ago.

I've since met her almost once every week to run, and we would eat together after. She doesn't mind sharing food and drinks, and have asked to try something that I had already bit into several times. We would often tease each other about the things we talked about, and talk a lot about our family, aspirations and our plans after graduating.

I recently sent her a snap of some exotic food I tried, and she said she ""must try it sometime ;)"". I suggested going to try it again together, and she said yes immediately, but then realized she couldn't after she checked her calendar (like 2 mins later). She also recently sent me a list of jobs out of the blue, saying that she ""didn't know why but she thought of me"", and I could consider applying to those after graduating. Worth noting that she's also interested in similar jobs.

I feel like she might be interested in me, but then again she calls me bro a lot, and she would sometimes not reply to texts for a day or two. I'm usually the one initiating the hang outs, but she always agrees to it enthusiastically. She cancelled our most recent run though, but then apologized for it a few days later.

Like the title says, I have put myself in a really messed up position. I just got out of a divorce from a wife who had multiple EA’s and dropped her like a bad habit. That was a month ago. I moved to another part of the country depressed and currently still can’t focus right. I rekindle with a girl I knew all my life (high school sweetheart) and didn’t realize how in love she was with me but she’s in a shitty relationship.

I was on the other end and as much as I want to tell her it was a horrible feeling I didn’t. I admitted to her that I loved her before I got married and always had a feeling eventually I would end up being with her despite me telling her I divorced and left a bad marriage. The situation gets worse. I started OLD and I know I’m a good guy and social so getting dates was never a problem. So a few weeks of moving to a new place I met a nice girl and I know I’m leading her into believing I know I want something but deep down I don’t.

I like companionship so I told her a small piece of the bigger picture of the marriage but I didn’t tell her it was so recent and I think she really likes me. Well I also have an eye for a girl at this Resturant I’ve been going to frequently and she knows I’m interested so there’s that. This weekend I sent a song to my ex that she knows if I ever felt sad it was about her. I haven’t spoken to her since I moved which was 3 weeks ago which she responds “I beg you, don’t make this any harder than what it is”. I told her I respected her decision and left it as is.

I’m on a phone so I’m sorry if the format is all fucked up.

TLDR: I’m flirting with 3 girls and deeply miss my ex. I know I’m a huge douche bag and I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown. I moved with no friends and family and NO ONE knows the truth. I accepted the fact that this will end badly and even possibly losing my high school sweetheart that I’ve known for 15 years.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,865418,public,self,Not sure what I’m doing,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9k45b/not_sure_what_im_doing/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

To me a lot of things run through my mind.

I feel like it’s kind of rude/abrasive to do it. Obviously there’s good times to get in on a conversation and approach a women or a group of them but even then to me i feel like whoever you approach is just thinking “this guy is just trying to fuck me” which doesn’t always have to be the case. I’m sure it is most of the time though.

Then I think these women are out with some friends trying to have a good time, they probably don’t want to be approached at all tonight (for me I know that’s how I am a lot of the time if someone tries to talk to me). 

And lastly why I don’t understand this is because I hear all these horror stories from girls about “creepy guys” hitting on them or trying to buy them drinks and how they get annoyed by it.

However recently she has been going through some issues which have meant that she hasn’t been able to be as present in the conversation as before. 

Because of this, there have been a couple of issues over the past week or so. Firstly, I noticed her ignoring my messages and i mentioned it to her. We sorted this issue out, but she removed me from snap maps which was fair enough. However, we had another issue last night, where i said i was being mentally drained by talking to her and getting nothing back. She got annoyed, and at one point said ‘i’m not so sure this is right now’, but in her next message she apologised and we agreed to take a break from talking while she focuses on herself. 

However, I am worrying that I am not going to hear from her again. Just before our talk yesterday she removed me from one of her private stories, although i am still in another one. I know she liked me A LOT before tho, so i can’t work out if i am just overthinking it, or if things are done between us. I wouldn’t though that she would’ve said no to a break when i suggested it if she was no longer interested? 

I just want some advice on whether this is done, or if i am simply overthinking it.

They don’t differ much at all. I know, all these things are subjective but looking at the broader picture, I don’t think there’s an actual answer to why some people are alone and it hasn’t worked out for them yet. I often find myself being jealous of those cute, long-lasting high school relationships. Those people still love each other while most of us can’t even get a text back, find themselves getting hurt and fucked over in a repetitive pattern only to find out that yet again, he or she wasn’t the one. It can be so frustrating. Especially because there’s no guide on how to date, how to build a relationship that may last, how to make love WORK. I always thought me being alone comes down to flaws in myself and me as a person and even though I still highly believe so, sometimes I wonder if there’s more to that. That maybe I’m just not one of the lucky ones. Maybe the worst thing being though is that some people never got lucky and remained on their own until their very end. That’s the harsh truth. Some people may miss their chance or never find the person that clicks with them like no other even though objectively speaking, they are very lovable people while others, objectively speaking, kinda aren’t but are having a family and a somewhat beautiful life.

I went through an extremely crushing heartbreak recently because my “girlfriend” was still holding a torch for a guy she had dated at a little before we met.

We had a great relationship for 4 months. I was the happiest I’ve been in a while. This last year has been difficult in my life and when I started seeing her it was a break from the rest of the life. From the global pandemic, from a soul sucking college semester, from family issues. She was my reprieve and it made me forget the bad when I was with her.

Then, a week after my 21st birthday she dumped me out of nowhere. She told me that she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was hurt but I was okay with it. Our time together was genuine. Then 2 weeks later I saw her posting about her first month with her boyfriend. 

I called her out on it and she said that she was sorry but she was still in love with him and just didn’t want to hurt me. And that’s when it crushed me. Our relationship was fake, I was a distraction for her and when the guy she actually wanted came around I was worthless.

I was on a second date with a white man. He was talking about how he doesn't get offended by anything. And him and his friends often make fun of each other. 

He went onto say that his South Asian friend says racist stuff towards white people. And in turn he says racist stuff back. He said: ""And I call him a p*ki"".

I was shocked that he said a racial slur on this date. I felt very awkward and excused myself to the bathroom. I called him up on this and he apologised for saying it. The rest of the date went fine and he's asked to see me again.

I'm not sure if him saying that word should be a red flag or not. That word has been used to bully me and I just don't like hearing it. At the same time, I know that as people we grow and learn. Maybe he just made a mistake?

1) The guy is actually being a classic “nice guy.” Like a girl rejected him and he told her, “You just don’t like me because I’m a nice guy. Fuck you.” Or something like that. How did we find out about it on reddit? Maybe the guy told reddit all about it? Idk. Would be pretty dumb. The classic way is the girl posts the text or something like that.

2) Toxic masculinity. Unsuccessful guys call other unsuccessful guys “nice guys” no matter what’s going on. Because they get a thrill out of it. It makes them feel good. Because that’s the kind of people they are apparently.

3) Well intentioned people use the term “nice guy” to describe, in addition to its original definition, other kinds of more or less toxic behavior that may or may not be related to the classic definition. Pretty soon the whole logic of the idea starts breaking down and you start calling a guy a “nice guy” for simply wanting a girlfriend or something that is fairly universal actually. It becomes victim blaming.

4) I feel like most older couples at some point have had the following exchange around me. The older man laughs and says, “Let me give you some advice about relationships. Don’t argue with your wife. Just let her be right. Everything is much better that way.” Then he laughs again and his wife laughs too. Idk but maybe this is just something that’s gonna be like that sometimes. A woman says, “This behavior by this guy is equivalent to him telling a girl that he’s a nice guy and deserves sex because of it.” You think to yourself, “Well that doesn’t sound quite right to me.” Then you stop and advise yourself, “I better just not say anything.” And then you move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,865666,public,self,The many layers of calling someone a “nice guy” on reddit,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9n9pr/the_many_layers_of_calling_someone_a_nice_guy_on/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

(4 and 6 months). I've been always careful not to creep out people especially women. So eventually it grew into a much more state that I can't even put up a conversation with a single person - unless it's a working environment. 

Every single female that I've known had  disgusting horror story done by males. I guess due to my low self esteem I'm so scared to ruin my fragile ego so I can't conversate with anyone. Even casually. If people try to do, I literally start to have heart palpations, start to slur and end up slither away from there with an excuse - sometimes without. 

wtf should I do. I already feel like 3 quarters of my life spent alone, and I've been desperately in need of a relationship. At the same time I don't had much to live. If I try to go to a therapist, that'll probably start working years after and I'll be 100 years old. But I can't approach people because people already have traumas, I don't want to trigger them and I'm too scared what's left of my ego. 

I'm asking here because I'm expecting hear normal advices rather than mtgow and 'go the gym bro' bullshit. 

Also tried dating apps as well, I don't get matches as I'm not a photogenic person. In fact I don't like my picture taken either so I don't have much photos.

When he would come back home - we saw each other and went out with his friends.

 Citing famous people who have these things who have still gone mad is not a good argument. Fame is an absurd state of being. Citing yourself or other people you know is a not a great argument either. If money won't solve someone's problem, that doesn't mean it won't solve the other person's problem. Maybe money is exactly what that person needs to aquire the means to better his situations. Maybe a partner is exactly what that person needs.

 I wonder if it's time to abandon this idea of complete emotional autonomy that has been hammered into us by the media.  There's also this idea that a man is not a man if he can't be alone. A woman is not an enlightened woman and she shouldn't ""need a man"". Almost like this weird battle of the sexes. But there shouldn't be a battle. There should be cooperation. I honestly don't think that man or woman are completely complete without oneanother.

I was just wondering if I could get some of your opinions on whether or not this idea is alright for a first date. 

So anyway, I matched with a girl on hinge (we are both mid 20s) and we've been talking on there for a few days and since I enjoyed talking with her I decided to ask her on a date. She said she would like to go on one. I don't go on a lot of dates, but for first dates I normally just like meeting up to grab a coffee or something cause it can be quick and I feel like it's a low pressure way to meet someone for the first time. Well, due to our schedules the only time that works for us both is in the early evening around dinner time. I'm not the biggest fan of dinner dates and I don't feel like going to a brewery and grabbing drinks either. I've done drinks before for dates and they've been enjoyable, it's just with my schedule I would prefer not to this time.

 I was thinking of taking her to go bowling and then go grab some ice cream afterwards. My only problem is that the time is around dinner time so we might both be hungry which is were I am getting confused. I don't want to push bowling back too late cause I have work early in the AM the next day, but if don't push it back I feel like we should at least grab something to eat first. So my question is what order would be best? 
- food &gt; bowling &gt; ice cream

- bowling &gt; ice cream

But over the past few days I’ve been missing him really badly and am confused again. I don’t know if it’s because me and my family aren’t in good terms right now/ my mental health is very bad right now/I don’t have many plans recently or is it I’ve genuinely started missing him again. 

I’ve been feeling so awful about myself and just feel like a shit person because of my behaviour and toxicity in the relationship and I can’t help but want to punish myself for that. But the thing with our relationship was that he gaslighted me a lot and I didn’t realise this until a few weeks after the relationship ended, it kinda hit me like a bus that he wasn’t all innocent and he also did a lot of stuff wrong too. 

I guess there a few reasons why I’m still confused: why am I missing him still after all the stuff both of us have done, our relationship was fairly toxic. He was also a very unpredictable person so one time he would be the most amazing supportive boyfriend and bought me flowers everyday and fought my corner then the other minute he wasn’t taking any responsibility for his actions and kept saying I ‘misunderstood the situation’ and ‘I didn’t do that’ and ‘I’m sorry you feel that way’ so I don’t know if I’m making the gaslighting up and he was great and I was the only toxic one because how can someone change from the perfect boyfriend (and I’m not just saying this, at times he was exactly what an amazing bf should be like and planned amazing thoughtful dates and told me he loved me so many times a day for example) to someone who isn’t very nice, that much of change doesn’t seem possible.

That said, I now have the unpleasant job of breaking up with the other girl (Jess) I was dating.

Jess was also a great person, we met up around 3-4 times and even had sex once although it was kind of disappointing because it was done after copious amounts of drinking since we had gone to a bar before and were having fun. That said, there was definitely a big cultural and moderate language barrier between us. Actually the last date we had was just yesterday to address this issue. This was the issue which also made sex kind of disappointing since we had a tough time communicating. 

Anyways, when we met up yesterday I told her I was dating other people too when she asked me and she said she wasn't dating anyone else. We had some good food, watched a movie, made out a little, and then she went home since it was a Sunday and we both had to be up early for Monday calls. Now Monday night Becky calls me and we chat for 4 hours and she asks if I want to be exclusive. I agree. I told her about Jess and she says she is fine for me to break up with her first before we see each other again.

Unfortunately for both men and women, a lot of men expect sex in return from a big favor which I’m not saying is right, it’s just the way the world works. It shouldn’t be that way, but what can we do?

I’m making this post because my close friend put herself in a position where I literally needed to drive a day and a half to get her. An affluent guy she met online and had been talking to for a few weeks who bought her expensive gifts and the guy offered to fly her to San Francisco for a vacay. 

She went and when she got there he expected some coochie. She wasn’t comfortable with that so he kicked her out and canceled her ticket back. Lucky for her, I have kin in Oakland. I called my mom up and begged her to to let my friend stay with with her. Also lucky for her I had saved up some leave so I could take a trip with some my buddies to Disney Land. 

I wasted 3 of my days so I could go to Oakland to see my family and pick her dumb ass up and bring her back home. I was so confused how a grown ass 25 year old woman could be so naive and put herself in such a dangerous postion. 

I told her this and I will give all women here the following information.

Do not get flown out by a man you barely know and except to not give him something back in return. It’s not right that a lot of men see a woman’s body as currency or a reward for a gift, but a lot of men do and you need to be aware of how dangerous that could be to you. You might not have a friend that loves you so much to bail you out of an awful situation like that.

Two weeks ago I met this women (F32) on the usual dating apps, and we quickly met up for a picnic in a nearby park. The date went really well, the conversations were great and we had quite the fun. At the end, we briefly kissed, and agreed to meet up for a second date.

Afterwards we texted around five or six times to schedule the second date a week later, with her very actively going for the second date. This time, it was a very hot summer day, we decided to get a drink at a bar with A/C. Unfortunately there were no free seats left, so we had to sit outside, in the shade, but it was still quite hot.

Because of the heat I was a little distracted, and while we had a more serious conversation (work, future, goals, kids), the vibe wasn't just as easy-going as it was the first time. When we left the bar after three hours we walked home to her place, arm in arm, joking and kissing.

Since we both had to work the next day it was clear that we wouldn't spent the night, and stopped near her apartment. We shared a few kisses and I mentioned that I had to tell her something (I am a little allergic to cats, and she sometimes cares for one). Almost instantly she replied that she also had to tell me something. We joked around, but neither revealed their secret. She just let it slip that her secret would be something that I had to decide if I am OK with.

So we decided to tell each other on the next date. She told me to let her know once I made it home safely, and we saw each other off. When I got home, I showered and sent her a quick text that I am home and thanked her for the interesting and fun evening, despite the heat.

She replied the next day, likewise thanking me, and also making a remark about the heat. I replied that evening saying that the heat really was uncomfortable at times, and that I would like to see her again under better climatic conditions. I did not think much of it because I was expecting her to answer something like ""yeah, that would be nice"" and from then on schedule the next date.

However, she has not replied to this message for three days now, which is the longest span of non-communication we have had so far. I know she is with friends at her hometown this weekend, so she might be busy.

The simple question I have is: What do I do now? Sent another text telling her my available days for the next date? Call her? Just let it go?

She has always been very involved, has been fascinated with the picnic, blowing me kisses and grabbing my arm and hands while kissing on the way home from the second date. We had a funny situation where we collided with our faces while trying to give each other a kiss, and she quickly apologized saying that she was a little out of practice. So altogether I had the impression that she is interested and attracted.

I’m not really interested in casual stuff, I want to be with someone and be committed. 

My problem is, I never am I girls first choice.

First I never really have a lot of options. I’ll see a girl for a month or two and then if that doesn’t work out I can’t get a first date for another few months. All the girls I’m seeing are always seeing multiple guys, which I’ve just accepted that that’s how dating is but it’s still a lot of pressure knowing she has options and I’m expendable to her while she  will likely be the only girl I talk to until the next season.

Of the women I’ve talked to none of them have wanted to be serious with me while they’re seeing other men. But all of them want to keep taking to me if the guy they’re they decide to be serious with isn’t working out.

Like so many times have I gotten a text that we shouldn’t see each other, or I get ghosted then on social media they’re always with some other guy, then when that flops, she hits my line asking for me to hang out. It’s really demoralizing. I’m always the back up. Always the guy that’s there if the guy that she doesn’t actually want doesn’t work out. 

Then I have to contemplate whether it’s worth it to start dating her again knowing I’m only talking to her because they guy she wanted didn’t want her. I like to tell myself that I have more dignity than that, but if I’m being honest I don’t think I do. I usually end up seeing them for a once or twice more and letting it fizzle.

I just want someone to view me as a prize, like they actually want me or view me as more than the understudy. It makes me not want to date every time it happens but I know I’m a hopeless romantic and want to find love.

I'm wondering what people still are attractive from 40 to 60 years old. I think the character side is fairly simple, most people keep their general traits and might expand on their weirdness, but otherwise just mature and go boring. 
What I really can't say is what happens to looks. I think in general tall people are less likely to end up round and wrinkled (if you get me), but what about the face. Any thoughts/resources?
