I am currently in college and not necessarily looking for a gf but not opposed to the idea of having one. In my mind the only reason I would date currently is if I found a girl that I think is literally the one for me. I am choosing not to date right now, for the most part, because of my last relationship and realizing how much time and effort had to go into it and seeing how that time and effort could've been put into something else. My only concern right now is whether I am setting my expectations for ""the one"" too high. Sometimes when I'm falling asleep or waking up I picture my would be girlfriend but I picture her mostly as someone who doesn't have very many flaws. Not necessarily never had flaws but just worked on them. When I say flaws I mean issues or struggles, say depression or severe insecurity. So rather than be upset and bothered by that, my ideal girlfriend would've put time and effort into trying to get rid of or atleast improve her insecurities and such. My ideal girlfriend would also be super sexual and love that aspect of life. My question is whether I am sort of idealizing this person I've created in my head and set unrealisitic standards/expectations about the kind of person I want to be with? Any insight at all would be great and any tips on how I should try to perceive a relationship would be greatly helpful as well.

5,o4atp7,1624210795,Mixed Signals: First Date,"I thought it went well. She was a chatter box, completely opened up to me about her family, her past relationships, and some of the things she's gone through the last year. She even got emotional at one point explaining a rough patch she had this year, starting sobbing a little. It was a very intimate conversation. 

It was also light and fun, we laughed a lot and made corny jokes. When I dropped her off, I kissed her. She kissed me pretty passionately (so much so that it took me back). She used tongue very quickly and I'm used to slower kisses. Our kissing seemed to be out of timing lol. Anyway, apart from that, I'd say it was a solid date. 

Its the next day and I haven't heard from her. We haven't spoken since I dropped her off. Is this a bad sign? I've been on many dates and usually the girl will write me immediately after.

1) always had the mindset that if you focus on your career then other things will fall into place including women 

2) I used to hang out with couple of friends who were players with women. I wasn't really good with women back then so adopted their mindset, style, atittude towards women. 

3) I was always a bit of a cold person to begin with but after being  in a couple heart breaks makes you a bit more callous. 

4) alot of women I don't really want to invest in a relationship with. I am more selective with who I want a relationship with than who I just want to hook up with. 

I actually haven't been on a date in a long time. I usually meet with women and just invite them over to my place and we just end up hooking up first time meeting. There was this one girl who I really like and she invited me over to her place. I pushed it a little too far for what she was comfortable with and that was that. Idk I really liked her. I still think about her from time to time. 

Now I am thinking about asking girls on date and not try to hook up first day. However I don't wanna waste my time if I am not interested in having a relationship with a girl in the first place and just want to have fun. I don't know.

But porn had a bad affect on it!😬,"I (22M) asked for this girl's (28F) number at work and she said we should do something this weekend. I didn't know where to take her because I haven't been on a date in years. I decided to take her to Applebee's for food and drinks. We got a booth and I sat beside her which made it less awkward during silent moments. We had some good conversations. After, she suggested we go on a cruise and hang out at the mountains to see the view. This and food lasted about 3 hrs. During the date we made out a few times and she would occasionally through in sexual jokes which made me know she wanted you know what. But I would let her take the lead in any sexual tension we had. 

I noticed when we would make out I wouldn't get completely hard quickly which is not something that happens to me. When we had sex at her place I noticed my thing didn't get hard as quickly as it usually does (when watching porn) which brings me to the problem.  We as men thing that porn doesn't affect our mind and sex but it really does! Your mind gets so used to watching it on a screen but when the moment comes when is foreal, it's almost like your mind doesn't recognize it quickly enough.

22,o4bkxt,1624213019,"How to ""date around""?","Tl;Dr: I get told the best way to put less expectations into potential dates/suitors is to date lots of people, but I find it hard to get lots of dates and meet people to reduce this anxiety. So am I in a catch 22? What do other people do in this situation?

So a couple years ago I (M30) had a rough breakup and went to therapy to figure some stuff out. One of the things my therapist suggested was read ""Attached"" to understand my attachment style. I got from it that (I think rightly) I was quite anxious and always expected a lot of a potential suitor or was scared of meeting someone and it not working out. I'm better about that I guess but still to an extent I fall hard for people early on and then get quite depressed when it doesn't work out.

So one of the things that book and other people in general have said to me is date around and meet more people and that will make you feel more secure and also stop myself from having high expectations when going into dates. 

My question is, I tend to find it hard to get dates, so how can I ""go on more dates to lower my date expectations?"" - feels very catch 22. Dating apps don't seem to do it for me and lockdown and some introversion are both challenges I've tried to deal with.

26,o4bx0p,1624214018,"Asked a guy I’m interested in to FaceTime, his gf encourages him to call me! Did I do something wrong?","TLDR; I asked a guy out on a FaceTime “date”. He calls late, talks to me for 1.5 hours, and tells me his gf was really encouraging him to call me. They both knew I was interested in him. Am I, is he, or are we both in the wrong? 

So I slid into this guy’s DM’s, we were friendly acquaintances. I asked him if he’d want to “chat” over FT, he said yes and we chose a time before he asked me what the call was about. I told him I’d like to get to know him, he said okay. I then followed up a few hours later and said, “to be completely transparent, I know I didn’t call it a date but I definitely didn’t invite you just to call. I’m down to talk and see how we vibe. Lmk what you think”. He left me on read for a while and then says, “Yeah sure, sounds great :)”

On the day of, he messaged me 40 min late, and I told him that if he didn’t want to call, he could just let me know. But he rescheduled, pushing the time an hour back. We had an easygoing convo that I let him lead, and he asked me things like “what are your hobbies?”, “what does a typical day look like for you?”, “how’d you become interested in your passion?”

After talking for 1.5 hours, he then told me he’d been seeing someone for years, and then started telling me that I’m amazing, and that maybe if he were single he might’ve been interested. I was in shock, and weirded out. He assured me that his girlfriend knew all about this, and was “pushing even harder than he was for this to happen”?! 

I told him he could’ve just told me he had a gf over text. He said it took a lot of courage to do what I did so he wanted to do it in person, though now he saw that he’d led me on and that “next time” he would tell people over text he has a gf. 

I messaged him a few hours later saying that I felt like I was being used as an ego boost, he said he wasn’t and that he was just confused about what the call was since I’d mentioned “getting to know each other”, so he didn’t know it had to be a date. 

So what gives? I said sorry for being confusing about the call. I know I could’ve been more direct- I (mistakingly) thought he’d been flirty with me (which I told him was my bad) so I hadn’t spelled things out. From my messages he did understand that I was interested in him though, and so did his girlfriend, so I’m still confused why he talked to me knowing I was interested and didn’t tell me beforehand about his gf. 

Should I have been clearer, should he have mentioned his gf sooner, or should we both have been more upfront?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4bx0p/asked_a_guy_im_interested_in_to_facetime_his_gf/
27,o4bxdw,1624214051,Unpopular dating opinions I've gathered over the years,"I really believe this stuff even though it would get my soul crucified if I say it out loud. I never say this stuff, but as time goes on it just gets more solidified.

1) Average women have significantly more and better options than average men do.

2) What women say and what women do are two completely different things. At least that's what I've observed by living with a bunch of women roommates. ""I want a gentlemen who's a good listener and takes things slowly."" Then they go and date a total douchebag who pumps and dumps on the first date.

3) Men already know how to seduce women. It's in their DNA from thousands of years. They don't need a stupid PUA book to tell them what to do. The problem is a lot of men have such horrible self esteem and anxiety nowadays that they second guess themselves. If they just got out of their own way and let things naturally happen, they would be fine.

4) ""I ghost because of safety reasons"" is just a BS excuse. Your safety isn't in jeopardy texting ""I didn't feel a connection, but wish you the best!"" The dude you met at Martha's Cupcake Shop was very nice and looking for love in the same respect you are. He's not Jeffery Dahmer. Show him 2 sentences of decency for he knows to unmatch and try again with someone else.

5) 30 years old and living at home with parents making $10.00 an hour as a woman? No big deal, but if you're a man in the same circumstance...immediate first date deal breaker.

6) Don't bother asking for clarification if you've been dumped after a few dates. No one, both men and women, are honest with it. They don't want to hurt your feelings. You'll just get a generic ""Our personalities just didn't click well"" excuse. The real reason, you'll never know.

7) People make assumptions without asking questions. I have a friend who has an etrade acct with a few million and he works in retail. He struggles getting past the first date when he tells women he works at Macys. They think he's broke when the dude can retire today.

8) Pictures are everything, so make sure you have good ones on your OLD acct. Buy a tripod with a clicker and have at it.

9) Dating as a single mom is very hard. Dating as an ugly woman is very hard.

I (24F) have been on dating apps on and off for years. Also been on Reddit forever.

I am so frustrated going on Reddit and seeing how bitter some men are here.
Just recently went to a post where one of the top comments are about how “all women cheat.” Almost every post has something like this, where men are simply hating on women because they’re alone and bitter. Grouping all women together how were judgmental, terrible at replying, ghost, etc. This is literally in the rules not to do this, yet I see it everywhere.

I’ve been cheated on, multiple times. I have had many men lead me on, lie to me, ghost me. I try to send thoughtful messages and often get no reply. I’m also tired of getting rejected. But you know what? Not all men are like this and not all men are bad.
So if women can accept that there are good guys out there, can men stop filling up dating subreddits about how terrible women are? I’m having a bad time dating too and just because I may have more options doesn’t mean they are quality options who actually treat me with respect, and coming onto a subreddit where an entire gender is hated on this much is ridiculous. If you wouldn’t say it to your sister or daughter, don’t say it to women on the internet. We’re real women too!

I realized that I don't have much outside of art--and that's fine. But I took a minute to look around  my apartment and just kind of... Smiled big. I have my roommate but even when he's around.... I've come to learn, I love being alone. I have a small circle with minimal drama. I indulge in my art, writing, painting-etc.
 It's.. really peaceful and fun. I used to hate being alone in every single way but now I feel so incredibly free, like I'm actually am and going to be okay I'm not inhibited or giving my life or worrying... I'm stable on my own I've discovered. Cool but fucking whack. I can make a list but it's kinda awesome liking myself again and seeing that the little things I have in my life that I've earned on my own? That's the shit. 

BUT I MISS THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL TOUCH. I miss the person I used to have right-- and like-- damnit dude 😂 the head rubs, both ways! And snuggling into his back or being the little spoon, kisses up and down his arms, those head kisses. I can make a list.-- The emotional intimacy that was healthy, the deep talks and belly laughs, the sexual intimacy and wild, lustful energy that I feel fine without and not looking for- BUT FUCK

34,o4d0ix,1624217182,"The pros and cons of ""the big three"" dating apps, from my three years of use","Alright so a little context, I'm a 21 year old straight man. Im slightly above average in the looks department, I work out regularly, BUT I'm 5'8 so that definitely cuts down my matches. This is Just my experience, I'm sure its different for others. I am also located in a mid sized city in the southeast US that I just moved to about a month ago- so im using current stats for my matches/dates per week.

Tinder- In my opinion its overall the best option. Obviously its meant for hookups, however there are definitely exceptions to this. I've had 2 serious relationships come out of this app. The reason I say its the best option is because it has THE LARGEST consumer pool out of all the online dating apps, therefore giving you access to many more people... however a large percent of those people will lie outside of your preferences. This brings up one of the biggest cons tinder has, the lack of ability to set preferences. This makes tinder a much more casual app, you can set up a profile in under 5 minutes and just start swiping. This leads to TONS of people using it solely for validation or even just because theyre bored. (I probably get 10 likes a week, with 3 matches, and maybe a date a week)

Bumble- this app is definitely the common ground between hinge and tinder. It has an interesting concept, forcing the woman to make the first move. If you do match with a woman, there is an extremely high chance she will message you- as the chances are shes on bumble (instead of tinder) in order to find someone that fits into her type (bumble lets you display height, exercise, education, political leaning etc). It also allows you to set discussion prompts, which can really make you stand out if you put in the time to create some original content. Overall bumble allows you to find more serious possibilities, coming at the cost of less users- giving you less dates. ( i probably get 4/5 matches a week, with maybe a date a week)

Hinge- this is by far the most serious dating app in my opinion. If youre on hinge- most of the time you want a relationship- no hookups. This is one reason I like this app, as you dont have to waste your time with people that just want a one night stand. Like bumble, it allows you to set preferences and put in your own information. The biggest thing this app has going for it is that you get an extremely limited number of swipes a day. This signifies to the person you swipe on that you are ACTUALLY interested and not just there for validation or out of boredom. (I get maybe MAYBE 2 matches a week, that can realistically turn into 2 dates a week)

Here is some advice in general for all the apps. First, make it clear what your intentions are (fwb, casual, or serious) Second, dont lie- for example as i mentioned I'm short for a guy- so it turns many people away. THATS OKAY, what are you gonna do if you lie about something and then get into a relationship? Finally, and most importantly, vet the people you match with for a while before going out on a date. The first step to this is to move off the dating app ASAP, get their number or whatever you prefer. Talk to them for a few days- not excessively, but just make sure they are who they claim to be and that they seem like a decent person. I used to just go on a date the same day we matched, and that gives you many more catfish or just shitty people in general that you could have weeded out.

35,o4d6rb,1624217686,"Currently coming to the end of ""a love that can't last"" (wrong place, wrong time). What is your story/ experience with this?","Hi y'all,

As the title says, i'm currently in the middle of one of life's cruelest jokes. I'll try be brief, I was recently accepted into a PhD program in Denver, so i'll be moving away in a few months. Because of this, I was looking to have as much fun as possible over the summer before I left (mostly casual dating).

Well, of course, life throws me a curve ball. A few weeks ago, I *happen* to decide to quit my night job, my friends *happen* to call me to go downtown and I just *happen* to meet a very wonderful and sweet woman. She tells me she's moving to New York in a month or so. I say i'm leaving for Denver. Perfect. No strings attached.

Naturally, these past few weeks with her have been some of the best ""dating"" experiences i've ever had. However, she's leaving this Sunday.

We both like each other and would be dating if life wasn't taking us in two different directions. I'm M26, so i'm under no illusion that i'll never love again or something dramatic like that, but it is a very bittersweet feeling to meet someone who you feel you could have a strong relationship with but it just won't work for reasons out of your control.

What are your experiences with this? How do you feeling looking back on it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4d6rb/currently_coming_to_the_end_of_a_love_that_cant/

37,o4daxd,1624218020,"""Women Should Ask Men Out More""","I see a variation on this topic every so often on these dating subs. It shows delusion and a lack of understanding of male-female dynamics. Riddle me this, if a woman is pretty, personable &amp; feminine...why would she need to ask men out? She probably already has several men vying for her attention. Granted, there are some women who don't mind pursuing men but are they the type of woman you actually want to be approached by? ***Or do you want to be approached by just ANY woman?***  I'm sure you know this but the hotter she is, the less likely she'll be pursuing men. 

If you want women to behave in a way that is very unconventional by asking you out, what are YOU doing to be that stand-out guy that women actually pursue? Or do you think that by standing there with your hands with your pockets like a wallflower that women should just approach &amp; pursue you?

I've only known very few men IRL who consistently had women pursuing them. They were all very good-looking, 2 of them were college athletes (football &amp; basketball). Other men I've heard of who don't really have to try when it comes to attracting women are professional athletes, musicians who tour, rich/famous men....the types of men who most likely aren't posting about their dating woes on Reddit.

She had to leave for another event so I walked her back to her car and I said something along the line which I don't remember exactly, ""It was fun, was wondering if you wanted to meet up sometime next week?"" 

She answered with something and we went our separate ways. 

Should I text her, ""It was nice seeing you again and was fun. Was wondering if you would like to meet up again sometime next week?"" 

Or should I just wait and see if she does reach out to me?

I am thinking to just go with the latter so I don't come on as clingy. 

Also she did tell me prior she is doing some fruit picking today, I guess I shouldn't message her later in the day to see how fruit picking went for her? And if she wants to tell me about her day, she will reach out and this could typically mean that she may be interested in me and wants to tell me more about her day.

I'm not trying to say I'm ""such a nice guy and all women like assholes"", that's not my point here. I'm not entitled to a relationship but, shouldn't I at least be doing better than a guy who is abusive? Don't get me wrong, not being abusive is literally the bare minimum behavior of a decent person, I don't deserve a cookie for it.

However, she has a problem that was not noticeable from the photos. She is really fat and really short. This is a huge turn off for me because I am very tall and athletic and I value physical fitness a lot.

I know that this may sound superficial, but I decided to not date her again because I did not feel physically attracted.

Just asked her again if she fancied a walk again tomorrow and she said she would love too. I'm so excited. The weather isn't looking great tomorrow, but I'm sure we can either go to where she said or find somewhere different if the weather is raining. she's shown interest in doing other things..we have to much in common and I'm getting good feelings.
I want to play it slow as I've just come out of a 12 year relationship. She knows this. My plan tomorrow is to continue to get to know her as frankly that means so much to me.

Anyways, the guy I like knew this and asked me if I was staying in town because the physical school was 50 miles away from us. 

I said yes, thinking nothing of it. Now when I go back to think about it, I think it’s weird that he even said that because there is no possibility I could complete the program on campus-all of those masters are online. 

The ironic thing is, he has the same degree as me, just a different concentration from the same school, he went there for undergrad, and his relative is a current professor at the college. 

I just find it weird now looking back that he’d ask me if I was staying here when he knows that school inside and out.

This morning we were sitting on her bed and she grabbed her phone cause her girlfriend texted her, then someone else texted her but there was no number and no name. It appeared to be a blank(not sure how that is possible other than using a (.) that maybe I didn't see. She immediately locked her phone and put it back on her nightstand. I should of said something but I didn't. I left shortly after masking my frustration. The night before we had a serious talk and she asked me not to see other girls which I'm cool with because I want to make shit official with her anyway.

If we didn't have that talk, I would of minded my business but it's bothered me all fucking day and I feel like it is my business at this point.

74,o4hc25,1624230072,How can I casually date around without hurting anyone’s feelings?,"TDLR; Casually seeing 3 very different people. Not sure what I want, and I’ve been very open about that. They’ve all shown they want to be serious with me. How can I avoid hurting anyone?

Alright, so 28 year old bisexual guy with a deep rooted commitment phobia. I haven’t been in a serious, committed relationship since high school, but I’ve dated around quite a bit since then. 

At the start of the year, I was feelin’ a bit lonely and unsatisfied, so told myself I was going to start casually dating around again and meeting people. I set expectations for myself, thought about what I really wanted, and promised myself that I’d be honest with whomever I “date” about my intentions. And then I started meeting people. 

I never realized how messy it could get it. I’m currently talking to three people — two guys and one girl. They’re all so different from one another, but I get along with all of them pretty well. I’m talking to these individuals somewhat regularly, and have been pretty open and honest with each of them.

The stickiness comes from the fact that all three want to be in committed relationships with me. I’ve been totally open about dating around and not jumping into anything serious, but it’s getting pretty messy anyway. 

I tell them I don’t know what I want, and that it’s not fair for them to wait around for me to figure it out. I think one of the biggest hurdles is that we’re all in our mid to late twenties, and, from what I’ve seen, a lot of people are just ready to settle at this age. I have a hard time believing any of these three people have actually fallen in love with me, especially since I haven’t known any of them that long. 

Realistically, I could see myself being in a relationship with any one of them for different reasons, but I don’t want to do that until I’m sure of it. I don’t think I’m going to know that anytime soon though. I feel like I’ve put myself in a *The Bachelor* type situation, and it’s honestly not great. I’ve been honest and open about my intentions, so what else can I do to prevent anyone’s feelings from being hurt?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4hc25/how_can_i_casually_date_around_without_hurting/

78,o4hn3k,1624231056,In a loop,"I (F22) keep on repeatedly coming across or dating this same kind of guy that in the end wants only sth casual and doesn’t want to commit or have a relationship.

Maybe it’s my fault or idk what it is. Basically I never talked or interacted much with guys till I was 20. I’ve had enough of it and I wished I could have a boyfriend and be in a relationship. So I decided to put myself out there.

I’m kinda introverted and quiet girl but I tried to become more outgoing and interactive and it did work since guys started paying attention to me.

Since I didn’t have any kind of previous experience with men, I was kinda naive in my thinking.

Not knowing why I always attract the same kind of male. You could describe them as a realistic “Mr Grays”. Yeah from the books/movies.

They’re dominant, like rough sex, can choose and pick in multiple women and the females will gladly fall into their arms, they’re handsome and so on but they don’t want anything more than fwb relationship.

As I said I was inexperienced and naive… maybe I still am since I keep falling in the same trap.

So I met a few guys till one managed to push the right buttons, crack the code and seduce me. He took my virginity and we’d meet from time to time… as you guessed for sex and spending some time together. 

After some time passed I started noticing he’s been keeping his distance more. He wouldn’t text with me as often as he used to, he’d only invite me for sex, etc.

It was because as an experienced guy he started noticing I started falling for him. 

So the last time we met (I didn’t know it’d be the last time at that point), we were cuddling and relaxing and I had my head on his shoulder and was looking at his face’s every feature and he’s eyes were closed. He looked so peaceful and I was smiling, happy I met him and that maybe there might be sth more between us.

I seriously didn’t know that this type of a man doesn’t do relationships… it’s just about sex.

So he probably felt me looking at him and he opened his eyes. He looked me in the eyes for a few seconds and said “please… don’t look at me this way”. 

I was like “what do you mean..?” And he replied with a serious statement “listen I’m not a guy you deserve.. someone like you deserve someone better, that’ll actually take you seriously.. idk if you’ve noticed but I’ve been keeping you at a distance because there can’t be anything more than that between us..”

I looked at him and actually deep down in my heart I knew that was the case all this time and I was just wishfully thinking I found a guy I could spend my life with. I just replied after looking into his eyes “I know” and buried my face in his shoulder. 

We laid this way for a few more minutes till my phone rung and I sat up to pick it. It was my mom asking me to get home cuz she had some business with me.

I turned to him and smiled saying “I gotta go”.. He noticed my smile was kinda forced and there was a tear running down my cheek but he didn’t say anything.

I got up immediately, packed my things and left after saying “goodbye”.

That night I didn’t sleep at all… I only silently cried. It was actually the first guy that I had feelings for as previously before I “put myself out there”, no man was ever interested enough to ask me out.

I was kinda numb for the next few days and then I just let it go. 

A few weeks later that guy texted me again being “sorry” he didn’t text me earlier and after we chatted about random stuff for a bit, he said that he wishes to meet with me and enjoy each other’s company.

I wrote him all I had stored in my mind and heart. It was a long message and at the end I tanked him for all the good time we’ve had and refused to meet for only sex again. I also added that I have no hard feelings nor do I think he used me and so on. 

That was the last time we talked. Neither him nor I texted again. Probably that was for the best. 

I came across another guy and he was same - sex is all that will be between us. So I left immediately after knowing that and turns out he ghosted me at the same time. I didn’t develop any feelings for him so it didn’t really influence me especially since we didn’t know each other for long,

Not too long ago I’ve met another guy. And I knew he was attracted to me as much as I to him. Today I got to know he’s also the same type of guy my first is. And all he wants from me is sex.

Truth to be said I’m kinda tired of this whole thing. At this point I can feel it in my bones that I’ll never be in a real relationship nor will I ever get married. I’m just incapable of finding the right kind of guy. 

I feel like not having a boyfriend during school years made “disabled” in a sense… I know it’s a strong word but idk how to describe it.

Before the third guy I’ve just described, I met a truly good guy and he didn’t pressure me with any sexual stuff or anything. He was really carrying and understanding to me.

We even started planning future together… But… after some time sth changed. And after I asked him “is sth wrong..?”, he admitted that before he met me, he had his future all planned out and he was actually planning on staying a bachelor till the end of his days.  

After I heard it I was already heartbroken because I truly felt we had a connection and all. 

He added that he can’t come up with how he could incorporate me in his dreams. And whatever to come, he’ll be there as my friend. Yeah I guess I understood what the meaning of being friendzoned really is..

And don’t get me wrong. It’s actually him that started giving me hopes and speaking about relationship and future together. I could imagine myself being with him so I thought “why not give it a shot..?”

But I really did grow in affection for that guy despite us not being together nor even kissing yet. He was really respectful and préfères to move slowly, which I actually appreciated. 

So hearing him saying all there would probably be between us is friendship hurt enough to shatter my heart.

All I did was put a smile on my face and say “I understand. Don’t worry, I’ll support whatever decision you’ve taken. Your dreams are really important and you should focus on those”.

He added “you know… if only I met you 3-4 years ago, we’d actually be together and you’d be part of my future”.

That night I cried again.

By now I just gave up and have no hopes. I probably keep meeting the third guy I described just because. After I’ll notice I’m starting to have feelings what will happen, I’ll leave again. After all, for those guys such feelings are only a nuisance, an unnecessary burden that they don’t want. 

Of course not all man are like that. The fourth guy is the prime example. But I’m just tired of it all. Why is modern society like so…

2. This was 2 months ago, we've basically spoken everyday since that day 
3. She's way hotter than me and is seeing other guys. She's constantly telling me ""how cute I am"" but I knoe it's in a friendly way. (I'm definitely in the friendzone)
4. Last week I went for her birthday party where she paraded me as the 'nicest guy'. Spent the entire night talking to only me (amongst like 10 of her other friends). I left with her and dropped her drunk ass home and went back home. 
5. I can't help thinking about her, until her birthday I was okay being just her friend because I don't want to date her anyway (atleast that's what I thought) 
6. We are absolutely different, she's a party girl and I'm more of a have a quiet dinner kinda guy. I work in IT and she works at Versace lol. So there's pretty much nothing. 
7. I tried icing her out and not responding immediately, she messaged me saying how much she misses talking to me and we don't talk as much. 
8. She responds when she feels like and sometimes gets weirdly passive

The pandemic came along and obviously I’ve felt loneliness like most single folk out there. I have tried dating apps , Tinder being the main one, and over the last year while I’ve had matches , they have been with women who I just don’t want to date. I’m someone who’s educated, worked all his life, and my very last match was with a woman who’s been out of work for 8 years….  Nope, and it’s not like she was spending that time raising kids or caring for someone. And there’s been a crap ton of ghosting too.
So basically I ended up deleting Tinder, as I thought I might as well embrace singledom than damage my mental health during the pandemic 

The pandemic has made things a lot harder, I’m permanently working from home , in the past I actually met a girlfriend while I was just grabbing lunch,  but now possibilities like that are gone too. This thought actually saddened me. I don’t have a huge social circle, my best friend is 30 and female ,she’s in a happy relationship so we don’t really hang out as much as we used to, although we do try and meet up once a week. I do feel like a male Pam (The Office) in that I miss spending time with my bestie, and don’t worry I don’t have any romantic feelings for my friend, but I miss goofing around and talking about the most random things with her

Anyway this is a long post already, but I was hoping for some advice, I don’t care if you’re male or female, but some tips on how to cope being single and childless at 40 would help. Ordinarily I wouldn’t have been so worried about my future but now that I’m also working from home, I’m going a day or two often without interacting with a human and I know this isn’t good for my health.

I don’t have a ton of other things going right now. Not else is on the horizon and SOME SHOT was better then nothing. At least it was nice to have hope.

There is a line of self worth. I wanna put everything I have in to it but man… trying to hard doesent look good. There is a balance I don’t feel I have. I don’t know how to not feel desperate because the chances just are far and few and that kind of sucks.

TL;DR: told a girl off for leading me on and now overly reflecting on desperation and self respect",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4i7xu/stood_up_for_myself_after_being_led_on_still_feel/

89,o4i9hr,1624233137,Girlfriend wants to go to a college across the country,"My (M19) girlfriend (F18) has decided she wants to go to college in California. She lives in New Jersey and I live in Pennsylvania so we’ve already had to deal with long distance. She wants to be an elementary school teacher, and her reason for going to CA for it was just “I’m at peace with it”. I support whatever decision she makes and I want her to be happy I just don’t think she’s making a good decision. 

I’m financially stable and have a full time job, I was hoping to propose to her in a year but now this changes things. We’ve been dating for 2.5 years so now we’d have to wait for another 4. There’s so many other options for college that could involve marriage and being a teacher I just don’t know why she wants to go to CA. I’ve had a couple discussions with her about it but she seems pretty adamant about it. 

I’m not really sure how to feel, I feel like she doesn’t care about our relationship. I want to stay together and she said she does too, it’s just now we have to wait for awhile. Instead of being married at 20/19 we’ll be married at 24/23. Not to mention she’ll be in CA for 4 of those years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4i9hr/girlfriend_wants_to_go_to_a_college_across_the/

So to keep a long story short, I find ""unappealing"" women very attractive (for instance some sort of deformity, disorder, etc.) but they are very hard to find imo. It isn't exclusively but I seriously wouldn't mind going out with one sometime. Like I'll go on like POF for instance and pretty much everyone on there is very visually appealing. I find almost noone ""ugly"" in this world (I can seriously count with both my hands the number of people I ever did find ugly).

93,o4ii6d,1624233944,Women can be just as bitter,"I hate how The stereotype seems to go that men are inherently bitter

I was raised by nothing but single black women and all I remember is most of them having some narrative that all men were trash and that trickle down and you would be foolish to believe that young children do not hear an internalize this


All my life I heard so much about what men do to women and by the time I was updating gauge and realize I had not done all of these things is where I really started questioning it

So far I'm a young black man at the age of 24 and I have been abused and cheated on

I have yet to abuse or lie or cheat on anyone but by popular discourse, this is supposed to be happening all the time from me to women

Women have just as many crazy beliefs about men that men do to women and I have met so many women who are filled with bitterness and it manifests in different ways just like it does in women.

I dated a very brutal and deeply insecure girl who was super bitter for the fact that the 10 out of 10 guys did not pick her. Damn my opinion being her boyfriend. She was still so bitter that she was in picked from those type of guys and I had to hear it all the time",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4ii6d/women_can_be_just_as_bitter/

98,o4iy08,1624235423,"why are people, especially on OLD unwilling to have direct conversations?","For context: a few days ago I went out on a second tinder date. The date itself was fine, but things went downhill at his place. Some how we got on the topic of social media and I asked him about his opinion on cancel culture. He was hesitant to disclose his opinion because apparently, it’s hard to comment on such topics without knowing the other persons political views. So for fun, he suggested we fill out an online “political compass.” Long story short, the last page has questions pertaining to sex, LGBTQ and religion. Since we hadn’t discussed our intentions I thought I’d seize the opportunity and ask what his thoughts on hook-up culture were. He immediately got super flustered and awkward, he then tried to skirt around the question by deflecting it back on to me. It literally took 25 minutes of us going back and forth, for him to finally admit that he was looking for  a FWB. 

At one point, he tried to imply that I was being too straight forward. Which is hilarious because it wasn't even like I asked what he was looking for in relation to me! 
You know what I'm trying to wrap my head around? The fact that people are comfortable dating and/or having casual sex with people they met off OLD but uncomfortable talking about the 'other stuff' in between the lines. All you need to know is, he thinks relationships equal ""averaging out each other's misery"" - like get a grip! In conclusion, **always** make sure to have this discussion BEFORE you get any ideas. Chances are they've already made up their mind, *going with the flow doesn't really exist!*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4iy08/why_are_people_especially_on_old_unwilling_to/
