0,mjf76y,1617477452,What advice would you give to a 5ft6/7 below average Asian guy?,"I feel like these features have really held me back, I have worked on myself, my personality and gotten more hobbies, I go for girls that are considered ""stereotypically attractive"" and I also go for girls that are on a similar attractiveness (based on appearance). A lot of girls say dating is based on personality, and I feel like even though I am not the best looking guy, I should at least get girls from my personality, which then makes me think my personality is terrible as well. 

I really don't want to have these thoughts at all, but it's just made me think girls in London are really entitled and superficial.

After that, we went on a third at a restaurant and we had sex inside her car. She recently has been more open with me and she told me about a guy who she stopped seeing in last October who she really liked who pushed her away and how she was really hurt about that.

I’m a Punjabi American woman, born and raised in NY. I have recently moved to the west coast but my issues have followed me. I have dated only Hispanic men, not that I seek them out exclusively, but they just happened to be the ones I always connect with. However, while dating, I always got hit with comments such as “ you are too pretty to be Indian” “you have to be mixed with Spanish”. When I was younger, and had low self esteem I took these comments as compliments. However as I grew and worked on myself I realized how insensitive such comments truly are. My question is, should I still pursue dating out of the Punjabi circle and potentially come across the same mind set over and over again, or should I try to just settle with someone who is also Punjabi.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjgnyq/punjabi_american_woman_and_dating_latinos/

I’m a white female in my early twenties and am bisexual. I lean more towards women though. My boyfriend I’ve been with for years is is a heavyset, bearded, hairy Caucasian man who would normally be the complete opposite of my type.  And yeah while I think he’s cute and I love him, I do have a typical type. 

I like guys that aren’t too tall, skinny, with softer features. Dark hair and eyes are nice. Being petite and a bit more fragile looking is really attractive to me in a man. I can’t stand body hair, particularly facial hair. It’s always been a huge turn off for me.

For women I actually like more masculine looks and the ethnicity doesn’t really matter. The stereotypical butch look if I had to sum it up is really beautiful in a woman to me.

So I like male physical traits that are found in a lot of places in certain parts of Asia and a lot of of my preferences aren’t really found in my area of my country overly often (USA). 

I also like more masculine women. I’m been told a few times that maybe because I lean towards women more that I tend to just prefer female looking features in men and gravitate towards races/ethnicity’s more likely to have them. I don’t know if there’s anything to that but I thought I’d see if anyone felt similar or had any answers.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjh0sl/is_it_weird_that_im_attracted_to_a_lot_of/

19,mjhoqz,1617485202,"The problem with ""How are you still single?"" Line","As a female who is 34 and single, I have had this questioned asked of me multiple times throughout my dating life. It starts either from random work colleagues and friends who know you (male and female) to the guys you meet and getting to know or dating.

But there is something so wrong about this line of questioning that I had to discuss here. Asking this question ignores our current reality, that online dating has given people more options than ever before and the grass is greener on the other side mentality that is prevalent. But even more importantly that dating is actually NOT easy.

Some of these people in relationships got lucked out and found their one and only when they were younger, or by random fate. They did not go through the rigorous dating process of today and completely live in a bubble when it comes to how hard modern dating really is and finding someone long-term, where you have compatibility and chemistry. They don't understand how many swipes you have to go through to find one match that you align with or how many bad dates you have to go on to find one where things just flow naturally.

So please, for future, refrain from asking a single person this question. It doesn't make us feel better about ourselves as if we are a catch. It makes us feel there must be something inherently wrong with us if others have found their one and we are still here single and swiping despite being beautiful and intelligent as you have put it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjhoqz/the_problem_with_how_are_you_still_single_line/

So during the date I asked the important stuff like ""What are you actually looking for? A relationship? Something casual? Friendship?"" I am looking for a serious relationship so this was key. I also asked whether or not children are part of his plan some day and gave a very vague non-response basically.

His response to the latter question was ""Yeah well, it depends on the woman"". So I asked what exactly does that mean, and he pretty cursorily said ""It depends really what the situation is like with the woman I'm with, whether or not I'd like to have kids"".

So it's not a straight forward yes or no.

Am I internalizing it too much by assuming he meant, he wouldn't want to have kids with me, in particular? I had this suspicion because we do come from different cultures and races. So perhaps he is not to big on the prospect of raising mixed kids?

Nevertheless, despite the fact that the date as a whole was quite lovely, I am inclined to ditch this guy because he also seemed to not be entirely sure whether or not he would like a serious relationship in general.

Please don't misunderstand me, these were general questions as it was a first date. I was not saying he *must* want to be in a relationship with me specifically. Just asking whether that is something he wants in general, same with children.

Two days later I ask if any time works for her she said yeah any time is fine just send her the info a day before the movies. Yesterday, I send her the info she says her best friend is coming she’ll be driving there I said sounds good. Today, I text her asking what time does she think she’ll get there but no reply.

But I guess I was overthinking shit. The last girl I ask out, I failed horribly. My dumbass just told her how I felt smh. I did that cuz it worked last time. I’m clean, ambitious, got a lot of hobbies, I like to tease and I think I’m a nice person.  (Not saying that cuz I’m a “nice guy”, I just think I’m missing something) I treat everybody the same, but I just feel like I gotta prove myself when I’m around some girls and I hate that.

I also love cuddling btw and I'm or at least was a huge romantic but that could all change depending in my true orientation. Also, my forced crushes on women go from infatuation to nothing whereas my unwanted crushes on guys grow healthily as i get to know them(I didn't know where ti add this but I also like makeup and I used to feel inferior to women back when I had an inferiority complex but I dont have gender disphoria).

Society just sucks).

My main concern is that he might be taking our relationship lightly and might not feel the same.

We only see each other once or twice a week since we're both busy, but we did spend Christmas, New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day and both of our birthdays together.

Anyways, I just feel scared to say I love you for the first time, and every time I wanna say it I open my mouth and the words get stuck in my throat. I'm scared I'll make him uncomfortable or scare him away. He told me about his past relationships and from what I gathered, he hasn't really had anything serious aside from his first girlfriend over ten years ago, so that might be why I'm scared to tell him.

We talk to each other everyday and we rely on each other for emotional and moral support. Recently I've fallen for her but before I could ask her out, I found out from her that she actually likes another friend of mine (E). In normal circumstances I would have have just given it up but when is life ever that simple.

So for some background, E, BC and I met through working together in a college student org (and we still are). I was noticing that BC was getting regularly annoyed so I as her friend, I checked in on her. She refused to tell me the reason at first. But due to my persistence, she eventually told me that it was due to her crush on E and the reason for her being annoyed is that E doesn't seem to be interested in her. She then apologized for hiding it from me as she was worried that I might have a thing for her. So me trying to be the nice guy, I lied about not actually liking her as I didn't want to make the situation even more awkward for her and I wasn't ready to tell her either. 

So presently, BC hasn't told E that's she likes him but I know for a fact that E only sees BC as a friend. This is because I've talked to E before about this topic before all this happened and he doesn't seem interested in her. E also doesn't talk to BC much and they mostly communicate only when it comes to work.

He also asked me if he could see what my hair looked like out since in my photos it’s up.

Is there a middle ground?!,"I’m 23F; been single for two years and since then I’ve dated numerous people. Most of the men I was involved with were between 25-28, and none of them seemed remotely interested in a relationship. 

I know everyone has a different timeline and that some people don’t want a relationship (with anyone; or me specifically, due to their own reasons.) But regardless,  the majority of men I’ve dated within my desired age range, are straight up anti-commitment. And it’s frustrating because I think it’s perfectly reasonable to desire a relationship at my age. We aren’t kids anymore, a relationship might be a stretch for a 15 year old boy, but a man 25+ shouldn’t run in the opposite direction when they hear that word! 

I don’t want a friends with benefits and I don’t want to spend months in a situationship. I’m not immediately gunning for marriage either, I just don’t understand.

I know a lot of people will read this and say “He didn’t find you attractive enough. He didn’t think you were girlfriend material. He had better options, etc” but in all honesty myself and many other women ARE a great catch. I don’t want to date significantly older either, any suggestions or advice?!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjnx5l/i_dont_want_to_date_men_who_are_significantly/

- I went through mental health issues for 10 years after high school.
- Got help, graduated with my CS degree and got a great job.
- Was planning on moving out when my Dad became sick so I remained at home to help my Mom care for him. Unfortunately he passed away a year later.
- Two months after my Dad passed away, my Mom had to have heart surgery. I remained at home to help her recover.
- A few months after her surgery, the pandemic hit. I didn't want to leave her alone until we were all vaccinated so I still remained at home. Especially as it had only been a few months after my Dad passed away.
- I am looking to get my own place next year assuming the everything goes well with the vaccinations.

He deleted his dating app after first date but that conversation wasn’t out of exclusivity- not sure if he’s meeting people in person still. Neither of us used apps before covid. I’m the only person he’s met on app.  He does refer to our meets as “dates” also.

Should I bring up exclusivity or wait?  I realize it depends but appreciate any input on benchmarks to wait for, or if I should wait for him to initiate that talk when he’s ready.

97,mjp2rx,1617510775,Just looking for other people to relate too,"Wow. I never thought I'd ever use Reddit but here I am!

I'm a 28 year old asexual/gay dude. I've never dated, like ever, for some reasons more obvious than others.

I've always found it extremely difficult to want to start dating because I'm asexual and very sex repulsed and I'm never going to compromise on that. That being said, my dating pool is very limited to non-existent. A couple of years ago, I was going through a major depressive situation and during that time, my best friend (who at that point has also never dated or anything) had told me she had a boyfriend. 

I was already feeling incredibly miserable emotionally and I guess chemically you could say in that moment and I had to hold everything back to keep from crying/losing it while smiling to her telling her I was happy for her.

I'm of course not blaming anything on her! I was just very mentally volatile and it was the most crushing news because all I could think was, ""Even my best friend finally has someone and I still don't."" It was even worse the next morning when her other friends who are married came over and they talked about double dating and stuff and I just had to stand there pretending I was okay and feeling left out.

Again, this is all on me, not her and I am truly happy for her. I just felt more lonely at that time and I still remember it very vividly. 

I just wish I could find someone and experience what so many of my friends have. I want to put myself out there but nothing happens. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bitter though at times whenever one of my friends brings up their relationships because all I can think is ""Well, at least you're IN a relationship."" I don't have any other ace friends IRL to talk too either or relate to. 

I've tried dating apps and all that but I never find anyone I can vibe with who also isn't just interested in hooking up. I'm definitely not into the whole ""gay culture"" thing, at all. Not to mention it's very shallow. I mean hey, it works for others but it's not for me. 

I feel like I'm never going to be with someone at this point. I'm just not going to compromise that part of me just for the sake of a relationship either. Being ace rocks, wouldn't change it! But it does making dating more difficult. And the very rare times I have talked with other gay ace dudes, I just don't mesh with their personality and have little in common. I've basically given up searching at this point because each time it's ended up fruitless.

As pathetic and miserable as this sounds, I guess sometimes it helps being able to commiserate with others. This isn't all I think about in my life, but when it hits, it hits. \*shrugs\*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjp2rx/just_looking_for_other_people_to_relate_too/

“Even though it’s an artificial means of communication, texting someone you like requires an element of vulnerability. With every text, you’re putting yourself out there by expressing your continued interest, hoping they’ll reciprocate.

If they don’t reciprocate, remember not to panic. The natural first reaction is embarrassment, but don’t beat yourself up for taking a risk and allowing yourself to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is crucial for any future healthy relationship, so don’t teach yourself to be closed off to avoid pain.
