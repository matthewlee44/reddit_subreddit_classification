Me(22m) have been seeing this girl for like two months now(22f) we originally worked with each other for atleast a year and a half but she quit and found another job I never once spoke to her because I was shy and kept to myself but I knew who she was. Months later I found her Instagram and we get to catching up, asked her out for dinner but got rejected because she said that she doesn’t make dating a priority while in university, a few weeks go by and we start going out.

I’ve been paying for everything on the 3+ dates and few hangouts we’ve had, I don’t mind but it gets expensive especially since we go to bars. I’m not a cheap so I can afford it but thought that she’d offer to pay atleast once. We had a conversation this week about us and she mentioned she’s not looking for a relationship because she wants to work on herself and has a lot going on in her life which I respected she’s been in a 3 year relationship and I suppose that made her realize a lot, not to mention the fact that she says she’s never been in love. To sum it up she’s super confused with her emotions and says she’s not sure that she can give me what I desire which is ultimately a relationship. I said that’s fine because truthfully I wasn’t looking for a relationship either but I had started to catch feelings and had hoped this would lead to something.

Currently she wants to remain as friends but still wants to see me and go out, wants the same physically affection we’ve had including sexual stuff. At this point I want to stop seeing her but I can’t, I’ve built up these feelings and it’s killing me. I told her I wanted to stop seeing her because it’s going to just hurt me but once she mentioned that she still wants to go out I just told her I do too and basically folded. We haven’t texted in about a day but I don’t want to initiate anything anymore, including going out despite how much fun we have. I know she likes me because she’s mentioned that she loves the way I treat her how kind I am, and pretty much that I’m such a nice guy. But I don’t know I feel like that’s a bad thing to be a nice guy .

I have pretty much given up on ever meeting someone who isn't using me as a slump buster, like I get it I'm not an attractive woman. But supposedly your other redeeming qualities will actually attract a long-term partner, I really think that is bs for anyone who is below average. I know you are supposed to be working on yourself for your own well-being but, I can do that all I want and still get no where with dating.

I'm independent, I make my own money, I bought my own home, I am trying to improve as much as I can. 
I've put in a lot of work on my physical appearance I've lost weight (only weigh 110 lbs), I've tried different hair options. I've tried to expand my interests even when I hate the activity I go anyways, most of the things I actually enjoy are solo activities like reading. I know the pandemic has made meeting people in person an issue but even pre-pandemic I have never had any luck. I used to go out every weekend with friends and get ignored by men on the regular who just wanted to talk with my more attractive friends, the only time men have ever payed any attention to me was for cheap hookups, or as one guy put it 'I just took one for the team so my buddy could get laid'. 

Dating apps are a joke no matter what gender you are if you aren't physically attractive, I get that but how are you supposed to actually get to know someone if you never get a chance to begin with. I don't shoot for the top men, I know that I don't have a chance. I always try to stay close as I can to people of my league, but men I do match with never want anything beyond sex.

I am generally fine with being alone, I just do the things I enjoy. After a while though all of my friends have partnered up and I'm the only single person left. Yeah I can still hangout with them but I'm always the 3rd wheel. It just gets old being alone all the time. I've been in therapy, I keep thinking I'm the problem here. My therapist keeps saying I'm not and that what really counts is inner beauty. Problem with that is no one gives me a shot to even show any 'inner beauty'. Looks fade and all that, but I never had looks to begin with, tried photo feeler to see if I could find more appealing photos, I've never been rated higher than around a 3.5 on attractiveness. I'm just pretty much at a loss for ever finding someone, I don't think it is healthy to lower my standards anymore at this point.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153584,public,self,I'm invisible to men,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s76212/im_invisible_to_men/,no_ads,0,,,,

Just vent a lot of my worries and thoughts as of late. 

My biggest concern at the moment is time. I recently got out of a 5 year relationship at 27. I feel extremely pressured to find someone else. I’m still hurting from the breakup, but I hate being single even more so. My ex has already moved on and I feel I need to as well. 

I haven’t been single in 5 years and the thought of dating again scares the hell out of me. I’ve been considering the dating apps, but the consensus seems to be all over the place with those things. The general takeaway seems to be though is if you’re a man it’s a lot harder. I’m just not sure how else to meet people, given I’m naturally a pretty introverted person. I only found my last two partners through work and school. 

A big comment I often see is just ignore finding someone and just focus on life and it’ll find you. I think this is baloney and just an anecdote to help people not feel so defeated. My current lifestyle with following that mantra would leave me single for probably many years as my day to day doesn’t really involve meeting many new people. At least not to a level that could build any sort of relationship. 

I’m currently working on myself and trying to get my self esteem back. I don’t think I’m an ugly dude, but dating at this age seems vastly different then my early 20’s. that might be just due to the fact that I’m doomscrolling dating crap on Reddit, but it seems daunting now. The dating landscape looks rough. 

I’ve learned that I tied a great deal of my self worth into having a partner in my life. I feel like without one I come across as this pathetic, bitter, and unaccomplished man who is incapable of having a woman in his life. 

I don’t know what I’m asking or looking for here, but any and or all advice with dating would be appreciated.

We have been working together for the last couple of years, but I work in the office doing admin and he is out of state working in the field. He was recently promoted, and we've had to talk quite a bit when it comes to the progress and documents needed which means we've also gotten the chance to get to know each other. Just to be clear- we aren't in the same department and don't manage or have authority over on another. It's more coordinating than anything and there wouldn't be an issue with that in the future as our job placements are so far from each other. His voice alone is probably one of the sexiest things I've heard, and I've seen a couple pictures of him from social media I've lurked on and it's safe to say he's my type to a T. Over the last couple of weeks, we've really enjoyed talking to each other and stay on the phone for an hour after talking about work just to talk to each other on a personal level and I think the vibe is mutual.

One of my best friend's boyfriends also works for the company and she goes out to see him often. We decided to take a trip together in a couple weeks to visit them and I'm overanalyzing every bit of it because I feel like this is my now or never chance to see if it'd be possible for us to take it a step further. He knows I'm coming out and seems excited but we definitely both play it safe and don't go out of the way to flirt with each other too hard and make it obvious. On the other hand, I'm debating on if it's even a good idea to attempt anything considering the work relationship we have on top of the distance. He lives in another state than I do aside from where he's working, and if we were to date there'd be a lot of travelling and compromise along with talk about which state we'd move to for each other. I know I sound crazy planning that far out, but I like him so much just from over the phone that I'm fairly confident I'm going to meet him in person and melt.

I usually wouldn't go out on a limb like this, but something about this screams I'm missing out on the opportunity if I don't try regardless of the hurdle.

I'm still open to allow whatever to grow organically, but I have neither the time nor the interest in maintaining multiples.

We met online and we always spoke through WhatsApp. Because she lives in the other side of the world it's difficult for meeting, specially now with the pandemic. 
This year I was finally able to book a flight to her country and today was our first date. She blew my mind, she is a person so unique to me and I love it. All girls I know either liked partying, drinking, etc. This girl is really classy, likes to stay at home, read, go to operas, etc. During our meet it was really tense, she looked like a really reserved person, she was somewhat serious, when we had something good to talk about she would laugh and keep it going. But eventually she would come back to be serious. Neither of us didn't know when to stop the date that we were in that restaurant around 4 hours. 
My question here is, how can I make her more relaxed with me, I really love this girl and want this to work. Right now we are just friends, because I'm a foreigner I asked her to show me the city or do things with me. I know it's too much to ask, but I'm here 2 months and getting that visa was not that easy, so every day counts.
 We agreed to meet tomorrow, I asked her what plans she had and she said none. I'm here because of her, so obviously I have no plans either. So second date after 12 hours, we will go buy tickets for ballet this Sunday, and we will go to museums and after eat. I really like her, but I don't know how to make her feel at ease with me. It's the first time I meet a girl like this, she's so unique to me that it's worth asking for guidance in this subreddit. 
I'm also very scared, from experience I can get girls very fast, but this time I just couldn't. I was scared every second of making a mistake, I think I did but was able to minimize it later. I also can't read her mind, so it makes it really hard for me. 
Having said that, this person is kind of a stay at home girl, classy girl. Is it too fast if I try to hold her hand? I feel myself stupid asking this question, it's not even kiss or sex. But I like her, and I want this to work, it's very stressing for me.

I told her I couldn't find anything on my google drive to share with her.

I don't know if porn desensitized me over the years but it just didn't do anything for me (also, her head is not in the picture btw, there is also no tattoo on her belly, so the earlier photos were definitely from someone else).

Like do a complete 180. And it’s not even me saying it to try and push for a relationship, it’s just to give them piece of mind and reassurance—a little self confidence that I am into them for more than their generosity when taking me out on dates. 

For example, this one guy who I was talking with for about a month (23M), had been asking me out every weekend. He texted me everyday, and he was kind of dorky (I found it to be adorable) and seemed a little nervous on dates even though I felt super comfortable. He seemed like he liked me way more than I liked him, but then one time after hooking up after a date, I casually mentioned that I liked him a lot and would love to keep seeing him. For real, every other confession, first move, and comments of interest were all made by him—which obviously told me I should reciprocate and hopefully make him feel a bit more confident. It just did the complete opposite.

The next time we hung out it was a different vibe and he basically told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship…. But I didn’t ask for one nor did I feel as though it was even appropriate to have that convo a month into dating. He said he wanted to keep seeing me but that he was scared that I was too interested in him all because I said I liked him (even though his actions and things he said to me made it seem like he liked me wayyyy more). 

Why do men get so scared by this word?? Like fr that was the only reasoning he had when I tried to inquire why he felt like he had to manage my expectations and emotions barely a month into dating. Does that word have a deeper meaning that I’m not aware of? Because it’s really not that deep to me, but every man I tell it to does a complete 180 after I say it.

The men on this subreddit are always talking about how their confidence is being shattered on a regular basis, but I don't know what would be worse: honesty, politeness, or ghosting.

Women have 3 options when they are not interested in dating you:

1. Be honest and say something that probably hurts your feelings.
2. Say something like, ""It's not you, it's me.  I'm working on myself.  I'm not looking for a relationship right now.""  Vague but not hurtful.

Background: I (25M) started dating my girlfriend (25M) about 4 months ago. We met off tinder and clicked IMMEDIATELY.  we keep seeing each other and become exclusive.  However, she’s told me things about her past completely unsolicited, things I did not ask to know and very much did not want to know, things that I did not feel the relationship was ready for. (We had only been together a few weeks) Her past is her past and that’s fine but she would go in to TOO much detail, again unsolicited.  One of the things she mentioned is how she  exclusively dated black and brown men before me (I am white, so is she).  That’s no problem to me at all but I felt that she has a type and that I do not fit that type.  She has made comments like “I like my coffee black and (before you) my men black” and “this is what I get for dating a white kid from the west side” (I live on the west side of town, she lives on the east side of town).  She essentially just goes out of her way to point out that I am white which again makes me feel like I am not her type given her exclusive dating history.  I have since asked her to stop making such comments as they made me uncomfortable as it shouldn’t matter what I look like but today when she went in for a job interview near my place, she said “there’s too many white people here” which made me feel uncomfortable about who I am.  I’ve asked her to stop and she apologized and agreed to stop but it still happens on occasion.

The next day she messages me on Facebook. She tells me it was nice to meet me and she gave me her number and told me it would be nice to hang out sometime. I responded also telling her I enjoyed meeting her and also told her I will text her later as I would definitely be interested in hanging out. She ""love"" reacted my messages.

The next evening I text her to greet her and she gets back to me the next morning. She responded, asked me how my weekend was going, we had a short chat, and she again asked me if I would be interested in meeting for drinks and dinner this week. I said yes and told her I'm down to meet with her and told her I have suggestions for places to go to.

Over the weekend I (22M) had my first date (not really sure date is the right word, we only referred to it as meeting up/hanging out) *ever* with a girl (22F) I met through OLD who I was talking to for at least 2 months prior. Dating was never a priority for me because of lots of issues with self worth, insecurities, generally being very anxious and shy, thus never done anything past talking to girls in a social context and being too chicken to make a move, ask for a number, or just flirt in general. However texting this girl was the first time things felt different (I’ve *meaningfully* matched with maybe 3 dozen girls in the last year total), I responded no differently than I would anyone else but we had no issue keeping a conversation flowing to the point where I miraculously felt comfortable enough to ask her out. We kept texting every day up until our date just sharing stuff going on day to day and general curiosities.

Anyway, before the date I was absolutely petrified, I could barely eat and get myself ready. I was so worried about A) me thinking this person is, or myself being, nothing like their profile/texts and me wasting both of our time or B) me doing/saying something dumb and ruining my chances with someone genuinely interested in me. Another thing I can’t wrap my head around, stemming from severe imposter syndrome with anything, I really struggle understanding why any stranger would want to know about me, spend time with me, care about me (besides my family or close friends of course). So I get to where we decide to meet and she had gotten there first so there goes any formal greeting out the window, I walk in and greet her with just a stupid “hey we made it” and pulled enough together to act like myself. We sit down and talk for ~2 hours, rarely a pause, lots of laughs, rehashing stories we told over text with more detail, learning more about each other. I tried my best to remember to smile/eye contact (things I’m just bad at regardless).

Here’s where my critical overthinking comes in. She talked a lot about her male friends, something very normal for her I guess, whereas all my close friends are dudes and I’ve never really had any close female friends, at least that I would talk to out of the blue or hang out with often. This just screams to me that the friend zone was not out of question. It doesn’t help that I was acting extremely cautiously/respectfully and didn’t even once think to compliment her or break the touch barrier, just brushing past each other as we walked. To be fair, she didn’t drop any compliments or wasn’t too forward with contact either. By the end she was abruptly in a hurry to leave even though we both mentioned we had nothing go on for the day. She had taken public transit to the place and I had driven. Considering we at least talked for 2 hours without any huge red flags being thrown, I offered to driver her back and she accepted no hesitation.

Commence the ‘holy fuck she’s in my car’, I fumble to play something on the aux and she directs me to her place and we just talk about music. We get to her place and she just jumps out and says “it was really nice finally meeting you” I return it and it was over. The whole rest of the day I was confused, she was an amazing person and more than I could ever ask for but the date felt so neutral, kicking myself for not being more forward, but thankful I also wasn’t and made a fool of myself. We’re radio silent the whole rest of the day. Midnight roles around and there’s zero chance I’m sleeping that night unless I text her. “Hey sorry for the late reply. I had a really good time today, wondering if you’d want to meet up again sometime”. Not really knowing what I wanted to hear but fully expecting something along the lines of “you were nice but I don’t see *us* happening”. Not long after I get a “Yes totally!!!”, W.T.F. What did I do?! Specifically what did I do *right*?! This put a massive smile on my face but it still didn’t stop me from not sleeping that night and literally re-rolling everything that went down that day.

Next day she’s texting me just like we had been prior to the date. The day after she adds me on snapchat (from my number) out of nowhere, I had made it clear I don’t really use any social media but something to consider regardless. I’m just at a total loss here. My critical overthinking is that I’ve just been thrown deep into the friend zone, yet we’ve only met once. I know some people like to take is slow and become friends before becoming more than friends so I have no idea how to read this situation as I don’t know even know what my preferential pace is. I know this second date has to mean something, we didn’t meet on a dating app to go out to dinner or whatever and make a friend who lives across the city so I know want and need to make moves. I then risk being too forward and messing things up is she wants to take it slow. For all I know that was her first date ever and she’s just as inexperienced and confused, and that’s not something we discussed and I wouldn’t a clue if it’s something she’d be comfortable discussing.

I have no idea what I’m specifically asking for here besides how do I not mess this up? This girl was cute, funny, respectful, we had more than enough shared interests and I’m already thinking of dozens of things to talk about with her but I don’t know how to make it more than just a conversation and into a relationship.

However, there was something about him where he was super cuddly with me from the get go, and I didn’t mind it. I remember even the first few times after we had sex, he’d say “do you usually do this with other people?” (Cuddling). And I was honest with him and said no and he replied me neither. Fast forward 3/4 weeks later, we’ve been messaging each other almost everyday and have been meeting up but just to have sex, and we would also stay the night round each other’s, and have showers together. (Something I never do with a fwb)

It’s to the point now where I have admitted to myself that I have some form of feelings for him, as I’d usually be bored of whichever guy I’m seeing after a month, but somehow he still keeps me interested. I’m at a point now where I still want to keeping seeing him and having sex, but I’m tempted to ask if he sees this going anywhere, or if he wants to start hanging out outside of just having sex, but I’m worried that a) I’m saying something too soon and b) I’ll look desperate.

My parents are trying to find a guy for me to marry, so I’ll most likely have an arranged marriage which is common in our culture anyways. 
So far the guys my mom has mentioned are all South Asian, like don’t get me wrong I’m not saying they’re not attractive or anything. I think everyone is beautiful. But for some reason I myself can’t imagine living with one. 
I have talked to my sister about this and she told me that I’m not being realistic enough  and that I should come in terms with the fact that since I’m a south Asian I’ll most likely marry one too. 
Like I’m open to the idea of marrying someone outside my race, I think I’ll be more happier that way instead of marrying someone of my race. Whenever I see an interracial couple I think they look soo good and cute together, especially interracial babies/kids I think they look super cute, and sometimes I wish one day I could have an interracial kid too. 
Idk I just have thoughts like these and I feel like it’s very hard for me to explain to my family since they obviously want me to marry someone of my race, all of my cousins and siblings have married someone within the race. 
I thought of telling this to my parents before too but I feel like when I will tell them that I’m not attracted and want to marry someone outside my race, they’ll be like do I have someone I like and if I don’t I’ll have to marry someone from within the race if that makes sense. 

So I don’t know what to do that this point, like I’m abit confused. I can go along with my parent’s wishes and marry someone of my race but I don’t think I’ll be happy that way. 
Btw I know some ppl might comment that this has something to do with psychology or with child abuse or trauma or self hatred, And no this has nothing to do with it and is not the cause of this so yea just to put it out there.

Recently I got dumped by a woman I was seeing for 4 months for someone else. We had both been still seeing others in the meantime but I really wanted to be exclusively with her because she truly made me feel happy and she knew this too. But even though I knew the vibe was off when we recently saw each other, she held it in for at least a week, which made me more anxious. I have been languishing for two years in a big city, a thankless job with nobody else to turn to. It's lonely, isolating and makes me very depressed. She texted me wishing me the best, thanking me for being such a great, caring person. 

I go to therapy (I'll see them tomorrow in fact!), I try to exercise, I try to be attentive to people and their needs.

She was quite, yeah, distracting, while i had to work near her i happened to be goofer than usual and burning with sweat cause i just find her attractive out of my control and she is much more beautiful than any other girls i happened to date, i would say, like, looking out of my class. I used to be shy with girls but i'm not really anymore and this happening was highely unusual(such random attraction had me think she could also maybe feel the same, as humans have pheromones too, just a guess though). So yeah, first day i didn't talk to her and just got nervous, might have catched some glares but didn't give to them so much attention at the moment. His name was written at her desk so i could search her on facebook and stalk  a little bit, i saw she was single, went at the same high school than me and was only some months younger. 

Today was the last day working in her row and since i found her attractive i wanted to do some moves before i lose the opportunity. I was observing more so i could catch anything and i did catch things. In fact i catched some glares and every time she would move her hair just after while she quickly turn her head. And while i was not catching her she looked deep dove in her work(i also did the same in between glares). When my job was done before dinner i went to eat but sat in the middle of the cafeteria while looking at door so i can see if she came. She indeed came and i tried to be inviting to her with slight glares and stuff. She sat at the closest table to me with one other of her colleagues but her back was turned. 

She talked with her and we didn't talk yet but she was sometimes watching in the back a little bit. I finished my dinner, left for a few mins to put away my lunchbox and then i decided to be brave and go talk to her at the table in the front so i can go talk to her directly hoping her colleague wouldn't be there but she was till there. I did it anyway and first asked : have i seen you at school(i was not really remembering but still asked for the sake an intro as i knew we went to the same school at the same time from her facebook), she obviously didn,t remember either since it was  7 years ago but she did ask me basic questions while i wasn't talking to keep the conversation going. 

She had an open posture and looked happy to talk with me, had slight smiles at moments but wasn,t clearly flirting and i wasn't that much either altough i might have  gave myself with my behaviour, my weird question and also i did say i wanted to talk to her earlier but didn,t want to disturb her in her work. The questions she asked me i can remember were : What program were you in?(about high school), do you like the work(since i was new), what tasks do you have?

I got really worried and was afraid this was her saying the dreaded we should just be friends. But she specified she didn't want to break up and she likes me. We hugged and I feel better now. And we went out and got breakfast today and have seen each other outside of work. But not wanting to go on dates feels like a sign I think.

Valentine’s Day he got me a thoughtful gift as I did for him. On my birthday in July he got me a gift but didn’t wrap it, just sort of left it on his bed, got undressed and went under the covers almost like he said “okay well there it is, time to nap”. On his birthday in November I got him a winter coat since I didn’t want him to freeze outside as he didn’t have one. 
Now for Christmas, he knew he was going to get something from me. One month before Christmas he asked me what I wanted but I never told him cause I never like telling people what I want, so I told him to ask my best friend to help him. A week before Christmas my best friend told me he asked her about what he should get me. On Christmas Eve I came over to his house and brought gifts not only for him, but for his mother, father and two brothers.And I went home empty handed. On Christmas day I came over again just to hang out, and his mom got me a gift that was well thought out, I saw an extra gift bag and asked him if it was from him. He said “no but yours is on the way” and he never brought it up again. This man lied to me. It’s been almost a month since Christmas and he still hasn’t updated me on it. I can’t tell if he’s being cheap or lazy but I was just so hurt that I put so much into his and family gifts and he just … didn’t bother with anything. Then on our one year anniversary (jan.1. 2022) he once again didn’t do shit. Didn’t plan for a dinner or dessert. I decided not to bother cause it’s always me planning things. I did however get him a thoughtful gift. I did have a talk with him about this a couple days after our anniversary and he acted very apologetic that he hurt me. And whatever, we dealt with it but I keep thinking in my head why did he lie about this Christmas gift? Surely I would know it’s a lie if nothing ever arrived. Is he hoping I might forget ? Why am I putting in so much effort in this relationship . I feel like I shouldn’t be trying as hard as I should. I think that with valentines coming up, whatever happens it could either make or break the relationship. 
My brain can’t seem to let this go. But let me be clear, I’m not the type to be spoiled wanting jewelry or designer bags, I just want some effort. I don’t know what to do.

We had a talk about it and stated I was not interested on knowing her sexual history and I would like to avoid that topic as it seems irrelevant to me (as long as there’s no a STD around).

Last date we went out for drinks and she brought that topic and she started asking me about my dating history and I was kind of vague with my answers but it seemed more like she wanted to tell me about hers. She used to date older men (10-17 yrs older than her) and pointed how they are so experienced and confident, then at some point of the conversation she said she wanted to be a cougar or have an experience with a 20yrs younger guy when she gets in her 40’s. The rest of the night she asked me about what I want in a relationship and how our dates are going well and that stuff. At the end of the night she rejects to come over to my place. All of this discouraged me to continue dating her at all.

Should I talk to her about my thoughts and discuss or should I just run away? It seems pretty obvious to me that you don’t act in this way with someone you are looking for something serious.

It was meant to be casual but we kept speaking afterwards and he said he enjoyed my company as I did his as well. I came back to visit friends and he wanted to hang out while I was here. He was coming back from a trip Saturday night and I said if he were up for it I’d be down to see him then. He got home late and said he was tired and I said I understand! And now I’m leaving tomorrow and he never reached out. 

I just feel so stupid, it’s just been going on of things not working out with guys since my long term relationship breakup over two years ago I can’t seem to win? I’ve been working on myself and idk it doesn’t make the flakiness and rejection any easier. It doesn’t make sense and I’m not sure why I believe what guys say to me. Should I ask him what’s up or just leave it? I’m leaving to move across the country by myself to live with family Sunday, but I really was into this guy so it’s just a bummer. He’s also a professional athlete and just got out of a relationship a few months ago but I enjoyed his company and would’ve enjoyed a friendship. 

Maybe I got ahead of myself thinking there was something there. This stuff triggers me into thinking something is wrong with me just cause how much I’ve dealt with dating.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153626,public,self,Why would a guy reach out saying he wants to hang out before I leave the state but then doesn’t reach out to make the plans?

Am I overreacting to the fact that he did not erase the videos on his channel? Should he have not erased it as soon as we started dating? (We dated for almost 2 months )

He's also asking me to be on his channel. Right now I told him I cannot be on any of his social media when he cannot erase past tinder dates posts and leave them on for me to see.
