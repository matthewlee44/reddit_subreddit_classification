I’m in my early 40’s, look younger than my age, aware that I’m attractive, an open book, adventurous, charismatic, social, ambitious, and speak multiple languages. But unfortunately I am emphatic and give people the benefit of the doubt so its burnt me in dating &amp; relationships.

I decided to end my failed 9yr marriage in the summer of 2018. Took some time to myself and last year the yearning for a true connection and chemistry with one man began to brew in me. I jumped into dating sites. I was hesitant but open to try. Times have changed and COVID made it impossible to meet new people in person. I decided to try CMB, then Hinge, Match and so on... The League, MM, JDate, JSwipe, Chispa, Eharmony, Bumble, DateMyAge, and Elite. Till I finally gave up last week. I never had more than 2 apps at a time but I kept thinking that I should try a different one with no success.

I always got hundreds or more of potential matches. I matched back with a fair amount but though their profiles claimed they were looking for love or a connection. They quickly wanted to take the chat out of the apps and meet up. Very little to no effort in chatting or talking before a meet up. Immediately rude once I declined after 2-3 messages. With the same “hru, wyd, hot, send pics, come over” messages. It’s like they are just into hookups or wanted nudes. I’m not one of those so no one got any. But it turned me off. I still tried to come back with some humor, a question to start a convo. Just wasted my time. 

I’m very clear that I’m not looking for hookups. There was a handful that communicated so I went out on dates but were insistent that I go to their place afterwards. Nope. Pass. Some had real outdated pics. Another let down. But I was still polite and stayed for the date.

Physical attraction is equally important to me as mental attraction with an empathetic, understanding, adventurous, ambitious, and youthful spirit. I know it’s not to much to ask for. Their definitely are single individuals out here in Los Angeles that are like this. Funny, accomplished, or working on becoming accomplished. But where?

How much more clear do I have to be that I’m not online for hookups but rather seeking a connection with tons of chemistry?? Or is online just not the way?

There I was, sitting and hanging with a group of couples while I, the runt of the litter at this point, was just kind of hanging there.  I became super depressed the next day at how alone and out of place I felt.  I don't even want to hang out with my closest friends now because it just triggers this feeling of sadness and lonliness I have.  Now whenever I'm hanging with a buddy of mine, they usually have to spend some time talking to their gal or have to cut things short to go hang with them.  

So I did what any sad and lonely buffoon would do and loaded up the dating apps again.  Paid for a 3 month subscription to okcupid like an idiot, although for guys this is literally the only chance you have at matching with anyone, and started ""playing the numbers game"" as so many of my friends put it when giving me advice.  Now it's just sunk me into a deeper hole than ever before.  I'm checking the app CONSTANTLY to see if I match with anyone or if anyone messages me back and even when I acknowledge what I'm doing, I'm still just quickly checking it when I have some downtime.

At this point, I really don't know what to do.  I've asked my friends and their gfs before if they know anyone and they always just tell me, ""sorry but everyone I know is taken.""  It's so hard to go out and find people these days and even if I was just allowed to walk into a bar and chat a girl up, my social anxiety makes the action of doing that so difficult.  Everyone at my job is either married or too old for me and hitting up people at the workplace isn't really kosher anyways.  I've tried the whole, go and participate in something you enjoy to meet somebody, but that's never worked for me too.  Dating apps are toxic as fuck and barely work but I don't know what else to do at this point to find someone.  I've been told time and time again that I'm a very attractive person with a very kind and welcoming personality.  I've recently lost a TON of weight just so I could look more attractive and feel more confident, but this dating thing is really taking a toll on my well being.  I've taken breaks from it, I've spent time to focus on myself and what I want in life, and yet I still have this dreadful feeling of loneliness that I can't do anything about.  Worst of all is that it feels impossible to talk about this with anyone in my friend group because all they do is tell me that I have to ""keep at it"" or ""take a break"" which is real bullshit advice that's easy to give when you're in a happy relationship.

So I don't know, is there any other way to meet someone or put myself out there outside of these manipulative dating services?  Being this lonely is really taking a toll on my mental health and if I stop to take a break, I just feel like I'm letting more time slip away from me...

In 2018, I met a girl and I just find her really attractive. To the point I'd have dreams of us dating and spending time together...

At the end of the semester, I said that I could go for a drink, and she said that she doesn’t drink. I then said that I could use some coffee around the finals . She smiled. I said that we should grab some coffee after her finals. She just smiled and entered a building . I don't think she agreed, but how do I get over her?

She was friendly to me in person and smiles at me.

I tried to ask out other girls but they rejected me. 

I also didn’t find her on social media until today and say on her timeline that she started a relationship in May 2016. However, I didn’t see any likes on her photos (which she just uploaded on Saturday), and when I clicked on her “about”, it didn’t say anything about a relationship with ANYONE. One of her photos is a group gathering at Disneyland at night but I can’t see her or any possible boyfriend or friends or family members in it. Does her relationship status really mean she’s taken or no? She probably would’ve scrubbed it when uploading photos on Saturday but I didn’t see any relationship status in her “about” in her profile. 

How can I learn to forget about her completely from my life (especially since I graduated) and learn to move forward, since I don’t have any opportunities to meet and date new women now due to pandemic?

No one like to live with regrets or wonder what the future may hold when you can get the answer's now!!! Cheating shows a lack of morality, it is a mindset that is created and shaped from early childhood. It shows opportunistic traits. It demonstrates a lack of intrinsic moral fibre. It shows that the person thought so little about their partner that they then made a calculated decision to have sex with someone else. So the reason it is once a cheater always a cheater is because you cant change the nature of a snake.
To be honest cheating starts with a message. It's why i recommend that people seek the truth before it gets too late.

C claimed that a future together was possible, however six months have passed and K has only seen him once.

It’s been months and he hasn’t contacted her since.

Here’s the dilemma: I know my friend K really wants to get married and have kids in the near future. This week, K consulted a psychic about her relationship with C. According to the psychic, C will come back around and K has taken this as fact. I (23F) validated her feelings but I’m not nearly as optimistic, so I encouraged K to keep her options open. Around the same time as K, I went through a really rough break up and empathize with how she is feeling: undervalued, insignificant, kept at arms length, unloveable, etc. Since we’re both single, we made profiles on hinge together. The difference is, I’ve made an effort to actually move on and understand why my relationships all had similar outcomes. In an effort to help, I sent K a million and two resources and attempted to lead by example. I’ve been avoiding red flags that I previously overlooked and even review profiles with her! 

Being discerning is one thing, but being ridiculously picky is another. She refuses to expand her horizons, then throws in the towel and starts panicking about her future.

It used to be that it was catching my girlfriends off guard. I would brace them before-hand ""just so you know, my cousin and I are a lot closer than normal cousins. Like we're more touchy, and it can sometimes look like flirting, but it's not, it's just the way we grew up."" They seem cool with that at first, thank me for telling them.

Like one of my ex's left to go to bed, and my cousin and I cuddled on the couch while watching a movie. My ex walked out of her room and saw me rubbing my cousin's leg, and my hand resting on her stomach underneath her shirt, and she flipped the fuck out! Broke up with me as soon as we got home!

Another time I brought another girl up my cousin's cottage, and this girl left to go on a fourwheeler ride with some other guy there, so it was just my cousin and I. She was complaining about her body being sore all over, so I offered to give her a massage (I'm excellent at massages). So she stripped down and laid face down on her bed while I massages her. Eventually the two returned and the girl I brought walked into the room. I guess she didn't like that I was massaging my cousin's ass at the time (and I also had my shirt off because it was summer), because she started crying.

I met a girl who lives in my building for the past few months, she’s 21 and will be here until August (she’s from Europe and is doing a lab placement). 

In general, we have a good relationship, though sometimes she can be too honest (I take a lot of pride in the artwork I make in my free time, and she called one of my favorite sketches “nothing that impressive”). I spoil her a lot, and she doesn’t reciprocate as much. Also, there is a crazy guy in his mid 30s who definitely has a drinking problem that slid creepy flirtatious notes under her door with his cell phone number on it. I texted the guy twice to leave her alone, and he threatened to kill me and tried to square up with me a couple weeks ago. I had to call the police on him, and he’s been quiet since being scolded by two officers. 

My girlfriend’s parents got mad at me for texting the guy, even though I was just trying to protect her (I’m glad I found out this guy is nuts because I’d much rather have him upset with me than her). However, I am scared of living in my building. I can barely leave my room and use the common area. When I’m in the hall, and I hear someone coming up the stairs, I dart to my room and lock the door. I even have to carry around pepper spray with me when I go to the shared bathrooms. Though my girlfriend did take my side when her parents told her to dump me...they’re fine with me now. 

This past week, I’ve been trying to hang out with my girlfriend, but she says she’s been too busy/too tired. Also, school has been rough this past week (middle of the quarter is usually the drudge). I seriously bust my butt to finish my work on time so I can destress and also make time for her, but she keeps blowing me off.

After she blew me off last night, I just got really stressed and now am even feeling physically ill/trying not to break down crying. I also am on edge because of this knucklehead on my floor (he left a racist message directed at another resident last week in the bathroom). School sucks too, just had a rough day in lab — we’re given half the time because of covid restrictions. 


I seriously don’t like how my life is right now. I’m looking to move, but it’s super expensive. My girlfriend and I seem to be on the same page about our relationship expiring in August, and we want to make the most of the time we have together. She has been acting somewhat jealous recently as she saw me messaging some of my female friends/classmates. She even wanted me to prank some of them and send them something flirtatious because I have to “replace” her, in her words.

I am beginning to feel like I'll never meet a person that actually understands and wants to be with me for who I am. I am a 31 M, living in Brooklyn. I've never necessarily felt like I cannot attract attention or that I'm undesirable but I always seem to attract people that are ultimately very unhealthy for me emotionally or judge me and my lifestyle in a way that feels unfair.

I live very simply and I guess I am very passionate about what I do. I was formally a Chef for 10 years and have been a working artist for just about as long, I am a musician/writer/filmmaker amongst other things. Since Covid started I've hunkered down with my art and it's gone much better then I expected. I'm getting a lot of work writing music for friends projects and I am also working a potential television project as a band leader and producer. I'm also beginning my own business with a friend and it is also going better then I could hope for. I tend to spend most of my time working on music, practicing or studying.

I also like to take care of myself. I go to the gym almost every day. I like to make nice meals for myself. I drink a lot of water. I don't really drink very much alcohol and don't smoke cigarettes. A lot of this is recent as well, for the longest time I didn't take care of myself properly and would abuse my body. I am an enthusiastic weed smoker and occasionally I'll do hallucinogenics, hehe.

So this brings me to my larger point I suppose. For the first time in my life I am deeply happy, excited and content with myself and how I'm living after years and years of self loathing and mistreating myself. That being said, it feels like every woman I meet either is overwhelmed, confused or feels the right to judge me super harshly for having made it out of a difficult upbringing without being a shitty dude. I grew up very poor in New York and Latin America, never had the chance to go to college and have never really had a safety net of any kind at all. I am a total autodidact. Everything I've ever been able to do or anyway I've been able to live has been out of a lot of struggle. I always find myself having to playdown my happiness or apologizing for being optimistic about my future. I also find a lot of time when I try to graze over myself and focus more on their story I find that people become disinterested. It always seems like at first people are excited by the novelty of the idea of who I am but when they poke and prod and I'm honest about who I am and my past and how I live now, it always seems like the date can't end fast enough. I usually just feel like a giant freak after dates.

There's also a part of me that thinks a lot of it is also because of how I look but I don't want to believe that. I believe I am handsome and have a nice body (I'm not overweight and am lo key muscular, lol). A part of me feels like it's because I'm short (5'6) and not white (I'm Colombian). I really don't want to believe that but it feels that way... it's probably just the depression talking.

I don't know. I'm at my wits end and just feel super discouraged and just sad. I'm not sure what to expect out of this but I just really wanted to get this off of my chest. I feel like I've just been suffering in silence not really knowing what to do with myself. I have a fear of just giving up and becoming a hermit that just works on music all day and never socializes outside of playing shows. I just want to feel accepted and cared about...

If you read this, I really appreciate that you spent the time to sit through my inconsequential problems and complexes. Hope you have a great day!

Now, for some reason, she doesn't want to text me until friday where I'm suppozed to give her an answer about if I want something casual or long term.

The thing is, I don't like hookups, I know I don't want casual sex. But I don't want her to get more invested and to think we're going to be in a serious relationship (which could very well happen) when I haven't even met her.

She doesn't seem to believe we won't have sex when we meet and it's not the first time a girl expects to make me lose control and gets frustrated. I don't think she'd get mad but I'm afraid she will be disappointed.

Been single for 2 1/2 years but have gone on almost 40 dates between 3 people and during that time all of them told me something along the lines of “you don’t have time for a relationship” and “you are only worried about yourself.” Which made me realize as a college student working 3rd shift all the while improving my life has left me with little time. 
I haven’t tried hooking up with anyone since high school and my 6 year relationship changed me into a more deeply emotional person and lost that part of myself being out of that “game” for so long.

How can being deceitful from the start of the relationship work in your favor at all? It makes absolutely no sense to me. This may sound harsh but work on your mental health. How is this behavior normalized or tolerated? This isn't some online game avatar you're creating, it's supposed to be you.

I hate how social media has normalized this and even encouraged it. It's annoying from a dating point of view sure but the repercussions this must have on the younger generations mental health... it's just sad to think about.

That night we  both said we loved each other. Pls note we didnt actually have sex. just slept in the same bed and made out etc..

Then he never talked to me again. It really went south after he cut me off. I started going out drinking every weekend and calling him. He blocked my number. I was severely depressed..

Now I  discovered the guy ive been talking to on tinder is actually his brother and they live together (from looking at his ig profile) . I actually really like  this guy and dont want to blow it if its not already messed up as it is.

I thought he might have known about me and we were both talking together knowing about my history with his brother. I thought that maybe his bro would have told him? But now im not sure if he has any clue...

Should I tell him and see what he says before I meet him? (If he doesnt block me)

We walked around a park and got dinner at a restaurant that he chose. The date went well and ended with a kiss. 

Last weekend, I had a second “date” with him and we got dinner (he chose the restaurant again). After dinner, he asked if I wanted to go his place to “hangout” and I said yes. At first, we were just watching a movie and cuddling, which led to us making out on the couch. At one point, he asked if I wanted to move to the bedroom and I said “I think we’re fine here” because I wasn’t ready to have sex with him yet. He didn’t seem annoyed at all and I stayed for another hour before I left to go home. Literally as I was walking out the door, he pulled me towards him and we had a quick make out session before finally left.

Since then, he hadn’t reached out until I texted him today asking how he was. He responded, which I guess is a good sign. However, I asked him if wants to get drinks this weekend and haven’t heard back.

He’s kind of confusing me because there was definitely a connection between us, at least physical for sure. But he’s being spotty with texting, which isn’t normal based on our previous convos.

This girl walks up to my car and says ""Hey, you're cute"" I tell her she's cute too and she wanted to smoke weed with me at her place, I really would've but I was getting tired and one of my homies was passed out, so we exchanged info, and her friend did the same. We all exchanged info, my friend and I with these two girls.

She'll snapchat me and all that, text me as well. And I guess my friend and her went out once, and he told me it didn't work out. He found himself not really into her. 

She reaches out to me and she acknowledged and told me that she hoped it didn't weird me out that they went out. I didn't carry we just met and it was one date.

So she asked me out a few days ago and we go out and have an absolute blast. We danced and made out. We went out for food afterwards. She said she wanted me to go back to her place but since it was our first date she didn't wanna mess things up. She kept calling me cute and told me how she felt like she picked the right friend to go out with. She called me cute more times than I could count. Kept smiling and kissing me while doing so.

That same night she was the one to ask me out on a second date. The very next day.

But then yeah all of sudden the next day comes, we text and talk some and she just kinda went cold. Today she told me she was feeling like we should just friends. And yeah I told her I appreciate her honesty, but I also told.her I don't think we could be friends, she said she understands. And yeah that's the end of that I guess. She was just so cool though, fun, plays video games, full of energy and really pretty.

And it sucks because I think she might like my friend more, but then why tell me all that other stuff. Not to mention my homie has got some issues with his ex, he's got a lot going on with her, and I'd never trash talk him or anything, but yeah she's about to out herself in the middle of that.

For the last few weeks and up until the end of our date, she's been trying to get my friend and I to come to her birthday party at her place in Friday. 

He already said he can't go and yeah if she asks again, I'm not gonna be her second choice.

I guess at this point I'm just venting. It sucked being the last choice. It sucked that we had a great night, she called me cute and kept coming over to kiss me every five minutes, only to still be second yo my friend, who apparently doesn't even wanna go out with her.

Since covid happened, I've only been talking to a small handfull of people. He was one of them. We started talking through discord and we eventually got along pretty well. We would talk a lot and spend time playing games together. This happened for quite a while and we started to meet each other person. For me, I'm a very shy and awkward person when it comes to meeting people in person, even if I've talked to them online for a while. But when I met him, that didnt happened. We hit it off really well just meeting in person and he easily broke me out of my shell. Ever since then, we've hung out quite a while and would do activities together.

This was all going well until one day, we had an emotional talk. He told me that he liked me. I told him that I felt the same way...except I feel like I wasn't ready. 

And when I mean by ""not ready"" it's because I feel like I'm not mature enough to date. I feel like I'm still too naive and immature to understand what dating is like and to handle such a commitment. Not just that, i have a huge fear of a breakup. This was bc I lost some really good friends during HS and it really tore me apart. So I feel like it'll happen again if I got into a relationship and broke up, except it would feel even worse. I dont really like things like physically touch, intimacy, or even kissing. As of right now, those things seem really out of my comfort zone and I'm not ready for that kind of thing nor even the idea of it.  I never dated in my life and it's really hard for me to like someone. The first person I really liked took me 2yrs to like them and I held it in for about 5yrs. You could say I'm picky with who I like but to me, it's because I want to be safe and I have a difficult time knowing whether I like them or not. I have a hard time understanding between ""liking someone"" and ""someone who's a good friend/best friend"" because we do things that seem more than just friends.

I enjoy his company. A lot. We do a lot of things that couples would do but we're not dating. We're more like in this gray area between friends and dating. But right now, I'm struggling on what to do.

Yes, we have communicated and talked about the dilemma with him and he understands me. He says that it's okay for me to not know what I want right now and that it's not my fault for feeling unsure. He even said that he has very strong feelings for me and is willing to wait if he has to. Even if it means finding out that I might not like him or it might take too long, he choose to stick around.

I'm happy that he respects me and my insecurities when it comes to relationships but I feel guilty. There has been two occasions I talked about our situation to my friends and they say I'm just holding him hostage. But when I talk to him about it, he tells me that I'm not at fault and that even if that's true, he's holding himself hostage for sticking around. He even acknowledges the fact that nothing is granted in the future cause I didnt promise him a relationship or anything. But despite all that, he decides to keep these feelings for me. 

No matter how many times he tries to assure me, I always feel guilty. I feel like I'm the one holding him hostage. I even sometimes tell him that he could always find someone else bc I feel really bad that I could be possibly holding him down. He knows everything about my situation and how I feel and he decides to stay. I need help please. Is he right that it should be his fault for staying and I shouldn't feel guilty about it? Or am I really holding him hostage?

At the end of August she flew back to her home country; I was supposed to follow a month later. Visa complications meant I didn’t get there until early November instead of late September. She had been acting really cold and distant the last few weeks before I flew out to see her. When I arrived she hit me with the “ things feel weird between us and I don’t want to have sex just yet” This was a red flag/ Huge bummer for me since wed basically talked every day about how much we missed/wanted one another. I knew I wasn’t entitled to sex and that she was going through a rough time so I simply told her that was fine with me and I wanted her to feel comfortable. Whenever she was ready was okay with me. Well we basically spent a total of maybe 20 hours together over the next two weeks before she dumped me. Her exact words were “you’re not career focused enough for me”. All my close female friends told me that was just a line though. It infuriated me that I had spent all this time,money and energy to go see her and she treated me like a stranger and then dumped me. It broke my heart . I won’t lie, the first few weeks were rough but I got through it and started to move on with my life. I deleted all the pictures, unfollowed her on social media and started going on dates with girls who were more than happy to find out I was single again. Fast forward to yesterday: I get a text from my sister saying “you have to see this” and a link to a tiktok video (don’t crucify me). I click on it and it’s my ex’s account (apparently my ex had requested to follow my sister) and there’s a video of her painting what I believe to be us. There are a bunch of videos with different paintings that are eerily similar to me. The captions are all about love and “realizing you have a connection”.

After our first date, I wasn’t sure I wanted to see him again. He is a very rich and successful business man, but was pretty arrogant the very first time I saw him, being a bit rude to the waiter and spending extravagant amounts of money which turned me off at first. But after that date, he continued to ask me out until I finally said yes. 

Once I got to know him better, I saw the person he is underneath the front he puts up to everybody else. He is sensitive and emotional, he even cried in front of me one night revealing a lot about his past and losses he has been through he tells no one about. He revealed that his past trauma has led to his struggles with alcohol, cocaine use, and smoking cigarettes. While at first something like this would have pushed me away, I wanted to continue to support him and be there for him and pursue a relationship because I like the person he was inside. 

He can be quite rude and arrogant sometimes, expecting money to fix the smallest inconveniences. While it irritated me, I also was jealous he had such power and control over every aspect of his life. I feel as if he did have a bit of a power complex, not feeling like he should be expected to do things that other guys would do in a relationship, like pick a woman up for a date or walk her to her car at the end of the night. Whenever I asked him to do something like this, he would laugh or complain. But I was still drawn to him. 

I liked our deep conversations and that he revealed a side of himself to me that I don’t think anybody else typically sees. He is surrounded by people just like himself most of the time (rich and successful partiers). We continued to go on dates for the next two months after that but just this past week he ghosted me out of nowhere. I had spent the night at his house and left the next morning and he kissed me goodbye and said he would see me soon. I texted him once I got home and he replied, but then once I replied to him he never responded again. 

Then, he was on social media posting pictures all weekend on a boat with tons of girls and friends binging on alcohol. He even added me to his close friends list so I could be sure to see it... 

Five days later I still had heard nothing. I was confused and hurt. I saw a future with him and it was very nice to be with somebody who had such an exciting life involving fun events and activities and took me out to these amazing places that I would’ve never dreamed of going before. 

To my surprise he ended up responding yesterday after I sent one last text just letting him know what he was doing was hurtful... He said that we can continue seeing each other and talking, but that he’s very busy with everything going on in his life and didn’t think that he could give me the attention I seem to require... He also said he felt like I may have been trying to “change him” and that’s why he backed off. I acknowledged his response and thanked him but I don’t know if I should re-open this door. And I’m just confused because now I’m questioning everything I said and did even more. 

I don’t know if I should try to hang out with him this weekend and rekindle things, or if I should just leave it and cut my losses.
