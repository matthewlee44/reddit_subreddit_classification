0,r4k4vg,1638149982,Question about asking people out from social activities,"I've been trying to figure out a good way to meet women to date and wanted to get input on something that's been on my mind for a while. What are people's thoughts on asking someone out that you meet at like a dance class/social or martial arts class? It seems there are two camps on this topic: obviously, social activities seem to be a logical place to meet potential dates, especially outside of college years or the bar scene. 

But there's definitely an unspoken ""don't shit where you eat"" attitude some people carry about this type of thing. Like, ""wow i can't believe you were hitting on that girl, don't you know people come here to just dance platonically!"" Or ""don't date a martial arts training partner, it'll make the gym atmosphere uncomfortable if you break up."" I guess this is especially nerve-wracking since often you'll shoot your shot and get turned down or find out a girl has a partner already, so it's not like a bar where you just move on to the next one. I don't want a reputation as someone who uses hobbies just to meet women, but I also don't know what else to do because I have terrible luck with dating apps and women in my area tend to be less approachable at bars compared to when I go out of town (just a more uptight culture or maybe my demographic is less appealing here lol).

Any input is welcome but hopefully I'll hear back from both men and women!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4k4vg/question_about_asking_people_out_from_social/
1,r4k8bu,1638150275,Idiot can use some new insights,"We met online a while ago, against all odds, and immediately had the most amazing chemistry. Even IRL I don’t easily miss people, but from the moment I met her I missed her every time she wasn’t there. The feeling was mutual. I still don’t really know how this happened. It’s like we already knew each other. I never understood how people could fall in love online. Guess I need to change my opinion on that…

Anyway, I made some mistakes which made things difficult. We’ve been back and forth a few times about keeping in touch. At one point she told me to to fuck off and to never contact her ever again… When she came to understand that I was gonna stop pursuing her, she told me she was glad, but that I gave up quickly regarding how I supposedly felt about her. When we talked about it, I couldn’t really tell if she was in fact relieved or sad.

I think we both acted like we were cool. But the truth is, I’m not. She’s still that one person on my mind. I just didn’t want to put her in a situation she doesn’t want to be in. I didn’t want to put her on that emotional rollercoaster again. I did that before and that wasn’t fair to her. But my feelings for her haven’t changed, and the more I think about it, the more i know they’re  not going to either. So, while she thought I was giving up on her, she couldn’t be more wrong, but I couldn’t tell her. She wasn’t gonna believe me anyway… I thought it was best if we both had some time to think.

But seriously, how can I forget about her…

I wake up and go to sleep thinking about her. 
Everything reminds me of her. From the cheese section at the supermarket to someone randomly mentioning “Hay”. 
For some reason I keep seeing John Hamm, ever since we talked about him. 
Everyone around me drinks tea all of a sudden. 
I miss our conversations. I miss how easy they were.
I miss her rants.
I miss how passionate she talks about the stuff she cares about.
I can’t stop listening to her music.
I miss how she’s always right (even when she isn’t).
I miss how brutal she can be.
I miss how she gives me goosebumps playing the piano.
I miss her facial expressions when she’s focussed.
I miss how she challenges me.
I miss all the fun we had together.
For some reason I happen to watch the clock everyday when it displays her birthday (what’s that about…).
I miss how elegant she is.
I miss staying up till 4am for her.
I miss her hands.
I keep watching her favourite show.
I miss how I could tell her things I can’t tell anyone else.
I miss her soft spot for animals.
I miss seeing her, hearing her voice.
I miss making her laugh.
I miss her fringe.
I miss how she’s the only person who can make me mad.
I miss her love for raccoons.
I miss how she pronounces “croissant”.
I miss how she used to look at me, how we looked at each other. 
I miss how she put her tongue on her lip when she smiled.
I hate how we never had that long passionate kiss, or even a hug.
I hate how I never got to hold her hand, or keep her warm when she’s freezing at 18°C.
I hate how I don’t know how she really feels about me.

I miss everything about her.
I miss her.
I miss you.

The more I think about it, the more I know I simply don’t want to forget about her. I feel like not meeting up with her is something I’ll regret for the rest of my life. We hit some speed bumps and there are still some to overcome, but even though they seem scary, it’s becoming clearer and clearer that I have to do this, that I want to do this. I keep overthinking the if’s, the when’s, the how’s, when only the “who” matters. I just hope I’ll get my timing right…

Since I feel like I have been a complete idiot throughout this whole journey, I welcome any advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4k8bu/idiot_can_use_some_new_insights/

4,r4kd7b,1638150694,Is this a place to talk about dates? (Female only),"So I met this Indian girl on hinge (which I never dated before), but she looks a lot older and bigger in person, which is fine because of my previous dating experience, it is kinda expected especially with the pandemic.

The girl was cool for the first 45 mins but after one drink she wanted to go. I may have said something she doesn't like in terms of my interest (she asked am I a dog person and I said no) but she was still friendly. I think that was the question and turned her off or maybe I just don't look as sexy in person but we still chatted for more than half an hour until that question came up randomly from her. 

So I walked her to her car because it's ghetto in that area, and she gave me a hard hug but she deleted me right away when I got home. What's the point of hugging me soo hard when you are going to delete me?

I don't think she's my cup of tea anyway but it kinda affected my confidence. Since pandemic, I rarely went to date due to fear of covid. Before covid, I was getting dates every week and now I barely go on dates because I am being more selective with the fear of covid.

Do all girls really do that? I never really had girls that would delete me immediately. They typically would still be interested and chat with you and eventually just dies down with limited texting. 

Anyway, if there are any girls in the bay area down to date, let me know. Just so yall know, I am not really a dog person since I got chased by dogs since I am an avid jogger.

6,r4kem2,1638150815,Where did this stereotype come from?,"I’m a 19[M] and I live in a part of Canada that has long ass winters. And yes Canada always has long ass winters for the record! Anyways, during the summer time I always like to golf with my dad and friends and it’s a very enjoyable hobby for me. My grandfather taught me golf before he passed away- I was only little at the time. I like to showcase my hobbies on dating profiles and I notice a high influx of women in my geographical region of Alberta, and most of the women say they hate straight white men who golf. 

I’m not taking it too personally, but it really warps my mind on how this stereotype even happened. Did women hear somewhere that golfers are terrible people? It’s just a hobby that I play for fun, but I honestly think it’s limiting my match potential just because of a simple sport and hobby. 


TLDR: I’m a young male who likes to golf during the summer and I feel that showcasing this hobby on my dating profile limits my matches.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4kem2/where_did_this_stereotype_come_from/

I say something and then she say’s something. She actually put in some effort with it. Every time we talk, we have fun. I’ve asked if she wants to hang out twice and she said that she was down. It’s just that we’ve both been really busy. Three days ago, I asked for her number because I just recently got a new phone. I sent her a text that said “See? That wasn’t so hard, was it?” (I did some light teasing before she gave it to me.) She hasn’t even read it, it’s been like three days. When I opened her IG message I kinda left her on read. 

So I saw that she was active on Instagram, so she’s on her phone. I text her with her number, to ask what she’s up too… and she left me on read. That’s all this man needed to see lol. Winter break is coming up and I was thinking to get a date in before then, but I guess not. I wonder what happened, we talked for a month and we knew each other’s situations. Maybe she just got bored or lost faith in us? What’s even crazy was that she checked all of the boxes. Pretty, funny, ambitious, intelligent and nomadic lol. It’s all good though. I’ll just take it right here on the chin. Maybe this was a blessing in disguise. I have a lot of shit going on and I’m digging myself out of a dark hole rn.

I (f,24) met a guy(m,35) on bumble. We live in different cities (like 3h away). We haven’t spoken much but we liked each other and kept in touch for about a month and he said he’d come to meet me. By keeping in touch I mean maybe talking once a week. 

Recently he hit me up and said he’d come over a weekend. He booked a restaurant in a very nice fancy place and we went for dinner. I’d say conversation was going pretty nice and we had a lot in common. There was no sexual context or things like that, but I feel like there was chemistry. Then we had a walk and in the end he requested me a taxi to get home. After I got home, we texted each other via messenger  and both thanked each other for a great evening. That’s it, he didn’t message me after it. 

To me, I’d like to communicate more with him and I would even not mind going and visiting him in his city but I haven’t heard from him for a day.

As long as you don't go out of your way to call me a useless loser or something please feel free to be honest. So basically I've been living in Asia which is not the paradise man claim at least not for me but I can get a girlfriend here given time. However I'm shortly returning to the US I'm only five foot seven 120 lb not so much anorexic looking as that sounds but small framed looking it's probably worse anyway. I'm 41 years old divorced from from an Asian woman just to clear that up no kids no child support. I'll be making $15 an hour although this is in the heartland but still not great money. Personally I'm feeling very depressed as I just don't see any prospects of anybody reasonable being interested. And what makes it worse is I'm only attracted to thick or BBW women. And when I say BBW I mean at least slightly curvy a belly is fine but not a diet of Diet Coke at McDonald's and riding a Walmart Scooter if you get what I mean. 
And I'd rather not be a stepdad since I'm not bringing any in. Possibly if they have one nice kid but definitely no more. I'm thinking with my physical appearance and other attributes that I mentioned I should just enter the priesthood or something but I don't have a calling for that. Just looking to hear how bad it's going to be most likely out in flyover country. I don't see that I can stay here the lockdowns been gone forever and the money is just about out plus I got a job offer in the US obviously not the best but better than starving. I don't see myself returning back here so just wondering what you think my prospects are.

I had a few dates and one night stands in my late teens but haven't had any luck at all since I was 20 in even getting a date. I've tried online with sites like Tinder and POF and have liked probably ten thousand accounts and have basically had no matches. I work in a large place with lots of women but literally every women I had my eye on there ( probably 30) have either been taken, gay, left the job before I got a chance. Only one girl was single and straight that I got a chance to ask out , of course she turned me down.  I know going out more would help but I have social anxiety disorder and hate going to social events, especially alone. The years gone by has just made that worse. I went to a few clubs when I was younger(with friends) and it was literally three guys for every girl there. With those odds I'm already at a disadvantage and with the loud music, how can you even talk to a girl? At my age I think I'm too old for clubs now anyways so you can throw that route out the door anyway. I don't know what to do. My family either doesn't care or are too worried about themselves to do anything to help. You'd think a 35 year old man that basically has never had a girlfriend would be a red flag to them to ask why?  It's all made me very depressed and suicidal. I've been in a mental hospital before and their only advice was to try online dating so ya, alot of help that was.

however with all that said, i realize that approach hasn’t really worked for me, as i am still depressingly single. so going to try out this new method even tho i am slightly scared they will run once they get to know all my baggage. 

how long do you wait before getting into deep stuff with new people you are dating? i  have mental health issues (bipolar, so it’s not a “fix myself and come back when i’m better” situation) that would most definitely need to be discussed before entering a relationship with someone.

2. Idc about virginity. I don’t consider the whole virginity thing sacred, just bs to put woman down.

3. If I really like the guy, I want us to move in together (b4 marriage) to se how things go.

4. I want a serious relationship. If we date, it’s for real. No playing the field, no open relationship, nothing. Long term or nothing.

Not sure what flair to use for this one because it’s a toss up between venting and seeking advice.
So basically this has happened multiple times in my dating life over the years and just so happened recently as well. Let me set up the scene:
You meet someone, you have an instant connection/chemistry and know this will be something special if everything aligns up. The dates are fantastic, the texting and communication is perfect, the humor is never out of both your wheelhouse, you agree on most basic compatibility points. I mean everything is great until you get to the physical intimacy part and then even though you can tell there is great sexual chemistry, I’ve always found myself to be more nervous around a woman like that and tend to underperform and/or tend to be more intimate in my ways (which is nothing wrong but I’m usually on the dominant side and turning into this persona feels very alien, which in turn feeds into my psyche that something is wrong in the relationship itself, which in turn makes me question the whole thing.

On the other hand, if I meet someone and I know this is going to be a short fling because of some incompatibility, the sex just happens to be mind fucking blowing on both sides. I’m performing at my peak which in turn also leads to the woman enjoying the hell out of it. Has this happened to anyone else? What’s the logic here? What am I missing and how can I fix this?

I met a girl online and we really hit it off. Similar interests and other interests we shared with each other that we were both intrigued by. I really started to fall for this girl and we were really endearing to each other (calling each other affectionate names and pet names) then one day her replies become much more spaced out. 

I didn't think much on it but eventually we planned to call each other which she seemed excited by. All of a sudden when the time comes she seemingly is inactive and she messages me a few hours later, seeming like she forgot.

Now the conversation has ended with her leaving me on read. I don't want to count this as ghosting yet but out of curiosity, if this girl never ends up talking to me again.

39,r4mnmi,1638157717,"There's someone who I've taken an interest in, but I don't even know where to start...","Backstory: I \[M20\] met another student \[F23\] in a college class of mine, and I would really like to get to know her more, and possibly even start a relationship eventually if we have good chemistry. However, I am too afraid to ask her out, since I have never asked out a woman in my life, and I don't know if she has a current boyfriend.

Some history: I originally got to know this person more earlier in the semester, when I interviewed her for a project in another class that I have. Specifically, it was about a near-death car accident that she was in a couple years back. After learning more about what she went through and how well she recovered, I became very empathetic towards her, and I immediately saw her as a charming and resilient woman. I thought about her every day for a long time, and now I finally want to gain the courage to ask her out.

However, there are many problems at the moment. For one, I have high-functioning Autism, which makes me a very shy and awkward person. I have trouble reading how people are feeling through visual cues, so I am uncomfortable asking her in-person. Instead, I want to send an email (to an account that she gave me), which I have already done. That email was about how much empathy I had for her, and I also offered my support in case she ever needed a shoulder to lean on. I know that it is better for me to ask her out in-person, but I absolutely need to send an email asking her out because of my social awkwardness (I already have a heartfelt message drafted out).

Also, I don't know if she already has a boyfriend now, and I don't really know how to find out. I don't have anybody that I can ask to ask her for me, and I don't want to ask her directly as she will likely believe that I am desperate.

This all leads me to my final point: I have many questions regarding what I should do about this situation. If I ask her out through email, how should I go about doing it? Should I tell her all my feelings about her along with a date proposal, or should I only ask about the date without any deeper feelings? Should I explicitly ask for a date, or just a simple meetup to begin with? How can I know whether or not she has a boyfriend? Should I ask her out even though I don't know about her current relationship status? Finally, should I even ask her out at all?

Thank you all in advance. I know that this was a long read, but I've never felt this in love before, and I would really like some advice as to where to take things from here. Having a partner would really bring a lot of happiness into my life, and I am ready to give my all for her if things go well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4mnmi/theres_someone_who_ive_taken_an_interest_in_but_i/

I'm 32M, just for context.

Now that the pandemic has normalized and people are going back to their regular lives, I thought I could give OLD a new chance. **The reason I'm choosing OLD instead of any other method is because I literally have no choice.** I seldom know any people in my area, and have zero friends here. I tried getting into social activities right before the pandemic, but to no avail.

I decided to open Bumble after a time of not using it. I matched with a couple of girls in no time. One of them lives pretty close; the other one, I don't see myself going to her place soon. They're fine and all, but... **I just don't feel the spark**. I can continue the conversation, but at this point I'm doing it because I enjoy having someone to talk with. It gets pretty lonely when you don't have company outside your family and the friends you made in a different, far away city.

And here is where the more generic issue comes. For every 10 girls I get shown in Bumble, I'm lucky to swipe right on 1 of them. Same goes with Tinder and about any dating app. The rest? **I'm literally not interested on them**. I want someone to share my quirky hobbies, someone I can be, I don't know, excited to be around of. But most profiles are just girls who travel the world and like dancing and karaoke and beaches and damn, I literally have negative interest on all of those! If you're dating me don't expect me to jump into the ""let's travel everywhere"" bandwagon, and let's not get started about how much I hate beaches and dancing.

Don't get me wrong. I can hold a conversation just fine, and I suppose I can do so without becoming a creep. But most girls don't really interest me (I dgaf about how hot they look if we cannot share similar interests) and it's been a long time since I felt that spark of actually wanting and needing to be with someone. Let alone the fact I don't have a single friend here.

And do you know what sucks even more? In the past I used to be extremely excited of being with... well, anyone who showed me a little bit of love. Nowadays I'm so emotionally worn out I lost that excitement and I have a difficult time becoming vulnerable with anybody.

I say something and then she say’s something. She actually put in some effort with it. Every time we talk, we have fun. I’ve asked if she wants to hang out twice and she said that she was down. It’s just that we’ve both been really busy. Three days ago, I asked for her number because I just recently got a new phone. I sent her a text that said “See? That wasn’t so hard, was it?” (I did some light teasing before she gave it to me.) She hasn’t even read it, it’s been like three days. When I opened her IG message I kinda left her on read. 

So I saw that she was active on Instagram, so she’s on her phone. I text her with her number, to ask what she’s up too… and she left me on read. That’s all this man needed to see lol. Winter break is coming up and I was thinking to get a date in before then, but I guess not. I wonder what happened, we talked for a month and we knew each other’s situations.

Background info: 

Regular communication without leaving each other on read. Equal effort in terms of interest. We had 3 dates so far. 1st coffee, 2nd music concert, 3rd proper dinner date. Each date was spaced 1-2weeks in between due to holidays, exams, other commitments. I had a healthy childhood, healthy friendships but never got to follow through romantic relationships because my fam and I were moving a lot, and I was advised to focus on studies. So I don’t have any relationship traumas people talk about on different outlets of advice. I feel calm and secure in this stage of dating. We had our first kiss on the second date. I do not do hookups because my parents waited till marriage to have sex for just moral reasons(atheists). I have a high sex drive but I also practice delayed gratification and can probably see myself abstaining from sex till marriage for moral reasons. Plus oxytocin and dopamine rush from sex can get in the way of thinking clearly about compatibility.

We always maintained a policy that we would be honest with each other. This past week, I told him that I want to start dating other people, he didn’t seem hurt or against it. We’ve talked about us being exclusive in the past and it never worked out. 

I was supposed to meet up with him this past Friday, but the morning of our meet up he canceled and said he no longer wanted to do anything physical. I asked him why the change in his tune and he told me he thinks I can do better than him and I deserve someone who wants to commit to me. We used to get into arguments (from my side) about me not seeing him enough and he told me we should stop doing this so we stop getting into fights.. Long story short, some fighting words were thrown around and I decided to be an asshole and ask him to hook me up with his friend (something he used to get upset about when I made jokes about it…). We got into an argument and he blocked me on iMessage. 

I tried to reach out to him on other social media platforms and he just reads my messages and doesn’t reply. I’m more hurt about the loss of the friendship than anything, but I get him not wanting to do anything physical anymore. Just reading back on what I wrote, I know I messed up and I know I’m in the wrong about overreacting during the argument. It’s not an excuse but I was just hurt.

We've spoken on texts/calls for almost 4 months before we met as we were not in the same city then. Became quite good friends and decided to keep things casual. My only demand was to have sex exclusively. It wasn't what he wanted but agreed for me.
So i wanted to continue this fwb situation with him till atleast for a month more (i'm leaving this city for college after that) as i wanted to have fun and make the most of the time i have left here. We met on 5th Nov the first time. It's been a lot of fun with him since then, even if the sex has been mediocre i didn't mind spending time with him because we got along really well. We've met around 10-11 times in the past few days which i agree has been too often.
A few days back he tells me that he thinks we're meeting a lot and that we're going to get attatched and used to each other if we continue since we are exclusive rn so should end this sooner than i originally thought. He said he can't do the exclusive thing anymore. I got upset but i understand where he's coming from so i agree with it and he fixes a last date for us.
Cut short to yesterday, while texting he casually tells me that he's going to meet another girl after we end things. So now i understand why he wanted to end things with me sooner.

So back in September, I started seeing this guy. We were friends since 2015 and he always flirted and hinted that he wanted to be more than a friend. Cut to this sep and I gave us a chance. 

I made it pretty clear from the start that I was not at all looking for fwb, hooking up (nothing against it. But I am too insecure, emotionally vulnerable with anxious attachment style for that sort of thing). And that I was in it for the long term. He agreed. That he was looking for a committed relationship too.

Guys, I really liked this guy. I was so happy to have found someone nice after my last extremely abusive relationship. 

Then I dont know what happened, all of a sudden, he said to me that he is worried if/when we break up, I am gonna be really hurt and I shouldn't love him too deeply. What does that even mean?

He started withdrawing from me. started canceling our plans. Answering my texts after 12/18 hours, not picking up my calls, stopped calling me, whereas he'd always reply within a certain time window and called everyday.

I texted him, asked if he was no longer interested and he replied that he loved me but was a little afraid (didn't explain afraid of what nor did I ask)

I swear, my anxiety is killing me. I didn't say anything or texted anything to him after that. And I have a feeling he wont contact me either. 

This morning, after waiting for him for days I finally deleted his number and now trying with all the strength I have to not check for his messages.

But recently we started talking again and now it's evolved to what looks like a friendship, we hang out outside of work often we share secrets and have alot of deep conversations.

Now to be clear I am not interested in dating her again that relationship was toxic as hell and healing from that was long and hard but as 'friends' I'm really enjoying her company but at the same time I feel like it's weird.

Looking for some quick advice if you would reach out in this situation:

I (M) went on two dates with her (F) and really liked her. At the end of date two, we kissed when I dropped her off and I thought it was going well. The morning before date three, she sent me a long text explaining the dating process felt like a chore, she needed a break, and was deleting OLD. She also asked if we could put in a pin in things for now, or if I wanted to just end things entirely - I said we could put in a pin in things and to let me know if she wanted to talk. She then asked if we could still send each other memes (we would send each other about one a day while we were dating/talking), and I said sure. 

Honestly, her whole text seemed like a classic “it’s not you, it’s me” vibe in order to spare my feelings, when in reality she just wasn't interested. I’ve done that before too, so I know how it goes (I’m sure we all do). Anyway, she did send me something later that day (which was pretty unfunny) and I just wrote back “not bad haha”. That was three weeks ago and it was the last communication we’ve had.

I’m still a little hung up on her, and I was really hoping she’d reach out, but she hasn’t. I think that mostly confirms she’s just not interested, but on the other hand, it’s not too late to send her something funny and ask how it’s going, right? If she doesn’t respond to my text or doesn't engage, I’ll know to drop it for good at that point. 

So my question is: if I’m still interested, there’s no harm in sending a meme/text three weeks later, right? Or would you seriously advise against that for some reason? Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4r5oc/is_it_a_bad_move_for_me_m_to_reach_back_out_to_f/
94,r4r6qi,1638174107,How long does a talking stage really last and do slow relationships progress,"ok so I (19F) have been talking to a guy (22M) for about a month now and I honestly forgot how relationships or anything remotely similar to dating progress. I’ve been with one guy before but it was toxic and we never made it official because he “wasn’t ready” and I was dumb enough to stay for a year. Now, i’ve been out with this guy for three dates and I really forgot how to do it after being so traumatized by the last guy. We just now kissed after our third date after he was dropping me off and I feel good about it but how does one transition from talking to being more serious and affectionate with one another? 

Like everyday is kinda the same thing in which we text (not facetimes or phone calls) and then we hang out like once a week or every two weeks since we only have freetime on weekends. Am I overthinking this orrrrr, should I be one of those “what are we?” type of girls? because I did that and I stayed like a dummy but honestly if this guy doesn’t want a relationship I’ll probably leave but it’s not like he’s pressured me into anything so far unlike the first one

95,r4r7b0,1638174174,My (26f) boyfriend (31m) is very affectionate to me one moment and wants to break up the next,"Hello, dear people on reddit!

This is a very complex situation and I'll do my best to keep it as concise and clear as possible. I apologise in advance if I express things in a confusing way.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year, we briefly broke up in summer. He was the one who initiated the break up but he felt pretty terrible and regretted it. Overall, we were broken up for about two weeks.

Things have been rocky with us in general. The problem mainly is that my boyfriend is extremely moody. To a point where I believe he might potentially have some sort of disorder. Perhaps it would help to give you some background info...

My boyfriend works for the military and takes his job very seriously. His career is important to him, he is very driven, wants to do a good job and advance. I know it's an ego thing. In the beginning, I figured it was normal, now I'm not so sure anymore. As we continued dating, he opened up to me about his past. He was adopted when he was 7. His biological mother is a drug addict, his step father molested him as a child and also killed his half-sister, long after he had been adopted but I can imagine that it was traumatic nonetheless.

His adoptive family kept him very sheltered, didn't allow him to go out when he was in high school and  his adoptive father verbally abused him. Toxic masculinity was a big issue as well.

I have known about all this for at least half a year now - I actively decided not to break up with him and stand by his side as he tries to cope with all of it. Unfortunately, he has shown some hurtful behaviours, like texting his ex (whom he doesn't even feel attracted to), not deleting his dating apps to get compliments from women, making comments about my appearance... I know, you might think now, ""Why the hell are you still dating him?"" - I don't want to picture him as just being a bad guy. I think he has some serious issues and doesn't even want to be like this.

Sometimes, when he gets drunk, he will talk about how he's intellectually not on the same level as me and that he might bore me with not being interested in some of the things I like. Last time he was drunk, he made a comment about how one of my male friends would probably be a good guy for me, and that he sometimes lays in bed and cries. When I asked him why, he said he was just joking. 

Yesterday, he was back at the point of wanting to break up. It's so weird because he made this effort of getting me a ton of nice Christmas gifts (which he didn't have to), he's been telling me how much he is looking forward to spending the holidays with me. He danced with me in the kitchen on Thanksgiving and was so affectionate with me. A couple of weeks ago, he even invited me to fly back to his home country with him when he goes to visit his family (I couldn't afford the plane ticket, so I won't go). 

He is in therapy right now, it was my condition he started therapy in order for us to get back together. He has been in therapy for the largest part of his life, he takes antidepressants and anxiety meds. However, he doesn't really trust his therapist because he put a diagnosis (GAD) on his record without telling him about it, he saw it by coincidence. In the beginning, he told me his therapist seemed like a good guy who knew what he was doing and now he's completely demonising him - he has the tendency to do that. Think positively of one person and then suddenly change their opinion about them.

My boyfriend asked me a few weeks back if I'd be scared if he was diagnosed with a personality disorder and I replied that I wouldn't be, it would be more concerning if he had one and suffered because he didn't really know about it. Now he's paranoid about getting diagnosed with one even though he says he doesn't believe to have one. Quite frankly, I believe he thinks he might have a personality disorder but he is scared of how it will affect his job (and potentially me). 

I don't really know what to do. I don't want to break up with him or him to break up with me. I'm not perfect either, I have strong fears of abandonment and tend to get very emotional quickly. I understand that's tiring and a lot to deal with when you already have a lot on your plate. I'm just at a loss right now. One moment I'm the most fascinating person he knows, the next moment he's bored and unhappy. One moment he is very horny and loves having sex with me, the next he thinks it's repetitive and there is ""no passion"". I'm trying to be understanding of his mood swings potentially being a result of his mental health but it's also very taxing.

I feel like there is so much more that needs to be in this post but it would get way too long. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend is very hot and cold about me, sometimes super affectionate, sometimes on the verge of breaking up. He has mental health issues that might contribute to his mood swings. I try to be understanding because I love him but it's a difficult situation...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4r7b0/my_26f_boyfriend_31m_is_very_affectionate_to_me/

97,r4r7zs,1638174259,Catfish trying to steal my information,"Hey, it's my first time posting on here so let me know if this post is more suitable elsewhere.
Context: I'm a straight, 23 year old 5'4 transman who passes pretty well. I'm very transparent with this because I never want to date someone who's not ok with that or who is transphobic.
I am also from Sweden if that matters and I've been dating via Tinder and Okcupid on and off for a couple of years now and it has gone pretty well in general.

Last week I met an amazing girl on Tinder. She was funny, kind, had similar interests to me but was also independent and had her own passions in life - something I value greatly. I have met some catfishes previously but I usually think that they're off in some way and sense red flags right away. Not this time I guess. We hit it off really well and a couple of days later she gave me her phone number and said she'd message me when she could meet up.
I wanted to text some more and talk over a phone call just to make sure she was who she said she was (being harassed every now and then online makes you extra careful). And she instantly snapped at me, messaging: ""Well I guess this isn't going to work out then. Unmatched and blocked. I will only meet you when I say so"". I was kinda shocked by this and then suddenly I got notifications that someone was trying to log into my Tinder account with my phone number. Ngl I was pretty uncomfortable, and I'm still thinking about it.

Here in Sweden you can google phone numbers and get information like what adress the person with that phone lives at so now I'm a little afraid that this person (who might not even be who they said) will come after me. 
I reported her on the app and tried looking for her adress via the phone number but it came back as a private number.

Is there anything else I can do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4r7zs/catfish_trying_to_steal_my_information/
98,r4r94n,1638174394,Advice!,"TL;DR: banging my roommate and not mad about it. 

So we all come here for advice. That’s for sure. But he’s an interesting one for you: 

So for context I’ve (26F) lived with my roommate in a city that I had to move to part time for nursing school (some of my school is still remote so I can do it wherever). The other part of the time I live in a city 3.5 hour (drive) away and I’ve been living in the new city with my roommate (29M) for about 5 months and it’s just him and I + his dog, my dog, and my cat… so we don’t have any other roommates… also we were Craigslist roommates so we didn’t know each other before. 

His girlfriend and him broke up like less than a month ago and he seemed pretty messed up about it for a couple weeks and I tried to be as supportive as I could given my roommate position. And trust me, they had a dynamic of a relationship that wasn’t healthy so it was good for him, and I viewed all of that from a friend perspective (honestly 100%). We have been keeping busy doing house projects as I have been in a depression funk lately so it’s been good for me too and so this is where it gets interesting… We were drinking the day before thanksgiving and doing some house projects and then he started kissing me and so for the past 4 days or so this has kinda continued. I went over to his family’s for thanksgiving, as his aunt invited me a few weeks prior and we also got kinda turnt there and so for 2 days this was in my mind: I guess an “oh well maybe this is just going to be a drunk thing” because neither one of us addressed it the next day (so thanksgiving), but it also wasn’t awkward in the least because we are so comfortable with each other. We talked about it and banged after we got back from his family’s thanksgiving but again we were a little tipsy. So yesterday we were just hanging out watching a movie on the couch and he was sitting really close to me and I’m so fucking touch starved right now and I kept getting really turned on just by him kinda sitting close to me and touching my arm a bit and then we started making out and I was like “I want you to fuck me” and we were sober and honestly the sex was really good. A few hours later I just kinda spit it out and said, “we should probably talk about this sober,” and so we did. Basically he told me he has feelings for me and such. But I felt like I had to force this conversation out of him almost. Like the same stuff that he said drunk the couple days before… but I’m just so worried about fucking up my living  situation  and now I feel like I’ve caught feelings in a way because I love him so much as a person but our dynamic has never been like this but it’s also been really good so far but I really am not in a place to get hurt anymore by men and I’m worried I’m walking into fire with this but I just don’t know.
From an outsiders perspective I could see people shitting all over this idea. But the couple people I have told have been really supportive (mostly because they love him lol because he’s such a good guy). 
Also, when we talked (sober) the rhetoric was basically opening up the conversation about exploring something between us. I brought up what we should think about our sleeping situation and the amazing person he is basically said: I mean my bed is bigger, and I’m down if you want to sleep in it every night or just some nights. I decided to sleep in my bed tonight because in some ways I want to still feel desired like I’m not encroaching on his space I guess? This is why the roommate thing is hard. But I did sleep in his bed the last couple of nights and we were both sober, and we have had sober sex twice now so I’m just confused. 

P.S. both of us have been engaged in years prior and are both seeking therapy for our stuff individually outside of this situation 👍🏻

Anyways thank you for reading ❤️ and all the support and opinions are warranted!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4r94n/advice/
99,r4r9nj,1638174443,Did he not like our date?,"Hey. 

I (f,24) met a guy(m,35) on bumble. We live in different cities (like 3h away). We haven’t spoken much but we liked each other and kept in touch for about a month and he said he’d come to meet me. By keeping in touch I mean maybe talking once a week. 

Recently he hit me up and said he’d come over a weekend. He booked a restaurant in a very nice fancy place and we went for dinner. I’d say conversation was going pretty nice and we had a lot in common. There was no sexual context or things like that, but I feel like there was chemistry. Then we had a walk and in the end he requested me a taxi to get home. After I got home, we texted each other via messenger  and both thanked each other for a great evening. That’s it, he didn’t message me after it. 

To me, I’d like to communicate more with him and I would even not mind going and visiting him in his city but I haven’t heard from him for a day. I know it’s nothing to be afraid about yet, but what do you think is an adequate time to receive some other message from him or does it look like he doesn’t like me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4r9nj/did_he_not_like_our_date/
