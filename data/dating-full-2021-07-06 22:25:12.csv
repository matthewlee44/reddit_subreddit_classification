We both really really like eachother like we’ve never liked anyone else but she (F17) suddenly got scared that I (M18) would lose interest in her once I went to college (I’ll be very close though) and said we couldn’t date the next day. Her reasoning for why was different than me going to college but I figured that’s what it was. She said we’d talk in a week but we could only be friends. Well the next night she sends me a snap and wants to talk again, saying she needed time to think. So we started talking again but that romantic spark started to flare up once more and she brought up the college thing again, the day before she told me that we can’t even be friends anymore (once again for a totally different reason which made almost no sense). I was really hurt by this but I figured it was like last time and I’d hear from her soon. Two days later she sends a snap, we snap back and forth but then nothing until the next night where I get one snap and haven’t heard from her since, that was 8 days ago. I tried reaching out once since then but haven’t gotten anything

For some reason though she hasn’t blocked my number or snap and I can’t understand why. Like if she doesn’t wanna be friends anymore why would she keep me around there, it’s kind of messing with my head and it is completely out of character.

So I would say I’m a really private person, usually none of my friends or family know about my personal sex life or I don’t really like to mention it to them, if they ask I would just say I’m single. And I expect that for my fwb as well, I expect him not to mention me to any of his friends ( keeping it discreet) or family.

But one day I spent the night at his place for like a jacuzzi date night. His female friend FaceTimed him while I was in the room, so I kept quiet and was just removing my makeup. They were talking about hair colors to choose, she’s in Japan rn and she wanted advice on what hair colors she should choose from. And I realized as they were talking, he kept on looking up to look at me ,and he said to her “ hey so I have company over, I will talk to you tomorrow morning”. 

I didn’t think much of that, so I just went on about my night and than he got another call from his other female friend, and they were discussing his family issues and just serious stuff about legal terms etc, I was guessing that girl was his cousin or one of his family members, I’m not sure. And they just kept on talking and I didn’t say a word and just quietly put my clothes back on, it was in the morning. 

He was talking on the phone, and said to the phone “ hold on”, and turned to me and called out my name and asked if I wanted my eggs to be scrambled ( referring to the breakfast) and I was like making a hand gesture saying I’m good. And than they continued talking and than he once again look up and said “ Jenny you want dark roast or light? “ and than I looked and him and whispered dark. And also teasing me by saying “ I will beat your ass if you don’t drink all the coffee lol” “ but like don’t burn yourself though”. And kept on giggling at me. While on the phone.

About 7 months ago, I (19F) met a guy on Tinder (28M). and we decided to keep things casual (similarly to fwb's?!) but he mentioned that it can become serious. We met twice, held hands, and kissed...I told him that I won't have sex with him (due to religious reasons).

I was worried about getting COVID since he had Tinder. We had an argument about it and he deleted it. We agreed to see each other about twice a month.

However, we didn't. He said that his sister gave birth which changed his perspective on going out (due to COVID). After that, he started being distant and rarely texts me. When I asked him, he said he's busy with the baby.

During that time we had many arguments- mostly me expressing to him I don't like feeling like an object and forcing him to ""label"" us and him saying that ""if we decide to date it will be way into the future..you're too young..I don't want to take away from your life""

Anyways, one time we had a big fight that ended in him saying “We met twice. Live your life. I’m not it”

We stopped talking for a month, and he started texting again, and we decided to meet up.

The night before, he asked ""Why do you want to see me? Do you think we'll get married one day or do you just want to try out things (sexual reference). I replied with ""there's no way in hell I'm marrying anyone, especially you, just no."" (my ego was hurt from him saying ""live your life"" a few months earlier so I obviously lied.)

After that, he cancelled a few times due to being busy. We finally met about a week ago. He was different. No hand holding, we just made out and didn't even talk. Unlike the other times we met, he never asked when to see me again, we just hugged at the end.

I asked him what he expects, and he said ""I don't know, I'm not looking for hookups right now."" So I asked if he thinks we should stop seeing each other and he replied with ""No, just what then after seeing each other?."" I asked what do you think and he replied with ""nothing good"" so I replied with ""we should stop then if you don't see something good coming out of it"" and he replied with:

“I don’t know what you expect.” “I’m busy right now, not thinking about this.” ""don't be dramatic.""

A few days later,

Me: “I don’t wanna see you anymore. I know you don’t like labels, but I like knowing everything. And I know you don’t know and busy, but you can always text me when you figure it out.”

Him: “ ;( Ok, sorry”

Me: “I just think you’re at the point of actually wanting to date someone and we know it can’t be me bc of age and all of these things. So it’s ok. Take care.”

Him: *sends 2 goodnight stickers* …….

At this point I just feel guilty for no reason. I feel as if I didn't make it clear enough that I see a possible serious relationship with him. I just can't find closure and I don't know if I should text him again. Someone told me that when he said ""nothing good"" he means that it's going to get complicated and that's he's scared of asking me out.

Long-time lurker; first-time poster.

I am 38, a man, occasionally bearded. A couple of years ago, I stepped out of the dating pool and have remained on the sidelines ever since. There are, to my mind, plenty of good reasons for doing so. But I have reached a point where I am beginning to think that dating is, inevitably, going to be part of my future and, in any case, *ought* to be part of my future; it is something that I desire to do, both for myself and for the sake of the happiness of whoever it is that I wind up with. That said, it is difficult to know where to begin, for reasons that I will go into below.

I spent much of my twenties teaching English abroad in quite a few less-than-friendly locales. Along the way, I picked up a pretty gnarly anxiety disorder and -- along with it -- a tendency to self-medicate. (Such is the grisly fate of many a TEFL instructor.) For a long stretch of my thirties, this arrangement was manageable: I was, to all appearances, an alcoholic, but a highly functional one. I was friendly, hyper-social, productive, creative; given to drinking too much and talking too much while drunk, but never violent and seldom snarky or mean. But, needless to say, this arrangement didn't hold. Hangovers turned into acute withdrawal, which demanded further drinking to stave off death. This all came to a head right around the time the pandemic hit. I required medical treatment to help wean me from the alcohol and the benzodiazepines that had once shielded me from panic, but were now threatening to take my life.

I am, by now, a year and three months sober. I am fortunate in that drinking did not take a toll on my physical health; I am fortunate in that sobriety is easy for me. A kind of mental switch was flipped at my lowest point, and the old habits of a decade appeared to evaporate all of an instant. From that point forward, I put in the work. I spent two months in intensive outpatient treatment; I attend weekly meetings, meditate, exercise obsessively, read the Stoic philosophers, and do all of the things that one is supposed to do when threatened by a deadly disease. I do not struggle with cravings and have not come close to a relapse, though I well know that I must also remain mindful of the risk -- pride goeth before destruction and what have you.

I believe (as all of us do) that I have quite a lot to offer someone. I am en route to a Master's program and, provided that the United States does not disintegrate within the next few years (admittedly a bold assumption), I anticipate being quite happy and successful in life. But all that said: I still harbor too many doubts to mention. 

I do not any longer doubt my commitment to sobriety or my ability to remain sober, but I worry that my past will forever remain nipping at my heels. How to begin to explain my past to a future partner? How to provide her with the sort of assurances necessary to sustain a relationship, when addicts are *notorious* for backsliding, for falling back into destructive and antisocial patterns of behavior, for playing fast and loose with the truth? Even if I no longer fear these aspects of the booze-addled personality that I cobbled together over the years, how could I possibly demonstrate this to someone who, at first, will know me not at all?

In the past, I have been forthcoming with others about my struggles. For as appreciated as honesty is in some circles, it can also alienate people. Most of us have an addict in our lives, and it is natural to associate the addicts that we meet with the addict that we *know*. Needless to say, it is often a painful association, and not one that some people are willing to engage with. So I tread more cautiously these days; I tell those who wish to know, but refrain from bringing it up where I don't have to. Obviously, in a relationship, this is exactly the sort of stuff I would want to -- and need to -- share with someone.

But how to go about it? This certainly isn't first date fare. It might not even be second or third date material. But the past, no matter how grim and no matter how compromising, eventually must be shared with one's partner, because it is the past that makes us who we are. I feel that my past has strengthened me; without having flirted with death for so long, I might not have such a strong appreciation for life; I might not be so dedicated to the principles that make me a good person or, at any rate, that make me a much better person than I was before. So all of this must be shared. But I also have to assume that my background will be disqualifying for a lot of people; it will also sow distrust into whatever trust exists; but I suppose that is my question. Is this the sort of thing that people are willing to work with, or is it best to remain sequestered in my house with my cat until I've tucked more sobriety under my belt?

Thanks for any and all feedback! And cheers to all those who have struggled with addiction, or with partners who have; it is truly one of the most fearsome predators on earth, and I am lucky to have survived it.

Surprisingly, she said yes!

on the evening before the prom, i spent about 2 hours and a sum of money to make myself as good looking as possible for my date. I got a new haircut and went shopping for a new shirt. I bought a new body fitting shirt which i thought looked pretty good. 

The prom started with a 3 course meal dinner. We sat down in our respective tables. Halfway through the first course my prom date dissappeared. i thought she had gone to the toilet.  

15 minutes passed and she was still not back yet. i got worried and excused myself from the table, went to look for her, thinking that she must have fainted or something. Went to the toilet, she wasn't there. texted her, no reply. 

Eventually, i came back to the table after all the course meals were already served, and then asked the girl sitting next to me (someone else's prom date) on the table whether they have seen my prom date. she looked at me with a pitiful expression and then told me that my prom date was with another guy on table no 15. 

my heart sank. it was like the worst day of high school all over again. I looked at table 15 and sure enough, she was there, with a tall, jock-looking guy who looked like he was in uni on an athletic scholarship. I saw the way she acted with him was so different towards me, she was laughing, pawing him, her hands on his lap and shoulder. later on, i heard that they had just met while she was on her way to the front of the hall to take pictures, and promptly hit it off. 

I pretended like everything was ok and put on a fake smile on my face, proceeded to eat my meal. after that, it was all i could take and i decided to go home because i felt like crying. did not want anyone to see my man tears. so i quickly made for the exit and.....ran into my prom date with her new jock date of all people!

at first, i pretended not to see them, hoping i could make a beeline for the exit as quick as possible before she saw me becasue i was so embarassed of myself. but she saw me and, probably feeling sorry for me, blurted out ""hey, where are you going?"" i blurted out in reply: ""not feeling well, going home now"". i could tell she was feeling sorry for me from her facial expression, so she whispered to me: ""i'm sorry"". then she went back to taking pictures with her new jock date.

3. The only women visibly interested aren't anywhere near my preference.

Like for women attraction is mostly social and if you don't belong to her tribe ... you won't get in easily. Of course if you're hyper social and a master talker with a zillion friends, you probably will get in. But that's not me and not many people most likely lol.

Like I've recently been matching with a lot of foreign women and it's amazing how open they are. Like first they match with me then we talk and there is no bs like a banter and stuff. Of course we tease each others and have fun. But it feels so much more fluid. Also the women from my ethnicity seem to be more reserved and submissive. Like here in Canada the ladies seem to have a zillion other dudes looping around them on Instagram and I just feel like a number to them. They don't seem to be looking for anything serious too.

This was in the early 1990s, before OLD, and dating for the most part was organic. But how much fun I had meeting new people and going out on dates. I worked in a nightclub and although I was not every person's type (e.g. I was not super tall or super buff or a bad boy, so to speak) I had a fresh-faced look to me that combined (working in a club plus okay looking) made it so I never had a shortage of dating opportunities. And how much I loved to date back then. I'm heterosexual (note: also a firm supporter of LGBTQ) and dated a wide range of ages and types of girls because I loved just going out, hearing their stories, and feeling that rush of getting to know someone I was attracted to\*

Then I met my STBXW, and was faithful to her for an our entire relationship so put all dating aside, but then after she ended our marriage last year I entered the dating pool again (this time utilizing OLD). What I learned is that at 52 I had not changed a bit since I was in my early 20s -- I still loved to date, still enjoyed getting to know people on an intimate level, was comfortable dating all types of women, and didn't have  issues finding people to date (OMG I love OLD). 

I had no intentions of settling down again, but then I met a magical person, and with zero reservations then or now have focused exclusively on her (53HLF). But I do miss the magic of dating, of getting to know new people on their best behavior (note: I love interviewing for jobs and interviewing potential employees for this very same reason!). 

So my point of all this is this: I'm wondering if I'd like being a matchmaker. And if people use matchmakers. And if so what their experiences were. And how they found them. And what words of wisdom any one reading this might have. What I imagine is interviewing potential men and women daters, getting to know their stories and interests/goals, then trying to find a match for them, charging a reasonable rate (and not some exorbitant fat fee that some services charge) while also providing feedback when applicable. 

My current SO, who is so kind and loving and sexual and balanced and who knows me so very well, has said I'd love being a matchmaker and that I'd be good at it. And she likes to joke that I am a human anthropologist, since I love meeting people and hearing their stories so much (I'm that person you find yourself dumping your life's story to at a coffee shop or hotel bar or on an airplane, and at the end of the conversation we part ways and you realize you dumped your story on someone without knowing who they are and realizing you'll never see them again :) ). And all of this is one of the reasons I drive Lyft/Uber on the side and I volunteer at various organizations on the weekends -- I enjoy talking to people.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. And I am very grateful for any thoughts/wisdom that you have. Maybe it's a crazy pipe dream I have, and that's okay to say, too. 

Thank you!!

 I am a girl and me and my friend are both in our 20’s. I’m starting to feel that he is starting to like me. We have known each other for a couple of years but we only started hanging out recently. There was a point where we would spend hours on the phone together at night but i realized that we shouldn’t do that if we’re not in a relationship because i feel that it isn’t appropriate. After the first time we hung out he expressed that he would like to hang out more often because he enjoys my company. We hung out once more  but something that I noticed is that I don’t feel comfortable around him. I have no idea why this is though. I feel uneasy and I’m constantly thinking of things that we could talk about. I usually make up some excuse if he wants to hang out because I don’t want him to start liking me and then have that awkward conversation. I could be wrong about him liking me but he has told me that he doesn’t view dating as dating. He sees dating as hanging out with someone until someone wants the relationship to progress. So part of me started thinking that maybe he is hoping for that with our relationship? If we’re out together at church for example he would introduce me to all of the people that is important to him. He even invited me to a family party but I did not go because if they see him with a girl they’re going to assume that there’s something going on and I don’t want to give him or them the wrong idea.
Just a few more random things I want to add:

Over time all these little moments had added up to a huge Mountain of pain and problems. 
Women and men ( in my opinion) tend to have very different roles in a relationship. When my partner and I were living together it felt like I was caring for a child. I was carrying the burden of responsibility. Everything from house chores, groceries, laundry, bills, cleaning, pet care. 
At first it wasn’t a big deal but over time I began asking for help. I communicated the weight I felt and resentment I was building in always feeling like the “adult”. 
Daily my partner would let me down. 
I would ask for help every day, beg for help. 
We decided to see a therapist because the stress was feeding into my depression and bleeding into so much of my life, even now after two years single I still feel anger and fear about being with someone for this reason. 
A therapist told us that as a women I would always carry this load. I would always be “nesting” and my counterpart would likely always need guidance. She asked if making him lists and him completing those tasks would help me and I told her no. No because it’s just ONE more fucking thing I have to do.

I think we made each other laugh and ultimately had a good connection. But then one day he texted me and told me that he knew we hadn’t gotten to the point of talking about being exclusive or in a relationship but he was really busy with an increasing work load and other obligations and he didn’t feel like it was fair to waste my time if I wanted a relationship with him and that he had a blast spending time with me and he hoped he hadn’t hurt my feelings and he wanted to maintain some sort of friendship. I had told him that it was okay, and I understood and that I still wanted to remain friends with him.  I really appreciated his honesty with this text message, and to be honest I wasn’t really free to have a good committed relationship at that time either because I was in the worst part of school.

I ran into the first guy at a bar, but I was there were pandemic restrictions in place and people were supposed to stay at their own tables so i didnt say hi to him, but my sister said she kept catching him looking over at us. KK fast forward a few months and pandemic restrictions are a lifted and I run into him at a restraunt. I was exhauseted I hadn’t slept all night because of a family emergency. He came to say hi and it was kind of awkward again, but cute, and both my friends said that he seemed to be interested in me. 

Later I posted about the family emergency and he sent me a really nice message and we talked a bit about what was going on and it was sentimental and comforting. I apologized to him for not being friendly when I saw him the weekend before and explained the reason why, he said he hadn’t taken it that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

He’s been liking all my pictrues on social media and we’ve been chatting a little bit, but I dont know if its all in my head, or what is going on. Or if he is interested or I am reading to much into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was/is everything I’ve always wanted in a romantic partner. He is an exceptionally kind and caring person, he and I share a lot of the same values, his family seems really cool. I’ve dated other guys recently and none of them are really as special as he is, like I just realized I’ve kind of shut these other guys in a way because they just are not him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I don’t know what to do here, should I leave him alone, or should I ask him out and tell him I’d like another chance.

Fast forward a couple months, we started to talk to each other when we see each other, it’s a big building so maybe for 20 minutes every couple days. She has expressed to her cousin how she has very strong feelings for me and I have started to like her more. She has the personality traits I look for in a girl. She’s also not a high school girl. She’s in college, works full time, provides for her own housing, is independent, and confident.  

So I’m talking to her cousin, I tell him I’m thinking about asking her out. He has given me his support and thinks it’s a good idea. He mentions to me she actually wants to ask me out. In person. Which has never happened to me before, and I find amazing.  

I’m worried about a couple issues. All revolving around the age. I don’t want to be seen as a creep. I don’t want to lose respect of friends, co workers, family.

So I started this job about 3 4 months ago, and when I start a new job I usually keep to myself until someone interacts with me. Fast forward to now I fit in perfectly with everybody, talk and connect well with most of my coworkers, although it’s a few that I’ve never said one word to, but that’s to be expected.

I recently got moved to another area in the warehouse where it’s this cute girl that I really wanted to get to know, but since she’s super shy and seems to have a little social anxiety, just approaching her like I normally would a girl I was interested in might have made her to nervous to talk, so I thought.

So I started simple, introducing myself, asking her how she was doing, how long she’s worked there, stuff like that. But I was usually carrying to conversations as she wasn’t giving me much to go off of, which is cool, in my mind she’s not interested so I’ll fall back, wouldn’t be the first time. But, we start playing this little eye tag game, where she’s starring when she thinks I’m not looking and I indulge, so I do the same back. We do this little game for about a week or so. So in my mind I’m like, at the very least she’s interested in what I got going on.

Now mind you, she literally only talks to her sister at our job who’s last day was Friday and that’s how I found out that her last day is tomorrow. Also my homie through me an oop, he told me today before our shift started that if I wanted it to talk to her, today and tomorrow is all I got. 

So today, again I said wassup, and these are my exact words, “hey wassup, I heard this is your last week.” She says “hey, and yea tomorrow is my last day.” I say “dang that sucks, just when I was starting to develop a little crush on you, what you got planned after this.” We talk a little more after that before we gotta get back to work. Weird and corny to tell her that, yes I know, but I wanted to see how she would react, or what she would say, I think it made her nervous a little bit, but that’s why I asked the follow up question “what you got planned after this,” to give her an out from that crush comment just in case that made her uncomfortable. After that we don’t see each other the rest of the shift and don’t get to talk.

Tomorrow her last day and I plan on telling that I wish her luck, wish we got to know each other a little bit more, but I’m rooting for her nonetheless, something along those lines. Now I know the easy thing to do is to just ask for her number but she hasn’t really gave me anything that would suggest she’d want to talk, which is why I told her I had a crush on her just to see what she should would do.

So I guess my question is for all of you, what would you have done differently from the beginning up until tomorrow, her last day.

I really value him as a person, but he's in a vulnerable place and grown over attached to me and started telling me how much he craves love from me - as someone with BPD I find this terrifying. It all feels so full-on that he talks about craving love and he wants me to fill something hollow inside him and I've told him I can't do that, and it feels like too much pressure.

I've tried to tell him that we've not even video called yet, we live far away in different countries and he's moving way too quickly with stuff but he doesn't seem to see these things as problems, provided I could have feelings for him.

 I've made it clear that I want him to expect nothing from me because I can make no promises, and we should try voice chatting and video calling more. I've told him I want to support him to grow in his confidence as a friend as he has quite low self esteem with dating, and I've told him I want to help him use dating apps and give him advice about girls. But this really upset him as he says he doesn't like or want girls from a dating app, he rarely gets matches and finds using the app really de-humanizing and depressing. He said he specifically wants me or someone like, and when I suggested the other girl he'd been talking with from the app, he got really mad and said he wasn't ok. This is upsetting me as I feel attached to him emotionally.

I've told him I want to slow things down and maybe call.  I actually feel quite scared of him right now but also guilty because when I was feeling sexually frustrated I did start talking in a sexual way with him which he liked and I feel I've led him on, which is causing me guilt.

So in this real world example, she is, flat out, telling me she expects that she will never see or hear from me again. After the date, we said our goodbyes and neither of us ever texted each other again. I have zero regrets.

I'm probably gonna be dragued for even saying any of it but I've been keeping it bottled up for years! First of all I'm happily married with two kids and we want many more, probably 5-6. I love my husband. It's hard work being married and working on ourselves but we have really built a beautiful life and I wouldn't change a thing from the past. I grew a lot in the past few years and I owe a lot to my husband because he was there when I needed it. He's far from a saint and so am I but we love our family together!
Before I was with him I used to have a friend. We met at work, he was a customer and friend of a collegue of mine... We lost track for a bit after I stopped working there because he was in a long term relationship and I had kind of a story with that friend of ours. He was always flirting with girls even though he was in a relationship so I thought he was a player and didn't think much of him.
One day, out of the blue he reached out to me and asked me out, just as friends. Wanted to chat. So he came by and picked me up and we went out. He payed for everything even though I didn't want him to. Said he was italian and had to. Brought me back home and that was that. He wasn't with his gf anymore and I was single. Since there had been something between me and his friend I didn't think anything could happen. Bro code and all. So I really saw him as just a friend. As time went by, we kept talking. I didn't realize it back then, I don't know why, but he was actually always complimenting me. For example, he wanted to come and pick me up once and I didn't want because I wasn't wearing makeup and ready to to be. He said I was still the most beautiful girl ever or something along those lines. He always told me I was beautiful, but not in a flirty way? At least I didn't think of it that way. He talked to me almost everyday. We would go out together 2-3x a week. Usually late at night. He would pick me up, always pay... Eventually, I kinda started wondering if he would eventually make a move? But instead, he started having me meet his friends, and would always say stuff like : you would go very well with him, or this guy is probably your type, or my friend thought you were pretty, etc. Etc. Etc. He would always tell me I was like his little sister and everything. By that point I realised he didn't see me like that, and I started to keep myself from seeing him like that, too. He seemed upset about his bad breakup. He told me he cried in his shower, and that he never told stuff like that to anyone. At some point, I also realised he had no clue his friend and I went out a few times, and I told him. We kept seeing each other but it got weird, I don't know when. He brought me on a DATE once. A date with another girl! A girl he didn't really like I think but still. The first girl he had slept with since his gf. She was his standard girl, very well-groomed and toned, fit, gym everyday girl. Which I'm not! I'm a bit on the curvier side although healthy, I love running and cycling, but I don't hit the gym. That date was so weird. He said he didn't like her, and wanted my ""opinion"" on her. I mean... Do you know how hard it was to see him with her? But I was a good friend. I told him she was sweet. Which she was. Even though she hated me but I can understand. Who brings his girl pal on a date with his well.. date? We went to grab some coffees and it was sooo awkward. After that I realised he really wasn't into me. He still kept complimenting me. He still kept seeing me 2-3x a week. Always driving, always paying, even though I fought him on this. We would always text and write to each other.
But since he wasn't interested, I started going out with other guys. It had been going on for months.. so I met my ex-boyfriend and had a fling with another man, too. Nothing serious, but I told him about it. He always gave the best advices but I knew he thought I was silly. I just felt it in the way he spoke. I was, too. My ex was an asshole. Eventually, we had a falling out. We spent a bit of time without seeing each other. When we spoke again, I had met my husband. He came to my place of work at some point (worked in a sexshop where I met my husband). He said he wanted to buy some stuff for a girl he was seeing and see the new guy I was dating. Later, he told me for sure he was gay and made fun of him a bit. I got upset and so did my husband (bf then). After a while, that man and I stopped talking again. I reached out 2-3x but he either answered very basic answers of just didn't answer at all.
I didn't think about him that much after that. But some time later I found an old convo with him and it made me wonder if he might have liked me, or if I was simply foolish. When it's hard with my husband, I think of what might have been. I will never reach out to him. I'm trying to forget about him altogether, to respect my husband.
But seeing those conversations with that man... remembering our nights out together, talking for hours on end, eating fastfood in his car, driving all night long, then chatting with him online before bed... I wonder if I hadn't gone out with his friend... If I had let him the time to heal from his previous relationship.. what might have been. Maybe I just read to much into everything. But he made me feel like the most beautiful woman alive. He was always there. And I miss his friendship. It's been 7 years. He probably don't even remember me.
I just want to silence those thoughts in my head. Even if he never could have liked me. Even if I know we wouldn't have been right for each other at the time. I was too young and too stupid. I was 19 and he was 27 or 28. We were not at the same place... And now, I have children that I love more than anyone in the world and I wouldn't change a thing in my past because it would mean that they wouldn't be there. I just feel like he's the one that got away and I hope that finally saying it, even to a bunch of strangers, and not keeping it bottled up will help put it to test. I hope I forget him someday.
