2,my3zel,1619339189,"I hate my boyfriend, but I'm scared to leave him","This might be a little long, so please try to bear with me.
I'm 20f, my boyfriend is 25m. We began our relationship about a week after I graduated from high school after meeting on a dating app. It began as a whirlwind romance, fun dates, me staying at his place for days on end, the whole shebang. However, we've always had rough patches every so often. And when I say rough, I mean ROUGH. Yelling, crying, (him) name calling, then making up the same night.
Long story short, I wish I hadn't, but I put up with it. By the time we'd been together about 6 months, I'd tried and faltered and failed in about 8 attempts to break up with him. And then I got pregnant. To be honest, it's a miracle it didn't happen sooner. We'd used condoms like 3 times TOTAL and I was being a stupid horny teenager, but alas, I decided to keep the baby. A while later, our daughter J is born. She's my whole world, and for a while, things seemed okay. And then we figured we had more issues. J is almost 8 months old. Bf still lives with his mom, and my current living situation is not safe for a mobile baby. And so, we've begun looking for places to rent together. And then things got worse. We began to fight more. He calls me evil and treats me like a child. Just today, we had an argument concerning my coping mechanism of walking away from arguments for a few minutes to calm down so I don't say something horrible. He doesn't want me to drink, he doesn't want me to be on my phone so much, he doesn't want me to have guy friends, he doesn't want me to sleep in till noon. He's controlling and immature and selfish and then projects it all on to me.
I want so badly to break up. I'd gladly do 50/50 custody.
I'd happily coparent if I didn't have this lingering fear in the back of my mind that he'd try to get more than 50% custody of J through a court order because of my living situation.
Right now, his version of the plan involves us moving in, me being a stay at home mom and getting a WFH job if I can, and enjoying life to the fullest. My version includes a part where I get the job and then move into a studio apartment or with my sister when she gets her own place.
In hindsight, I see the red flags were going off like flashing lights in my eyes. I don't regret my daughter, but I wish I'd broken up with him before I'd gotten pregnant. I wish I could just cut him out of my life because of how undeniably toxic he is. I love him, but I hate him just as much. 
I need to stick it out for a little longer, I HAVE to. It's all for J. I just don't know how much longer I can keep up with this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my3zel/i_hate_my_boyfriend_but_im_scared_to_leave_him/

7,my4a1k,1619340578,Girl i like,"First of all some backstory. I'm 31 years old and i broke up with my previous girlfriend like 4 years ago. I'm currently just working on my grain growing farm and i don't really go out at all.

2 years later had some problems with my debit card and i went into bank to sort it out. There was this beautiful girl behind desk that was extremely nice to me. Well tbh its their job to be nice and i was too afraid of making any move because first of all she was working and i don't even know if she had boyfriend. Atleast she didnt have ring.

Bit later that year after i bought the farm and i was making bank account for my farm i met this same girl behind the desk. I went to her and she guided me to other room, where there was senior bank advisor or what ever since its not important. On our way there she tried to make some small talk to me and she clumsily just wanted me to know that she owns farm and she grows mostly oats. Like i was 95% sure she was intrested in me but we were already at the advisors door so i just went in and filled forms for the bank account.

On my way out she had his hands full of work because there was some people there in line so i just greeted her and left the bank.

Fast forward to this day i found her image in magazine about new farmers and about their farms.

With some detective work. Should i just message her in instagram since i have no idea where i could meet her in real life.

9,my4cji,1619340911,advice needed. obsessed in a romantic or platonic way?,"i’m pretty much getting obsessed with my best friend, as she’s the only person that i genuinely enjoy talking to and hanging out with and we talk an awful lot on a daily basis about absolutely anything and we are crazily comfortable with sharing any type of information with each other. literally any kind. we’ve been best friends for more than one and a half years but we’ve lately been getting closer than we ever were. we share the exact same music taste, political views and overall opinions and we’re very similar so we always have something to talk about and never run out of topics to discuss.

however, we used to be part of a slightly bigger group of people, six to be exact, and ever since we’ve met in that group i knew that this girl would be the only one worthy of my attention and time. nevertheless, everyone in our friend group was pretty much going crazy over her as she was always in the spotlight and had that very specific extroverted main character energy that everyone praised her for, and i was the quietest, most aloof one that they didn’t really like hanging out with. i quickly got jealous that she was getting all the attention, so i began initiating indirect conflicts between the members of our group so they’d eventually break up.

it really worked and i got rid of the burden of the group, without anyone blaming me, but when i thought about the true reason why i had done that, i think it wasn’t because i felt lonely and wanted the spotlight, but because i wanted to be the only one to talk to this girl and have her close to me. i despised the idea of her having any other friends or talking to someone else than me. as bad as it might sound, i wanted to be in HER spotlight, i wanted her to pay attention to me and me only. anyways, once the group broke up, we began getting closer, hanging out lots, etc.

whenever we went out and she had her phone with her i would always sneak peeks at whoever she was talking to, and always questioned her about the friends she had made, who she was chatting with (she had a very messy breakup after her ex cheated on her with an underage girl lol, and i was there for her and helped her through that terrible period of time), because naturally she had sought new relationships and connections after no longer having a boyfriend (they had been together for one year and a few months), and i began getting obsessed with knowing everything about everyone she talked to and whenever i got the chance i would encourage her to stop talking to them and talk to me only.

she agreed to cutting off some people that i had suggested her to cut off (not necessarily because i was jealous, more like because they were straight up creepy and predatory), and well, we started hanging out more and more. at some point, she had confessed to me, as in she confessed that she had romantic feelings for me, and i told her that i feel the same about her. when faced with taking a certain approach in this situation, i didn’t know what to do, i didn’t know if i actually liked her or i was just obsessed with the idea of being her only friend, so i told her that we should withhold our feelings and stay friends because a relationship between the two of us wouldn’t end well. she took my word for it and we kept being friends.

the thing is that i hate and love her greatly at the same
time. sometimes i dream about being in a relationship with her, sometimes i dream about us being the best of friends, and sometimes i dream about straight up humiliating and dehumanizing her in the worst ways possible. i always think about all of her flaws: she’s irresponsible, childish, extremely loud, narcissistic, egoistical, overly sensitive and emotional, dramatic, exasperating, demanding and tiresome, and try to think of a way in which i could fix her, but i’m pretty sure i’ve tried it all, and simply can’t do that. i hate her flaws, i hate the way she behaves and talks with people who aren’t me, or when it’s not just the two of us, and i hate that i’ve tried everything to help her overcome her shortcomings and it was all ineffective.

as much as i despise her weaknesses, she’s different with me, she’s caring, gentle and mature, and also knows me and my reactions so well, which is truly comforting. i get mad when i know she’s talking to other people, she has friends other than me or compliments someone else. once we were walking around a park and we saw some acquaintances of hers and she simply said “i don’t know them that well, but they seem really nice!”, and i got angry because of her assumption. not to mention the one time when she sent me a guy’s IG profile and said “he seems so cool” or something like that. it took a while to convince her not to talk to him.

these days we’ve been going out daily, just spending eight hours a day talking, walking and joking around, gossiping, listening to music and ranking our favorite artists, albums and songs, and just chatting about the most insignificant of things, and she’s been getting really flirty, flirtier than last summer when she liked me. for the reference, she says things like “you look so pretty today, i really have the most gorgeous best friend”, “i bet your [you know] is real good”, “your next significant other will be so lucky i’m so jealous of them”, “haha what if we kissed”, “no don’t worry about them, nobody is hotter than you”, and she says “i love you” a lot. i’m equally flirty, so i don’t know how to think of this. 

i have no idea if i want a relationship with her, i’m attracted to her psychical appearance a lot and consider her gorgeous, but at the same time i despise her? and i’m obsessed with the idea of having her all to myself, but i can’t tell if it’s in a platonic or romantic way. i don’t want for her to talk about herself, i don’t care about what she has to say, what she goes through, and even though i comfort her all the time about everything, i actually couldn’t care less. i just want her to listen to me and think of me as the best and only person she’ll ever talk to. it sounds like shit once written in this context, but i need advice, i guess? thank you lots for reading!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my4cji/advice_needed_obsessed_in_a_romantic_or_platonic/

Like the guys I date always put in so much effort at first to just talk to me. It goes on like that for about a month or so and then I get emotionally invested. Then things go fine for a few more months and then they start drifting apart. Then I give them space by doing my own thing which they consider as ""play hard to get"". 

They start ignoring me /avoiding me and at this point I lose interest and then I'm emotionally unavailable again. Now at this point I suggest we part ways and they start pursuing me again and now it's too late.

17,my4sa9,1619342873,Would you get back with your ex in this situation,"So me and my ex of nearly 3 years broke up 3 and a half weeks ago and we’re in no contact for  month so we’ll add each other back sometime soon. I’ve reflected on the relationship over the last 3 weeks and have realised a lot of the problems so the first main one is the fact my parents are quite strict so like we can’t stay over at each other house and like even travelling the world my parents would most likely say no and we both are the type of people that love backpacking ect, so he told me he felt really held back by this and like he’s starting his life now but there’s still people holding him back( my parents), which I completely understand tbh especially since his parents are like high school sweethearts and also travelled the world young. Then the second reason is I could be toxic sometimes and had unhealthy mechanism  and he gave me chances before but I didn’t change before because I was only trying to change because of him and this time I want to change for me as well and I’ve genuinely made great changes so far and people have commented on it. Also in this time apart I have got diagnosed with complex ptsd which explains a lot of what I was doing which obviously doesn’t excuse my behaviours but I’m going to be getting therapy and like I feel like I am making a lot of progress and that combined with therapy will really help me and he doesn’t know this because we’re in no contact right now. Another thing that makes me believe that it could work this time is that I’m moving away from home and away from that toxic environment in a month( he doesn’t know this either) and this will make my parents not really a problem and my moods won’t change that drastically because the cause of my massive mood swings were usually to do with something at home.  I’ve started meditation and journaling which has helped me massively control my impulses and help my communication even my relationship with my parents have got slightly better as I am more calm with them when they say/ do  something toxic.  

But yeah our relationship was an amazing one like a week before he broke up with me he was saying how he was going to marry me ect and like we got on so well and went through so much together more than many other couples and he genuinely treated me amazingly. We both said we still loved each other and always will we still want to be friends and like the breakup wasn’t messy it was upsetting but we left on good terms. We broke no contact once and it was really confusing because there was so many mixed signals and we met up again( for closure as at this point we both thought we were fully done with the relationship) and I explained some things to him and he left my house and said I need to think about this more ( as In getting back together) but then when we got home he messaged me saying stuff like I think we got a bit too caught up in this stuff and he was like I want to be your friends and how he loves me so so much and I was confused because he said he was going to think about us getting back together, we reinstated the no contact rule for exactly a month but I still don’t know how he feels 

But anyways after this and the reflecting and therapy I’ve gotten past the stage of the breakup that I’m crying everyday and can’t do anything, I still miss him so much and want him back, but it’s hard because I know I have put him through a lot and a lot of it is my fault but I know for a fact this time if we tried again we would work and these problems would be significantly better but it’s just he needs to see that as well or we won’t work out. I just want him to be happy and best case scenario he’s happy with me but if it’s not with me that’s okay as long as he is. I just want to try my best now to try to make it work because I’m the future I don’t want to look back and regret it because our relationship was 100% worth saving. But also I’m so confused because was no contact a mistake? Will he completely get over me in that time? Like it’s like I’m in a limbo and don’t know if I should move on or try wait for him, but then he could also be out there completely living his life and moving on completely and I see some of his posts on social media and it seems his living his life and how could he get over a relationship that fast, idk it just makes me question things I’ve never had to question like if he ever really loved me. I don’t know I just want this conversation to come soon so we can either get back together or get closure",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my4sa9/would_you_get_back_with_your_ex_in_this_situation/

Using those apps made me feel completely undesirable, and I felt like I had to use them to get myself out there. But in the end it was utterly pointless. I went years without any intimacy. I think you literally have to “get lucky” to be with someone as an ugly guy. 

I don’t think it’s normal or natural for 75% of guys to be deemed untouchable by 100% of women. It’s just insane. I was rejected by women who were in wheelchairs, were morbidly obese and had facial disfigurements. I know I’m not attractive, but I’m still more attractive than them. 

This is the reality that tinder etc has created for less attractive guys. I was wondering how other ugly guys have found it and how it’s impacted them? I think it’s important to talk about as men’s body image and self esteem isn’t often spoken about :)

*Disclaimer* I know it’s not impossible for an ugly guy to find someone (I have a partner). But it’s not good for men’s mental health to be rejected on sight 100% of the time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my6xap/online_dating_as_a_physically_unattractive_man/
26,my7erd,1619353989,Can you still see messages on facebook from people your not friends with? Or does it automatically go to spam.,"So last night I went out to a bar. I met a girl who I found was really nice and we had a cool conversation for a while. From what I could tell she seemed pretty interested as she was asking me heaps of questions back and we spoke for almost 10 minutes. We were both pretty sober as well. At the end of the night I ask for her facebook and she happily gave it to me. After she gave it to me I left the bar and said goodbye. I go on to add her this morning and I see we don't have any mutual friends so her privacy setting won't allow me to sent her a request.   


So I though I might just message her. I just said it was great to meet her and asked whether she got home alright. Nothing that I think would put someone off. So far after about half a day since I've sent the message, I haven't heard anything back. At first I assumed she wasn't interested; and to be fair that's all good we only spoke for 10 minutes they don't owe me anything haha. But the thing that concerns me is that I've had friends who have told me they've had message requests go straight to there facebook spam folder and they only find the message in the folder after 2 years.   


Offcourse, I'm not going to act creepy and start double messaging a person I don't know. I will leave it obviously. If im being honest, I actually hope the scenario is that she's not interested and just ignored me. Because, if the situation is that the message went into her spam folder and she hasn't even seen it I'll be kicking myself for a long time wishing I'd done something differently.    


I'm just curious, has anyone had messages requests on facebook go into their spam folder without even receiving a notification?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my7erd/can_you_still_see_messages_on_facebook_from/

I've been doing online dating for about 6 years, and I've been on over 30 dates. Not one has gone to a second.

I have plenty of male and female friends so clearly I have social skills. But the one thing that eludes me is a second date. The women always say that they ""got more of a friend vibe"".

I don't understand, when a few of them have told me that I'm really good looking and that they enjoyed the conversation. I mean, I realise a relationship is more than those things, but SURELY those two things should be at least a catalyst for a second date?

28,my83eo,1619356479,"Is being an independent, 'manly' women a turn off?","I've been single over 8 years now. Dated on and off but nothing ever materialized. It always seems to be the other person that decides they're not interested,  and I can never figure out why or what I was doing wrong. I recently met a guy who I thought was wonderful,  we went on a date and I was very excited about him, but that completely flopped.

One of my (favourite, the kind that when he walks in we start insulting each other) customers found out I was talking to that guy (long story on how, I never involve my customers with my personal lives) and he came in on Friday to buy some motor oil from me. He asked me how all that was going and I responded  ""I swear I'm going to die alone"".

He told me he was probably intimidated,  because I seemed like a catch. I asked why he'd think that and he said guys get intimidated by independent and manly women like me, which I asked what that meant.

I own a house, a pick up truck, a snowmobile and have a dog. I do my own oil changes and tire rotations. I know how to pull a trailer and launch a boat. My dress attire consists of steel toe boots, jeans, leggins and sweaters, or flannel. I don't do my hair and make-up (I actually just think I look dumb with ny hair and makeup all done up). I work at a repair shop for transports. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, when the guys are busy I usually move tires around for them or do other menial tasks they don't have time for. Apparently I can have quite the mouth on me,  I can throw dirtier jokes than my male coworkers. My hobbies include fishing and snowmobiling,  quadding, boating. 

My customer said there's nothing wrong with that but I'll have a hard time finding a man that can handle a woman that doesn't need him. His girlfriend is a lot like me (she's another one of my favourite customers) and went thru the same thing before they met.

Since this conversation it's been bugging me. I  work hard and didn't think all that was a turn off lol. So I'm wondering what your opinion is 😅",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my83eo/is_being_an_independent_manly_women_a_turn_off/

42,my9im1,1619361290,My DETAILED BREAKDOWN on why women don't like their s/o liking girls insta pictures,"(HALF-SERIOUS)

People pin women being bothered over men liking pics of girls to insecurity which it is to an extent but it has some layers to it and this is my VERY HONEST personal theory

1. women can shoot their shot with likes and easily get a dm out of it afterwards, so they assume it can happen to the s/o or the guy they are dating
2. the principle of it is the accessibility of the person he liked, if it's a celebrity or someone half famous living in a different country, that's out of reach. But someone from the same city that is not famous is accessible.
3. Why I think instagram likes should be taken more seriously than your man watching porn...

As a woman who enjoys watching porn, my purpose of it is to learn something new or get off and what ive learnt from the perspective of the male gaze is that men perceive sex as just the act itself and not about the person. Watching porn is already an objectifying act towards the actors in it, liking an insta pic however, is approving the woman's request to validate her thirst trap. The bottom line of an insta like starts from being quite an endearing form of interaction similar to how we get swayed by our s/o in the beginning of the relationship, they make us feel beautiful and appreciated.

4. What do women do when we breakup or are trying to get over someone? We often try to ""level up"" by pampering ourselves again and displaying it to the public. This is what we call ""peacocking"" but this is not the peacock world, in the human patriarchal world the peacocking is a role left to the woman. Posting pics is one form of peacocking and sending signals for compliments because desirability politics is systematic and our contribution to it is inevitable in someways. This does not mean women post solely for male attention since using our ""looks"" on social media can often gather consumers for ur brand; unfortunately due to pretty privilege people will pay attention to someones independent business just because they're pretty and have a lot of followers . So in my mind, your s/o validating women's ""peacocking"" signal can be perceived as a form of disrespect.

5. Other women can see your s/o liking other women's posts. It is often a feeling of embarrassment that your s/o has wandering eyes

6. If we were to sit next to our s/o and scroll in from of them, liking every thirst trap of a man that looks nothing like him, say men with beards and he has the inability to grow one, or men with bodies built like an nfl player and he doesn't go gym, they would probably not be bothered. Women we aren't built the same, especially those who believe in monogamy. Society has made it seem like it must be women doing the waiting and men do the chasing so they cannot connect the dots of disrespect when their thumbs are slipping on every woman's insta pic.

7. Remember that one guy in high school who used to ask for hugs from everyone that every girl thought was slimy, but somehow he was able to get some action from girls in other schools because they didn't know that we know he is slimy? your s/o constantly liking insta posts of girls gives off the same vibe.

8. We get likes consecutively or from the same guy often and sometimes think, ""this dude again?"" We think to ourselves, what if I picked the ""this dude again?"" guy to another woman as my s/o? That is embarrassing.

A lot of it comes from mixed emotions of embarrassment, insecurity (I have to admit) and the s/o not making us not feel secure enough in a monogamous relationship. This feeling should be validated by your partner if you feel a way about him liking women's pictures. if they can't stop at your request, there's a chance those wandering thumbs will to turn into wandering eyes which might not be far off from a cream pie.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my9im1/my_detailed_breakdown_on_why_women_dont_like/

He wanted to go on a date with me while I wanted to call first before meeting up in person but ultimately he didn't wanna call cus he wasn't comfortable/ didn't want to put expectations before meeting. I wasn't comfortable meeting cus of covid and all the cases so I told him let's meet when things calm down. Anyways, we still text sometimes and have a streak on snap (think I'm the only girl he's talking to rn cus he doesn't seem like the f boy type and barely follows girls on social) but it just hit me this morning that maybe I'm scared of meeting him cus what if I like him? We have a lot of the same core values and take relationships very seriously. He seems to have a lot of the qualities I like in a guy. 

I know that sounds bizarre to say cus isn't liking someone the point and goal of dating/meeting people. But idk why this just hit me right now. I feel like I've been using covid as a cover up for what I deeply feel inside and what's preventing me from meeting him. 

I have been in two relationship before. First  one was 2 years and he cheated. My second one was about a year ago (lasted 7 months) and I just had higher standards+expectations than he did for the relationship. I also had some trust issues with him cus I would see repeated behavior from how my first ex was. So I broke things off. 

So yeah here I am.. this guy seems great but I'm afraid of liking him, getting my hopes up and invested just to be let down again and lose the person. I mentally can't handle heartbreak just cus I have other things to focus on like my career+heartbreak puts me in a very low spot I never want to go through again. I have already opened up to him about some of my past and so has he. He knows I have some trust issues. A part of me feels like if I'm afraid of liking someone maybe I'm just not ready to date yet?

To think that the ideal partner for such woman like that of traditional, stereotipical prince charming is outdated and laughable.

The ideal partner would be a feminine, metrosexual guy who you would share hobbies, literature and general life viewpoints that better relate to the modern woman i.e. he does your makeup, your hair, paints your nails, wears lingerie (look it up, it's quite common) and he is very much in touch with pop culture, celebrities, women fashion (he can even give you tips on your dresscode) loves broidery, women's movement, cats and knowlegeable about periods and feminine higiene.

I'm thinking of a way to make the smoothest approach when someone starts splashing some water from their balcony almost on our heads. 

I use that situation to make a comment when she looked at me and I said ""It seems like they are trying to kill us, what did they throw on our heads?"". She starts laughing and smiling and answers ""Seems like it's water"". And she starts conversation from there saying how she got late for the last bus now she's gonna lose her friend because she's impatient and we both laugh. She's asking me where I'm from, where do I live and we exchange some basic info about ourselves and I ask her where's she going to and she says she's going to campus. 

In the meantime bus arrives, she's constantly flirting, playing with her hair and smiling, asking me questions about me, bear in mind I didn't introduce myself, nor did I ask for her name, and while we are standing in a bus we talk about our favourites places to sit and she says she takes this line often but doesn't like sitting and asks me for my name and my surname and how old I am, do I know a certain person from my city, she's texting her friend in the meantime  she's still flirting with me, I'm showing confident body language and our conversation flows naturally. She asks me where do I exit and I say at city centre and asks me where I'm going, I say I'm going to my training session and she asks me what I'm training, I say I'm just working out going to the gym. 

After few moments of silence she tells me suddenly that she's exiting at city centre as well and she's changed her mind with her friend about going to campus. I'm like, this girl is showing all signs of attraction and I'm gonna ask her if she's interested in hanging out after we exit the bus. 

We exit and her friend calls her and tells her where she's waiting for her and we go into same direction, and I ask her since we are in the same neighborhood we should organize hanging out sometime and maybe you should give me your number, and she responds, I'm not very social person and I don't give out my number to someone I don't know very well. During our whole conversation she didn't move her hands from touching her hair constantly and was making eye contact and smiling. We keep walking for 5 more minutes and she tells me that this friend is the only person she hangs out with and it happens only few times a year because she's studying here and they are usually apart.

Anyway this guy is SO my type but I am holding back with developing any feelings because he told me he is not looking for a relationship right now. Because he is too busy for that. I got busy too, but I could manage a relationship... I would be ready for it but I thought ""Hey let's try this casual dating too"" (bc the guy is cute and we are in a similar life situation, maybe casual dating is a good choice then??)

Before our first date we called and had so much to talk. We were vibing! I liked that we have the same humor (he laughes at my jokes!! YEY) and were interested in each others lifes (I think he is such an interesting person). He seems like a honest and straightforward kind of guy which was sooo refreshing. He knows what he wants and compliments me in things nobody has told me before.

First date was a walk in the park, we talked for hours and he wanted to see me again. Second date we had dinner at his, I slept with him, since then we meet once a week or every second week (depends on how busy we are) We talk a lot still when we meet in person, sometimes he calls me but he is not much of a message person. Which is fine.

But he told me again ""I just want something casual"" because he is too busy with his job and studies (which he told me from date #1). I made myself busy too these days but still I could make the time for a person I am interested in to check on them and ask how they are. But I don't want to text or call too much because he doesn't want that responsibility to always be in touch - therefore ""casual dating"".

But what can I do to not get hurt from things and how to do the ""casual"" dating right? I guess one big difference to a relationship is that you are not constantly in contact or feel the need to meet often? But that doesn't have to mean he is not enough interested in me to WANT to see me?

53,myb88r,1619366491,Are dating apps worth it?,"This is gonna be long. So I wanna start by saying that I have zero experience with dating. I know that texting online will not improve my dating skills and that I gotta talk to women irl (Im a straight guy btw). I only feel comfortable talking flirty with women that are in an environment where I spent a lot of time daily, for example at work.  The problem is, there are no women in production. There are in the offices and a couple of them may walk by once in a while, but most of them are taken/ married so I wouldn't wanna be that guy who hits on married women. At the same time, my colleagues who are married are drooling all over the women who come out of the offices and I can tell by the way they look at me, that they probably think I am like those guys. Like if a female goes to the toilet they literally wait until the door opens so they can look at her again which is disgusting (especially considering those guys are married).

Before the lockdown I used to go to the gym daily, but most of the ones I saw often were already in a relationship. I also have a problem with small talk and talking to strangers in general. In fact when I go to the gym I don't talk at all, just go there to do my workout. I did catch a couple of girls looking, one of them was probably single because I've never seen her with anyone. The thing is, everyone there knows that I don't talk and every time I talk with a female they look at me as if they are seeing a ghost or something. Not that I care but it is annoying af.

You may say that I should start by making friends who may know somebody because a lotta people find others through contacts. But the thing is, I don't want to start talking to the guys there just because I wanna find a girlfriend.

Now there is a new lockdown taking place here, and I see that on Fridays and weekends people still hangout, be it friends or couples because they still have contacts. But I feel like I am trapped in a hole somewhere. 

I go to a park to workout because gyms are closed and there are some chicks there, but just like the gym I can't tell if they are with some of the guys there or not. And talking to random females while I am not that talkative with other people can make me look creepy, or at least that is how I feel, like a creep. 

I recently started using a dating app and got 2 likes, but even though I sent messages I got no replies. There are rumours about fake profiles and stuff so my hopes keep decreasing as I get older. Not 30 yet but in my late 20's.

82,mydsda,1619373888,Is it weird to reach out to someone in an attempt to be friendly after you’ve slept together? Not sure if I should reach out to this guy or leave things be,"Hooked up 3 times with this guy who we
will call Will on vacation. 

Coincidentally went on one date with his roommate before Will and I slept together on our first date, and so the roommate and I stopped talking, obvi (I didn’t know they knew each other until I met the roommate — I feel kind of bad for hopping into bed with Will; the roommate reminded me too much of my ex and I was pretty drunk the night I slept with Will. It was definitely an impulse decision. Roommate and I had only gone on one, admittedly amazing, first date so I don’t feel *that* bad, though roommate seems the sweeter of the two — my ex was very charming / appeared sweet so I guess I got spooked). They’re still roommates even post-vacation so not sure if that’s relevant to this story or not but I thought I’d throw that detail in there. 

Will and I got along well but I don’t think either of us really sees the other as long term potential, though for me that’s mostly because of the circumstances / the timing. It takes me a long time to evaluate someone for an LTR and I didn’t get enough data to rule him out, but I also didn’t get enough data to change my interest from platonic to romantic. I like his interests and his demeanor. We would message a little every evening but, to me, it was nothing too emotionally intimate so I found the conversation quite dry. I think he mostly was reaching out to keep me in his back pocket for when he had time to meet up again, though it was me who initiated the 3rd and final up “hang out” in his hotel room ;)

Anyway, that was probably a month ago or so now. I work remotely, so my plans were to go to NY, and I told him as much. I always knew he was going to LA, though he is technically based in SF. We definitely never planned to meet up again and I think we wanted it to stay a nice memory. We haven’t messaged since he got on the plane. 

Well, one thing in my life led to another and I actually ended up in SF the past few weeks, and I’m now out in LA, close to his neighborhood, very briefly, to see a friend who’s also briefly in town that I haven’t seen in over a year. I’ve been busy this weekend seeing her and her kid that was born before the pandemic / meeting some of her friends while here. Since I am very busy with work this week I’ll just stay here until I have time to make the drive back up to SF and finish my business of finding an apartment there/seeing family (probably next Saturday). 

The thing is, I’m thinking of reaching out after my deadline to this guy just to say hi? I’m not really interested in hooking up again tbh. And idk if he would be either anyway. Let’s just say that out of curiosity / uncertainty about what to do I did a quick test on Tinder by limiting age and location parameters and I’m all but 100% certain that he swiped left on me (and never reached out via text). I have gold and he never appeared in my likes and I definitely purposely swiped left until he was like the only person left in the neighborhood lol. If i hadn’t done that I probably would have blithely reached out but now I don’t know. I’m a very gregarious person by nature, and I like making friends. but I don’t have much experience in dating / hooking up after being in a relationship for a long time/ that was my only sexual experience. I don’t know if there’s certain etiquette or boundaries I would be crossing by reaching out. To me, he’s just an acquaintance who I have happened to sleep with. If we hadn’t slept together I would 100% ask if he’s free for coffee and not feel a thing if he was “too busy” or didn’t reply. But because we’ve had sex I don’t know how to act or feel. 

TLDR: slept with this guy. He seems completely uninterested, but for some reason I still want to meet up to chat over coffee. Would it be weird to reach out? Am I being delusional? I would like to be friends but I don’t know if that ship has sailed or if he’s even interested in friendship with me. If we hadn’t slept together I would 100% reach out and say hi. But for some reason the potential rejection or seeming clingy here (like, lord, what if he thinks I’m in town for *him*??) feels unsettling to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mydsda/is_it_weird_to_reach_out_to_someone_in_an_attempt/
83,mydsx5,1619373931,Struggling to find anyone in a tiny dating pool,"Hi reddit.

I am 21F and I’ve never been in a real relationship, so I have no real idea what I’m doing and could use advice.

I am a lesbian. This means that even though I live in a larger city, my pool of potential partners is pretty small, and identifying them in the wild is exceptionally difficult, so I’m relying on dating apps.

I do not want children, and I’m mildly on the autism spectrum. Because, of course, this had to get more complicated.

Finding a lesbian who does not want children, that I am compatible with (does not infantilize me, does not claim I need to “get over” my sensory issues, etc.) and I am preferably attracted to? That seems like an impossible task, and I am getting slightly frustrated.

I feel like it’s not unreasonable to have standards that go beyond my absolute dealbreakers. But finding someone who even meets those? That seems like one in a million.

If there’s anyone else reading this who is part of a very small community and learned how to find a needle in a haystack, so to speak, I’d be really appreciative.

So the other day I went on a date with an old co-worker of mine. She showed high interest and I had a great time. The date itself went great but as the title says I made a few mistakes. First major mistake I feel I made was that I didn't go for the kiss after our first date ended. The stupid mask make things awkward where instead of just going for the kiss, I have to be like ""Take your mask off"" first and it just kinda got to me and I got nervous. I sent her a text the next morning saying I had a good time and she responded positively. Second mistake I feel I made was when I texted the day after our date, I told her to let me know when she's back from her trip so we can make plans at a bar I wanted to meet at again. On the surface it doesn't seem bad but generally whenever I tell anyone ""Let me know"" usually they don't get back to me regardless if its platonic or dating (just a people thing since most people don't like initiating plans). Usually I don't have issues with these things but quarantine has made me really isolated for the past year so I've become more socially awkward and I haven't been dating a lot during the pandemic so I got nervous. Hopefully things can open back up soon and I can get to meeting more people soon instead of worrying about one person.

Probably because most of the girls have far more matches and have far less energy for the same reason that I don't. 

I also blame my self because of my nerves. I get anxious to meet someone and am afraid it won't go well. It also doesn't help that I mostly match with people who are 2 hours away. 

I'm not sure what my point is. But I think I'm realizing I should just take a break. I'd love a relationship. But I don't have the energy to force something with someone whom I don't belong with.

 I've definitely come up with many excuses and blamed society. Or dating apps or what ever else. But I do take responsibly for a lot of it. I could have met a few girls that I had chemistry with. But I just can't gather enough energy to meet them. 

I think it may be best for me to just sit back and not try so much. Let the process be more natural. And just meet people purely as friends.

It is hard when you're a man though. And your biology pressures you to find someone to have sex with. Which can often lead me down the wrong road seeking the wrong women for me. 

Any men out there relate to this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mydy1c/ive_lost_all_energy_for_dating/
86,mydy7t,1619374350,can you develop serious feelings if you havent developed them yet? (8months),"these are things i have (some time ago) experienced or wondered and now i am wondering what are other people thoughts.

1. If you haven’t fallen in love with someone in eight months in relationship, does it mean you won’t fall in love with them at all? I mean who is to say that there is a specific period of time in which you fall in love? some may fall in love in two months, some may fall in love in six months, some may fall in love right away. can you fall in love after eight months of not being in love? 

1.1. do you know right away if you want to be with that person for the rest of your life or are you in a relationship with them and only after a while you start to develop serious feelings or start to see the future with them?

2. if you have had thoughts of breaking up does it 100% mean the relationship won’t last? you like the person they like you, you respect each other, everything is okay but you have had thoughts of breaking up. not because you don’t like the person or they don’t like you or they treat you badly but because MAYBE it’s just a bad phase or you are not sure YET. 
(my answer to this is - NO it doesnt mean that but what are your thoughts?)

3. is having sex rarely a dealbreaker? let’s say you love the person so much, they are everything you have ever wanted in a person, you see a future with them, you want to have kids with them, you want to marry them BUT the only problem is - their sex drive is lower than yours. they think having sex once a week is enough but for you it’s not. what would you do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mydy7t/can_you_develop_serious_feelings_if_you_havent/
87,mye0of,1619374537,"The ""male reparations"" strategy - good idea or petty?","I (25F) have a friend who has an unfortunate history of getting used for sex by guys. She is very attractive, has a great personality, and doesn't give across an ""easy"" vibe, so logically speaking she should have no problems whatsoever. But for some reason almost every guy she has dated has ended things after they slept together. And no, it wasn't just ""top 10%"" guys, she's shown me pictures and some of these guys should have considered themselves lucky that she even glanced in their direction. I reckon it's just down to bad luck. 

Anyway, so we met up for drinks the other night and she told me that she has a new dating strategy which she calls ""male reparations"". Basically she'll go on dating apps and match with guys who appear wealthy, whether that be because of their job, outfits, or the locations or their pictures. She'll then send them a bunch of flirty messages to tease them and turn them on, and initiate a date. It's always somewhere fancy and expensive, but they agree to it because a) they can afford it, and b) the teasing leads them to think that the date will result in sex. She then shows up to the date dressed to the nines and looking amazing, and flirts with them hardcore, but won't kiss them or anything. Then after they've finished eating, she pretends that she needs to use ""the bathroom"", leaves, and blocks them on all platforms.

Her justification for doing this is that after years of being degraded and used for sex by men, and being made to feel like she was worthy of nothing other than her body, she wants them to know how horrible it feels. They lied to her, lead her on and used her to get what they wanted, so now she's doing the same to them. She says it's fair and a ""balancing of the scales"". She also said it makes her feel empowered and has helped her to gain her confidence back.

What are your thoughts on this? Personally I don't think it's that bad seeing as at least she's not putting anyone in danger. And if it makes her feel better about herself, after years of being made to feel worthless by men, then I'm in favour of that. I also think that seeing as so many men lie and manipulate women to get what they want, yet it's so normalised and they almost always get away with it, what's the problem with a woman doing a bit of manipulation to get something for herself for once? However, I can also see why people would be bothered by my friend's strategy, or think it's petty.

Also, if you're a woman who has been used for sex by men in the past, is this strategy something you would ever try yourself? Why/why not?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mye0of/the_male_reparations_strategy_good_idea_or_petty/
88,mye46r,1619374816,Was she interested and i blew it or was she just “being nice”,"
There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She would ask me what my weekend plans were/ i would ask her

She would also ask me what i was doing after work. She took a genuine interest in my life/school/ family. Would get excited when we had something in common

Very awkward and shy when she would first sit across from me. Only started the convo 40% of the time. Other times she would just sit there and look at me until i said something. Would always blush/smile. 

If my break was 15 minutes or so she wouldn’t leave until i got up and left. Seemed to genially enjoy talking to me. Applied the rule that if i were talking to another dude i would be uncomfterbal here with this type of silent behavior but seemingly just enjoying my presence. 

There is no way she is interested in me as she is a 9/10 in my eyes and im maybe a 3 at best. She is athletic i am not. 

I am genially friendly and a lot of people like to great me when they see me. Talk for 3-5 minutes. But usually don’t take breaks with them. When ever someone would great me i would try to include her in the convo as i know she is shy but she would only smile at look at them then get on her phone until i was done. Really cant figure this out. 

Seemed to get slightly annoyed if someone took my attention away from her. Or if she saw me talking to another cute girl on the sales floor she would turn around and flip her hair and i think intentionally made me see her walk away.  

Another thing i truly cant figure out is when i would be sitting down talking with her. On quite a few occasions she would speak so softly i couldn’t hear her and i would ask her to repeat herself 3-4 times until i would just go with it and act like i heard her. Really confused as to why she wouldn’t speak up. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i asked for her number and texted her the next day. We texted for about 2 days then i asked her on a date. She said she couldnt because of covid and a household family member had health issues. I took this as a rejection and told her i wouldnt talk to her anymore. She then said she really liked our relationship and i didnt have to do that. Why would she say relationship not friendship if she rejected me? I told her i would think about it and she insisted. We talked the next day at work like normal. That night i texted her saying i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. The next time i saw her she looked really sad and almost like she was about to cry. I felt really bad by cutting her off, i realized i should make amends and the next time i saw her i approached and she told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. Now when i see her she still looks sad and takes her breaks byherslef. I dont know what to do as i really enjoy taking to her. Any ideas on what went wrong? Also is there any way i can fix this as i really liked her and enjoyed talking to her. 

I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

To add on to this if she wasnt interested romantically but she liked me as a friend. Why wouldnt she tell me that instead of making up an excuse?

TL;DR she said she enjoyed our relationship now she wont speak to me. Whats the deal?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mye46r/was_she_interested_and_i_blew_it_or_was_she_just/

This is strictly unidirectional. He is not only making pauses to allow me to maybe ask him something, but even interrupts and continues with the next question if I am getting carried away. Then I apparently don't pass this interview at the question about my ""job experience"", which in this context is the longest relationship I have ever had. He suddenly remembers that he has to get up early tomorrow and after ""we'll let you know"" kinda phrase we end the call.

So for future I am planning not to waste my time, but stop this kind of conversation after the second question. Besides I am going to reply that my previous relationships history is not to be discussed with strangers. This is the second time I am experiencing this and I have even once got an advice to prepare the questions I want to ask myself.

95,myezgq,1619377273,Should I move on? (Long post sorry),"I know to get the best answer your gonna need some context on my situation. 

I’m 19 M and recently started dating this girl 18 F who I reconnected with through finding her on Instagram. Come to find out we knew each other back in elementary in like 3rd grade. This was about a month ago. Up until yesterday, everything has been perfect with us. We’ve been on multiple dates.. each one being better than the last.. the sex is great... she’s smart, beautiful everything I want in a girl. 

She’s been to my house a couple of times even though I stay with my parents because my room is downstairs by the front door and my parents stay up stairs for the most part so it’s easy to sneak around. Never got caught. Since we first started dating, she would always come back to my house and I’d take her home around 3 am but she spent the night once or twice. This is when things started to go left. 

She stayed at my house for 2 days so we could spend time together because I was leaving to go to Florida for a week. I asked her would her mom be ok with that and she said she told her mom she was gonna be at her sisters house so everything was good don’t worry

I called her before I got on the road to let her know I was leaving and she sounded like she had just finished crying but wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. I came back yesterday and after I text her letting her know I was back home she text me... 

“Um I just need to tell u that this ain’t going to work. When u called before u left I was just getting kicked out.

Idk how but my mom figured out I was spending the night with u. She also was even more made bc it was piled on how late I was coming home.”

She also said she didn’t want to be with  someone her family  didn’t like.

I called her to figure out what was going on and she tells me she’s staying with her cousins and her mom thinks she’s going down the wrong road because her grandma had her mom she was 16 and her cousin just got pregnant so basically their projecting their fears onto her and I told her that’s not right.

She told me she’s not mad at me at all and even took accountability for being the reason she got kicked out since she was lying to her mom and betrayed her trust.. and that she needs time to figure out how to get back home and being with me right now isn’t gonna help. 

I’m moving out next week into my own apartment so I want to tell her if all else fails she could stay with me until she gets her situation straight with her mom... but I don’t know how to feel anymore since she said she doesn’t wanna be with someone her mom doesn’t like... because I don’t think like that.. I stopped depending on my mom YEARS ago. 

With all that being said, should I wait it out and see how everything plays out or just move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myezgq/should_i_move_on_long_post_sorry/
96,myf4m9,1619377671,GF (25) mad that I (27 M) asked her to pay her share?,"TLDR: I make way more than GF + pay for everything, how do I help her not feel bad when we do things she has a hard time affording?


Been having a blast dating this girl for ~3 months.


I make pretty much 10x what she does (+ she's also in an industry hit hard by covid) so I've pretty much been paying for everything. (Neither of our family is rich, but I at least make a lot of money)


She offers to pay for stuff sometimes (or sth like get dessert after a nice meal) but I insist on paying, especially if it's a nice restaurant or sth I suggest that I know she has a hard time affording.


She always matches my unpredictable work schedule and spends time / effort coming to my place so in my mind, she contributes just as much to the relationship overall.


Recently we did some semi-expensive water sports activity which she enjoys doing. Because she had to pay (it was through her friend), I paid her back - but only for MY share of the activity (I separately covered the transportation + lunch).


I figured it's sth she has done multiple times in the past, so it's sth she's comfortable paying for herself. Also she suggested it.


She seemed a little distant / clearly upset after that and I felt sth was off.


I tried multiple times to ask her what's up but she wouldn't say. Then before going to bed, she suddenly pays me for half of a 5-star staycation we did the night before (though she was the one who wanted to go, I paid and was happy to cover the expenses, given I know it's quite expensive for her).


The coincidental timing of this + her actions after paying her back only my share makes me think she has some issue with either (1) me only paying her back my share, or (2) being sad/upset/guilty that she can't contribute or the disparity between.


If it's #1, then that would be hugely disappointing and may be a dealbreaker for me. (I don't mind paying for everything - but I don't think that means it should be taken for granted).


If #2, how do you overcome this type of pay disparity? I'd hate for her to feel guilty or sad everytime we do sth nice that she can't afford herself... Also don't wanna wreck her pride or make her feel inferior...
