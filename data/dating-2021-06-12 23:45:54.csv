0,nyp8b2,1623560804,How can i get my boyfriend to do a STD test?,"I’m a virgin and my boyfriend is sexually active. he told me he’s lost count over how many girls he had sex with. I brought up std’s to him and he assured me he has always used condoms and that he is perfectly healthy but has never done an std test in his life. 

this worries me because i am very paranoid about std’s and havent had sex with him yet mostly for that reason. We have had penis-vagina contact as in the tip touching me there but nothing more than that.  

So my question is… how can i get him to do a test without offending him? he is a very understanding person but i feel scared to actually tell him to get a test before we have sex.

I typically approach men in their 40’s. I just got out of a 3 year relationship and my martial arts teacher has recently caught my attention. But I’ve lost my stuff. Completely. I forget how to flirt. And this guy is a weird one. I tried to flirt with him once and his lack of a reaction startled me and I backed way off. I pretty much ignore him in class now because I can’t handle the thought of being told no. I know I’m going to go for it again. But men usually reciprocate right away with me. He’s weird… he used to look at me a lot and then I tried to flirt and he stopped completely. He goes out of his way to pick other girls for the sake of demonstration (really ugly girls that have a lot of extra weight, acne, and sweat A FUCK TON) instead of me. But I also think he knows how uncomfortable I get when he touches me. (It’s a martial arts class. Lots of rolling around on the floor) I can’t hide it. I’m so confused.

He truly is an amazing guy, but we are much better off as friends than as partners, and there are no romantic feelings from either side. I started dating another guy in late December and had an on-and-off relationship with him until May. He did all the flirting, so the last time I actually flirted with someone was when I was about 16. Initially, I genuinely thought he was ""the one"" because of how well we connected, but he cheated throughout the entire relationship and treated me quite poorly. Because of how long I have been taken, I don't really know how to flirt, and my last relationship has made me quite scared of getting hurt again. I am currently working on overcoming that fear, and I would like to ""put myself out there"" but I don't even know how.

I will keep it short.
J (33 M Korean) and I (26 F Black) hit it off really well on a dating app and started talking off the app. When we would text he would always refer to me as his “ebony princess” or his “chocolate queen” and it kind of bothered me at first but not enough to speak on it to him. 
We finally went out on a date and it went really well! We kissed and enjoyed each other’s company. While we were eating, it was quiet for a second and he goes “I never dated a black girl before” and laughs. I didn’t laugh but said “and I’ve never dated a Korean guy” 
He laughs it off and we move into a different topic, but something is making me a little uneasy. I don’t want to be an experiment for this guy.

Tomorrow I’ve got a third date planned with a guy who I’ve got on quite well so far and our texting has been really nice. 

We are both stoners so this is one of few things we have in common. Usually when we text we text and either until we go to sleep and say goodnight or at least acknowledge the last text, especially when it’s textable. 

I messaged him about picking up, he replied, he asked me if I tried it yet and I said I’m about to roll one and go for a walk before bed. This was 10pm last night. I kind of thought he would reply, he usually does and say something have a good smoke or something. But instead nothing. 

I actually felt a bit shit so I put my phone on airplane mode as I didn’t want the temptation to check my phone at night. Woke up an hour ago and all I had was texts from my sister. I genuinely feel shit and stupid right now with a bit of anxiety. 

Every time I feel a guys texting game change it’s never a good sign, it’s one of my red flags, when start to feel anxious about things I really shouldn’t. (I’ve only ever been in toxic relationships and I’m used to terrible texting game which now when something is slight off I feel shit).

I don’t know, we were telling each other goodnight the other day to just silence last night. So it’s a bit of a kick.

Hope your day is going well. 

There’s this guy I have been going on runs with now for a while. I’m not sure he enjoys running but I think he goes with me so we can spend some time together. 

He asked me out (like for lunch/dinner) twice last summer but I said no both times. Not because I don’t like him, but because he lied to me about this age the first time around (I’m 24 and he’s 19) and just in general, I don’t think he’s sincere. Anyways, I told him then that we should just stay friends because I didn’t feel that he was being genuine with me. Also, nothing happened physically (we’re both Muslim) so we don’t have that intimate connection or whatever you want to call it.

Now that it’s warm out again, he joins me on my runs like twice a week. We have each other on social media but the last time we talked was on my birthday last year. Now how do we go running without communicating? Well I sort of have a fixed schedule and he joins me on the track whenever. So again, I thought to myself, he hasn’t changed and he’s not sincere. I mean, he doesn’t even talk to me on social media! Therefore, I didn’t think anything of it. I thought, “If he wants to join me in getting some exercise, it’s whatever, it’s cool”. But recently he’s been acting weird by being touchy and saying stuff like he’s a changed man. 

I feel like he’s playing games with me again, so after some thought, I told him last week that we’re still just friends and nothing has changed. And so now I was just on ig and he unfollowed me. I’m just wondering why he’d do that? Why do guys in general unfollow? Is this a part of these games some guys play or whatever? Or did I actually hurt him?

36,nysrsg,1623576822,I probably had the most frustrating date ever.,"I've had been talking to this girl through Tinder and that went over to Whatsapp quite fast. We've been talking constantly for about 3-4 months, Had a lot of fun. Actually had the feeling that it was going somewhere. We decided to go on ''date'' due to corona the restaurants and movies were closed. So i decided we can make it a Home date. (Just to add onto it, She never had been at my home and she and I only seen each other once before for a very short time. But i thought i knew her quite well)  


So I had been cooking, dinner literally for over an hour just to make it feel like we were actually ''out'' and I just said ''I hope you like it, I tried my best'' She had 3 or 4 bites and she said ''Nope, I'm not eating that, Doesn't taste good'' I was incredibly ashamed at that point and was just already like ''Wtf am i supposed to do now'' going forward I had the movie started, which we BOTH chose and were like... This seems like a good movie.. I had some snacks ready, chips and just soda's... Kinda the normal stuff to enjoy off the side.. 10-20 minutes pass... Bowl empty, we're talking about 200-300g of chips just gone... I'm a big eater too and I don't really care, but I was kinda already in a pissy mood after that first comment... Then she decided to just decide for herself and quite literally RAID my supply closet with snacks that i keep for any occassion... WITHOUT ASKING. I'm quite the guy that just goes straight for it... and asked in a subtle way ''Don't take everything please, I'd still like some'' She just smiled and took a second bowl and put in new chips in it and gave it to me and said ''Now we don't have to share!'' SHE DECIDED THAT WE WOULDNT HAVE TO SHARE MY FOOD/SNACKS. The movie was still going on and i was just trying to focus on it at this point. 3/4 movie is almost done (This is 2 hours later). She goes ''Hm I don't like it we should watch something else'' just takes the remote and changes to a different movie... I was just literally baffled... sitting in silence thinking ''She will be gone after this movie, just chill'' Nothing really much happens other than that i got annoyed by chewing sounds (I have mysophony, I'm extremely sensitive to chewing, pen scribbling etc..) The movie was over i closed the Netflix and the moment i closed it .... ''Well that movie sucked too, but i guess it was fun...''  


I was at my limits at this point, but i champed through... It was 12:00pm and she goes... ''Oh shoot, I have a problem'' Her bus... was cancelled and was only going to be driving again at 6am... And she had to STAY IN MY HOME TO SLEEP OVER AND IM THE IDIOT THAT LETS HER BECAUSE I AM SOMETIMES TO NICE AND I HATE IT.   


Also when she was going to sleep over. Instantly hid my expensive stuff in my room where i was sleeping. (Nintendo Switch, Console, Phones etc) My mindset was literally ''She can sleep here, but im not going to be robbed tonight'' Everything set, I gave her a blanket and some pillows on my couch (Yes, she looked very disappointed, when i didn't invite her to my bed. zero emotion on my face)  


The night goes past, I wake up. She's still there (Yay). Made eggs, She ate like 4-5 eggs and then also complained that my eggs sucked. (Cherry on top y'all) Walked her to the bus stop, SHE WENT IN FOR A KISS and just straight up shaked her hand and said a bit too loud.. 'Let's never see each other again'' and made a U-turn and walked back home...

37,nysv24,1623577233,"Not sure what to think, or where to go.","I M24 have been seeing a girl F27.

We met through a dating app.

Since I am going to travel abroad for 6 months in 2 months, we agreed to not commit to anything and just see where it goes.

We text all the time for about a week, and because of the good chemistry decide to meet up anyways.

We have a good time, go for a walk and get some beers, we end up sitting on a hill just talking till it got late. Unfortunately she wasn't wearing enough clothes, so she got cold by the end of the night. I offered her my jacket and she was happy with that.

5 minutes after we departed, she texted she was very happy that she met, and she felt like she could really be herself around me. She suggests right ahead that we meet again the upcoming weekend and watch a good movie together.  
Feeling good chemistry, I was of course very excited.

But because of the cold weather and too little clothes, she got sick the day after.  
Running nose, fever, headache.  
Because of that, she could not meet in the weekend.

Because of that, everything started to go wrong.

We keep texting all the time while she is sick, things get more flirtatious.  
She says things like she wants me to cuddle and massage me.  
I of course enjoy that, and I flirt back.  
She was starting to feel better.

Saturday evening, still sick and alone, she watched a movie I suggested her.  
She texts me that it would be nice if I was there.  
Hearing that, I of course want to come over.  
She says her place is a mess, and she looks like a mess.  
I was okay with that, and said I could just come over anyways if it was okay for her.  
She says she didn't want me to get sick either, but didn't say I shouldn't come over.  
I tell her that I can just keep good distance.

I get in doubt if she does not want me to come over, and is trying to say it in a polite way.  
So to clarify that, I text: I can be at your place in 10m.  
She then clearly told me off, which was good -

But that was not good.

I made her feel pressured and angry. She felt as though I was disrespecting her boundaries. She even used the infamous words ""me too"". I was very sad and offended, and I have never felt so misunderstood.

I of course tried to explain my intentions and emotions, apologized deeply.  
Later she apologized too, and said it wasn't only my fault. 

I was relieved, but something still felt off.

Things go back to normal for a while.  
We keep texting all the time, pretty much non-stop other than when I am at work or do other stuff in my life. She is there all the time.

One day she texts me:  
""It is always so nice with new friends ;) Like you and I! I think it is so hard to find new friends in my adult life. It was so much easier when I was young"" 

Still being frustrated about the previous misunderstanding, because she used the word ""friends"" made me feel as though I wasn't a potential date anymore. This was a quick judgement in my head, and of course I should have just let this by. But out of frustration, I try to look for confirmation.

I ask her:

""I felt a bit special when you mentioned new friend, not that I disagree, but did we entirely close the dating doors? Mine are still open. As you know I think you are kind and understanding. Should we want to go in the direction one day.""

She replies:

* I think it is bad to go in that direction as of now.
* You are going abroad in 2 months for 6 months, and there might be other girls there.
* I want to keep my dating position open because of personal things in my life right now.
* I don't want to mix you into that, because I don't want to lose you as a friend or hurt you.

I tell her:

* I tell I respect her decision
* I'm glad she is honest
* I acknowledge what she says
* I explain what I like about her
* I tell I feel as though it is worth the risk of getting hurt for me

We both get tired and agree to continue talking another day.

The next day she seemed much more gone than usually.  
She would take longer to respond, for sure not her usual mood.  
She started acting weird. 

I asked her if she was okay.  
She said she was.

That evening she sends me pictures and cute texts as usual, we end day well.  
Something still seemed very off.  
I could not tell what it was, but I knew it had to do with the dating situation.

The day after she doesn't respond to my texts, which is very unusual, till the evening.  
She then tells me that she is not romantically interested in me, and asked what I thought about that.

I get a bit frustrated, and start to think twice. 

Out of despair I tell her that we should stop texting for a while, and it would be hard to be friends since I saw her as a potential romantic partner.

""Since we texted so much this felt very online to me, and not so real. I don't have romantic intentions for you right now either. But maybe it can develop in the future, we have only met once and I felt good chemistry."" I say.

She gets mad and tells that I try to manipulate her emotions. She misunderstands my texts once again, as though I am trying to pressure her into something she doesn't want to, just as the situation earlier, where I thought she wanted me to come by.

We text a lot that day, and I find out that she had a very abusive ex boyfriend.  
He crossed her boundaries and pressured her into doing things she didn't want to, told her lies, really manipulated her to fill that void.  
She has physical wounds from her past relationship.  
She tells me she has PTSD from that and is undergoing therapy.

She says, as soon as she feels pressured or thinks someone can cross her boundaries, she responds with strong self defense. She is aware, and is actively working with the therapist to solve this problem. I also open up to her about some of my mental issues. 

She says she was hoping that I would stick to her as a friend, and clarifies again that she doesn't have romantic feelings for me, but she sees a lot of herself in me.   
She texts I am a really wonderful, unique and creative person.  
And that she really, really likes me and appreciates me.

I feel as though I have accidentally pushed this relationship way too fast.  
Of course she is a special case, because she has PTSD with especially boundary violation, so I am not sure if I could have done much different. But now I at least know what I can do to make her feel more safe around me.   
We only met once, and the illusion of so many texts made me forget that.  
I did not know her boundaries, and I unintentionally violated them.

When she earlier mentioned that I was a good friend, I should just have been happy and acknowledged what we were, instead of trying to get a confirmation for potential future romance.  
We were starting to grow as friends.  
That can also be a good thing.  
Especially when I am going abroad soon.

I regret texting her that I would not want a friendship.  
I get back to her, and tell her that I am open for that.  
I have patience.

She once again claims that I am trying to change her emotions, and manipulate her.

I call her, but she doesn't pick up. She texts that she doesn't want to talk, she says there is no need for me to call.

Since I feel misunderstood and felt like that was her anxiety responding, I write her a long ass text message explaining everything, in hopes to clear up everything:

* My true intentions
* Why I acted how I did, and how I felt
* My desire to respect her emotions
* What I like about her
* How I am okay with her to do what she wants, no matter what that is (respecting my own boundaries, of course)

She opens up a lot more, and is willing to talk again.  
She suggested that we take a break, and I agreed.

I ask her if she wants to initiate again, when she feels ready.  
She was up for that, but also used the word 'maybe'.

Now here I am, a bit confused and waiting for her to get back to me.  
Whatever happens I just hope I have cleared it all up.

I sensed a unique chemistry, and I do miss her.  
She seemed good for me, until she starting to think I was trying to violate her.  
I feel as though it is repairable, but I am not sure. Maybe a long shot.

I am afraid that while we have our break, she will jump to her old conclusions about me being evil, when it is in fact one big misunderstanding.

In all cases, I have a good life, and of course I will meet someone else if it is not going to be her. And I have good chances of meeting someone interesting going abroad - But I do want to make an effort for the people I appreciate, and sense potential with.

I have a feeling that she does actually like me romantically, and is keeping to herself to protect her from the ""evil"" me, and that she in fact does want something like that later down the line, if she senses I can respect her.  
I will respect her choice regardless, and don't want to push her. New friends are always good in any case. 

If she just didn't get sick, things would have been a million times easier.

I predict that she will get back to me in a few weeks, saying that she has changed her mind and does not want to meet up, because of her personal issues. I predict it will be goodbye, but I also have hopes. 

Any thoughts appreciated on this, whatever is on your mind.  
What do you think the chances for this relationship to grow is?   
How does this all sound to you?

I am in doubt if I should pop by once in a while, send her a text or a picture, just to let her know I am alive and my intentions are good, while we have our break - or if I should really let her have space, leave her by, and wait till she possibly comes back to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nysv24/not_sure_what_to_think_or_where_to_go/
38,nysvji,1623577295,"20M, zero dating experience, no idea how to even approach it","20M, zero dating experience, no idea where to even begin

Yeah, so I'm a 20 year old guy with no dating experience. Unless you count that time a girl asked me out sophomore year of high school and I fucked it up, I have basically zero experience w/ talking to women. Never asked a girl out, never had any female friends growing up, just honestly have very little experience w/ talking to women in general.

I mean, at my old job a few years ago, there was my coworker, me and her got along pretty well, but I was only at that job for a couple of months. All my other jobs I've done have been either entirely men (construction), or just me solo (DoorDash). Zero romantic relationships.

Ngl, I'm kinda worried that my complete lack of experience will be extremely noticeable and off-putting to women.

I'm a fairly good looking guy I'd say. Not trying to blow smoke up my ass, I'm not a model or anything, but I'm 6'4, have good facial features, etc. I'm not insecure about my appearance  is what I'm trying to say, I'm happy with how I look.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as for why I haven't tried dating or anything. Its relatively complicated, but I'll try to summarize it. During high school, I was very socially awkward, and had low self esteem. I had really good friends, but my depression caused me to shut myself away from people. Its hard bringing all this back up, but in essence, my mental health in high school was mad fucked.

Its gotten better since HS, but I still haven't had much interest in dating until recently. I think its because I still live at home, and I don't really wanna date while living at home as an adult. But I think I'll be moving out on my own sometime this year, so once I do that, I want to try dating.

Basically, all of this is completely foreign to me. So once I move out, does anyone have any advice on how I should approach dating? Do I just go with my gut and just jump in there? Or should I take caution and approach it a certain way?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nysvji/20m_zero_dating_experience_no_idea_how_to_even/

On a smaller level, family and friends can also be an influence. Social media and its emergent effects can also be a huge influence (e.g. the rise of IG/TikTok girls).

It is quite obvious that what people find attractive changes over time and is influenced by culture to some degree.

What should I do for i am hopeless and done.","Idk why i am even putting this up here but i just don't know what I am anymore and I'm losing my shit. Last year around i believe July I (M19) started texting this girl (17). We are both dealing with pretty bad  mental health issues and helped each other a lot. Lots and lots of time I've put into this, so much it has cost me a lot of  hours i should be spending in school and sleeping but i didn't care because I wanted this to work out so much. We both are pretty alternative people with extreme ideas/music taste/appearance/  outlook on life. Finding a click with someone was impossible for me but finally i really clicked with someone and I couldn't believe it. I've never felt this way before and my depression got a lot better because I finally had something good and something to look forward too in this miserable life. we talked so much and called and video called as well. Things weren't always as stable especially from her side but I wanted to help her because I knew the shit she was dealing with was really awful and i wanted her Future to be better and to be a part of that as well. A few days ago i already noticed she was feeling worse and i asked about it ofcourse but she said no worries. I wanted to trust her but i knew she wasn't okay. She already told me her feelings for me were like a graph on steroids. She started out crushing on me then loved me then it was stable, then it slowly went down and up, and down and up again. But at the end we had a click Wich was magical at least for me and i think for her too. The problem is there was a sea between us, the distance wasn't that long and the tickets affordable enough, but COVID said no. I couldn't go to her because of the rules of her country. and i didn't have the time to stay so long in quarantine because of my job. So I never saw her in real life Wich breaks me even more. So a few days ago she suddenly blocked me on all forms of communication we had. Wich i still don't understand because we had a great talk the same afternoon. I haven't heard from her since and tried to make another Instagram account to reach her but she blocked that too. She blocked my number, whatsapp, Instagram and discord.
The one thing I had in my life to look forward to and to give me tremendous support is now gone, and just like before I met her, the negative thoughts are taking over my life again and I'm feeling hopeless, depressed and suicidal again. I don't think I'll ever find someone else again, i look like shit and i am so incredibly short for a guy. I have a lot of issues mentally and I'm always so fucking tired. Should I wait for her to answer me again? It wasn't just a hookup, it was a really long engaging thing we had together Wich was amazing for both me and her. Maybe her depression took over and she has killed herself, maybe she has found someone else better then this useless bag of shit, maybe she has just lost feelings.

That is also partly my own doing from my own relationship history where lots of sex in the beginning seemed to contribute to the downfall of those relationships, which I understand it isn't fair to assume that would happen in this instance. I'm looking for advice on what to do. I know there's really no proper way to do things as anything would hurt her feelings. I would prefer that she and I avoid a confrontation.

Some of the doubts are the following:

\- She still speaks with her ex. I'm not sure how frequently but enough to receive money from him to help pay for her bills

\- Speaking of bills, she's horrible with managing money and hasn't been able to have her phone on because of it (currently relies on wifi for it). She regularly asks her roommate to cover the rent and tells him he'll pay him back. But apparently that's been going on a long time.

\- A little more about money. When we've gone to dinner and I've driven us, she leaves her purse in the car and says that she doesn't need it. I always pay, which I'm fine doing, but its just frustrating to hear her say it like that.

\- When I've complained about some things my family has done she seriously suggests I don't ever see them again. I don't misunderstand that, I ask her if she meant to say that and she repeats that as though she's very serious. I'm close to my family, and yes they annoy me sometimes, but I'm not willing to not see them for a long time.

\- She has described her emotional issues and to me it sounds like she needs a lot of work for herself, which I completely understand and am actually doing for myself. However, I don't feel prepared for the level of support she's needing at this time. Such as half of the year she's suicidal, has deep emotional issues with her parents-especially her mom, and so on. 

\- Possibly due to her depression and maybe her current living situation but she describes her place as very messy and refuses to let me come over. She's not hiding anything as far as I'm aware, she just says its so dirty.

\- She told me she cheated on her ex. I have been in a relationship where someone cheated on their ex/exes and they wound up cheating on me despite never saying they would. I know, again, that's not fair to assume would happen again but seems to be the unfortunate way things go for me.

\- She has a kid personality. That's a wrong description, but basically she sometimes has a child-like personality surface that talks differently (higher pitched voice, for instance) and wants to do kid-like things, such as go to events for little kids so she can explore that kid personality. That's cool she wants to do that, and I'm not judging in a negative way, but in a past relationship that person claimed to have something very similar and it was so extreme that she eventually pushed me away. I'm just feeling the affects of that again, the bad memories of it, and I'll never ask her to change but its just difficult to hear again if that makes sense.

\- I love sex as much as the next person, but I keep finding myself avoid it with her. For me I get too emotionally entangled when sex happens and from the dates I've had with her and her personality I just don't feel its right to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nyxhit/im_34m_having_serious_doubts_about_going_further/
64,nyxibc,1623594585,Look for someone with similar values,"

For long-lasting love, the more similarity (e.g., age, education, values, personality, hobbies), the better. Partners should be especially sure that their values match before getting into marriage.

Although other differences can be accommodated and tolerated, a difference in values is particularly problematic if the goal is long-lasting love.

Another secret for a long marriage: Both partners need to commit to making it work, no matter what. The only thing that can break up a relationship are the partners themselves.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nyxibc/look_for_someone_with_similar_values/
65,nyxid6,1623594589,Sexual pressure on men happens and it sucks,"So we all now by now that despite all the societal norms being torn down one by one there's still some areas where people seem pretty content with the norms that have been there since forever. Dating would be one of them as most women just wait for the guy to make the move and if he doesn't then he's often considered weak or unconfident. (Even though she's most likely terrified at the thought of being rejected herself) 

I've always been someone that struggles with anxiety as well as a rape victim, needless to say these things don't exactly help with the whole confidence thing. I can't just walk up to someone and lean in for a kiss after our date, and because of that it'll ruin her image of me even though she has no clue what I've been through. 

I don't play guessing games, I'm not about to whip out a coin and call heads or tails before going for the kill. I can't have sex on the first date because my heart will literally explode in my chest. 

But it doesn't matter because all they see is weakness, or they'll think I'm gay or something stupid like that. It sucks because I'm not allowed be human, I have to be perfect and make the best impression according to what SHE wants. 

If a guy makes a move on a girl and gets turned down he might think ""Oh she's a prude/frigid"" and move on. 

When the opposite happens it's usually followed by comments attacking his manliness or self worth. God forbid you bruise her ego! 

People always talk about not putting pressure on women but forget it can happen the other way around too. When it does it's about how he wasn't a man enough or all the focus is on how he lost an opportunity, he should consider himself lucky, blah blah blah.

I hadn’t been sure if he was interested since he had never asked but he was down and we met up last night. When we did he said he hadn’t been sure if I was interested since our messages were so slow. 

It was really good overall, I’m definitely attracted to him and the conversation flowed easily for the most part and we hung out for about 3 hours. He’s going out of town on Thursday but said we should do something when he gets back so it seems like he’s at least down to get together again.

74,nyyr7k,1623598125,Moving too fast or over-thinking? F(23) with 0 self confidence,"Hey all, I F(23), need some friendly dating advice. For the last 4 months, my good friend has been talking to me about one of her best guy friends with who she thinks I would really get along with. So last week, she invites me to a camping trip, to which the guy friend is invited too. We meet and end up getting along very well (similar careers and interests). 

The backstory to my dating history: literally non-existent. Have never had a boyfriend or someone who showed proper interest/care in me. 

Anyway, I ended up getting quite drunk on the trip and ended up kissing him. It was during this moment that he mentioned he was in it for the long haul. He also mentioned during our make-out session that he never feels ""jealous"" but was sad that I was getting a lot of male attention from the other guys we were hanging out with. 

I think my friend gave him the idea I was fully ready for a relationship (I have been on my own for SO long that I struggle with picturing someone else in my life immediately), so this has not sat with me very well as I think she gave him an altered impression of my character. 

We stayed close during the rest of the trip and ended up catching up 2 days after we got back. Since the trip, he has also messaged me every day with good morning and goodnight messages. 

The first time we caught up (5 days ago now) was really nice. We talked the whole time and I felt very comfortable and safe with him. He then came over to mine 2 nights ago and we ended up sleeping together. 

He shows A LOT of interest in me and I don't know whether this interest is too intense, or I'm overthinking it because I have never had any guy be this nice or forward before. He has been talking about us doing things in the future together such as traveling. 

Should I be wary and ask him to slow things down since it's been only a week? I admit I probably should not have slept with him but it felt right at the time. 

I do like him, I just don't have the intense feeling he has for me just yet. Am I being too cautious about this? Or does love not need a timeframe? 

I have told him I can't see him for another week until our camping group goes away again next weekend. He has also asked that I drive down to the camping spot with him and suggested we share a tent. 

I want to do this but am afraid I am rushing this (could end in heartbreak). I have 0 self worth at the moment so I am finding it really hard to convince myself to enjoy his interest in me.

I’ve been seeing this girl (who I really friggin like) for the past couple months. However, last week, we had sex for the second time, and since she was on the nuvaring, she figured that the pullout method would be safe. So, I urinated beforehand to ensure that precum would be out of the picture when it came to sperm content, and then we had sex. Halfway through, I had to use the bathroom (like a release the kraken type of piss), and her blood sugar was getting low (I thought these circumstances were hilarious tbch) so I didn’t even come (heh) close to ejaculating in her. We just kinda did what we had to do and went to bed.

Two days after we had sex, she gets her period, all is well, but her period has been SUPER heavy for the past seven/eight days, and last night she experienced some pretty heavy clotting. Now, the rational side of me says that even if there was sperm in her system, between Aunt Flow and her nuvaring, there are definitely no survivors in that joint. But part of me feels off for whatever reason, like for SOME unearthly reason she might be pregnant. While I do really like this girl, I’m not trying to have a child with somebody I’ve been dating for two months. And to top it off? We’re both 21. Definitely not into the paranoia that comes with sex w/o a condom. She says all is well, but I’m still overthinking. So, can somebody offer me any sort of reassurance here?

Hi Reddit,

So basically I have two friends let's label them as friend A and friend B. For a little context, I am very close to friend A she is one of my best friends, while friend B is just a friend that I will hang out with during a group hangout, we'll go to his house and stuff but that's about it not that many one-on-one deep talks.

As of right now Friend A and B are in the talking stages... they hang out and do ""cute"" stuff. Now over the weekend, I found out that in friend A's past relationship she was cheated on (the guy was unloyal, he never had sex with another girl but made out with another girl at a party and did other sexual activities). I felt really sad hearing this because she is honestly such a wonderful person and doesn't deserve this. When she told me that I remember hearing that Friend B also CHEATED on his recent ex-girlfriend when he was away for a vacation with a girl (same thing made out, no sex I think).

After hearing that I asked her... ""Would you ever date someone who's had a cheating past?"" Just to see if she would care if someone had a muddy past in their past relationships. She said something along the lines of ""No, likely not. It's pretty easy not to cheat"". Now I am here thinking do I have any right to tell her OR to tell her to ask him about his past, or should I just mind my own business. Now you might say... ""Well, I am sure he'll tell her if he gets asked about it"", knowing this person I don't think he would, to be put it directly this guy really gives me fuck boy vibes so I am sorry if I don't give him the benefit of the doubt when he's already shown that he has poor morals.

So what do I do guys? Hint at it to her or just not say anything.

She's absolutely beautiful, kind, smart and I think I fell a little bit too fast lol. Haven't dated in the last 2 years so I got a little bit rusty..

Anyways, the first date went really good, she lives like 1.5 hour away from me but I have a car so no problems for me.

When we arrived I already noticed her body language and she was clearly nervous and told me that ""hugging is awkward"". I decided to kiss her on the cheek which turned to a kiss on the head more like..

I thought to myself while driving home that I majorly fucked up and I should not have went in for a kiss  but then I got home and I noticed a text from her. She wanted to know when I get home and she also said that she enjoyed spending the day with me. It actually felt like a second chance for me, I was so happy. 

After a week a second date comes, I go to her city and we have a beer, after that we went for a walk around the forest, she loves nature. It was amazing, I felt the same way as I felt like on our first date. I have no idea why but I didn't compliment her at all and I felt so dissapointed in myself because of that. 
After our date she gave me a big hug which meant a lot to me. 

I learned after our first date and I was looking for more cues so I know better on what to initiate. We had an amazing 4 hour date and I asked her out for a 3rd date, she likes traveling so I will take her around a nice national park. She accepted without hesitation and I could hear the excitement in her voice. 

She is a very busy person, I am as well cause I work a lot. 

She is such an amazing person, absolutely gorgeous, very understanding and kind. I really don't want to fuck this up. 

She has her birthday next week and I am not sure how to proceed, should I just call her on her birthday? She did not mention anything that we could do together on her birthday so I thought she has other plans, which is absolutely fine.

If all goes well our next date will be on next sunday. She doesn't text a lot, but I know that's normal so I don't worry about it. I love spending my time with her.

I was really thinking about taking it a bit further on our 3rd date. I really want to get physical and be more romantic with her. I just want to show her that I'm really interested. 

I honestly think that she is just as nervous as I am.

94,nz1nps,1623606133,Maybe I’m Better Off Being Alone,"I’ve gone my whole life without having any romance. I’m 27 and have only had 1 relationship that lasted 2 months (at 25 y/o) and it was 2 of the worst months of my life. I don’t have close family, I have a few friends. 

I grew up very alone with very judge mental and bullying parents and older brother, and always got rejected by girls who I asked out even when I was told they liked me. With time, I hardened, became counter dependent and it left me pretty much unable to let my guard down despite years of intensive therapy.

Part of me feels like I’m better off just being alone, since I don’t really live any other way. I’m in harm reduction and addiction medicine, so my rationale is that I would contribute as much as I can to the world not by relationships/dating/marriage/friends and family, but by working as much as I possibly can. 

Thanks for letting me rant y’all, hope you’re having a good weekend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nz1nps/maybe_im_better_off_being_alone/

We only been on one date but we would text almost every day and sometimes she would text first or I would text first to start a conversation. However lately it seems like I have to text her first to start a conversation, and they seem kinda dry. How dodo I go about asking her if she is truly instested in me so that I don't waste any more time.

99,nz2c7j,1623608052,"Should i stop talking to guy I still dont feel attracted to after 2 weeks of online talking, or let the attraction grow?","Weve been speaking for 2 weeks and havent met in person yet. He is interesting, adventurous and we have stimulating conversations. He is handsome but for some reason I cant get myself to feel sexually attracted to him. I just dont feel any sortof... desire. I have a very specific type that instantly gets me attracted (tall, more tan skin, beard, etc) but I spoke to a guy once who didnt fit those very narrow criteria and attraction grew after 3 months of friendship. Is it okay to give it a shot and wait it out in the hopes that I develop attraction for him when we meet, or should I just call it off? He is planning to come visit me in my city in about a month. Im scared I wont grow attraction to him by then and just make him waste his time. Im speaking to another guy who fits that “specific type”, and I feel very attracted to him just looking at his photos, but he doesnt seem as interesting as the other guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nz2c7j/should_i_stop_talking_to_guy_i_still_dont_feel/
