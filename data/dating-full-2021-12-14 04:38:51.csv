I’ll call him N to be on the safe side. There’s a very obvious age gap. I’ve talked to friends and a close coworker about and no one really thinks it matters, but I’m worried cause when I was 17 I dated someone someone who was 19, and the 2 year gap alone created a weird dynamic in the relationship(granted, it was mainly cause that’s what he wanted to happen). 

I’ve work at an assisted living home since mid October. I mainly got the job because my mom works in the business office. They put me to work in the kitchen as a server/dietary aid. The first 2 weeks I worked there N was out sick. I heard the head cook, my boss, talk about about how much he values him. And the residents and my coworkers say plenty of racist remarks towards him. When I met him I didn’t really pay him much attention. He was helpful, hardworking, and we got out of work early when he was cooking so I liked working with him. 

One day everything just kinda clicked. He made some joke about a broken coffee pot but I barely remember it cause I caught myself just admiring him. I barely even knew what he looked like cause I’d never seen him without a mask on, but those eyes. 

We struggle with understanding each other sometimes. He has a very thick accent and most of my coworkers either brush him off or just pretend to understand him. Just nod until he stops talking. It makes me so mad. I feel horrible every time I ask him to repeat something, but it’s only cause I want to know for sure. He gets annoyed occasionally, which can be hurtful. But I understand. It must be annoying to not be understood. 

Enough of the fluff, I am at a bit of a tough point cause I want to ask him out but am unsure if I should, or how to do it. He is my supervisor. He’s older. He’s never expressed an interest in anyone to my other coworker’s understanding. I’m not sure if he even wants to date at all, so why me when I’m so young? Should I shoot my shot just to stop thinking about?

If I do ask him out, how do I go about it in a way that’s not only clear about my intentions, but it’s not so forward that working with N would be awkward?

I am a 30 year old male, and I went to a Christmas party with co-workers last weekend. I saw my crush there, and things were going really well, until they weren’t. Let’s call her Jane.

I have had a crush on this woman (26F) since I met her at a Thanksgiving party a few weeks ago. We got to taking at the end of the night and hit it off. She even told me the nickname that her mom calls her. I missed the chance to ask for her number, was a little bummed about it, but decided it wasn’t that big of deal. She was just some girl I met at a party.

Then, I saw her again at a Christmas party this weekend. I played it cool and spoke with her for a minute and then when to talk with other people at the party. The first indication I got that my attraction to her was mutual was she kept following me around the party. As the night went on, she kept being very touchy/flirty.

Next thing I know, she recommends that we go out to a bar together. When I say that I’ll go, she goes around and gets a few people to go with us. We all leave, and she gets in the front seat of my car with me.

At this point, I’m not really thinking much about it. We are having fun, and I like this girl, but I’m not getting too far ahead of myself.

We get to the bar and she starts *aggressively* trying to get me to drink with her. I’m like “no thanks,” but she buys the group shots and insists that I drink with everyone. I managed to get my friend to take my shot for me. I was the DD, and I have a strict no drinking and driving policy, even it’s technically legal. Lost a friend when I was 21 to driving while intoxicated. Anyways, I digress.

After shots, we move to the dance floor, and everyone is having a good time. While we are dancing, she keeps grabbing my hand and dancing (mostly innocently with me). I hang out for a minute, but then I take a walk because I don’t like to dance unless I’m drunk. I’m walking around, just vibing being by myself, talking to some strangers. 

I walk back to find everyone, and they say that Jane is looking for me. I feel a tinge of excitement, and walk back around to find her. I find her and she seems a little upset. She keeps asking if I’m having a bad time, and I reassure her that I just like to sometimes do my own thing and was having a good time. 

We walk outside together and are really vibing with each other. We are talking effortlessly, she’s laughing at my stupid jokes, and she continues to do things like rest her head on my shoulder. We go inside and dance together. And she’s getting really affectionate with the dancing.

We go back outside to smoke. Then things started to get weird. Apparently some ex-fling is at the bar, and her attitude shifts. She seems anxious that he’s there and tells me that they used to be a fling and sleep together. I made the mistake of not seeing the red flag and then continuing on with the night.

We leave around the time the bar closes, and she insists on driving home after drinking from our friends place. This upsets me because I didn’t think she should be driving, but she’s an adult and insists she’s okay to drive.

I text her when I get home to see if she got home safe. She said that she did and told me she had fun. I went to bed thinking, “what the fuck happened?” At some level though, I was just thinking about the night and how much fun we had. It had been awhile since I felt myself starting to open up to someone.

The next day, I still feel a little funky. Around noon though, I gather up the courage to text her and see if she wanted to go shopping with me. It was so last minute, I figured she’d say no and I would move on from the whole experience. She ended up eagerly saying yes and seeming to have the same attitude as before things got weird.

To wrap things up, we went to a few shops and eventually it just dawned on me to ask her a question: “Did you end up going home after I dropped you off?” She pauses and says, “uhhh yeah.” And I laugh and say, “You don’t sound too sure.” She says, “well I went home and then went to a friends. And I ask, “oh that guy?” And she said, “yes.”

Don’t get me wrong. I know we aren’t together. I know she has every right to sleep with whoever she wants. But damn, did I feel like the wind was knocked out of my stomach. It would be one thing to see him the next day, but really? After we had just spent the whole night together and almost kissed on the dance floor? And to lie to me about it and say she needed to get home because she had something to do in the morning? I felt completely manipulated. 

Guys… I’m going to be honest. As much as I knew I should be upset, I was and didn’t respond well. Basically, we stopped speaking, she made some comment about me being a “law abiding citizen” and I said “one of us was supposed to be when y’all were drinking and driving.” I proceeded to tell her I would never have a one-night stand with a co-worker because of how unprofessional it was and she should be aware of her reputation. Oddly enough, it was sincere because it’s the reason I didn’t actually make a move.

But I have been in a horrible mood ever since. I’m not sure if I should apologize and explain how I feel or just let it go. I think it was more hurtful than anything. The way she actively pursued me all night and then was able to lie and ditch me for a late night booty call. It made me feel like I was being used to make the other guy jealous or to validate her.

I joked about being in a crowded room and that I might have COVID and she joked back that it would be 14 days until our next date. I figured this was my chance to just tell her that I wasn't interested in a romantic relationship with her and I did. I told her that I really enjoy talking to her and that I wouldn't mind hanging out as friends. She just responded with a thumbs up. So I asked her if she was okay and that I just didn't feel any romantic connection and she responded saying she understands. I said to her that I still want to be friends and talk with her but if she needed some space for a bit I understand. Last thing she said to me was ""We can still talk"". I don't know how often ""We can still be friends"" is thrown out, but I meant it legitimately. She is in the same profession as me so it felt nice being able to talk to someone who knew what I was talking about.

I graduated college 6 months ago and just recently started dating someone. I do live at home which has been weird as this has been née to me. I’ve been seeing them for about 2 months but haven’t told my parents. I will usually come back really late after a date and come back at around midnight. I let my parents know if I’ll be out late but then when I get home the next morning they ask who I was with and what was I doing? 

That’s understandable as any parent would be curious but I honestly don’t know what to tell them. My parents are very loving and supportive but I would like to wait before telling them about her until it gets more serious. I’ve just been kind of avoiding them for a month or so and they kind of forget after a couple of days.

I want to spend the night at her place one day but I think that would be a clear giveaway as to what I’m doing. I really would just like to be private about the whole thing but I feel like ever since coming home im a teenager again. Also I feel like my mom has a hard time keeping my business private and will start casually mentioning it in conversations.

This is our third time meeting up.

TLDR: I say “are you gonna come for me” in a non sexual way in the middle of a conversation, he then responds with “can you take it?”. Im grossed out by it and under the impression that he’s being sexual. He says was just responding to what I say-not trying to be nasty, but I believe that he was intentionally trying to sneak a nasty line in. 

We’re having a conversation and I end up saying, “are you gonna come for me?”, in a non sexual context. I was saying it in regards to him roasting me. Like “are you gonna come at me?” but it came out as “are you gonna come for me” due to the nature of the conversation. 

He then follows up by saying “can you take it?” Or some shit like that. So the convo goes like this:

Me: “Are you gonna come for me?”
Him: “Can you take it”

 And I’m immediately repulsed. I’m assuming he took what I was saying sexually and I got so turned off I told him I’m ready to go home. I’m not into sexy talk with men I’m just meeting. 

He got defensive and was saying that he feels like I’m judging him, that he has no idea where I even got this “sexual context” from and that he in no way intended it to sound like that…

So am I really crazy for thinking his response was sexual? Does that not seem like an inappropriate response?

So at some point in time in my life I think it would be interesting if I went somewhere natural completely nude with my significant other like maybe a beach, a forest of some sort, a desert area etc.
Basically just go to a place that’s naturally beautiful with both me and my significant other being completely nude together and maybe even have sex too.
Like we could basically just drive and park somewhere and then leave all of our clothes in the vehicle and then grab a tent or something and hike until we find somewhere to stay.
And no I’m not thinking about doing any survival stuff heck no, so don’t think of this as a naked and afraid type thing, it would be more of a fun camping trip with my potential girlfriend/wife where we can just ditch our clothes and enjoy nature and feel free completely nude.
So just out of curiosity, for those of you women out there is this something that you would do with your boyfriend once you’ve already got to know him very well?

It’s the first time in like 3 years that I’ve felt infatuated with someone. I always have my guard up with people and dating feels like a boring routine just so I can have sex and appease my hornyness. 

He really changed my views about sex. I’m always used to having meaningless sex with people and I’m afraid to talk about my feelings with people out of fear of coming off too “clingy”.  I always felt so numb to dating and sex and it just feels like something I have to do to avoid feeling lonely. 

However, this guy I felt really comfortable with. I felt like I could talk about my feelings and he actually cared how I felt. He was the only guy who wanted to wait to have sex (although we never got that far). He said he likes to have sex out of love and wants it to be really passionate and affectionate. This felt so foreign to me but I realized I really want something like that. 

I always felt like I was being a “badass” by having wild and degrading sex (sex in public, degrading dirty talk) but after meeting this guy I realized that while that type of sex can be really fun, it’s also okay to want and ask for more than that. 

School got pretty busy and I haven’t reached out to him much this semester. Last time I messaged him was 5 weeks ago and he said ideally he wants to be friends who go and do cool/fun things and also have sex sometimes. He said he wishes he could see me more often because he hasn’t determined yet if we would be good together. 

School has just be crazy and I haven’t had a chance to hang out with him. I stalked his Reddit most today and saw a recent post (2 weeks ago) in which he mentioned having a girlfriend. 

This feels like a missed opportunity and I feel really sad. He means so much to me and really changed my perspective on things.

I would be cool with a situationship/casual type thing if we were sleeping together and it was just a not so serious dating kinda thing but she is a virgin with anxiety problems (Borderline personality disorder) and used to cut herself etc, but is very charming and sexy and fun, who wants to look for a serious relationship whilst dating me and some other guy. I basically said I want to be a priority and not an option and that I will only date her if its us and I walked away. She is confused, young, inexperienced and conflicted with obviously has a lot of personal issues. Is this normal? Am I taking things too seriously to walk away from this? Should I have just accepted to date her while she sees this other guy but she isnt sleeping with either of us?   
 I think its completely reasonable for me after 4 dates with her, lots of making out and ***the proviso we both expressed by date 3 we were looking for a relationship and to date one person at a time*** to do exactly that and not re-write the contract after starting to build some momentum. I think its normal i walked away. I think accepting it would go against what i want, would diminish me and cause me uncertainty and anxiety and i could potentially get enmeshed with someone with a lot of baggage.

I met a girl on Hinge and we started dating. We have been on 4 dates. We started kissing and making out on the 2nd date. We really hit it off. there was a lot of chemistry and every time we met up we ended up spending the whole day together and doing lots of activities. The attraction was high and she was really into me. I was doing everything right and things were going well. Our last date we went out for drinks and I took her back to mine, we cuddled and got intimate but didnt have sex as she is still a virgin and wants to take it slow. I am cool with that. She told me she has some anxiety issues and childhood trauma and thats why she is a virgin and that she is looking for a serious relationship, that she has never 'been in a relationship' before. On our 2nd date she mentioned she felt a connection with me. i replied 'me too'. on our third date she told me she broke it off with some guy she had been seeing for 4 months because she really liked me and wanted to only date one person at a time. Things were going well dating and I could see things progressing nicely with the potential of an intimate relationship developing. by the 3rd and 4th date she was really into me. Couldnt keep her lips and hands off me and kepts saying how much she likes me and feels a connection. Some of you may say I did something to turn her off but i really believe this isnt the case this time. I have experience with girls and have made many mistakes ive learnt from. Im confident to say that it appears this girl doesnt know what she wants and really likes me but obviously still has feelings for this other guy and wants to date both of us, and overtime get to know both of us more and eventually decide if she really likes one of us and will choose to sleep with one of us. i think thats foolish and i dont want to be part of it. I think its normal to date lots of people at once during 1st and 2nd dates, maybe even 3rd dates, but by a 4th date with lots of kissing and both of us having been clear by the 3rd date that we are looking for a serious relationship and only want to date one person at a time, that dating other people wouldnt be appropriate, unless both of us were keen on doing that. I mean she was the one who brought up the 'exclusivity'. I was dating other people until she brought that up so by the 3rd date so i decided to focus on her. I am busy and only really had time to meet up with her for dates. I didnt mention anything about being exclusive or deep feelings etc. She brought that up. She really likes me and is clearly disappointed i walked away from her. It was hard because i could see a lot of potential with her. I told her that. It would be different if we were sleeping together and she said something along the lines of ''Hey I just want to date you and other people right not and not be locked into anything'', I would have been fine with that. I would have been happy to have a casual relationship with her while I date other people and find someone who wants something more serious. But thats not what she wanted. She wanted to date me seriously along with this guy who the week earlier she had dumped but then decided she wanted to get back with. She hinted to the fact that she has a lot of personal problems and the reason she wants to keep it open is because she is not sure how i will react to learning about these issues of hers. She has scars on her arms from cutting herself, anxiety issues and borderline personality disorder so i probably dodged a bullet here. I told her that it takes time to get to know someone and that is part of the fun of dating. I said i was fine she has issues and that I really like her and would like to get to know her more and the issues arent a barrier. We had some good talks on previous dates about some of her anxiety and they were really good discussions and i felt after her attraction towards me was increased. I said that i really wanted to date her and see where things go but not if she is seeing another guy as she will only give half of her self to me. I also said it leaves a lot of uncertainty and that I will end up having to hold my self back a lot and that in doing this she wont really get to know me. I also said that it can get complicated if she starts sleeping with one of us. I said to her that these things usually never work and she'll find it hard to find people who would agree to such a thing. She said something along the lines of that she is an open book but wants to do this because she wants to see if she likes one of us before she commits. I said to her that surely after 4 months of seeing this guy she would be certain about whether of not she likes him and wants to be with him. She is new to dating and obviously wants to see whats out there but I find it rather strange what she wants in particular. the fact that me and him would both be competing for her virginity and be in a serious relationship is not on. If we were both just fucking her and she wanted to be loose I would actually be fine with having a fuck buddy on the side. This whole scenario combined with the fact she comes with a lot of baggage made me decide to leave. I said to her im going to start dating again but that she has my number and if things change she can contact me. I didnt say I am going to wait for her but that she can send me a message in the future and if im single we can see where things go but i wished her luck with everything, dropped her home and gave her a final kiss. She was visibly shaken and distraught/conflicted by this and disappointed. I value my self and i just cannot see this going any where, whereas I could use that time to find someone more stable and suited to me. If she didnt have all the personal issues and wasnt a virgin I would probably accept to date her and start dating other girls too. She yo-yo'd and i think shes making a mistake. I can tell shes really into me and things will likely not work out with this guy. Anyways, i wish her the best but im conflicted because im old school but it seems these days 'normal' to be in situationships and encouraged for people not to commit and date lots of people at once. I think in some cases thats ok if both people want that but i think its completely reasonable for me after 4 dates with her, lots of making out and the proviso we both expressed we were looking for a relationship and to date one person at a time to do exactly that and not re-write the contract after starting to build some momentum. I think its normal i walked away. I think accepting it would go against what i want, would diminish me and cause me uncertainty and anxiety and i could potentially get enmeshed with someone with a lot of baggage. My anxious brain tells me I have too much integrity and that i am being fussy and unreasonable for expecting her to commit after such a short time. I said we can just continue to date and see where things go and not be serious but that I only like to date once at a time.  I dont know. Am i crazy? Am i stupid? or did I do the right thing? Is this normal? when do people starting dating exclusive? surely after 4 dates and making out etc and expressing everything i have mentioned it would be normal to just want to date each other and see where it goes? if it works out great, if it doesnt then so be it but you just cant seriously date multiple people at once. You cant seriously date for a committed relationship and sleep with multiple at once! well you can but youre called a player and its hard to do and you have to keep a lot of secrets and im sure most people dont do that or would want that. thank you for reading! &lt;3",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137035,public,self,Am I crazy?

I met her at a Thanksgiving party a few weeks ago. We got to taking at the end of the night and hit it off. I missed the chance to ask for her number and was a little bummed about it because that “vibe” was just there.

I saw her again at a Christmas party this weekend. I started a chat with her at one point and then went to talk with other people at the party. I noticed something was up when she kept following me around the party. As the night went on, things started to escalate.

Next thing I know, we are laughing and she says that we go to this particular bar together. I say that I’ll go, and she gets a few people to go with us. We leave and she gets in the front seat of my car with me.

At this point, I’m not really thinking much about the whole situation. We are having fun, and I like this girl, but I’m not getting ahead of myself. I was playing things slow because we work together. I didn’t want to do anything in front of our co-workers.

As the night goes on, it’s pretty clear she’s into me. She *aggressively* tries to get me to drink with her. I’m like “no thanks,” but she buys me drinks anyways. We move to the dance floor, and she keeps grabbing my hand to get me to dance with her. I take a walk because I don’t like to dance and start to just walk around the venue. 

I’m walking, just vibing by myself, talking to strangers, and she comes to find me. We walk outside to smoke, and she keeps trying to get me alone. We go inside and dance together. And she’s getting *really* affectionate. We almost kiss at one point, but (again) coworkers. I don’t want to be included in any office rumors. 

We go back outside later and things started to get weird. One of her ex-flings is at the bar, and her attitude changed. She seems anxious that he’s there and tells me that they still sometimes sleep together. We go back inside and dance some more together, and she continues to be really affectionate. 

We leave around the time the bar closes, and she insists on driving home, even though she’s been drinking. I did not think she should be driving, but she’s an adult and insists she’s okay to drive.

I text her when I get home to see if she got home safe. She said that she did and told me she had fun. I went to bed feeling like something was off, but I mostly felt happy about meeting this girl, who seems legitimately cool to me at this point.

The next day, I gather up the courage to see if she wanted to hang out and go Christmas shopping with me. It was so last minute, I figured she’d say no. She ended up saying yes almost immediately, so I was a mix of nervous and excited.

We were hanging out and I got this nagging feeling to ask her a question: “Did you end up going home after the bar?” She pauses and says, “uhhh yeah.” And I laugh and say, “You don’t sound too sure.” She says, “well I went home and then went to a friends. And I ask, “Oh, that guy?” And she said, “Yeahh.”

After that, things just got weird. I tried to act normal, but it was probably noticeable I was disappointed. At one point, I said some poorly worded things that probably came off as judgmental, even though they weren’t intended to be. It just threw me off that she went to go bone some dude after spending all that time together. Plus, she lied, which is such a deal breaker. I told her I would never date a co-worker randomly, kindof pretending like nothing happened.

I am wondering if maybe I overreacted. Like, do I even have a right to be mad at her? She seemed legitimately a little confused/hurt when I said I would never date a co-worker. Plus she hung out the next day, which I doubt she would have done if she wasn’t into me. I guess maybe she didn’t want to tell me initially because she liked me. But she clearly isn’t over this guy... so probably not in a place to date me anyways.

I’m not the best at articulating/explaining things so if I fudge it up I just want to apologize in advance.

Anyways, I’ll give y’all the whole story. I recently moved very far away from home for a job. I do have some family (my brother goes to school down here and I have an aunt with younger cousins down as well) down here but other than that I don’t really know anyone except for people within my job. My brother was telling me how there was a girl from my class in high school who had also recently moved down here. I didn’t really think anything about it. I never really talked with her all that much in high school, i dated a friend within her friend group, I was friends with her brother and had a whole bunch of classes with her as well but other than I never really talked with her a whole lot. She was also a pretty quiet girl too. A solid reason as to why I never talked to her is due to the fact I had baaaaaad self esteem issues and thought she was waaaaay out of my league. 

About a week ago I decided to give hinge a try and wouldn’t you know guess who I stumbled upon. Yep that’s right. When I say her account I said you can’t make this shit up. Anyways I liked her photo and she was surprised to see my like. Long story short I end up getting her number and said fuck it and asked if she’d like to meet up for a bite to eat. In the back of my mind I thought for sure she’d say no or make an excuse as to why she can’t go but that did not happen!! She very enthusiastically texted that we should . I thought we’d do a casual lunch meet up or something of that nature but she said she’d prefer to go at night on a water front restaurant. 

I kinda know how I’m gonna tackle this “date” (my goal is to just have as much fun as possible). I just don’t know if I should treat it as a date or a meet up to catch up.

They ask for ""equality"" until it's time to pay for the plate. I feel that attitude is hypocrite and a double standard.

In cave times, women looked for the strongest man, so they could bring them food, take care of them and protect them. Today they are looking for the one with the most money and credit.

When money or credit runs out, ""love"" also runs out, because it was never love for you, it was only love for money, for economic stability and a roof to sleep under.

Many women think like this:
-Men and women are equal, but men pay for the dinner.
-I don't want them to take advantage of me, but I want them to pay for my drinks and buy me gifts.

Really? Talking about equality and taking advantage of?

In my opinion, considering that two unknown people are meeting for the first time, both should pay half and half.

I think we live in a time when it is easy for women to accept a date because they know that the man is going to pay for the meal, and in the same way it is easy for them to get another date for another free meal.

He always say something like he really likes me and wanna be in the relationship with me. No matter how long it takes he can wait until i'm ready for a relationship

He doesn't watch them anymore he said he doesn't even wanna go look at it. He just keeps it bc it's funny (I don't understand why it's funny)

I have anxious attachment style so I always asked him if he really likes me and wanna be in the relationship with me and i always give me the same answer. He said yes he's being serious but idk why his action speaks otherwise sometime

IMHO, the tradition that the guy must always pay for the first date is ***outdated***, ***sexist***, ***materialistic***, and ***disrespectful*** to both men and women. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, but this tradition should be shot and buried in an unmarked grave, and the sooner the better. Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people - so let *them* have it!

Saying ""the one who invites is the one who pays"" may be a little better if women made the first move more often; but in the current reality where this still falls mostly on men, this is just saying the same thing in prettier words. (Which is a good place to repeat the call to women everywhere: *if you like us, approach us!* Don't wait for us to make the first move. Most of us will appreciate it.)

Why do I think this way?

The **sexist** part should be quite clear: expecting different things based solely on a person's gender, and judging them differently for it. AKA, discrimination. If a guy doesn't pay, he's ""cheap"", ""uninterested"", ""has no manners"", ""not a gentleman"", ""a looser"", ""pathetic"", etc. If a girl doesn't pay, she's fine; it's not her job.

It's **outdated** because it's based on a world where men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home to cook and clean. We no longer live in that world, at least not in the west. Women today are financially independent, they're capable, they have careers. Sometimes the woman makes more than the man (not getting into the whole wage gap debate here - I'm talking about individuals, not statistics).

It's **materialistic** since it gives *money* too much importance. It contaminates the interaction, and if such attitudes persist, it contaminates the relationship. Money is nice, it is useful, it is helpful. But when it becomes a key factor, we lose focus of what really matters. Money is volatile. Temporary. It comes and goes. Even a homeless person can find a job, and turn their life around. Even a millionaire can lose everything in a moment. And then what are you left with? The person themselves, their personality, how they treat you - *that's* what really matters. And those are the things that are much harder to fix.

It's **disrespectful to women** because it paints them in the same way the old world did. Weak, dependent, incapable. And when a woman insists that a man must pay, let alone when she forces him, or tricks him into it, or abuses the custom for her own benefit, I can think a several other titles for her, none of which are good. To women's credit though, those last few bad cases are rather rare. Or at least, I hope so.

And it's **disrespectful to men** because it takes them for granted. It takes *their generosity* for granted. It treats them like an ATM. Judges them by the content of their bank account. Is that all that a man is worth to you? A wallet? Surely not.

If you want to judge a man's character, his manners, his interest, there are better ways than relying on money. And there are many ways to be a gentleman.

When a man *chooses* to pay for you, chooses to spoil you, chooses to be nice, don't take that for granted. It was *his choice*. If you're just meeting for the first time, he doesn't owe you anything, except to treat you with respect. And you don't own him anything, except to treat him with respect. So please do.

I found it odd because there was a large sign that pointed to the toilets nearby us, but maybe she just didn't notice, so I pointed that direction and she thanked me and went. 

A few mins later she walks out of the toilets and went towards her group of friends on another pool table not far from us. For the next hour or so, I catch her looking at me a few times. My guess (and wishful thinking) was that was into me and she intentionally approached me earlier to make herself noticed, or something? Disappointingly, I just didn't do anything, and my friends and I eventually left the place.

4. Lastly, if we don't do it, what if I end up regretting it and once again lose a friend and potentially really amazing sex? Lol

I'm a single woman in my late 30's, no kids. I've been in serious relationships before and been engaged. I really want kids and marriage but it's been hard for me to find someone who wants the same.

 I've been on a certain online advice forum for eight years but a couple of years ago I saw a man posting there a lot giving everyone advice. I was giving advice too but I actually began to get a ""crush"" on what he was writing (super weird I know). Apparently he felt the same and he started private messaging me on the forum. Then we added each other to a messaging app. I'm originally from Eastern Europe but I've been living in a western English speaking country most of my life. This man is also in his late 30's and he's also in Eastern Europe but not the country I'm from. He speaks perfect English though.

We've been messaging literally every day and sending a lot of photos and videos. We did also video call for an hour and said we'd video call again. We've been talking for many weeks or even a couple of months at least now. We have quite a bit in common and similar values. We both said we want to get married and have a family. We've discussed that we want to actually meet in person by one of us visiting each other's country or even meeting in some other cheap country to travel to (e.g. in Asia). I also want to bring my friends with me for safety and a few of them agreed to go with me. But at the moment it may not be possible due to COVID. He also said he was considering moving to another European country before where he barely speaks the language. So he seemed open to moving somewhere else.

I feel really torn because I feel like I really like him but he's also really far away. I get really excited about his messages and I think about him all the time.

The whole ""Don't work overtime because that means you don't love me."" ""Don't get your own car because then you'll go out without me sometimes"" ""Don't say hi to any guys or else I'll sulk."" As well as wanting to know what I was doing etc. I'm ridiculously loyal and don't have a high sex drive, definitely never cheated on anyone, but the alcohol made him incredibly paranoid.

As a result I'm really wary about guilt-tripping, controlling, and woe-is-me people. Friends, family, relationships, doesn't matter. If someone says ""If you do *perfectly normal thing* then it means you don't love me"" or ""Do this for me or else I'll sulk"" I distance myself from them instantly.

Anyway I had my first date the other week with a guy I met online, and it went well, we both discussed beforehand that we wanted it casual, take it slow, see how things go. He's a nice person so I thought if one or both of us weren't attracted perhaps we could be friends. We just went for a coffee. I always offer to pay if I initiated the date or I offer to split 50/50 if they did. That's just manners imo. We split this one 50/50.

We went on our second date last night at a local pub. He had 3 beers, I had one and a lime and soda since I don't drink much and my ex really put me off it. It went well and was very funny and casual.

I got home and said ""thank you for tonight it was really fun :) did you get home safe?""

He sent me a reply saying, ""Yeah thanks I had such a good time with you. I hope we carry on like this because we have such a connection. I feel really vulnerable right now.""

I asked what he meant by that and he said ""I just don't want to lose you, it would be painful for me.""

At the time I put it down to the drink and replied saying ""oh right well we if you're free we can meet up at the weekend if you like?"" Which I know wasn't the best response but I'm battling with my mind over whether his reply was normal or not.

Don’t know if this sounds odd but I have a pretty high libido and have an expectation that men are supposed to be hornier than their female partners. It could also be what is portrayed in the media and everything i read about how men behave especially when they are with women they are attracted too. 
As such this fucks with my brain a bit when I meet and date men who do not instantly have a hard on when kissing or when we make out, I get immediately offended and read that as a sign of disinterest. 
This may also be related to an previous relationship I had with a man who had ED. The experience with him completely destroyed my self esteem and since then any “ unresponsiveness” is an instant turn off for me. I even stopped seeing a guy because of this. I didn’t say anything about to him it so I imagine he must have been completely blind sighted.

&amp; so i took bite of the bullet to initiate meeting on the 29th if she was feeling up to it then, and she responded with she wasn’t sure she would get back to me as she was busy with her family &amp; her son.

I found her really pretty so I just slid in and spit game, and she seemed to vibe with me. Even hearted some of my messages n all dat. But like she ghosted for like a week so hit her up with a spongebob meme I sent like yo u did me dirty type stuff lol. She cracked up den** **apologized and said she’s not active on ig like that and does not really check her dms. Her last post is from like august so I can believe that to a certain extent but idk. So I naturally asked for her phone number cuz I felt like that's what she wanted me to and naturally she gave it. Den we got to text messaging we was having fun, i was sending memes, she was laughing. Just getting to know each other all. N outta the blue she stopped replying. Last message to her was early Wednesday last week like 2 in the morning type shit and we’re Tuesday today. Just wanted to ask you guys do you think I have been doing something wrong? Is there anything I can still do now to possibly bounce back and be able ask her on a date? Cause I was trying to get to know her a bit before asking the date question obviously but yea idk.
