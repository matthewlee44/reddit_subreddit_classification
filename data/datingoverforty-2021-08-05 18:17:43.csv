8,oza5nx,1628267363,An Ode To Over 40 SOs,"When I (52M) married, I was 25. Which meant for me that without exception all the people I’d dated before I married were in their teens and 20s since this was before the MILF/DILF thing was as prevalent as it is now. For the most part, my dates/SOs then were — like I was — still trying to figure out where they were heading in life. Careers were just starting (if even that), families meant “parents,” only one person I dated owned a house, and although we didn’t realize it we were still just babies. 

Fast forward to 51. I am unexpectedly getting divorced, and suddenly back on the dating market again. For the first time in my life I was dating 40 and 50 somethings (when I’d dated in my 20s, my dates’ parents were in their 40s and 50s — now my dates were those parents :) ).

How much I loved it!

Many of us had either figured out our lives, or realized that we were never going to figure out our lives. We talked about careers, kids, sometimes grandkids, houses, places we’d lived, places we’d traveled to, or dreams that had never materialized. Some of us had elderly parents, or had nursed parents, and many of us had lost our parents. There were a lot of discussions (but not too many) about exes, and although I didn’t date anyone (by coincidence, not choice) with late spouses, I had conversations with people with late spouses. 

I expected to be a single a long time, but by chance I met a really special person my age at the end of last year. She had a house, a tween daughter (she had kids late), elderly parents, an ex husband and an ex partner, and was successful in her second career. How wonderful our conversations were, and we bonded so strongly so quickly that I was rarely spending any time in my own place, so when my lease expired a few months later I just moved in with her and am paying her the rent I would have paid otherwise (she didn’t want to, but I didn’t feel right “mooching” off her by not paying rent or splitting the mortgage and thus squeezing into her equity — those things may come later with the benefit of a prenuptial attorney’s expertise). And how much I love her. And how happy I am.

This morning she and her daughter are traveling on a girls weekend. So I am waking up by myself (and with her kitties) in her house. I miss her. But I can feel her presence everywhere. There is the kitchen she remodeled, the special kitty room she has, her yoga area, her clothes hanging in the closet, her work desk, her daughter’s art on the fridge, and of course her lovely kitties. It makes me miss her so very much. But also I am just so attracted to the choices she makes and the life she has built for herself — I respect what she has done, in addition to the wonderful person that she is.

Anyway, all of this makes me appreciate dating and love in our 40s and 50s, because I love(d) dating our age group very much. I would not have known that about myself when I was 25 :) 

Anyway, all my best to you…

12,ozcw06,1628275617,"Anyone else happy being single? Don't know if I really _am_ happy, or just too cynical to try dating.","I'm 42 and split from my husband 6 years ago. Backstory, we met in college, married young (early 20's), and when the marriage fell apart, so did I. I was pregnant at the time with my third child.

In the time since, I've become independent, strong, and mostly very happy being single! I love being a mom, and focus my time and energy on my kids and my future career (I'm in school for a second degree). But I still have people (mother, friends, therapist) suggesting I get out there and date. The thing is, I generally have zero interest in it. I tried online dating briefly a few years ago and found it mostly disappointing. I had one relationship with a man who I realized had an alcohol problem, so I ended it. The only other thing was contact from an old childhood friend... we reconnected, met at a playground with our kids, texted from time to time (he lives on the other side of the country), and he made it sound like he was headed for divorce. Except he wasn't, and he sent me a ring (!!!) saying that if he ever divorced, he wanted to be with me. Well, I threw the ring away, not wanting to be an idiot waiting for something that will never happen.

The truth is, I think dating and relationships are ultimately disappointing. It seems like a waste of time an energy. I like having a peaceful life, with no drama. I get along with my ex very well (we are close friends, and I really like his girlfriend). Sometimes I wonder, am I cynical (and rightly so), or am I missing out on something by basically building a fortress around myself?

I joined Bumble last weekend, and I stayed on the site for less than a day. I just couldn't and didn't want to do it... My sister-in-law said, ""maybe you'll find Mr. Right"". But my cynical self says there is no mr right! I deleted my profile and felt incredibly relieved.

So Thursday night she actually calls me and we talk for a hour about life. Nothing crazy,  jobs and kids etc.. Today he text me her normal good morning text and told me how excited she was to finally meet me.
Said she was nervous and I asked what about, she mentioned her mom body. I told her I had a dad bod and it was nothing to be nervous about. She then mentioned how excited she was and enjoyed talking to me this was at 1030am, at 330pm the I'm just not ready to date my hearts guarded text came through.

There's a guy at work, I think he's about 45 and I know he is single. We don't work together closely but our paths cross at least once a day. I didn't really notice him a lot at first (just started this job 6 months ago) but in the past month we have been allowed to remove our masks at work and everyone has seen my face for the first time and vice versa. Since then he has been making a lot of eye contact with me. For example, I was walking past him and another coworker who were talking to each other and as I approached, I looked at them and he was   making eye contact with me and smiling but it felt like more of a gaze that lasted much longer than usual eye contact. It felt intense and I had to look away. But then I started noticing that he does that a lot when we cross paths. Now whenever I look up from my work, if he is there he will be looking at me and he holds the eye contact for way longer than I would, so I have to look away. He is always smiling.

I find this very seductive and he's got my attention but I don't know what to do cause I don't know if he's just being friendly.

34,p028tl,1628373297,The Burden of Rainchecks Lies Upon? (crickets...),"Earlier this week, I had plans to spend a week with a long distance love interest whom I have been involved with over the course of a year.

Plans were canceled via text 2 days prior to my leaving when a landslide occurred at his place of work. He works in a National Park and clearing the landslide would cause him to work 2 additional days, coinciding with days I would have been there. He attached 5 or 6 pictures of the landslide.

I immediately texted, ""It's okay, we can do different dates. I know you'll want to be available to help (at work).""

The next morning he confirmed via text that he would be working Fri &amp; Sat. and that maybe we should do different dates.

Because he is very into his job and this was a big deal, I said, ""Take it easy this week as I know it's going to be a lot of work."" Rather than my getting right into what the back up dates would be.

The next morning, I sent him a case of his favorite, but very hard to find, energy drink. Just as a show of support for all the extra hours &amp; work

But now, the doubts are creeping in since he did not make any attempt to offer up any back up dates. There was neither any regret in plans getting canceled, nor easy and immediate, ""Let's move it to next week?""

Around the house, I slowly unpack because? I have no assurance that he will revive the raincheck, so to speak. (Because it was a roadtrip and I was bringing my puppy for a week, it is a lot to unpack, not just a duffle bag 😂)

I think? Did the landslide get cleared? Did he have to work on his days off? What if there wasn't a landslide?? Yes, stuff like that.

To those who will say, ""Just ask him"", I have been assertive in the relationship in the past, and so, this time, it is important to me that I know that he does want to see me and extends the back up date invitation on his part.

I know they meant well, I know they just want the best for me, but the things that are red flags to them are not really red flags to me. Like I don't care about certain things. My girlfriends oftentimes would tell me to ""Stop talking to him"" or ""Why are you still talking to him, he's not even good looking?"" 

Sometimes I felt that my opinion does not matter, their opinions are always right and I should listen to them. Sometimes I felt like they bullied me. It made me really doubt myself. Like I'm having an identity crisis or something. Am I wrong not to care about these things? Or should I care? Again I understand they probably meant well. They think I should be more selective and picky in general. But I think they're being judgemental. 

Anyway, so I decided to stop sharing stories about the guys I'm dating with them. I also decided to take a break from dating because I'm kind of tired or it.

I've (48F)been dating this terrific guy for about 5 months, long distance. He visited me a month ago and I bought tickets, while he was here with me, to fly out to spend a week with him in September. He's amazing. He's kind and funny and so fucking intelligent. The way his mind works fascinates me. He's a terrific father to his son and although he's divorced, he has a very amicable relationship with his ex wife. He has so many qualities I admire; He's good to people, especially his friends, he's honest, giving and genuine. He is introspective and tends to ramble his thoughts out loud (I think I love that most about him) and is a bit of a know it all! He gets distant at times, but he's a Capricorn so... yeah. He says he's ""A lot"". He is but, up until recently, I had yet to see a level of it that I couldn't live with. We have discussed becoming exclusive on a few occasions, because he kept bringing it up, but never came to a conclusion. When I asked for a definitive yes or no or whatever (because I was confused and I hate to be confused), he said he wasn't sure what he wanted. I can respect that what with it still being kind of early in our dating each other. He did admit I'm the only person he's dating. Anyway, we enjoy each other's company and have fun. 

The problem is this. His best friend very recently died of an overdose. Best friend is too small a concept. This was, essentially,  his soulmate and his first love.  They met as teenagers and had fallen deeply in love to the point he wanted to marry her right out of high school. They were immensely close, but she was addicted to some pretty bad stuff. He told me that, from a young age he'd looked after her and sometimes for her, when her mom couldn't find her, and bring her home and the countless times he'd ""talked her off a ledge"". My God, he was a kid practically raising a kid! There's so, so, so much more. Eventually, he broke things off because he couldn't stay with her in that life she kept returning to. He broke up with her and left for college. He still loved her and was in love with her and anyone who has ever loved an addict knows how complicated it is. They remained very, very close friends up until her death. Whenever she needed him, he was there, until he married and had his son. He had to make different choices understandably. She was however, for lack of a better term, the love of his life. Keep in mind, please, that all of this I've shared with you are things he's told me over the past days since her death. 

He is devastated over her passing in ways I'm still trying to comprehend. I'm trying to be there for him. I'm trying to be supportive and validate his feelings because the love he had for her, at heart, is truly beautiful! He gave a lot to her. Things a teenager should never have to be responsible for, he took on and says he would do it again a million times over. He is heartbroken. We've talked at length about their history. He's posted all over his social media about how much he loved and still loves her. While some of the posts are touching and funny, some of it has made me feel... uncomfortable. He even made a joke that she'd laugh thinking she was cockblocking him in the hereafter. 

Which leaves me wondering where that leaves us. He's told me that none of this changes the way he feels about me and for the first time ever he used the word love, ""It's not easy talking to someone you love about another person you've loved as deeply as I loved her."" He's never said he loved me before. I didn't press him about it because he's grieving and because of that, maybe he didn't really mean it like that?

All I know is he's about to go through his year of firsts without her. First birthdays (hers is in September...

It would be our year of firsts as well. First holidays, birthdays and milestones and I can't help but feel guilty of the fact that I feel our firsts will be overshadowed. 

I'm just afraid that it's wrong to continue our relationship until he's worked through this chapter in his life. Am I wrong? Is it wise to continue our romantic relationship with all of this going on in his life right now? I don't want to break things off, but am I being fair to myself? Fair to him? He's a great guy who is having a very rough time and what kinda creep am I for breaking things off when he's already in so much pain? I'm anxious about September. Am I wrong to feel like he should heal from his broken heart before considering letting me any further into it? I feel like I'm already getting cut by the shards. I feel like I'm being so selfish and thoughtless. Someone help me set my head straight, please. I don't want to mess this up or hurt him further.

47,p0iu48,1628443517,Communication four months in….,"TLDR: How often do you talk/text when a relationship has been established?

I am a 42F and have been dating a 40M for four months. He has 50% custody of his children and coaches their sports so even when he doesn’t have them he stays busy with them. We live very close so when we are able to spend time together it is very easy to do so. From the beginning he has never been a big texter which is very different for me. About six weeks in when we established we weren’t seeing other people I brought up the communication in a way that I thought was positive… and it went no where. He later mentioned that it triggered him as this was apparently an issue with his ex wife. There are times where I can really tell he is trying, but most days it is one, maybe two texts. There have also been several times that we have gone a day or two without any communication. I make sure I am doing my fair share of initiating as well. About three months in we had “the talk” and confirmed that we are in a relationship and I felt it was appropriate to bring this up again and explain more where I am coming from. It also triggers me when I don’t hear from him, I assume his feelings have changed and that he is no longer interested in this relationship. I am very independent and love my alone time, I am ok with going one to three weeks without seeing him. I’m not asking for more time with him, but just more consistent communication. Not all day, everyday… but a “good morning beautiful” text can make a girls entire day! I find myself making excuses for him: he’s busy, he has his kids, he doesn’t feel well.

Am I being unreasonable in my expectations? This is my first serious relationship since getting divorced so I am still learning. I am at the point where I feel like I need to end the relationship, my needs are not getting met. He has so many amazing qualities and I know how awful online dating and dating in general is at this age. I don’t want to regret this decision later.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p0iu48/communication_four_months_in/

49,p0iwni,1628443754,Why I Passed on Second Dates from OLD,"I (44F) have gone on a couple of meet and greet dates with OLD men recently and have been chatting with a third while I've been out of town. The two I met, I wasn't excited about to begin with, but am trying to keep an open mind and you never know how things might go in person. These two wanted to get together again, but here's some insight as to why I turned those down and why I'm still talking to the third.

All of them, it occurs to me, have not mentioned my looks once. Obviously, they found my photos attractive or wouldn't have matched, so it has been refreshing that the focus hasn't been about my looks and the conversation has been more substantive.

Guy #1: he was boring, but also much more boring in his texting and in person than his photos belied, which looked all sorts of adventurous, exciting, and fun-loving. He talked about money several times, which I hate, and picked his teeth with a skewer from his drink. That teeth-picking was probably a sub-conscious thing, but such a turn-off.

Guy #2: he was engaging in person, but also so damn pushy about everything and insisting on giving me a ride even though I said I didn't need one, and suggesting we get together to watch a movie together and hang out at each other's places. It's good to be assertive sometimes, but you have to read the damn room before crossing into creeper territory. Even if the intentions are innocent, from a woman's perspective, coming on so strong and trying to create situations where you're physically in control like in a car or trying to come over, can be disconcerting.

Although Guy #3 and I haven't met yet, we have been consistently in touch and talking about lots of different topics. I like the consistency a lot. I know the general advice, which I agree with, is to meet as soon as possible if there's a vibe, but it can't be helped at the moment. I hope if we do get to meet, things haven't fizzled out by then. 

So I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you (men) have gone on meet and greets with women that seem to have gone well, but don't lead to other dates, it might be because you've done something sub-consciously that was a turn-off to her, which out of politeness she would never tell you, or maybe it was her and not you at all e.g., she's talking to someone else she's interested in more, or wasn't too jazzed about the date to begin with (which is not on you either), etc. And also, if you feel like you haven't had much success on OLD getting responses, if you've been trying to flatter women with opening lines like, ""gorgeous,"" or ""you're so beautiful,"" ""hi, you're cute af,"" you may want to change up your tactic a bit. 

Good luck out there!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p0iwni/why_i_passed_on_second_dates_from_old/
50,p0javy,1628445007,Nervous about getting physical.,"I (47F) only slept with 1 person after my &gt;21 year marriage ended a couple of years ago and that didn’t count for anything. And I didn’t expose myself to my ex for the last decade or so of our marriage, so no one who matters has “seen” me for a very very long time. Meanwhile, my already shy nature actually has something to be shy about as I advance in age. 

This new guy I’m talking to and have seen a couple of times now might have potential. Now I’m getting really nervous. I might start to like him. What if he sees me naked and his eyes start burning because I have stretchmarks from my pregnancy 17 years ago!? Or because my boobs look a lot better in my fancy bras (gravity is evil!). Oh and the butt and thighs that look good in jeans???…. damn cellulite! 

The thought of it makes me panic. I can’t be the only one who looks better in clothes right? What to do if things advance? I would think staying under the covers and keeping the room pitch black only works for so long.

I don’t live under a rock so am very much aware of the body-positive movement. But right now, I feel how I feel, so I need a strategy that will allow me to keep things moving despite my anxiety. I don’t have low self esteem I promise. I’m healthy and active and live a productive life. I’m just very aware of my aesthetic decline and right now way too self conscious to expose myself. 

Any advice?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p0javy/nervous_about_getting_physical/

We had a decent time together. Conversation flowed decently. I offered to pay half the bill for dinner and then he paid for all of our bar tab. Admittedly, it wasn’t a sparks flying situation, but I thought a fun enough time to go on a second date. 

I texted him the next day saying I enjoyed the date and we should plan something soon. He replied that he also enjoyed the date but felt no connection. I really appreciated his honesty and told him that. I also said “certainly not hard feelings but I am new to dating and would appreciate any feedback. Is my situation a dealbreaker? Did you find my pictures to be inaccurate? Anything you can put your finger on?” He replied “no it’s not a dealbreaker and everything was fine, just no connection”. I thanked him once more and obviously moved on with no hard feelings.

Anyways, mostly looking for male opinions on what this typically might mean. I tend to think it was a physical attraction thing, based on what I’ve read on here in similar posts. That’s why I tried to offer it up in a non-offensive way by asking if my picture were inaccurate. I guess it can still be awkward to admit to a stranger, though.

So during the past 13 years, I first didn't have time/money for my own hobbies while I raised the kids and worked a TON, then I was in school and working a ton, then finallyyyy started making good money, then did grad school and finished that at the end of last year.

This may be a long one……
Got a message from a guy who had recently broke up with his girlfriend (month or so). We messaged for hours the first night, text for hours the next night and talked for hours the next few nights. We finally met for dinner, it went well. We both had a nice time. He called me when he got home and said goodnight as always and said he had a nice time and hated for the night to end. The next day he sent me the normal morning message so I asked what he was thinking about our date and he said once again he had a great time but wasn’t sure he was ready to move on from his ex. I was ok with that bc it hadn’t been as long as I thought since the break up and we decided to give it time and keep in touch. Come to find out he is back with his girlfriend (I finally just asked him straight up).
So, we have been talking close to a month now and he still texts me good morning and goodnight and random texts throughout the day.
Well, I’m still on the dating app and I finally decided to go out with someone and I told him (he tells me when he is with his girl). Anyway, now he makes remarks about “your new man”, even asked about the date and continues to make comments.
Does anyone know what kind of game he is playing? Is it a game? I am widowed (almost 2 years) after a 26 year marriage and I really suck at this dating thing.

I was out with a friend last night and out of the blue she asks me "" What do you want out of life? ""... Rewind to my early 20's to really my early 40's I'd always been able to answer that question without hesitation.

It was strange for me since I've always had a clear definition of progression in this life though I looked at her dumbfounded. Turning 44 at the end of the month I feel like I don't know who I am any more. I mean I know-ish what I like, I've finally got a stable carrier even though it's wash, rinse, repeat. I'm doing reasonably well for myself for the first time in a while. 

Maybe it's a product of the current COVID environment maybe it's after my ex lost a degree of confidence I once had, maybe it's a mid-life identity crisis.... I'm just not sure, and it's had me perplexed ever since the question was asked.

78,p146ay,1628524310,Intentional Dating,"Many people are complaining about the dating market place and are frustrated about it, but how many people are being intentional about dating and speaking life into the experiences? 

Intentional dating is about having a purpose and vision for your life and connecting with others who share the same values and who are compatible. 

For women, it is about going within and truly understanding what you need in your life versus what validates you.

For men, it should be more about compatible partners based on values and not solely on looks. 

Until we go a bit deeper, seek out experiences instead of hook ups, we will continue the vicious cycle of crappy dating. 

Dating is also a numbers game. The more you get out to meet people, the more you learn about yourself and what you need. 

Everyone is complaining, yet hiding behind a keyboard with mediocre inbox messages, and less than stellar profiles, yet people want the love of their lives. 

Intentional dating is about desire, purpose, and most importantly INSPIRED ACTION!

Stop complaining about the market place and be the change agent in the market place! Maybe you will see more results if your attitude changes. You can not tell the Universe you want love yet, speak hate and negativity into the atmosphere. 

How many people are you dating on a weekly basis?

Have you crafted dating goals?

What types of questions are you asking your dates?

Are you vetting your dates?

Do you have a vision for your future relationship?

Are you developing the friendship formula or do you rush things?

Do you know the difference between compatibility vs chemistry?

Are you lonely?

These are some key questions to reflect upon before you jump on any dating app.

Are you valuable to others? Why should someone select you?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p146ay/intentional_dating/

84,p1b4iq,1628545025,How do I break up with someone because of vax status and worldview?,"**Background:** I've been seeing this guy, Bob for a month or so and was really enjoying our time together.  There have been few issues (that I haven't expressed) but nothing that really was a stopping point.  But then our county made the national news for COVID infections and the number of people who are still convinced that this is a conspiracy to violate their rights.  If I had to classify Bob's politics, I'd put him in the libertarian camp.  I come from a conservative background but have become far more liberal in the past 10 years but I don't think politics inherently make you a good/bad person.  I know plenty of people who are anti-vaxxers for whatever reason.  My father is one, and I've shed tears over it but I don't think they're BAD people.  

I like Bob and can live with divergent politics but with COVID absolutely off of the chain where I live.   Our county made the national news for COVID infections and the number of people who are still convinced that this is a conspiracy to violate their rights.   **I can't in good conscience date someone who is unvaccinated.**  I live with a frontline healthcare worker and it's only a matter of time before we have a breakthrough infection and pass it on to someone else. My roommate has literally gotten tested also two dozen times. I don't want the guilt of Bob's death or long-COVID on my conscience, and I won't lie, I'm also starting to question his ability/willingness to see objective truth.  He's has said a few things that totally come off as ""I'm just looking out for number one"" and I think his overall worldview is not compatible with who I want to be.  

**Bottom line:**  What do I say to break up with this guy?  I do like him, but as I said in the paragraph above, I can't date someone I could kill with a kiss. I could be friends with this guy, but I can't see building a life together.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p1b4iq/how_do_i_break_up_with_someone_because_of_vax/
85,p1bhqo,1628546159,Pre-freaking out a little over age difference,"I (52F) have starting seeing a pretty great guy and things feel like they are moving fast, but in a good and exciting way.  I know it's still early and who knows what will happen, but he really likes me and I really like him and I’m excited to see where it goes. We've already discussed and agreed to exclusivity, talked about future plans, acknowledged that this feels unexpected and special etc.

My challenge is that he's not trivially younger than me.  44 to my 52.  He hasn't been married nor does he have kids, but has been in several long term relationships that just didn't work out.  I'm divorced with a couple older teenagers.  And I find myself worrying that I'm going to totally fall for him and a few years later he's going to realize that he wants a family (he says right now he's not sure if he wants kids), or just that I will grow less attractive and exciting with age while he's coming into his prime and he'll leave and I'll be back where I started, just even older.  

I mean, I know age is just a number and all that, and annoyingly my ex husband was exactly that much older than me and I never even thought about the age difference, but a couple things are true:

\-It's not the same when a woman is older than the guy.  It sucks and it's unfair but it just isn't.

\- This decade is hard on women.  40-50 is totally different than 50-60 in terms of what happens to you, aging, menopause, etc.  I can pass for early 40s right now, but I absolutely will not look like this in 10 years.

\- He is gorgeous and fit and charming and smart and almost 8 years younger than me.  Sure, I am a catch, but he could have me at 52, or he could have someone like me at 35.  He's crazy about me now, but if I were him, eventually I'd pick the 35 year old me.

\-It's not a cougar, has a thing for older women situation.  He has always dated women around his age or younger.

So, I don't know what I'm asking. I feel so weirdly vulnerable and anxious.  Which is not like me.  I haven't felt this way about someone for a very long time.  Any stories of similar F/M age differences that yielded long and happy relationships welcome.  Or validation for my concern too I guess.

86,p1bxhh,1628547538,How much should I explain myself to someone I’m not interested in seeing again?,"I matched with a guy on tinder, we chatted for a few days and had one date. He was interesting to talk to, but probably the most intense person I’ve ever interacted with. It’s just too much for me right now. I have a son and am starting a business and am just looking for something a little more casual, at least at first. 

He made it clear that he wants a serious relationship right out the gate and started texting me extremely long messages all day every day, wanting to FaceTime a lot, etc. 

I told him I was looking for something a little more casual and he keeps texting me, asking me very detailed questions about why, wanting to renegotiate, etc. I’ve explained myself as clearly as I can a few times, trying to be kind but direct that I am not interested in seeing him again.

92,p1fwa4,1628561466,"I'm feeling all kinds of ways about this, none good","Possible TW:

I have always had low esteem. I've worked on it but still, it's not good.

I was abused for a long while in my marriage. I have been told I'm never going to find anyone because I'm too fat, I'm too old, I'm too introverted. Do I want to be alone forever? 

I tried OLD a few times but nothing. I tried again recently and started talking to someone about an hour away. He was very attractive and interesting. We met for lunch yesterday in a public area. He has a very public profile and job, not married, all checked out so I wasn't worried about being scammed.

Talked for 4 hours at lunch. It was good but not earth shattering.

He walked me to my car and we made small talk. He leaned in for a hug and I returned it. Then he kissed me. Unexpectedly, long and hard. It was not good. 

Here's where I'm struggling. It just randomly started pouring so he asked if I could give him a ride to his car 4 rows away. I did. We got to it. He grabbed my head, kissed me again and said I aroused him. He put my hand on his penis. He took it out and said to rub it. I took my hand away and then I just was confused, scared, tired. He put it back and I ended up giving him a handjob. I was scared to say no, I was mad at the world because I have been alone so long, I wanted to exert my sexually because all I have done is take care of my kids, my mom until she passed, and work. And so many conflicting feelings.

He texted last night and said he had a good time and we should get together again soon (we could only on a weekend due to work schedules). I said ok and that was it for the moment.

But in the end I felt stupid and disgusting.  How do I move on and forgive myself for the first dating experience out of the gate and get rid of these feelings of stupidity? I thought my self esteem had gotten better. I was setting boundaries. But I failed.

Tldr: i did stupid on a date, feel disgusting and don't know how to move on.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p1fwa4/im_feeling_all_kinds_of_ways_about_this_none_good/

When we were teens we quite often kissed but nothing more. We were really good friends back then and didn’t want to ruin it by sleeping with each other.… there was always tension between us, when we saw each other but we never acted on it. FFW 26 years… Last weekend I ended going with him to his place. He’s 8 months out of a tumultuous relationship of +10 years and starting to feel ok about it. I haven’t had sex in almost 5 years. It was great! We said beforehand ‘no strings attached’ so when I left in the morning, I didn’t expect him tot text me 2h later and every couple of hours that day. Next day, same thing, texting morning and noon. Today again, 4hours. 
The day after he said he freaked out a bit. I knew. I saw it in his his eyes when we arrived at his place. I offered to just go home, I wouldn’t have taken offence. I know him. But he really wanted me to stay… to just sleep. I was fine with that (but the sleeping didn’t happen, haha). 
I’m getting mixed signals. He says he freaked out, we said it was a one time thing but then when I say I’m happy single but I don’t want to die alone, he replies ‘I’m not leaving town 😉)

 I have 50/50 custody of my kids and I miss them when I don't have them. I realized my birthday falls on a week I don't have them. So I picked up a shift at work to avoid being alone. Yes, I picked up a shift surrounded by covid patients as to not feel alone. Writting that out made me realize I need to schedule a therpay appointment. 

I thought about what I wanted this morning. I just want a hug. And I realized yesterday as someone was bringing in a flower delivery for a patient how much I missed and loved receiving flowers. I haven't received flowers in the longest time. I know it's silly. But I guess I really like flowers! And yes I could buy myself some, but that's not really the same.

However, it doesn’t seem like he understands that.
