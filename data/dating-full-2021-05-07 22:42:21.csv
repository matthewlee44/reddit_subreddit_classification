My friend and I (worth noting hes very much a confident alpha type, I'm more laid back in general noticed a girl working there a few months ago and we both were like whoaaa shes very good looking. Anyways since I mainly go myself I've had quite a few encounters with her, and even dropped my entire bag of groceries after she bagged them and we had one of those both reach for the same thing and look at each other cliche moments but didn't really think anything of it, basically just brief encounters as I've never actually checked out (from shopping) with her. Usually I go looking like shit as I'm not really trying to meet anyone at the grocery store.

Anytime my friend and I were in there she would stare directly at us really boldly and wouldn't try to hide it, didn't really think anything of it though and figured it was my friend playing usual eye flirtation games everywhere we go lol. Last weekend though I was in there pretty hungover on saturday morning wearing hoodie and sweats and I felt someone watching me while I was waiting in line on my phone, looked up and she was literally ignoring her customer and staring at me so intensely it was kind of insane, almost like a spotlight was the feeling I got, and I then realized she had probably been staring at me every other time. A couple days later I matched with this girl on bumble and figured out it was her until she messaged me the next day ""Hii"", I knew she was single since one time she was buying some groceries presumably after her shift and opened tinder and was screenshotting and sending her friends the messages from sooooo many guys without replying, which I just found funny because it basically affirms dating apps are so oversaturated.

Anyways I'm essentially just wondering if I should go for it, don't want to make her uncomfortable at work though and I'm kind of avoiding going back since I straight up said ""I feel like we've met before"" which was prob a little dumb, but I just wanted to highlight like yes I saw you staring at me like that, she didn't unmatch or anything. I'm pretty tall (6'3) and she is too, but I'm currently on a weight loss goal and have lost like 75lbs so far and transformed pretty drastically, yet my confidence and self-image is still very low so I figured she wouldn't have been attracted to me. I'm not really trying to date at the moment since I still have some improvement to do but obviously there has to be a starting point.

Once I started to sort of progress things she broke things off saying she wasn’t ready for a relationship and didn’t like the way things were begging serious.

She asked for my social media’s but I plan on just unfriending her just on Snapchat bc that’s really the only social media that I use a lot. The only thing is that I don’t want to seem like I got hurt over her breaking things off, but seeing her smile or just out an about hurts my heart.

I took it pretty hard when it happened. I had no appetite, no will to live, couldn’t get a full nights sleep, and I was just all around a mess. Now I’m not as happy as I was, but I’m doing okay. We talked for about a month after it happened but I cut off any contact because it was making things worse. I’m still pretty lonely and I’m trying to adjust to how things were before and it’s weird because I was lonely for years before her, but it’s worse now that I know what it feels like to be loved and wanted. Regardless, I have goals and places I want to get to.

The only thing that worries me is that I won’t be able to find anyone like her. To me, she was perfect and I feel like I’ll always be comparing anyone I meet to her but I hope that changes.

I thought she was really pretty but I didn't talk to her the first day as we were all strangers.

Today was the last day at the course, so I decided I might as well go for it before it's too late and I never see her again. During one of the breaks I approached her and struck conversation, it went surprisingly smoothly and we hit it off very well, she was a bit shy but we turned out to have some stuff in common. In the later breaks I found she approached me and sometimes waited for me by the door until I left the class room so we could go on break together.

We had a final test for the course and I figured that once we were all done we would have a recap to wrap it up and say good bye to each other. I thought that  I could ask for her number or something then before we all part ways, or at least ask if she's interested in hanging out later. However she finished her test very quickly, gave it to the instructor, told him she had to catch a bus and before I knew it she was out the door and gone.

The only thing I got from her was her first name and the place she lived. I can not find her on any social media but she didn't strike me as the girl who even has social media in the first place.

And haven’t had much success in dating.

But lately at work I see couples together and it makes me yearn for that feeling.

Now I’m not saying everyone’s relationship is perfect because I don’t know them.

But the way they look at each other The silent communication that only they know.

The smiles when their eyes meet. 
The feeling that they are happy.

I know what that feels like. And it makes me yearn for love and a relationship.

Isn’t that what we all want. It makes my heart hurt to think It may not happen. 

Especially when I have so much love to give and want it in return. I want someone to look at me that way again

But here we are in a different time where you have online dating read a profile, message, FaceTime. We use these things to date.

Can you really get to know someone this way. I find it difficult.

People can be anything they want on these platforms.

So who do you meet a person who has made themselves someone they wish they were.

Or are you meeting some who tells you what they think you want to here.

What ever happen to being your authentic self and being happy with who you are.

And if they like you and you like them it becomes easy. Because you don’t have to think about a thing just be you.

I know I’m going hear about it. But it is really that easy.

When I use to meet someone if I liked you and you like me we would see where it went.

And if if for some reason it didn’t work that was ok We kept it moving no hard feelings. 

I miss those days. But today there’s so much mistrust, ghosting all kinds of tactics that has nothing to do with love.

That makes it hard to find love at any age

But I believe in love and after this pandemic I’m going to make it a point. To just be me like I’ve always been and hopefully I’ll find the love I’m looking for. My heart is open.

So I (23F) was seeing this guy (23M) for about a 3-4 weeks. I really really should have broken things off sooner, like after date 2 or 3 because I realized that I didn't really enjoy spending time with him. One big mistake on my end is that I realized I wasn't super attracted to him. After getting to know his personality better, the attraction got worse it did not improve. Also, I don't think our sense of humor or boundaries were on the same level, here are some minor examples that kind of built up over time:

* Went over to his parent's house, he played the show ""big mouth"" on full volume when I suggested we watch something else (truly, there are a select few shows I can't stand and I'm not even that picky but I can't do creepy cartoon humor kind of shows they make me extremely uncomfortable nevermind that this one is just about sexual stuff). I did not understand how he wasn't uncomfortable doing this with his parents and sister home.
* I felt like I was being put on a pedastal all the time, and it made me extremely uncomfortable. He would text me all the time and honestly it was a little too much, I communicated to him my texting habits and that I don't expect to be talking every second of every day. This didn't change on his end.
* He would say things like ""you're so tiny"" and ""wow look how short you are it's so cute"", not exactly the compliments I am looking for (and again I'm not that picky and not looking for compliments all the time or that frequenly) and honestly it made me really uncomfortable. He also would make a point of lifting me up without asking me and I would tell him to put me down but he would continue to lift me up/hug me because he said it was ""cute"" and ""funny"".
* He wanted to spend his birthday at my house after only talking to each other for a week. I told him you really should go and spend it with your family, I already had plans with my family weeks in advance for that night. Eventually he convinced me that I should have him over for his birthday (mistake on my end) it was just too much too soon on his end. Just too too much interest after talking once or twice. Personally even if I really liked someone after dating for a week I wouldn't make a point to spend my birthday together, again I feel like our boundaries and expectations were very different.
* He was too into social media in terms of it effecting us hanging out together. He would be sending ""snaps"" to friends or texting his team every 5 minutes. Also he was obsessed with tik tok and would send me no joke 5 tik toks a hour during the day and say ""look at this it's funny"". Again, very different wavelengths here. I'm not here to say what you should or shouldn't do for fun/sharing jokes but our ideas of fun were not the same here with social media/phone use. 
* I broke it off with him over text after 3 weeks/hanging out 5 or 6 times and that was that.

If I were to give myself any advice: after the 2nd date when I knew I wasn't super into him and getting ""weird"" vibes I should have cut it off then and there.

I just want to express I guess that when you can 100% trust your person with staying within boundaries, and to top it off know that they've shown to really care for you.. it's really the best feeling and something I think others should strive for... 

Why I'm posting this, I'll share where my thoughts are coming from... My partner (20m) who isn't able to be around very often, was with me (21f) while we were watching road to el dorado on the couch... and it was a jolly time, classics are the best. Well the scene with chel and tulio making out briefly had come up, and I guess that was the turn on for him to want to initiate something. I wasn't really feeling sex though, and we don't see each other often so I'm sure it was a let down... but like he's totally cool with it and ops to bring me strawberries/sweets!

After my last post and reading some of your comments I realized that everything made sense and it was my mind that fucked me up.

While it was true that I crushed on a girl, after thinking logically for a second and putting myself in her shoes I understood why it was impossible for her to have romantic feelings for me. The points were logic and sound and I totally agreed with it. The reasoning was as plain as daylight to her but boy could I not see it. Cue the fuck up. Due to this discrepancy, I had very different expectations and naturally this led to me putting pressure on our relationship. She decided to go cold on me soon after and here is where I am.

I realize that at that point of time I was having different thoughts and hence different expectation which led to me doing not so reasonable things that caused the relationship to fall apart. I also realized that she is a great person to chat with. This is in a genuine sense and not romantically which made me feel that I've lost a great person to talk to due to my own mistakes.

It's been about a month since she went cold on me and about two weeks ago I sent her a sort of ultimatum wishing her good luck in her life.

People. Please be respectful to the fact that body language is a thing. If you are that volatile in being able to control your own emotional responses then it would be wise to leave said area instead of trying to make the other do as such.

So I'm heading out the door. I quit smoking 6 months ago, but I'm a bit depressed. I see a guy at the top of the stairway out of the underground bar. 

 I'm new to the area so I need meet friends too. So fuck it. I ask to bum a smoke and introduce myself. He introduces himself, his friend and his girlfriend. His buddy and I start talking libertarian politics because we're both on the same level and we're bonding over our similar political views.


Then his sister come out of nowhere. As soon as me and her Locked eyes I immediately knew something went boom.


Let the flirtation begin. They invited me to the bar they were heading too, got us shots and bought me a beer. Awesome people.

So. His sister and I immediately hit it off. We're at the bar talking, touching, getting close, it was fucking insane. We ended up walking on the pier, locked as talking about family, relationships and everything you can think of.

Now. This girl hinted all night she wanted to go home with me, but my female roommate does not like women coming to the house unless we talk about it respectfully. So I unfortunately had to play it off. We exchange snapchats and she was acting really down to meet back up tonight. No bullshit. With how the chemistry was going and the tone in her voice she wanted me. She talked about how we need to hangout, go places, hit the dance floor, take car rides, she seemed so real.

So. They all take a cab home and I'm lovedrunk asf. I'm experienced something I've been craving for a while. She tells me she's off at 3 and I need to contact her. I send her a brief text on SC telling her it was great to meet her and her brother and I looked forward to meeting up the next day.


Open my phone in the morning. Left on read.

Fast-forward to 3:30 pm the next day

I text her ""Hey, we still on for tonight""

Why does online dating have to be so hard? I'm not the type of person to go out to bars and make conversation with random girls. I naturally preferred online dating becasue right off the bat you know some things about the person so you can be more selective compared to walking up to random people.

I've had both tinder and bumble for the last 7 months and have gotten very little matches. All which lead to her no longer messaging me or most recently cancelling a first date without any communication afrer. Its frustrating, I put the effort in to continue the conversation, I put the effort to message back whenever I get the chance compared to other people that play that stupid wait a day between texts game. I l take the effort to look up fancy coffee shops in my area that I never been to becasue I dont like coffee but your bio says you like coffee dates so I put the effort to do something you enjoy. I put in the effort to schedule and make time to meet someone just for it to never happen becasue they cancel...what's the point? 

I just want to go out and get to know someone. I want to get to know someone to eventually form a relationship so I can spend my youth sharing my time with someone. I'm a simple guy I just want the normal things. I want to plan last minute road trips with someone, share all the new songs I learn on guitar with someone, go sit by the water and talk for hours and spin someone around in the headlights of my car with our favorite music playing, binge watch movies all day, so on and so on....

I’ve been dating for about the last year now. 24M and I’d say I’ve been fairly lucky with getting dates. Not to be conceited, but I’m attractive both physically and mentally. I’ve always been told I make a good partner. However, this thing keeps happening where I have a near perfect first date, only to be ghosted right after. I’ll explain what happened most recently, but please know identical situations have happened to me repeatedly and I really don’t understand.

So I was talking to this girl over Snapchat for a few weeks. We vibed pretty well together. We began sending flirtatious messages and hit it off. This went on for a bit. One night she messages me and says she wants to meet, that very night. She wanted to come over to my place. Not how I normally do first dates, but with the way the world is I agreed.

She comes over, and since it was the first time we actually met it was very casual at first. We sat on my bed and listened to music while just talking about anything and everything. Things were going great. Eventually we lay down, no contact. We continue talking, then she puts her head on my arm. Now we’re snuggling together and talking about more personal things. She tells me how bad her ex was. Abused her, cheated, used her, never put her first. At this point we’re completely wrapped in each other’s arms. I’m rubbing her back and she then tells me how her ex never cared enough to do things like that.

This continues, then we start making out. Making out leads to rubbing and kissing more than just each other’s mouth. Nothing wild. We had some small amount of foreplay, but nothing beyond that. She let me know she didn’t want to go any further and I respected it. She tells me how I’m the first new guy she’s been with in about five years. I ask her if she’s comfortable and she says yes. I tell her that she’s the priority and my only goal is to make her feel good and be happy while being comfortable. We continue having fun for about 20-30 minutes. She keeps telling me how amazing she feels and how she can’t believe she found a guy like me. She’s just staring at me telling me how beautiful I am. I can tell that she is completely into me. No doubts about it.

It’s now pretty late and we both had to work pretty early. As she’s getting her stuff, she remarks how she’s not that pretty. So (in a respectful way) I grab her and drag her into my bathroom. I have her in my arms and I point at her through the mirror. I tell her how beautiful she is and she needs to see what I see. We make eye contact through the mirror and I know that just swept her off her feet. That leads to making out in the kitchen for probably ten minutes before I walk her to her car. Then we make out for about five minutes before she finally leaves. 

She messages me when she gets home. She also sends a lengthy message about how good I made her feel. She tells me that I “showed her what true love should feel like” and that “she’s never felt more appreciated in her life”.  The next morning I message her to make sure she made it into work okay, she tells me she did.

Six hours later I message her only to find out I’m blocked. No explanation. Nothing but feeling terrible and questioning everything that happened.

This has basically happened three times this year so far. Almost every time I’m told how amazing I am, only to be ghosted either completely or with extreme vagueness as to why.

Honestly it hurts pretty bad. I play it off when I talk to my friends about it, but when I think about it by myself, it really makes me question myself. I would love some feedback, specifically from women, as to what I can maybe do differently. Or if anyone else has had these problems?

I (31YO White male) have decided to exclusively date second or (preferably) first-generation immigrants until I’m married.

This obviously doesn’t apply to EVERYONE by any means.

But I feel that, based on my own experience, first-generation American immigrants (especially) have more reasonable expectations of a dating relationship, marriage, and partnership than many of the natural-born Americans I’ve dated.

I don’t exclude myself from this equation. Especially in my twenties, I had unreasonably high expectations of my life, my job, my future, and my relationships with women.

But after a lot of hard interior work, I’ve realized that mistakes and suffering are just as valuable as happiness. I’ve realized how lucky I am to have been born into the circumstances and family I grew up with, to have the opportunities that were available to me.

These realizations were hard-won and don’t come naturally to most Americans. We take what we have for granted and we always want more.

This has also proven true in most of my relationships with American women. I often felt like I was expected to fulfill a punch list of expectations that grew longer every time I completed it. Any sign of being human (expressing anger or sadness, having needs) was met with revulsion. 

I felt like I was expected to be a mindless, need-fulfilling robot, with no needs or demands of my own. Frank, open communication was nonexistent.

Generally speaking, the bar in my relationships with immigrants has been set at a far more reasonable height. Communicate openly, work hard, treat each other reasonably well, and love each other, and you have a happy relationship.

Better still, I find that my OWN attitude improves when see how hard-working and appreciative of this country my girlfriend is. She has no sense of entitlement, and doesn’t EVER complain about work. She inspires me to be a better person instead of complaining about the fact I’m not perfect.

I’ve been clinging on a couple of things as a prophecy of something that I’d be okay. When I was like 16 my cousin asked me if I was gonna end up getting married. I tensed and shrugged. “I hope so.” My cousin looked at me for a while, acting like he was deep in thought. Then he smiled and told me, “It will happen for you.” That blew me away. No one had ever told me anything like that before. Every indicator seemed to say things weren’t looking good. By the end of high school some friends told me lots of pretty girls liked me and tried to give me a confidence boost.

Fast forward to 33. Those were the only positive indicators I ever had. That I might actually have a shot. Literally everything else in my life has been discouraging. No wonder my confidence wasn’t great.

So now I’m about to start a new life in nyc as a doctor. I actually have a lot of cool hobbies now and I easily make friends regardless of gender. I don’t see me ever being capable of cheating on anyone or anything like that. I think I would be good for someone probably. But now I’m scared to date anyone. I look around and it looks a lot like everyone is trying to get the best match they can get. And they’re never satisfied. Meanwhile, I’m just extremely behind. And I still get 0 matches on the dating apps and can’t seem to interest anyone in that way. I feel like when I finally do it’s going to be for all the wrong reasons. Someone’s gonna take my money and status for a ride and cheat on me behind my back. Something like that.

I’ve been holding on to what my cousin told me all those years ago this whole time. Holding on to that idea that all the girls liked me at the end of high school. But holding onto those things doesn’t make them true. And it doesn’t mean a relationship would be good for me. My cousin was wrong. That’s not the way things went for me.

This cute guy added me on Instagram months ago. Lately he has commented on more and more of my incredibly random story posts, which is nice because he seems to want to get to know me. We have had some flowing conversations from them. 

I’m not normally into dating long distance, but I really click with this guy the more we talk and subtly flirt. 

A few things have made me worry in the past few days, but I’m not sure if I’m just overreacting:

1) Yesterday, we were talking about how I streamed video games on twitch a few times, years ago. He asked to follow me, even though I told him my channel isn’t really being used anymore. Gave him my username. He said he looked through pages of people before he was able to find my username. I didn’t understand the point but ok. 

2) Today, he said we should stream together. I told him my pc isn’t working and, again, I haven’t streamed in a long time. It’s low on my priority list because I’m moving apartments soon.

3) Tonight, he asked what video games I play so we can play something together. Turns out I have PlayStation and he has a Mac, so that’s a dead end. He said he’s going to look into getting a PlayStation so we can game together. I told him he must really like me a lot (to buy a console to play with someone he hardly knows). I didn’t say that last part. The conversation would change but somehow kept landing back to what games we can play. 

4) Showed me an awkward YouTube video of him from 7 years ago, no context.

4) He told me I have a very cute philtrum. ?????",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,760980,public,self,Is this long distance man showing any red flags?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7g52p/is_this_long_distance_man_showing_any_red_flags/,all_ads,6,,,,

She didn't have a profile picture but seemed interesting by her bio so we got to talking. One thing she noted was that it was her fifth time reactivating tinder after deleting it, saying that she gets overwhelmed using that app. We quickly moved to instagram where it was easier to talk by sending voice messages, videos, pictures etc. Well she's beautiful, really down to earth, and fun to talk to. We would talk almost all day about our lives, family, futures and wants. So about a week into talking I ask her out for something simple and casual, coffee or a dinner date of sorts. She said she was really nervous about meeting anyone since she'd never met anyone off a dating app before. 

So the day of she cancelled on me saying that some of her family came over and she couldn't get away, which was understandable so it was fine. So we just continue talking and getting to know each other, talking for multiple hours a day most days. So for this weekend I once again asked her out. She seemed excited over it once again and says she wants to meet but said she had to check her schedule to see if she could make time. As a sidenote, it is Ramadan and she is Muslim so I understand if she can't make time since most Muslims here (in the UAE) spend Ramadan primarily hanging out with friends and family. On Wednesday I opened my tinder app and noticed that our chat had disappeared so she either unmatched me or deleted her account again, no telling. 

So she either unmatched or deleted tinder again but I didn't think much of it since we were talking on instagram and continued to talk that day so I figured she was interested and just deleted it, so whatever. Well for the past 4-5 days when we would tell each other goodnight she'd send me a kissy face or heart emoji and Wednesday night she did as well. She would also compliment me on my looks and I hers, so we both were interested in each other aside from having a lot in common. So Thursday I message her asking her how her day's gone and get no response. Was at work so I also shared some memes as we would do, still nothing. Friday I messaged her again asking how she is and if she had plans. Nothing. 

Now it's Saturday morning her and still no response whatsoever, and on top of that she seems to have turned off her online status. We both have private accounts on instagram and follow each other, and she didn't unfollow me or remove me as a follower either so it all just seems weird I guess. Do you guys think I got ghosted? I know it's only been several days but it's not like her at all to not respond almost immediately when I message her.

Things were great for a long time, she shared all our hobbies and we were both really happy. We would write long messages about what we liked about one another and how we helped each other. We shared everything and would talk from wake up to the early morning. Of course things weren’t without occasional strife, but we would always talk things out. She had told me once the academic year began she would be different. Along with this she shared much of her past trauma. Needless to say, I was fully prepared for the relationship to be strained over these last two semesters. One day she said she didn’t feel that she loved me, we seriously talked about this and decided to give it some time and discuss it during the summer, as that’s when much of our relationship was build. Despite summer being less than a month away, she decided to talk about it now, finalizing the break up, but also assuring me I did nothing wrong and we could still be friends. She assured me she didn’t leave me for anyone. Judging from the title of the post, I’m sure you can tell it didn’t work out like that. She said she needed space so I began messaging much less, a simple good morning and good night, maybe a hi in the middle of the day. Sometimes she would message back or even engage conversation. I took this to mean things were ok between us. Then she just stopped replying entirely. I figured she just needed some more space and continued as we had been. Throughout the relationship she had issues with trust, always scared I would hurt her and leave because we were online. This was a fear we both had, but I trusted that she wouldn’t do that and worked hard to make her feel comfortable. We had taken a break like this once before, but we had continued talking as usual. It doesn’t seem like that this time. She doesn’t seem to know what she wants, saying that she didn’t want to be friends, but not giving me a firm answer when I asked if we would ever talk again. I just don’t know what to do, I know she probably wasn’t emotionally ready for a committed relationship but it just hurts like hell. I think about how she lashed out at me for trying to get her a birthday gift, accusing me of trying to buy her. Even worse, now a guy who confessed to her while we were together has changed his profile picture to them together. I know they are friends but I can’t help reading too far into it.

Since we first started talking, we’ve texted nearly every day and we’ve seen each other pretty sporadically over the past few months because of lockdown/school schedules/other things going on in our lives. We have so much fun together, we have amazing sex, and he really seems to be putting an effort in to getting to know me which I’m not entirely used to. The only thing is though, he told me he only wants something casual but is “open to anything really”, while I’m looking for something serious. He gave me the go ahead to continue to see other people to find what I’m looking for, but I haven’t found anyone in Hinge since him that I’d be interested in meeting. 

Even though we have a ton of fun together and our sex is great, I’m not really getting the emotional fulfillment I want right now. I don’t really know what to do about the situation. Because of lockdown, he’s the only reason I ever really leave my house and it’s nice having that social outlet and somewhat of a sex life. I’m not fully invested in him quite yet, but I do like him and like spending time with him but because I’m not getting that emotional fulfillment, I don’t really know if this is a healthy relationship I should continue. 

He’s not holding me back from meeting others, and I don’t think it’s hurting me in any way. I also don’t think we’ve spent enough time together for me to tell him I like him or ask for anything more out of him, because I still feel like there’s so much we don’t know about each other.

Lots of men harass me verbally and I have even been stalked to my car by a man in the short time that I’ve worked there. Lots of men have also tried to touch me while I’m serving them drinks. I sometimes go into the bathroom at work and just cry.

The other barmaids say they are just “used to it now” and it’s just “lad culture, so don’t take it personally.” But it is scary to me and really unattractive! It’s really made me believe there are no decent men out there and I feel so hopeless. My ex of 4 years also cheated on me and left me for another girl, which I guess hasn’t helped my opinion.

Stop being bitter. I’m serious stop being bitter about your lack of success with the opposite sex. This is very obvious and off putting, you will have a much more difficult time trying to attract women if you’re always coming off as bitter.
2. Be fun, funny and playful. Dating is supposed to be fun and everytime I get on here I see that’s lost on many of you. No one wants to date a downer or at least most don’t. Think about what excites, what humors you. Pre-game your dates and outings by watching something funny and getting in a good mood.
3. Be kind. I shouldn’t have to say this but many of you think women only like “bad boys” and that’s just not true. I’ve treated women well and also like shit and have success with both. However If a women stays with you even though you treat her like trash she doesn’t love or respect her self and vice versa for women.
4. Be spontaneous and thoughtful. If you really want to woo a women study her and surprise her with things she loves. 
5. Only accept the love you know you deserve. If someone treats you poorly or with disinterest cut them off immediately. Don’t waste the precious gift of life on people who don’t value you.
6. Invest in your looks. Ik some of you don’t wanna hear this but know one sees your personality immediately. Invest in your style and have good hygiene. 
7. Have no expectations. Don’t interact with a women with the expectation of getting her number, having sex, or getting a date. Talk to her because you find her attractive or looks like and interesting person to talk to.
8. Know what your partner likes. In life, in bed, at the dinner table. Be thoughtful.

She requires all of my attention during phone calls and always insist on video calling. she always wants compliments on her recent pictures/selfies which I'm forced to give. She never sees things from my perspective. She shows and boasts that she's bold but in actual lacks courage. Looks good naturally but still uses too much make-up. Likes to wear branded dresses, branded perfumes, watches and cars. She always taunts me for being too simple and says that she will change me and my dressing sense. though she always says that she loves me and wants to see me as her life partner.

I like some of her things, but we don't have a deep connection right now, the only reason I've been talking to her right now is LUST. because she's attractive and charming, I can't help myself stop talking to her.

I've also been told by men I can be hard to read sometimes.

Here's the thing. I'm not like other women when it comes to romance. I'm not a girly girl. I am feminine but I have strong opinions. I don't pick up easily on gestures or hints, so if a guy likes me he has to be bold &amp; verbally tell me so.

I hate social media as a way of expressing how someone feels for me. My biggest pet peeve is decoding someone's feelings for me. Its a time waster &amp; stressful. I've had so many guys post subtle messages online to try to grab my attention or tell me how they feel but because they're so passive &amp; unclear in their feelings I can't tell if it's directed at me or someone else because let's face it, he can be posting it for several women or another woman &amp; this has happened to me before where I assumed it was for me &amp; it wasn't.

So at some point ITS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE A CLEAR CONVERSATION WITH A GUY ABOUT our feelings. However, I feel whenever guys try to approach me &amp; I get the sense that they're trying to feel me out to see how I feel &amp; I ask them straight out where they're going with this or to try to get some answers as to what's on their mind, almost always they bail out &amp; say its nothing but look disappointed. 

That's their perfect opportunity to say something then! If a man wants to be a man in the relationship then he needs to step up &amp; take lead!!! 

I had an old flame who I've been recently seeing casually. Every time I hang out with him lately he's been bringing up the topic of marriage, houses, etc. to me very casually. I dont know where he's going with it, but its so annoying because he can never just say whats on his mind &amp; whenever I give him the opportunity to come forward he doesn't. He keeps sending me houses he finds randomly that are for sale. I finally asked him why he keeps doing that &amp; he just says its because he figures we both like houses &amp; thought he'd casually share it with me.

First I want to say I have to intention of building anything with him because he's already showed me how immature &amp; not ready for a relationship he is even though he thinks he's ready I know he's not &amp; is just caught up in the fantasy. Also we never dated that long, he's fickle &amp; you don't tell a girl you want to live with her by sending her a bunch of houses online. You sit her down &amp; tell her you have feelings for her &amp; see a future with her &amp; would like to build something with her towards the future. That's how you have a conversation LIKE A MAN. 

Maybe I am a little hard to approach but it's because I'm tired of dealing with little boys &amp; need a man to step up &amp; be a man. Too many guys say they want to be the leader in the relationship but never take charge to do so. I'm tired of dealing with cowards &amp; need someone who can be transparent &amp; clear with their intentions &amp; desires with me.

I'm a male college student in my early twenties looking for advice concerning my last dating experience.

I recently got to know a girl studying at the same faculty as me over an online dating app and after a bit of texting we went on our first date. The date went great and I had the feeling that we are on the same wave length. On the date she told me that she also uses dating apps just to get to know people on a non-sexual level, but I think I made it pretty clear that I'm only interested in romantic pursuits (not necessarily a relationship but sexual none the less). 

A week after this we went on our second date which went even better. We had a really good time, cherishing each other's humor and company and ended up at my place, where I made my move and we started making out. She was hesitant staying at my place for the night because of the corona curfew and bc she had to work early the next day, so after making out for a while she went back to hers.

The next day she texted me and said that she really enjoyed our last date and that she wants to see me again, so I was like ""Nice, it's on :D"". However, when we met again (kissing when greeting) she told me that she is more interested in seeing me on a friendly basis. This is where I started to get confused (because of our last date and her reaction afterwards and since she did not reject kissing me at the beginning of this third date). She also told me that she's been feeling down and pretty emotionally the last few days bc an acquaintance of hers died of an overdose.

However, we still ended up at her place, drinking with her room mate and his gf. After a while we went to her room and started making out again. This is when she told me again that she is unsure about whether we should have sex bc she doesn't want me to think that she wants to get into a relationship with me. From what she said I also gathered that she seems to have general troubles building emotional connections of a sexual kind (for whatever reason, I didn't want to overanalyze her psychologically), but I explained that I am not necessarily looking for a relationship and that I am fine with casual sex.

Fueled by us being tipsy, we continued making out and finally had sex, however we had to stop after a while bc she said that she isn't really present with her mind and that the last few days have been really hard on her. Even though I would've loved to finish, we let it at that and cuddled some more before sleeping. 

The next morning we made out a bit, cuddled some more and talked about how to go about our situation from now on and she made it clear that she is not down for anything but a non-sexual friendship thing. 

I really like her and am pretty confused about her seemingly paradoxical statements and actions. I feel like the reason could be her having problems making intimate connections, but maybe this is a bit too far fetched. I guess she is probably just confused as I am about this or just can't properly communicate what is up with her.

How should I go about this? On the one hand I would love to keep seeing her, but on the other hand I definitely want to pursue a sexual relation with her... Should I just tell her that I am definitely  looking for something more than a purely non-sexual relation in case she makes up her mind?

In any case, I'll try to not obsess over this and keep on dating other women.

I made sure to tell her beforehand that me asking her out for coffee (I actually asked for dinner but she said dinner was too serious so we would just get coffee) was me being interested in her. She knows that I wanna date her

So we went. And things were going well, not amazing, but good, we were talking and laughing and making jokes. All of a sudden a friend calls her.

I have had a lot of flings and situations where I was close to getting into a relationship, but once things that getting serious I always end up losing interest. Now I am almost 21 and I have never been in a real relationship and I don't want to be. It seems, at least for the time being, pointless. I am not really a very romantic person and I don't idealize the idea of being in a relationship, even when I like people. In fact it actually kind of stresses me out. It seems like a massive time commitment. Maybe I'm a ""workaholic"" or something, but when I am not studying I am working on my side hustles, or trying to learn new things, or hanging out with friends, or just consumed by hobbies/trying to improve myself. I don't see the point of pouring so much time and energy into building a relationship with someone, especially in college, if things probably won't even workout. Another thing is the fact that a lot of people tend to not remain friends with their ex's. Like why would someone put so much effort into building a relationship with another person to not even remain friends when things don't workout romantically anymore? I am working on so many things right now that spending time on someone that I will end up breaking up with seems completely pointless. Not to mention that relationship are expensive, can become very emotionally draining, and overall feel limiting. I guess I am a ""free spirit"". I don't like feeling like I have to commit to something that isn't necessary, and I know you might be thinking like this sounds like an excuse to just sleep around, but it's not. It has gotten to the point where right now while I am in a situation where I like someone a lot and they like me too, and I still feel this way. I want to tell them I think we should just be friends because I think you are dope as a person, but I am just not a relationship person. I know like that might sound like a classic ""fuckboy"" line, but I actually mean it. I like them so much as a person, that I don't want to risk losing them by getting into a turbulent relationship, and then just breaking up and not talking anymore. I want them to stay in my life for the long run and stay by my side, even if it means just staying friends. Do any of you feel the same? Also since I plan on moving abroad after college and tend to move around a lot that also doesn't make to want to get into one either. Like if I really like someone for their personality, wouldn't it make sense to just be friends with them and then if I am more just attracted to them sexually, just have sex with them? Sure there is no problem for being 20 and still never getting into a relationship, but I love being single. In fact I think that I might like being single a little too much, so much so that the thought of being a relationship sounds like something that gives me a headache, more so than joy. People spend so much time trying to make relationship work or just trying to find love in general, but why would I spend all of that time and energy into finding the ""perfect"" person, when I can just become my own perfect person (in my eyes). I want to build myself to become my ideal version of myself because I am going to be with myself until the day that I die, but relationship tend to just be temporary, and well let's not even get into the topic of marriage.

We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and almost 2/3 months later, I sent him a message telling him what I wanted to tell him if we had cleared the air. He positively responded to it, told me things have been really difficult on his end, he still thinks and misses me all the time. That he basically feels the same, it’s just really hard and he doesn’t know what to do and doesn’t want to mess with my head so he tries to leave me alone.

Advice? What do you think he would benefit from telling me he still thinks about me all the time/misses me.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision. We caught up a week after we broke up but I've decided to not see him for my own reasons. Lately he's been initiating more contact and has been quite persistent in catching up with me but conditions the catch up as 'clearing the air'.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,761660,public,self,What do you perceive is going on with my ex-boyfriend (35M) and me (26F).
