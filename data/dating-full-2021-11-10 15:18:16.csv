I'll try to keep it short. I'm going to be taking a girl who I'm friends with out for a date this weekend. We met in college together and have hung out a decent amount together in our mutual friend group, but have never really went on a ""date.""

In the last few months, she was sending out some pretty strong signals and I finally popped the question. The thing is, what should I talk about?

She knows a lot about me and I know a lot about her. We know each other's backgrounds, schoolwork, and a large majority of each other's likes and dislikes. We have quite a bit in common and enjoy a lot of the same activities. We've done a lot of recreational activities.

I'm just worried that the time will be boring and not seem like a ""date"" at all because the things I know to talk about, we've already covered time and again, because we’ve hung out as friends so much. 

Any ideas on how to keep the conversation flowing or just some advice in general? A little word of caution: I haven't dated much at all, so this is new ground for me.

Here to just vent. Opinions would be great too.

So last year, I met this woman and she is absolutely stunning inside and out. We both do have a crush on one another but the thing is, neither of us are allowed to act upon it. It's kind of forbidden. I can't tell the full story for this one. (We're both single just so you know). 

Anyways, so the last time we talked was in April. I asked her out for coffee and she completely changes the subject. She could have easily said no and given a response. Instead, she changes the topic completely.

A few months after of not talking, I texted her and she kind of shot me down immediately.

The last few months, I've been dreaming of her quite a bit. Nothing erotic. Just a lot of like going on dates and holding hands with her.

Man, did he have me fooled. He was one of the sweetest, most attentive, caring guys I had met to date.

It started as something casual, just two people talking about movies (we’re huge film buffs and it’s his career). I never thought it would lead up to anything. However, he introduced himself as single and with a different name. Because I wasn’t invested romantically, I never thought to look him up or anything. So far, he was nice and just a random dude to talk to about one of our favorite things with. 

Eventually things progressed, texting/sexting all the time, long phone calls, etc. I’m not sure how he had time to have a whole job and a committed relationship. How he found the time, I will never know. 

I found his gf on Facebook, finally made itself useful, but Instagram told the detailed story of their recent engagement and two year relationship filled with constant travels, date nights, and hiking trips.  

She seems lovely, way too good for him, but I had no idea what her response would be if I told her about her fiancé’s misadventures. I even hoped they were in an open relationship so less people would get hurt. I can handle it, if he only lied to me. But she’s didn’t know. She wasn’t defensive or aggressive towards me. I told her how him and I met and when (June). She disclosed they got engaged in May and she already had a wedding dress picked out. 

She thanked me and acknowledged how difficult this conversation must be. I have no idea if she believes me (I hope so) or if he will try to twist the story to something untrue (I hope not) but I guess I can say I did my part.

So him and this girl (21M,22F) have been dating for almost a year. It was all fine at the start but as they got into the relationship she started to become naggy. She has some sort of work all day and they spend time together at nights. She had her reasons to be mad. He’d play a lot of games( matches that takes 1-2 hours while making her wait on the other side saying it’ll be over soon). He did not know how to keep his boundaries with his friends, can’t say no when it’s their time to his boys asking to come play games or his girl friend who wants to call him for hours. But after they fought about it he stopped doing those. 

She tried to break up with him during one of those fights but are still together. She is impatient and doesn’t know how to not be too invested in him. She has tried to break up with him several times now( 3 times from what I know ) when they fight big, doesn’t trust him and would get mad easily over small stuffs which leads to long small stressful fight.
He’s especially in a difficult spot rn, he had to go to college so it’s ldrs now. 

The thing is, even if he loves her, why would he be still with him knowing she is always having second thoughts about the relationship and would try to leave any time a big fight breaks out. He told me she’s warm and caring at other times and help him go through this difficult time.

We’re exclusive but we’re not in an official relationship. He simply hasn’t asked me; I would ask him but I’d feel like I’d be forcing him to say yes if I did. We’ve talked about it a couple times and basically he doesn’t want things to change… he thinks if things are official he’s going to have to do (I don’t know what) _ and he doesn’t want to have to do anything different because he likes the way things are now. 
I could lie to him and say of course nothing is gonna change it will always be the same and then maybe he would want to make it official but I don’t want to because I don’t believe that. I can’t tell if things are gonna change or not and I don’t think it’s fair for that to be like a “contract term” for us being together. I think it should be simpler than that… either you want to be with me or not. When you choose to be with someone you make compromises on things and you’re choosing to be with them despite whatever might change. 
So he says he thinks he’s wasting my time since I’m ready for a relationship and he’s still not. He basically gave me the choice of waiting for him to decide he wants to be with me or leaving and I left. It’s been fun and I really really like him but I have this deep down feeling of not being enough. I also don’t think it’s fair to keep waiting and being exclusive with someone when I can be dating someone else that would be sure of me.

I did thinks completely different with him, as I'd clearly had some training by this time.  

The reason for my post is I have a problem with guys that criticism me for how my older children act/their lack of helping me. One still lives at home, he's 24 and undiagnosed aspergers. The other is 28, 3 kids and a bipolar wife. He's got his hands full,  so I don't call on him often to help me with much. (It's not worth my DIL tantrums that's he's not home helping her) 

To that end, I don't really call on either of them much.  I survived mowing my lawn, doing many manly jobs for over 28 years, and happen to enjoy those things now. I hire help if it's too much for me, I can afford it.  

My youngest now almost 15 helps me with everything, all the time.  

My older two have the same dad,  he was out of the picture until 6 yrs ago. My youngest son's father passed when he was 5. 

Every guy I get close to criticism me about my parenting skills with my older two. I already beat myself up enough about that, so thanks for the reminder. 

I've even had a few say that's why they decided not to date me.  

I'm am a decent looking woman, with my shit completely together. Educated, financially stable, own a home of 29 yrs, two cars. 

I don't know what you guys want in a woman, or if my ability to mow my own damn yard is such a turn off you can't deal. I also cut down trees, remodel my home, fix my cars and appliances, so on...

But, I'm over the criticism, unless you feel like you can put my shoes on and walk through the last 28 years and come out alive and smiling.

I'm currently 20years of age and had few romantic experiences. I've had a meaningless ONS but no actual relationship, I was never actively looking for it, to be fair.

I asked myself this question a few times before and just wanted to see if other people have had similar thoughts and/or experiences.

I'm at a point in my life, where I have things to do and am super happy with pursuing my hobbies and do stuff with my friends. I don't really know if I want to waste my time trying to find a potential partner, when I'd much rather pursue my hobbies. I'm content with being on my own and can easily entertain myself forever.

It would take a lot of effort and time to find a potential partner that is not even guaranteed to be someone I want and vice versa.

Of course being in love or having a loving and caring partner is a nice thought, but I would much rather do my thing and not pursue actively, if I happen to meet someone that I like and she likes me than great, if not also okay.

So, yesterday I asked her if she'd want to get drinks sometime and she agreed, phew. Initially I think we were both thinking this would be after work sometime but our shift schedule the next few weeks isn't great so the only feasible opportunity is A) after we're both on late shifts (finishing at 9pm) which I'm wary of because it means its late and we might both be too tired for drinks out at that point or B) arranging something on a day off, which I'm concerned she might not be as keen on (I guess to me it seems like drinks after work is an easy commitment to agree to while meeting on day off is like a full on commitment, am I overthinking it?).

Since then I’ve had short-lived flings that ended abruptly. 

But I started seeing this girl for the last couple months who makes me feel really good in a few different ways. Maybe this is just because I’ve been starved for this type of attention but I thought I’d share with you all.

First off, she’s pretty feminine, not only in the way she presents herself but she’s soft-spoken, warm, and go-with-the-flow. I never noticed how much I’m attracted to these qualities, especially after dating someone who constantly wanted to argue, prove me wrong, and control everything. 

She makes me feel masculine too. She even tells me that I am which was strange to hear at first but I think every guy wants to feel that way. She makes it clear she’s attracted to my masculine qualities, and doesn’t shame me or try to one-up me on masculinity. She’s really encouraging when I talk to her about my work too.

Then she does all these little things that I love: stroking my hair, touching my back/shoulders/arms, compliments me. This type of attention without being asked for is crazy to me.

Needless to say, the sex is hot af too.

She recently told me “I feel so spoiled by you with your great company and amazing sex” and I was taken aback cuz I’m just literally being myself. I feel like I’m the one being spoiled lol

I feel very relaxed when I’m around her, and for lack of a better word, I feel very manly. I’m realizing my ex girlfriend treated me more like a child.

We only didn’t have sex bc there wasn’t a condom around and so I just fingered her through her pants and all that good stuff. 

I’m glad I didn’t have sex with her even though I maybe could have bc it would’ve been bad bc we were drunk and I’m tall af and we were in this small cramped car. I’ve known her for years and to see this side of her was interesting and amusing tbh.

Anyways, I message her the next day just kind of joking about the whole thing and how she left me marks on my neck, and it seemed like she was embarrassed and all she sent me was a facepalm and “yikes.” That seemed pretty short but I said I’d forgive her, and she didn’t respond and I’m guessing it was like an embarrassment thing, bc she like did a 180 personality wise and said and did some things in the heat of the moment that are maybe out of character.

She told me she didn’t want a serious relationship, which I’m on board with, but I just don’t know how to ask her out again. Do I just ask her out like nothing happened, do I make a joke and then ask her out, like I don’t know which approach to take?

So, my boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been together for ten months now. The first six months, we spent almost all our time together, but now we're doing long distance. I'm visiting him at the end of December (my mom is coming with me because her fiancé(my stepfather) and my partner live in the same house), and it is possible that my mom and I may not have to come back before our first anniversary (in that case I'd have to come home that day probably, but still at least we could spend a little time together on our special day). 

I had a slight idea of what I was gonna make for him, but when I told my sister about it, she said it was lame (i was gonna make a video montage of photos of us/him/I) Which I won't disagree with because it's really a common thing to do, but... I've already given him a painting of the two of us for Valentine's day and a hand-written letter. I've painted a portrait of him as his favorite video game character for his birthday and made him a Metal Gear Solid 3 poster kinda thing. I'm graduating this year, have a ton of studying to do and my days are long, I have like an hour free time outside of school on an average school day, so I don't have time to make something big that I can't just take with me everywhere, like that portrait and poster. I'd have a lot easier time with something I can carry with myself as I do have 2-3 hole hours each day, so the most important thing for me right now is for it to be something I can carry in my backpack and isn't messy!

I'm planning on buying an xbox (360) game for him for Christmas (if I can) because I saw how happy he was when he got to hold some of his favorite games in his hand instead of downloading it from somewhere else, so that's off the table too, and that's not something you give for an anniversary anyway. He already got a teddy bear from me and a dream catcher (those weren't handmade though...)

Now while writing this I had an idea- 
I saw this somewhere:
I have a ton of photos of him, and us together as I said. If I got a pretty notebook and filled it with sketches of those and wrote nice things in it,

Would that be good, along with or instead of the video (depending on how much time it will take)? That's something I could probably work on even if I'm not at home.

We are almost a year long in a long distance relationship and nevermets (in two months we should though). I am a virgin and she is my first girlfriend, she is neither. In the beginning of the relationship, she didn’t mind me watching porn, was not jealous and it was not an issue. But lately she said that if we lived together or got married, she doesn’t want me watching it anymore. I wasn’t sure how to take this because no one before has told me to not do something before that is so personal. For me, I do watch porn, but I don’t think it is any sort of addiction, I could drop it and be a celibate monk, if there was incentive (/r/nofap and /r/pornfree crowd claim there are benefits) to do so. 

I only watch porn while I fap, so stopping watching porn would effectively mean no masturbation. I know that some people can get off with their imagination, read erotica stories or audios but I heavily rely on visual stimulation (videos or pictures) to get turned on, spending 30 mins finding the right scene etc. I guess I could get off from pure physical stimulation alone if I had some crazy sex toy or doll 3000, but I am guessing the GF would be against that (I do use onaholes which she didn’t seem to mind though). My GF’s concern is mostly just porn with real people, she doesn’t like the unethical portion of porn and probably the comparisons I would make with her. So she recommended me to watch hentai instead (I do sometimes, but prefer real) or fap without porn. But like I said, I think I can only fap with porn. I tried fapping to sfw pictures and it took 45 mins to an hour and a half to get anywhere. I guess I could try to retrain my mind to fap without porn but not sure it’s worth it. I think as well I have developed a bit of mild death grip from fapping over 12 years, but I don’t have issues finishing when I want to and like to practice edging, or having extended sessions to prevent premature ejaculation. 

So if we are together in real life, I would imagine I could give up porn and fapping, if we are able to satisfy each other’s sexual needs and desires. Personally, I think I don’t have high or low libido or anything, I fap 2-4 times a week. I could stop if there was incentive to but I just ended up fapping most of the time because I get random bouts of horniness or just bored so rub one off, which I assume is common for most men, or not out of the ordinary. I have read that men and women in relationships tend to not give up personal mastrubation, for various reasons, so I’m not sure if it will be the case for me either. 

There is another issue that my GF currently has zero, low, or no libido at all. This is caused by SSRI antidepressants she takes for treating her anxiety. She was already taking meds when I started dating her, and her sex drive was at 40-60% of what she has when she wasn’t taking any medication. But when she started taking meds, she said she could not feel any pleasure from orgasms. In the start of our relationship, she would occasionally fap, not watch porn but listen to erotica audios or come up with scenarios (I bought vib for her to help her fap as she didn’t have one at her house at the time) and we would do sex calls a few in the early months of the relationships. I would occasionally initiate some sex calls (it seems weird to demand these thing, so I don’t tend to do so it made my GF thought that I was not interested in sexual thing with her but that is not the case). But now, fapping on her side and intimate calls have completely been absent. She is disgusted by porn, hates humiliating sex acts (but she always had), and most nsfw things now. She is trying to switch her medication to see if it has any effects with restoring her libido, about two weeks ago, but nothing has changed much since, and says her libido is at rock bottom again like when she started her antidepressants for the first time.

So one scenario I can imagine happening when we meet or live together for a long time is this: I am interested in initiating sex because I am horny or have some desires. First option, she is interested or she is not interested but willing to follow up when I ask. Option 2, she is not in the mood and refuses. I then either have to repress any urges since she will not allow me to watch porn around her, therefore I cannot masturbate for sexual relief. Even if I try to circumvent this restriction clause, like watching hentai, I have a suspicion that she would not like this eventually either. Fapping without visual stimulation at all seems like it would be very unenjoyable to me, due to not getting turned enough, or taking hours to finish. But I guess it is an option and is possible. For the second scenario, the act of being rejected would make one not feel good and undesired, which I or my GF would probably not look forward to. Feels like /r/deadbedrooms even though I have never met my partner yet. And yes, therapy is always an option. All of this is sort of theoretical and contingent how I think sex in relationships work because I really have no idea, being an inexperienced virgin. 

Tl;dr So in some sense, I feel as though my GF is being a bit controlling with me but I understand where it comes from. I am willing to compromise and make changes to accommodate her requests or wants but I am not exactly thrilled or happy either. It’s not like I’m upset with anything in particular but having a sense that something is not clicking or matching with our mindsets. I have an itching premonition that all of these things won’t simply resolve themselves when we meet in person.

Recently I met this girl at my job. We got along really well and each shift with her we laughed a lot and she always insisted on getting a hug and such, seemed to enjoy being with each other.

Anyways me, her and 2 others from the workplace went together and had a nice time at the ice cream place. Afterwards me and her walked all the way to her house together, and had a good time. She gave me hot water in a cup to keep me warm on my way home too lol.

I've always been a very horny guy, but also very reserved, in a way most people don't really suspect that. I've never been really interested in an actual ""dating relationship"", but for I sure desire more open-type relatioships with people.

In my teenage years, I've never really went after girls. Few girls I'd met at that time actually peaked my interest, and I didn't have a hope they'd be interested in me, so I just didn't do anything. I acted like this for my whole adolescence. When I went to college (at 17), that changed. Now, there was lots of girls that interested me, but I didn't have a clue on how to interact with them without being creepy. It's not a case of not being able to interact with women very well; I have women friends. Mostly because of me being extremely shy, and also because I always think I'll be bothering a stranger by interacting with them so unexpectedly, I just kept not taking action. Like, ever. It doesn't help that I'm already terrible at interacting with strangers in general.

I had one year of college and then the pandemic hit. I spent this year and 2020 almost not getting out of home. I'll just have 8 months of presential college next year, and it's gonna be the last one. I have this feeling that there's this big part of my life that I've been missing out on, as my youth fades away. I don't wanna be exxagerated, but I wanna be able to actually hit on people in the time that I have.

When I search for stuff like this, it always seems so complex. Online articles make it seem like hitting on women is this very hard equation, in which you have to pay attention to every little thing you say and be strategic, but I suspect it isn't actually like that.

So, how do you go on talk with a stranger you have interest in? In a realistic way, how does it happen to you? How to know if you're bothering them?

I'm a fairly introverted person by nature, although I don't have social anxiety or anything like that as I'm confident around people generally, I'm just not an extrovert so I don't go out of my way much to make interactions with people. I'm also very inexperienced with women. So I'm gonna need some help to make sense of this situation.

I was in the queue minding my own business one day and the girl serving behind the counter was giving me, I felt at least, very intentense eye contact as if she were starring deeply into me. I think she's absolutely beautiful and to be honest, she's exactly my type. I didn't really know what to think at first so I just assumed she was being a friendly member of staff. However, she seemed very polite and I could tell her voice was becoming very soft and feminine but she wasn't holding eye contact with me, I could feel some awkwardness as I too looked away most of the time when she looked at me because her gaze was very piercing but again I always assume its not what I think it is and she's just being polite.

After we briefly spoke about my order and moved onto the next customer behind me I turned to face away from her and move further down the queue and I heard her say something in her soft voice (my hearing is terrible by the way and it's getting worse for some reason) which think she said ""thankyou"" to me and I turn back round to her and there was looking at me with a slight shy smile. I didn't know how to respond and because of my bad hearing I wasn't entirely sure what she said so I just blanked as if I didn't hear her, and by now the next customer had already started ordering. Plus, ""thankyou""? Isn't that a weird thing to say when I hadn't given her anything or said anything other than my order.

The next time I was there I was being served by a different female staff member and as I was paying for my order my girl comes out one of the employee doors and stands right next to me. She starts talking to the girl serving me and we glance eye contact a few times. She hurries off before I finish paying and then when i turn around and go to the entrance she's there in the way and we hold eye contact for a brief couple of seconds. I always feel she's got a very slight snd shy smile when she looks at me, but maybe she is too shy to say or do something, basically like me haha, although I'm not anxious at all or shy really I'm just not sure if I'm reading this right.

The last time I've seen her was just today. I was being served by another female employee who was clearly new. I noticed my girl was in the back and she noticed me being served - we made very brief eye contact and I think she recognised my voice (I have a very deep voice). The new girl, lovely and pleasant as she was, was struggling with the order and my girl rushed out to help her, she would occasionally glance up at me and I decided to hold eye contact when she did so. She went back into the back room and would constantly ask the new girl if she needed any help and in the end it was her who ended up serving me at the till/cash register (for you yanks out there). The new girl apologised for being slow with the order and I told her it was no trouble at all, I thanked them both and me and my girl made eye contact again and she told me to take care and I left.

I've had what i believe to be similar scenarios like this happen to me over the years but I'd always either chicken out or assume there was no attraction and it was all in my head, like just the other day another girl at the subway gave me free cookies because my card wouldn't work on the machine and another girl at my uni offered me a sweet out of the blue. I would think ""they want me"" but they probably don't and were just being decent people. If I've learned anything in life its not to build your hopes up too much and always expect things won't always go your way or aren't always in your favour - it helps alleviate some stress and relaxes you in the realisation that you can't control everything, even other people's attraction to you.

Anyway, sorry for long rant but there's just something about this girl, man. If there genuinely is some attraction on her part then I'd definitely pursue this further. In my opinion i think shes quite shy and seems a little bit nervous for some reason. For any women out there reading this, what do you think? I'd love to get your take. Even if she doesn't like me and its all in my head, I'd love to at least make her day and make her smile or laugh, any suggestions?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125420,public,self,Girl at Subway,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qr5jyq/girl_at_subway/,no_ads,0,,,,,

We ended up hitting things off really well and it wasn't long before I found I really liked him and was starting to get romantic feelings for him. While his actions seem to indicate feelings are mutual, I'm struggling at times with mixed signals and was curious what you guys might think.

While we're still working on our project, we generally meet up two to three times a week and will spend anywhere from two to six hours together -- be it sitting and talking or going out to dinner. We'll generally go out to eat 3-4 times a month, and occasionally follow up dinner with drinks (we also alternate who covers dinner, if that's at all relevant). We've talked about past relationships, what we're looking for now, family, friends, morals, careers, and so on. There's not much between us that hasn't been discussed, and we're very much on the same page with what we want in life and what our long-term goals are. I've been to his house and finally got him to visit mine recently, we've hugged, we regularly go out in public together, our mutual and personal friends know we hang out, and I've attended a church service with him (I'm not religious).

The hang-up: he has to be the one to engage an activity proposal. Any time I've invited him to do anything, I get a polite declination or he freezes up. I've been turned down four times now and I'm kind of at a loss of how to proceed there. He seems to be much more comfortable being the one to set the pace of things and he seems to actively work at building his confidence and pushing things along...which has been fine for the most part, but I feel like we've literally been on the cusp of actually dating that I don't know why he hasn't just bit the bullet and had the conversation with me. I'm honestly hesitant to be the one to do it since I'm a little chagrined from my invitations being turned down, and logically I know it's better to know than sit here wondering day in and day out.

So what do you think? Give him a little more time to muster up his courage? Should I just take the plunge and bring it up? Is there something I'm missing and I'm misreading him? Are we just two awkward boobs who are too shy to ask the other out?

Sidenote: yes, I'm positive he's single and not seeing anybody.
