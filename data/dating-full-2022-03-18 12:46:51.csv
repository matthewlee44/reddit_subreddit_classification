Luckily this was before anything really happened with us. we did make out but it didnt go further and thank goodness. I feel like i'd get attached or something and feel very heartbroken if we got more ""involved"" 

but i do have to see him around all the time.  we keep running into situations where i feel like i'm hurting his ego. for instance we were all at a happy hour thing and he said i was ""giving him the cold shoulder"".  But i wasn't giving him the cold shoulder. I just hadn't walked up to him to say hello. When he said hi to me, I said hi to me. then he seemed upset that I didnt want to flirt and I was sort of keeping distance (this was AFTER we agreed to be just friends). I really think he thought i was going to hook up with him .

i didnt see him for a few weeks after that and I assumed things would sort of cool off. he invited me to a get together and i was out of town and I told him I was out of town that day. He did another get together like 3 days later, and I was till out of town, so i told him. 

then we were picking our seats for our new class and I didnt notice Jake waving me over, until i already sat down next to my close friend, which was near where he was sittng but not next to him. He seemed very hurt by this and refused to take the seating chart and acted all weird.  Just because I didnt sit right next to him?  then after that when i tried to talk to him he was very stand offish.he's making me feel guilty

Anyway, I think i bruised his ego or something. I already made it clear I will NOT be hooking up with him.

I don’t think we had much in common but he was funny and I thought I might be open to something casual with him.

Problem is though, he didn’t shower before our date. Now our date just consisted of going for a walk, but he showed up in his work clothes with pit stains and when I was cold he gave me his fleece which, although a nice gesture, it stunk of B.O.

He does work outdoors but I can’t get over how he didn’t prioritise going home for a shower before our date. He had time after work and before our date to shower (and our meeting location was close to his house), but he went to his friends house and got high instead. He’s a stoner who gets high every single day, so this didn’t seem to be a way to cope with first date nerves to me, which I could maybe sympathise with. 

Now any time I think about hooking up with him, the worry about his hygiene comes into my mind. I keep trying to arrange a second date outside his house to gauge his hygiene on that date, but he seems to be only interested in meeting at his place which would put me in an awkward position if I show up and he seems to have not showered again. Like I would want to just turn on my heels and leave, you know?

So note to self, don't go to one of their friends unless they are also your very close friend. I mean really close so you know you could trust them. Chances are if you say anything, and can and will be used against you.

As it happens during reunion, we were talking general stuffs and life updates. Few people teased her (in a joking way) when I told I am in relationship and she also really looked a tad bit down after that. Wasn't also really interested in having a look how my gf looked when I was showing pictures of her so I didn't know what to make of it. 

Fast forward to now and I am out of the relationship. The breakup was messy and never expected for it to happen. Nevertheless, I find the old friend really attractive and super cute nowadays and want to connect with her and get to date her. Might seem like a thing out of fairly tale but recently she came into my dream out of nowhere and from there only the interest peaked. Stuffs to mention - we are different cites, we both are working adults, almost zero interaction but we have been knowing each other for a long time and from the looks of it she kind of feels like interested in me (last we met).

What I am really here to get help on is that how am I supposed to approach her. Out of nowhere asking her out is a no go for sure. Starting to build conversation with time might seem, idk, odd because we haven't had conversations for long time. It was only here &amp; there, like I mentioned when reacting on stories. 

So, I am out of ideas on how to approach her as this situation is new to me and it's very different from the mundane tinder bumble situation.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163910,public,self,Help in connecting with an old friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/th2w6d/help_in_connecting_with_an_old_friend/,no_ads,0,,,

Beginning of January I started to talk to this guy (28m). We got on really well, within 2 weeks we had our first meet up, had a good time. We hanged out quite a bit for a few weeks. But things became intense in February, and we abruptly stopped really seeing each other, just texted and and by the end of the month he asked for some space for a few days, that was also the last time we saw each other. 

Him needing space was a few things, his work, family and a tough one I learned, subconsciously my anxieties and overthinking. 

But I gave him space, a week later I reached out to ask what’s going on with us and I started to feel horrible being in the middle. He then told me how he has been busy with work and that’s why he’s been quiet but he still wants to be with me. 

He then went to visit family but another week went by and he never spoke to me. So I asked for a phone call so we decide what’s going on. Again in the phone call he expressed how he still wants to be with me. 

Another few days go by, so I message him, he doesn’t really reply. So I ask him why his messages are slow and he says he’s been gardening and with family all day. Then he messages me few days later that he’s gonna be slow at messages because he’s working nights (never used to be an issue). So I asked him what’s going on, you’re sending me mixed signals for the last few weeks, 

He told me his family is going through a thought time and he’s thinking of moving back to his home town and currently it will be difficult for him for us to date etc, but that he still does want to. So told him I’m here for him and want to help in anyway. He left that on read for a few days.

Last Saturday I sent him a message ending it, as difficult as it was (I really liked him, like a lot, I felt safe and comfortable with him, it was nice sharing his company) but I had to choose me as being told one thing but then ignored, it was messing me up. 

We’ve now not seen each other nearly month, I’d love to go on a date and want to get to know someone.

35/f.

Two months into dating 47/m. We hit it off well at the beginning. Same line of work. Both have two kids with same custody arrangement. 

I think it definitely started down the love-bombing, crash and burn path. He said I love you and then I just…lost interest. He seemed to get needy and was saying things like, “I’ve so long for you.” “We’re perfect for each other.” “I couldn’t imagine a day without you.” 

It was sweet at first. Now I’m striving to maintain my space. 

I haven’t had a serious relationship in years. A string of short-term toxic relationships since 2016. Since then, I’ve started pursuing a doctorate degree, returned to my hobby of showing horses and now own six, have a full time career and run a small business on the side as well as share custody of two very busy kids. I also take my “me” time to do things like workout, meal prep, and get my maintenance things done like nails, hair, etc. I wanted a relationship so bad and then experienced so many bad situation-ships that I decided I’m happy on my own, which now feels like it’s getting in the way. 
He wants to spend all weekend together and likes to watch TV. 

Maybe I’m not into him enough to make time? Maybe I’m just ruined for dating? Maybe my life isn’t built for dating? 

We have an appointment for a massage tonight and he wants me to sleep over and order takeout - again. I was so looking forward to it. Now I want to go to my waxing appointment, hit the gym and then go home and cook something healthier than takeout, hit my couch or prepare prizes for the Easter Egg hunt my kids are hosting at my house next weekend. I don’t know what to do, he’s like counting hours until I’m with him and it’s “heaven all weekend.” 
He seemed great and I was enthusiastic about it until things seemed to be too much. 

Should I tell him to slow down? Do the massage together and then go home, is that reasonable?

I honestly have no idea what day or time it was over since the asshole ghosted me. We have been together for almost 6 months, we had a date planned for this Friday/Saturday, and he texted me on Tuesday wishing me a great day with a little heart emoji, and have not heard from him since. Called him Tuesday night, he didn't answer so I figured he'd call me back. Wednesday passes, nothing. Then yesterday, I called him twice and texted him like 3 or 4 times, and nothing. He doesn't have social media (trust me I checked. found is dad but not him), so I'm assuming that's that then.

The last guy I was seeing (we weren't official) did the same exact thing, and I don't get why this keeps happening. My most recent ex literally stood me up and blocked me on Valentine's Day, which hurt like hell, but I chose to forgive him since I called him from my work phone and we talked it out (I thought for sure he was going to hang up in my face as soon as he heard my voice). His story was that he was going through some financial difficulties and he was too embarrassed to tell me (which he had just made some dumb decisions by getting fired from one job and then ghosting a door to door sales company). I was understanding. 

I didn't curse him out or go off on him, and I explained that the only reason I called was to get closure for our relationship and move on. I even told him that if he couldn't afford to date he could have just told me and we could end things as friends. I wasn't begging him to get back together. Just letting him know I enjoyed my time with him, and I wish him luck. From there, he apologized, said he wanted to give things another shot because he really liked me, and he would never ghost/block me and handle things like that again. Fast forward to today, and while he didn't block me like he promised (lmfao), he isn't picking up the phone or answering my texts. I had a funny feeling when he didn't call me on Sunday like he said he would, and now, here we are. 

And I have no idea what happened. He had started a new job. A nice paying job, and our communication was the best it has been since we started dating. And, then this. I have no idea why he chose to end things this way. I thought the whole point of ghosting was trying to avoid any messiness or complications, but literally, last time he did this, I didn't even go crazy and told him I wouldn't go batshit if he decided things weren't working out. So, I don't know why he couldn't just give me the respect and talk to me. I'll probably never know why. Same with the last guy I allowed to lead me on for 6 months (wow...6 months seems to be a death sentence for me). When he would go cold, I'd tell him the same thing. Like, dude just tell me if it isn't working. I'm cool. We can just go our separate ways and maybe be friends. Every time he assured me that he really liked me, and he didn't want things to end, and then, boom, I stopped trying eventually and just let things die.

I don't know why these guys choose to end things with me in the one way I communicated would hurt me the most. And, of course, like most ghosters, when I asked them about it of course their response was, ""Oh, yeah. Ghosting is disgusting! I would never.""...And, it's not like these guys were in anyway similar looks or personality wise. Only thing they have in common is that they both ghosted me, are guys in their 20s, and I met them on Bumble.

It sucks because I really really liked this guy. I don't regret taking him back after the Valentine's incident since we had some really good and beautiful times even after that. I don't regret being with him, but it still hurts me that things ended this way and there's nothing I can do about it but feel my feelings and try to heal. I wish I knew how to know a guy was going to treat me this way and then I could avoid them, but I can't...I finally get what Olivia Rodrigo meant when she called her ex a sociopath because it's crazy how a person can go from calling you the most beautiful woman they have ever seen, sending you heart emojis, planning dates, and saying what they want to do with you and then in a matter of days...cut off all contact. This hurts. Rant over.

There’s a super hot guy at my gym and in a really bold move, I introduced myself a few weeks ago. I’ve been told I’m pretty but honestly this guy is way out of my league. 

Anyway, a few days after I’d introduced myself (outside of the gym) he came over to the cleaning station next to where I was and started chatting. There was another cleaning station he could have gone to.  After that, we exchanged a few hellos but I didn’t go up to him as he was usually with friends. The next interaction was when I went to the water cooler and he then queued up behind me. I stopped to chat and he suggested we ‘train together’ some time. We then said a few ‘hi’s’ next time we saw each other and a few times he worked out really close to me on his own (on equipment I never see him use usually) but didn’t chat to me. I went over to him one day when I saw he was on his own and we had a quite lengthy convo where we joked and had a good vibe. At one point I said I thought I was a good cook and he joked, “I need to invite you over!”. I also asked “when are we gonna have our training session then?” and he said “i was waiting for you to say!” so I suggested he take my number to arrange it. He took it and said he’d text me later.

He text me that evening, and when I said I’d been packing (was moving house) he joked ‘Next time I’m packing I need to ask you over!”. He asked me a Q about my job, which I answered the next day as his last msg was late and then he literally did not reply for TWO WEEKS when he then randomly sent me a “Missed me in the gym?” message. I replied after a day and he text back straight away with some pics saying he had been on a family holiday. 

After he sent messages about his hol, I tried to ask a few more q’s as it felt like he wanted to chat which he replied to straight away (within like 5 mins whereas I take about 30mins to an hour) but the replies were the type where I had to then ask another q if I wanted to keep the convo going. I didn’t reply to his last text which was just a reply to something I’d said. A few days later I text ‘Try not to miss me in the gym too much this week’. He said “I’ll try not to miss you too much. But I’m getting withdrawal symptoms now” (I’m not sure if he meant me or the gym!?). He then said I’m missing his tan and sent me one of those pics you can only view once - it was him in his boxers in front of a mirror, with a hoodie on but his trousers were around his ankles, to show me his tan lines on his legs. Let’s just say you could not miss his package! I replied with the eyes emoji and he sent a few other pics of what he had been doing but again, literally no q’s to me and kinda got to the point of a few messages where he was sending laughing emojis in reply to things I said.

That’s kind of the cycle of our texting so far. He was the last to reply (emojis only) so I didn’t bother responding. It’s not like we met on a dating app, but I think it’s obvious I like him esp given know I've been the one to text him a Q every few days. I don’t understand if he likes me or not. He’s kind of flirty, replies quickly and shares pics but doesn’t ask me questions to keep a convo going. I ask him questions and then get bored of not having any back.

I'm struggling with a big insecurity about being boring, inexperienced and not having a 'life'. I'm trying to get a feel how rational and realistic my insecurity is.

I wasted my 20s with gaming, all the other digital indulgences and alot of work (programming). Most of my hobbies are digital. Basically living a digital life. Didn't really travel apart from the occasional holiday. Didn't party as I don't like going out. Also you wouldn't believe how little interaction I have had with women in my life.

Now I'm 30(M) and I got 'it all' on paper. I excell at my job, all the freedom in the world, more money than I can spend on my own, high-tier house, my own company on the side, I always get along great with colleagues and people at my sports hobby etc. I don't say these things to brag because I'm not about that. But I really have the inner need to compensate for being very boring, lonely and well ... being a loser in some sense :/ Although I wouldn't tell any of the above in person to a date.

How much would you care about a guy not being the regular guy with friends or a social life for that matter? Instead someone that's pretty damaged and broken about regretting his last 10 years? In some cases pretty needy but you couldn't tell it from the surface.

And would you want this to be brought up early in the conversations? 

I could easily 'hide' these aspects in the beginning but I am very transparent and open about it to the point that I don't even want to hide it. I want to get it off my chest. But I would totally understand that it's a big turn off and a bit intense in the early stages.

I come here today seeking advice 😃. 

Some background: I’m a 23 M, just graduated school, got the career going, moving out in a 3 months. 

I was at the horse races the other day celebrating my grandmas birthday, and I happened to come across a waitress who was yes very beautiful, but happened to just really really catch my attention. She is also 23, Normally i’m pretty confident, but I respect when people work and generally don’t approach anyone while they are working. This time I had this strong just urge, not even sure to somehow speak with this girl. So I end up going to the bar and ordering a beer for my dad and I. She ends up coming next to me and starting the conversation which I will say was just friendly in nature, but enough for me to take it as a sign 😂.

So I came up with my master plan, my two little cousins happened to be at the races as well both 9 &amp; 11 the sweetest girl cousins you can think of. I offered them each a soda, medium if you’re wondering if they would help me out. So a few races pass by, and we return to the dining/bar area. I give them the money and tell them okay when you go up to the waitress order your drink, and then make sure to tell them your cousin thinks she is beautiful! So they’re all happy and laughing they go and do it. The waitress smiles, laughs, and says should I wave to him? She does, she also states, “you can tell your cousin he isn’t bad looking himself”. I’m like sweet, no need to be extra, i’ll go approach her for her number before I leave. As I go to see the next race I bring my cousin with me, we happened to cross paths with the girl, my cousin and her start talking and laughing. I say well my (cousins name) says that I need to ask for your number, the girl says oooooH! is that right! She says you need to ask, she then asks my cousin, should I give it to him? My cousin is smiling happy and says yes!!! She proceeds to ask for my phone, and gives me her number. Coool.

I decide later that night at dinner i’ll send her a text which I did, I work pretty early so fell asleep around 8 pm Sunday night. I wake up to her texts, and all seems cool.

Where I get sort of confused is that we don’t really text all day, maybe 1-5 times a day this whole week. I’ll text and she won’t respond till later, vice versa. Wednesday she texts me, and says we should get to know each other in person, I had already booked some dinner spots for Friday just in case so I agree and ask if Friday works. She says yes, we’re good. Yesterday we text about twice the whole day just confirming the time for today and that i’ll pick her up etc.

I shoot over a text this morning just confirming for today, 

“Good morning, hope you have a great Friday! Would you mind sending over your address when you have a chance, i’ll see you tonight i’m excited (:”

She respond a little while ago,

“Morning, thank you! I hope you do too! ☺️”

and then a little while after another text from her,

“I’m excited :).. would you be down to face time later?”


Maybe i’m totally over reading the situation or something but like idk what to expect or thing just about the whole scenario and date lol.

Maybe i’m a little nervous or something I actually really don’t know and it’s kinda like been in my head. I’m usually very confident and sure, but this time it’s throwing me off a bit. I’m sure i’m used to just texting people i’m interested in a bit more? I understand everyone is different so maybe that’s why i’m thrown off a bit.

After that amount of time I decided to stop actively listening to see if maybe he would take the opportunity to ask me a question instead. In followed a long awkward silence and he just was glaring at me and asked how I liked the meal. I am someone who only really speaks when I’m asked a question or if we have a good flow going where we are both listening and responding to each other.

I was starting to talk about it and got maybe 3 sentences in before he told me he once spent 12 hours in an airport layover. Then he wanted me to listen to his story of a layover when there was nothing interesting in that story, instead of my actual experience in that country. By the end of the night he knew next to nothing about me even if he had many opportunities to ask, or if I did get a small window between his talking to drop information about my life, he didn’t bother to follow up with it and quickly moved on about himself again. He thought we had a great time. 

I’m just wondering who is in the wrong here. Should I be more openly volunteering info? What’s the point if they don’t seem at all interested? I told him I was living in X town for my masters degree and he didn’t even bother ask what I studied, he just had nothing to say and stared at me blankly until I stopped talking. This happened the entire night.  Is it wrong to expect someone to listen and be curious about who I am and my life? (After 4 hours he didn’t even ask where I worked but I had an extensive understanding of every job he held since age 16).

She also let me know that she was gonna ignore me for 2 days because of that but her sister calmed her down. Once we went to a concert and towards the end of the night she was very shady, on her phone a lot. And I’m the morning she confessed she hadn’t moved on from the trauma her ex caused her. So I told her I was sorry she felt that way but I can’t keep going if she hasn’t healed from that. 1 week later I see in her Snapchat story that she’s with a new guy (not her ex )at another concert. 

2 weeks later she came back saying she missed me. And has feelings for me and wants to hopefully make this official. She did confess going out with another guy but that she just couldn’t because she couldn’t stop thinking about me. I decided why not. We hung out and ended up hooking up too. We didn’t hook up long since her period was coming up and she was cramping so it was understandable.

On that night we slept together, at some point I was really up front that I didn't just want to sleep with her and was interested in more than that. Two days later she texts me that she realized she wasn't ready for a relationship, and we should end things because I'm looking for something different. I did notice that she on the dating app we matched with after that changed what she was looking for from ""Relationship"" to ""I don't know yet"". I didn't press any details as to why, and I haven't spoke to her again since that day.

I've recently found myself single again and as said it's been roughly 8 months. I have no clue what was going on with her, there were some hints that she was only recently single at the time but I never delved in, so I want to lean towards believing her that she really wasn't ready for a relationship. Is it a terrible idea to text her again? What's a good way to form that message? Or should I accept that maybe she was just dumping me in an easy on me way?

I seem to have up till the first date figured out. Like for online dating I'll chat 3-7 days. I feel things out. Some women want to talk longer and also only respond one time a day. Others are quicker to respond and is escalates things quicker. If they are still talking to me after 3 days then I know they are interested and I've found it freaks some people out to ask sooner then that. So that has worked well for me to land 1st dates.   


And first dates I'll do drinks or coffee since its casual and time frame is very flexible. Can be ended short if they arent feeling it. I dont care if that sounds boring, it just works, plus I am not spending big bucks on a first date. I think anyone who would see that kind of first date as a bad thing is just not my type anyways. If dates are fun and go 2-3hrs I feel like there is a good chance they'll accept a 2nd date.  


Second date I still see that its on me to plan. I usually have been going with dinner, but depending on what they enjoy I might do something more active like climbing. I plan over text and maybe ask something about their week once or twice before we meet. If they are interested then usually they respond well.   


If 2nd date is going well I usually try to ask what the are looking for. To make sure we are on the same page about some things. I am looking for a relationship and I like to take some things slow. Like intimacy. I try to be upfront about that so that they dont decide I am not interested. Most of the time women are receptive. Also because of my faith I tend to date women who are more reserved anyways. I dont mind paying for 2nd date, but after that I intentionally ask them if they are good with splitting things in the future.   


Communication after that is always hard for me to read. Like do I initiate calls?  Do I continue just setting up dates and occasionally asking about their day over text? Do I start bringing them in on figuring out dates?  


There is a fine line between a guy seeming needy and a guy pursuing someone.  Sometimes to avoid seeming desperate/needy I feel like I dont make moves that maybe women are looking for.   


The last women I saw was still giving me pathetic one handed hugs after 4th date and turning her feet away from me when talking standing up. Then when she ended it she said she didnt feel a connection. That is fair and I wasnt either, but it was awkward.   


I try to read body language and gauge interest level, but its hard. And then when they say they never felt a romantic connection I sometimes think its just because we ""hung out"" 3 times and even though I communicated things they might have subconscious expectations that I didnt not fulfill.   


I guess mainly I just find myself struggling knowing a good pace.   


In the end Id think the right person would show interest and things would be more natural. That if they want to call me really bad before I initiated it they would let me know. That if they wondered why I hadnt kissed them, even though I told them I slower to initiate that sort of thing, then they can initiate it.  


But if they have this pursuit idea in their head and arent communicating to me then I lose their interest.

Over that time I began to fall for her although I had a gut feeling something was just off, things were going well although I felt like she was becoming distant over time. A couple of months in while now bf and gf I hadn't seen her for a month with covid. When we met she seemed unenthusiastic to be there and cold, not reciprocating affection, it hurt. The next week she asked to talk and then to break it off saying she wasn't interested. Although I felt led on and hurt after it being mutual and her agreeing to be exclusive I was happy with how I handled the situation, accepting and not contacting her afterward, she texted a couple of weeks later to wish a merry Christmas to which I said the same and then blocked her number as it was too painful to hear from her.

It is now about three months later and although I am more emotionally stable than at the beginning I still think about her constantly, I really felt a deep connection with her for the first time.

I’m not quite 100% sure it’s The One though… but I figured that doubt is probably quite normal..? 

Now something happened last weeekend that made me think it wasn’t the one and maybe I don’t want it.  It’s so silly though. . ?

Basically, we were in bed at his house, was really late. I said a couple of times that I was hungry. He didn’t  offer me anything. He then said he wanted a cup of tea, and disappeared downstairs. I assumed he’d bring me one too, but no, he came back up with ONE cup of tea and a few biscuits . And proceeded to drink the tea and eat the biscuits right in front of me. I would’ve LOVED  a cup of tea right then, but I wasn’t offered. Plus I was starving. I was kinda too shocked to even confront it. Just hungrily watched him eating and drinking it. I was so upset and annoyed it was crazy. I left kind of abruptly the next morning. Still seeing him atm but this is sticking in my mind. It’s actually the 2nd time he’s just made himself a cup without asking me, tho the first time I didn’t fancy one so thought it was rude but just let it go and forgot about it

Women of Reddit Would you ever be in a relationship and have sex with someone disabled and in a wheelchair? It can be tough to meet people due to my situation I thought I’d ask this question as it can be a struggle for disabled people in the intimacy department. 


Hey I’m male 30 from the west coast.. I’m in marketing and do a tech side job it was my birthday sunday. . I have mobility issues and use a wheelchair long distance. As a result it’s hard to meet people hence why I’m here. It’s been a lonely time and hoping to get to know people. I like movies music and talking about life id love to get to know you. I’m probably healthy my only issue is not being able to walk long distances. Unfortunately people judge and it’s hard to establish a connection I really hope there is someone out there at least at to talk with.  A nice girl would be great.  I’d love to get to know someone and can talk on here and ask for my kik. All ages welcome I don’t mind someone older I just want to see where things go. I hope this works.

I could feel it coming back together. We weren’t officially broken up, but we needed a break to get back to the healthy relationship we had. It was getting toxic and we needed time to reassess it.

We were hanging out everyday and doing everything we used to, just without the kissing or romance. But I felt it was missing what I wanted, and everytime I’d try to flirt or get close she’d pull away and say we’re just friends. She knew what I wanted and I was willing to be patient but after hanging out all the time and her pulling away too much I decided I needed some space.

Anyway, i took some space and came back and for some reason she was being distant. We ended up getting in a fight because she disregarded my feelings after reaching out to me about my dead dog. (Apparently I wasn’t taking her care seriously because my responses were dry). And then I called her out for something she posted on her snap chat story. Long story short, it didn’t go well and she blocked my number.

I gave her space and decided to reach out on snap chat a week later to apologize for my part in the fight. I said my sorry and told her I hope all is well with you and I hope you had a good flight home and have a nice spring break and that your family is doing well. She opened my message and didn’t respond for 2 days. I thought maybe she was taking her time processing it or something..

However, she finally replied but didn’t acknowledge the apology at all, just said “thanks and same to you and your family”. I am confused, it was nice of her to reach out but is she still upset about the fight? Did she accept my apology? I feel like if she was really still mad she wouldn’t wish me well or even respond. Maybe she just wanted to forget about the fight? I’m just super confused..
