0,r97aeu,1638677802,"Pretty sure I’m being ghosted, curious for others perspective.","So I’ve (24F) been talking to this guy (25M) for the past two months kinda on and off. I don’t think it’s anything serious, but I like hanging out with him. I honestly found him very refreshing, because unlike guys I’ve seen in the past he was very communicative, self assured and very explicit about wanting to spend time together. Even if our plans didn’t work out he always made a point to say “I really would like to do this with you sometime…”. He just seemed very genuine and straightforward, like I said it was refreshing. We’ve only hung out about 4/5 times, but At first we texted almost everyday, but for the past couple weeks or so he’s kinda stopped texting me as much and he goes out of town all the time. He just got back in town and said he wanted to hang out sometime this week. So on Monday he asked me what my schedule was like and I responded with my availability. It’s now Saturday night and I never heard back lol. 

I’m very confused, why would he reach out in the first place if he wasn’t going to follow through? I honestly didn’t take him as the ghosting type, my impression was that if he wasn’t interested he would have flat out told me, so this is confusing and disappointing. My reaction is to just leave it alone unless he reaches out to me again but idk. 

I don’t have a ton of dating experience, so I’m very confused about where his head could be at. Anyone have any insight or advice? Do you think I should just take this as a sign to that he’s not interested in hanging out anymore?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r97aeu/pretty_sure_im_being_ghosted_curious_for_others/

2,r97c6n,1638677968,Moral difference between my friend and I. She thinks it’s okay to go after taken men and I don’t.,"This is more directed towards heterosexual relationships as both my friend and I are straight women. 

So I want to start by saying that I would never blame another woman for ruining a relationship. At the end of the day, the man should establish the boundaries if another woman tries to flirt with him and the other woman (mistress) is not to blame if she doesn’t know he’s already taken. 

However, the dilemma that I struggle with my friend is that she’s completely okay with going after men who are taken and will boast about her intention to “steal” a man from another woman. This rubs me the wrong way because although I believe the man would still be at fault, I would NEVER participate in this type of scenario if I knew the man had a girl. Even if their relationship is on the rocks, even if he’s unhappy - I still believe it’s bad karma and morally wrong. I would never want to be on the receiving end of this so I wouldn’t help a man cheat on his woman either. No matter how I attracted I was to him. 

My friend doesn’t understand this and she doesn’t see why it would be bad karma. This makes me feel wary of her because I think she’s for herself and isn’t a supporter of other women like I would want to. I mean it’s already hard out here for a lot of us women so why would I deliberately join a man to hurt one. To add some context, my friend admittedly loves male attention and I can see how excited she gets when she gets even a crumb of attention when we’re out. Idk if this makes her a pick me girl or what lol but honestly it ends up annoying me with how much she craves male validation. 

I would love to hear anyone’s thoughts on this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r97c6n/moral_difference_between_my_friend_and_i_she/
3,r97d8z,1638678064,I (20F) feel like I’m not worthy of being anyones girlfriend.. but i have a boyfriend,"Before i hear all the “get therapy” comments: i will and i have before, I’m looking at the moment. 

I have a boyfriend of 2 months but sometimes i convince myself he doesn’t even like me and that if i have sex with him then he will leave so i haven’t done anything physically sexual with him yet. If i feel any type of rejection or like I’m not being given the attention i want then i start to get upset and second guess everything. Ex: after work he asked me how work was and then the whole conversation was kind of prompted by me and he didn’t seem to be interested in asking me anything or starting conversation with me. He was just kind of replying to whatever i would say but wouldn’t converse back if that makes any sense?

I’m insecure, if that wasn’t obvious from the title of this post. There’s times where i feel super good about myself and feel hot. But I’m very insecure about my average body… i have no butt LOL and there’s nothing special about me. I used to do a certain type of lingerie modeling when i was 106 lbs but now that I’m 111 i feel like i look soooo different and i don’t look good without clothes. I don’t think i have a pretty face either. Honestly i think I’ll be happier when my whole body is covered in tattoos because then the focus will be on them instead of the shape of my body or how pale i am.

Besides appearance, I’m insecure about who i am as a person. I have severe anxiety (GAD and SAD, but it’s more so the social anxiety that gets me). I second guess a lot of my interactions with people. My boyfriend says that any time i feel anxiety then i should talk to him about it and he will help me work through it. But a lot of my anxiety has to do with the fact that i don’t feel like a good girlfriend. I haven’t dated in forever so i don’t even know how I’m supposed to be at 2 months. The confusion is causing me a lot of social anxiety because I’m scared of messing up.

I don’t know how to get over the feelings of not feeling worthy or the way i catastrophize and overthink. I know therapy will help a lot but i don’t know how to hand it until then.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r97d8z/i_20f_feel_like_im_not_worthy_of_being_anyones/
4,r97ehe,1638678189,how to feel confident when I have less sexual experience than the girl?,"so I am seeing this girl a few times and things are going great. She thinks I'm super confident, funny, etc and she's really been open about being interested in me. We've made out a few times and she's hinted she is into me and is always available when I ask her out. 

The problem is that I'm very inexperienced sexually despite appearing very confident and smooth and am not sure how to handle it.

She is also about much older than me (6-7 years older) which makes me even more insecure about my sexual experiences vs. hers and I'm worried to disappoint her etc. 

How do I stay confident or handle this? In terms of sex I have had multiple times where I ""could"" Have had real sex but I always get too anxious and can't maintain my erection.

5,r97es5,1638678217,What are ways to meet and date American Desi's specifically?,"I may get some hate/shit on this, but here it goes.

I'm an Indian guy living and working in the states. I have never dated as I was more focused on building a career for myself all through the years. 

At 24, I am now finally where I wished to be in terms of pay and work and feel like I should get into the dating scene. I have tried a bunch of dating apps but they don't seem to work for me. Maybe I'm doing something wrong (like use low quality pics) and so do not get likes. 

But I have a lot of friends around and have realized that the ideal match for me would be an American born Indian (Desi) as there is still a cultural connect, but also a lot more flexibility. One of my friends married an Indian American and she's one of the best people I've met in life. I know that's 1 person and not enough to make a generalization, but that's just one example I chose to share here. 


Anyway, what is your advice for me? I am open to meeting non Indians as well, but I do not feel it will work out. Maybe I'm wrong and someone here can help me see that!

6,r97gfo,1638678383,I'm having a hard time connecting with anyone outside of my culture," I am Vietnamese-American.

The majority of Vietnamese men (I guess I'm a boy because I'm 18 lol) like me aren't very tall. I'm only slightly taller than the average American woman (I am 5'6""), which I can't do anything about, it's just my ethnicity. Most of my Vietnamese friends are about this height. Even East Asian women are taller than me. I've only ever had 2 girlfriends and both were Vietnamese, and they were below 5'4"", like plenty of Vietnamese girls are. So basically, my stature means that I have the easiest time dating Vietnamese girls. Now that isn't even the hard part, I'm sure there's white/black women out there who don't care about my height.

Now there's politics. I am the son of South Vietnamese refugees, and I'm not going to disrespect my grandfather who served in the ARVN, along with many Vietnamese-American uncles and grandpas. That means I am incompatible with anyone who has different political views, and it's not as simple as dating Republican or dating Democrat. Many Vietnamese-Americans share the same views, while other cultures are more likely to have different feelings towards South Vietnam, the Vietnam War, etc.

And there's religion. Many South Vietnamese were catholics, and that's what many Vietnamese-Americans are, including myself. Catholics are a minority amongst Christians in America, which makes it even harder to find someone compatible.

Lastly, the part that makes it the hardest to date outside my culture is my name. The only non-Vietnamese person who ever pronounced my name right was a military recruiter trying to get me to join the army. I never butcher my name on purpose to appease others, but they still can't pronounce it right. I've tried to teach people to pronounce my name, but I haven't been successful. I can't see myself marrying someone who can't pronounce my name.

TLDR: It's so hard to find an American Catholic woman who can pronounce Vietnamese names, is fine with dating a short guy, and doesn't harbor negative feelings towards the former South Vietnam. All of these things are part of Vietnamese-American culture, so basically that's the only girls I can ever find.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r97gfo/im_having_a_hard_time_connecting_with_anyone/

Last night we went for some drinks at a bar, we had good conversation but he didn’t make a move at all? Not even a compliment which I found odd considering prior to the date he said he was going to be complimenting me all night.
He seemed to be curious about my life a lot, asking a lot of questions about how my childhood was, my family, friends. I also asked him questions too. When he got back from a 10 minute bathroom break…. (Bit strange but I guess it was a busy bar and I think he had to pay for the drinks we were getting sent to our table all night) He said he realised he has to work in the morning. I told him I did too, I felt abit weird because I know guys sometimes use this as an excuse to get out of the date but I just thought, whatever at this point I’m happy to go home. We did end up still talking for another 30 minutes with him directing the conversation because I didn’t want him to feel like I was holding him there. Anyway it was about 12am and we went for a walk so he could come with me to get an Uber. We laughed a lot then hugged goodbye and i thanked him for paying for the drinks. 

After about 2 minutes of getting into my Uber he messaged me “goodnight *my name* 😘😘” 

With the kissy faces? Yet he didn’t even attempt to kiss me at all haha.

I just replied goodnight it was nice to finally meet you 🥰 and he replied it was cool to after all these years.

Anyway now I’m confused as it’s the next day and I thought I’d send him a generic message as he usually would just reply to them to turn it into a conversation, but he opened and didn’t reply?

Does anyone else know that they're too picky for their current status? I'm educated, kind, and hardworking but I also know that to 99% of the population I'm also very unattractive physically. But I'm also very picky when it comes to dating. I can't compromise on some things like politics, kids, or smoking, as that would just not work and would be unfair to both of us, but other more minor things like the photos on someone's profile, them not adding any text, their relative hight/appearance/demeanor from their profile description all play, usually negatively, into me swiping left. I'm trying to better my health and appearance, (for me not for dating but that would a nice bonus if it would help me) but even then I think I would still be extremely picky when it comes to dating. Currently I'm a 3 appearance wise on a good day, and a 2 most of the time. I have a very small window of attraction physically and a fairly wide one when it comes to personality and shared interests, and if I don't know the person then I only have appearance to go off of. I also would NOT feel comfortable approaching a coworker or classmate for a date, even if I've seen them on the same sites and wanted to swipe right. I can't risk that going badly. I just wish that my appearance was in line with my attraction.

I'm (19) in university and I asked this girl (18) out. She's very innocent, I kept giving her signs that I like her but her kindness is pretty general. She's an international student who came here and she doesn't have many friends. She's like the type who doesn't think about relationship or even thought about having a boyfriend. She just studies everyday like a really good student. She even talked about having some friends who never talked to her again. I tried offering to buy her food but she refuses. Our first hang-out just became homework helping session.

Her boyfriend who works in the army moved to the city I live in about a year ago, and befriended my boyfriend.She moved here about 6 months ago and we quickly became friends. I always thought her boyfriend was kind of shady and manipulative, but I really liked her so the four of us hung out fairly often. 

They have been together for about 5 years, and he has cheated on her multiple times and other people have warned her about his cheating. Unfortunately he is very manipulative and he somehow convinces her to stay each time. 

Fast forward to tonight. My boyfriend was at the bar, and some of the army guys her boyfriend works were there started and my boyfriend and them started chatting. They told my boyfriend that they were pissed at her boyfriend, because made out with one of the army guys girlfriends, and also how he cheated on my friend all the time when they we’re away on an army trip last month.

Selfishly, I know that if i tell her that this will be the end of our friendship. I believe that he will put it on me and it will make things worse.

38,r9a38v,1638688067,I’m having regular mental breakdowns over my fear of the dating world,"I’m 18f, a virgin, never been in a relationship or even kissed anyone. I’m late as fuck to the party, I know. 

Im a hopeless romantic and I yearn to find love one day but I pretty much avoid reading or watching anything relating to modern dating bc it horrifies me. So many things are expected that I just don’t think I’ll ever be able to handle. 

The entire concept of dating around and dating multiple people and trying to figure out who is right for you sounds exhausting. I don’t have the mental capacity for that but I feel like I have to do that in order to find someone bc that is what everyone else is doing. I’m just an option until someone deems me worthy of exclusivity and if I only date one person at a time I’m bound to end up alone.

And that’s another thing that stresses me out: the exclusivity talk. I hear people saying that you should wait 3 months or 10-12 dates until becoming exclusive and that sounds agonizing. I can’t imagine routinely seeing someone for three months knowing that they’re still fucking other people and that I’m still no more than an option to them. 

Additionally, the whole thing of sex before exclusivity just terrifies me. I’m just not comfortable sleeping with someone before I feel like we’re close enough to be exclusive (especially since I’m a virgin) but I feel this pressure to have sex before that bc if I don’t no one will want me.

I feel like everything I want and am comfortable with is just incompatible with the dating world and as a result I’m just gonna die alone. The entire idea of dating stresses me so much that it sends my anxiety into overdrive and I have breakdowns (especially when it comes to how I feel about sex. I’m legitimately afraid I may have to put myself in an uncomfortable and possibly traumatic situation in order to cater to the needs of the dating world and that scares the shit out of me).

What do I do? I feel like I have no choice but to just accept that I’ll be alone forever bc I can’t conform to what is required to succeed in dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9a38v/im_having_regular_mental_breakdowns_over_my_fear/

I have no problem with making friends and getting to know people. But I’ve been limited to dating apps in terms of meeting other women and it makes it even more depressing. 

It seems that people my age don’t want anything to do with dating or relationships. Where as I feel mature and very capable of meeting another girl and possibly making them my life long partner. I understand that im young and I have so many years to worry about that. However I’ve had so much experience with hook ups and relationships during high school to where I feel I can maintain a healthy relationship, I want something more. 

I don’t know if it’s just my city or my landscape but I’ve tried everything with sport clubs and bars and book groups but nothing seems to work.

And while I cried as it broke my heart into a million pieces, I accepted it. Because ultimately, I want him to be happy, to succeed, and to be the best version of himself.

2 months later, and we still talk after work, though the bubble has definitely burst.

I’ve tried carrying on and treating him as if nothing happened but I just now know that we won’t be together and we have to continue as JUST FRIENDS.

I’m at this crisis though, where on one hand, I’m slowly trying to be used to his absence (hence the stopping-of-the-texting) because he’s mentioned he might stop working at our workplace in the new year and tbh, it almost seems like a disservice to myself to stick around hoping he changes his mind when we don’t even know if that’ll happen. I obviously wanna stay friends with him because we vibe so well but if it’ll just ruin my chances of moving on, maybe staying away is for the best.

but i can’t also help but feel like I should hold on and be there in the chance he finally wants to ask me out. It seems silly and very irrational but I don’t wanna let go when the chance hasn’t even happened yet.

She was 15 minutes late but no worries, she texted ahead of time. We got a drink and sat at the back patio of the bar. Not even 20 minutes in when I get up to get us more water, I check my phone and she's texted me ""Ughhh I'm on the worst date"" and below it is another text: ""Mine is going OK. Having first wine."" I didn't want to cause a scene but did want to get to the bottom of that asap and she said it was so embarrassing that she texted me that. Yeah, I wonder why. She said she was texting her friend who was on an awful date. Weird. Does not make sense. Anyway, I am not quite of the confidence to just French exit on someone, but that did really derail me for the rest of the date. I don't know exactly what I said to continue the night smoothly, but anyway we continue for a second drink and seem to be connecting notwithstanding and leave for another bar. But then I suggest food since it turns out eight of us had eaten and we go to a local taqueria. We continue talking which for the most part is pretty inane and I realize she seems to really be avoiding any real personal questions about herself. Even when I asked her last night just like the normal question it is, she kind of mumbled where I actually had to lean in to hear what it was. Maybe it also wasn't good that her parents were a lawyer and artist and mine are decidedly very blue-collar. When I went to the restroom and returned, she was standing by the door and then abruptly announced she was going to catch the bus back home despite only being 2 hours into the date and that we were going to try for that other bar after dinner. After walking from the restaurant, she then no lie starts running to catch up with the bus she needs to take bus misses it. I am still not quite understanding what is happening and ask when the next one she needs is coming. She says (kind of to herself) she is on the wrong side of the street, running to the other side, and tells me to not wait up despite saying her bus isn't coming for another 20 minutes. I figure it out there and just say ""Ok, see you later!"" before turning on a dime and saving myself any further embarrassment and taking the subway to go home.

I respected it and kept seeing her. Two weeks later she breaks things off with me saying that ever since I asked her commit she lost all attraction for me and didn’t want to see me anymore.

Now she told me to stay at this seat and that shed come get me but she didn’t, i think she left with someone which would obv take priority over a bum like myself/ or the bar was being raided and she decided to exit/ or she just didn’t see me because i put my head down/or she didn’t care because i was kinda rude to her despite her being so nice, I didn’t deserve to be treated so nicely. 

Now I understand that I can’t explain everything in such a short text but what do you guys think I should do? Wait to see her at the bar again (maybe? Possibly may not happen) Text her on instagram? (should I apologize, but I don’t like doing text because when people aren’t face to face they don’t care since you’re not there) 

What are your suggestions?

58,r9c0lc,1638696030,Help,"I matched and went out with a girl a few weeks ago. Things are generally going well but there are definitely some red flags that are popping up. 

We’re both in our 30s and seem pretty compatible (per her “mas in sych). We had sex after the first date and it was actually great. We got together twice more that week (not dates lol). We’ve since kept in touch and have seen each other in person a handful of times. But sometimes the back and forth is easy and others it takes her more than a day to respond. 

My question is this: I don’t know what she wants out of this. I know the holidays can be stressful for new relationships but I don’t think I’ve given her the idea that I want to jump the gun on getting serious too fast or anything.

There's really nothing wrong with talking to people but its pretty clear that theres no issue with me being treated the same way that other guys who girls talk to are treated unless they believe something is wrong with them. ez pz all I have to do is bring that up.

I’m 22, and about two weeks ago I was broken up with. Our relationship was 7 months long and it was my first REAL relationship. At first everything was great, she asked me to move in with her within the first month however, these 7 months felt way longer as we were spending so much time together. There were good things about the relationship, but she would constantly compare me to her ex’s. I started a new job 4 months ago and we started to see each other less and less. She was very codependent, she couldn’t do anything without me. It got to a point where I could just tell something was off, so I asked her one night if she thinks we need to break up, she said we should. Instantly after that, reality hit and I went to get my stuff from our apartment. I was a mess for the next two days, and she seemed perfectly fine, even going as far as telling me that she’s so much happier now that she’s single. I made the decision to keep her on social media, and she still messages me every day/other day. I don’t know if she’s having second thoughts or trying to string me along.

62,r9cbqk,1638697338,Will girls pretend to like you so you buy their products?,"So today I was walking through the mall, and a girl working at a stall that sells skin care products points at me out of countless other people walking through the mall and signals for me to come over. She starts by asking how my day is and some basic small talk and then begins the sales pitch for her skin care items. She made it seem like she had some genuine interest she held strong eye contact was showing subtle signs of attraction to me. She even asked me if I had a girlfriend at one point to which I said no I do not and followed up with asking her “why’s that?” This girl was fairly good looking, nothing out of this world in my opinion but she was attractive. I obviously knew she was trying to sell her product. To which I was very hesitant to buy. She tried to sell me a package deal with 5 different items for a discounted price. I ended up buying 3 items and it cost $280. I can’t lie. a part of me bought the items because I genuinely felt like they would be a good purchase and it was something I was in the market for anyway. But I wasn’t planning on spending this much. And then another part of me made the purchase because I thought this girl was interested in me she even said she even gave me her number so I could text her with any “questions” this made me think she just wanted an excuse to give me her number. I’m always a reasonably attractive guy I like to think anyway. I’m in good shape I dress fairly well and I like to take care of myself. So I felt like she could have picked me out in particular because she thought I was attractive. Anyway I ended up texting this girl with a question about one of the products. She gave me a simple response answering the question but didn’t come off too eager to engage in conversation. Now I just feel like I got played. Like I got singled out. She pretended to show interest and now I’m down $280 on some skin care products and it’s pretty embarrassing. Even though I think the products will do me some good. I definitely didn’t plan on spending this much. Almost feel like it’s a similar situation to how strippers will pretend to like a guy so they spend money on them.

Before i came to spain i met this guy on tinder and we became friends (who flirted) and texted almost everyday, then he started texting me less and leaving me on read a lot and it made me overthink so i cut him off and blocked on everything, because i thought he just wanted me as a texting buddy when he was bored and never had intentions of meeting once i arrived to spain.

now i’ve been here 3 months and i just re added him on instagram and apologized and explained how i was overthinking the situation so i backed out. he said he didn’t have anything against me and understood my overthinking issue, and now we’re friends again, or potentially dating i honestly don’t know.

so i told him yeah 100% we have to. and he said “tomorrow if you’re not hungover (i was going to the club that night) let’s do something” and i said when and he said “idk whenever”

i’m gonna be honest i’m not good at recognizing good/bad signs. so i’m just wondering if the “idk whenever” is a sign of low effort or whatever on his part, or am i just overthinking? i have anxiety so if i’m overthinking pls don’t be mean about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9cgml/is_this_a_red_flag_18f_21m/

67,r9cwgx,1638699745,My guy friend (20M) dedicated a romantic song to me (21F),"Hello! I've been friends with this guy for more than 6 years now.

I've had a happy crush on him on our first few months in school (and first few months knowing each other), but that faded over time, probably because we were always in the same group and I saw him and talked to him nearly everyday in school that I got used to him. I also had no interest in relationships and had my fair share of crushes that change every so often. Since then we became good friends (not too close, just casual friends).

We rarely go out as a group, even prior to the pandemic, so my experiences with him were only ever at school. Today, however, was a special one so we as a group decided to have some fun. After getting some food, we ended up at a karaoke place to end the night.

He was a very good singer and I just could not sing for the life of me. As expected, our friends cheered him on and he happily sang a variety of songs for us, alternating with a few of my friends who were also very enthusiastic (but not as good) at singing. It was getting late and we were about to leave so he asked that he play one more song...

Then he dedicated the song to me. Specifically.

Then the romantic song started playing.

He started singing the song and finished it. I did not know how to react so I just sang along with it even though I'm pretty sure the little butterflies in my stomach started acting up. Some of our friends started teasing us but I acted like I heard nothing.

After the song, he then gave me the microphone and asked me to sing. Dang it. Our friends cheered me on -- forced me to sing.

I gave it a go even though I wanted the floor to eat me up because of how badly my voice sounded. I wanted to stop every now and then because of embarrassment but he would tell me to continue and hand the mic over to me. Whenever our friends wanted to steal the microphone, he would tell them to let me sing. I played it cool and sang the song even though their ears probably bled. Hahaha.

I still see him as a friend although I admit this incident stirred up a few butterflies in my stomach.

What do you think about his action/s based solely on this one event? Is it normal as a friend or could it mean something more?

TLDR; my guy friend dedicated a romantic song to me, asked me to sing even though I sound horrible, and wanted me to keep singing even though my friends wanted me to stop. Do you think this is friend behavior or could it be something more?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9cwgx/my_guy_friend_20m_dedicated_a_romantic_song_to_me/
68,r9d3h6,1638700580,Met a China Girl on a dating app and went on a date with her,"I never really had faith on dating apps or at least on the one I was using, it's called ""TanTan"". I matched with this girl that I thought she was cute and decided to asked her out on a date. She was like okay and I was like ""too easy to be true"". I felt something was off, that's for sure but I don't know what. So, curious me decided to go on a date with her anyway. We decided to meet nearby her place, at 3 pm. I arrived at 3 pm and she's nowhere to be found, apparently she's still busy with work. I waited for almost an hour and she finally showed up. She's not what she look like in the photos, a totally different person. I was like okay, lemme just hang for a bit and see how it goes. First thing she said was, ""I'm kinda shy"".  We chatted while we walked so I was not really paying attention to where we are heading as I'm just following her. She brought me into an elevator in some creepy building where it leads me into a fancy private restaurant. My first thought was,  ""Damn this looks expensive"". I decided to rolled with it anyway because I'm dumb and curious (and also dared by a friend). 

&amp;#x200B;

She sat down on a sofa and I sat beside her on a bigger sofa. We chatted till waiter brought the menu, she took it and ordered some stuffs. Before I can take a look at the menu, she gave the menu back and the waiter walked away. We chatted again, till the waiter brought two glass of red wine. She was like ""cheers"", so I did the same and we took a sip of the red wine (tasted pretty good tho). There's like curtain surrounding the sofa and table (for private/intimate purposes). The waiter closed the curtain and we were alone. We chatted more and the waiter came over again, asking us to pay first. Since she brought me here, ordered some stuffs that I did not get to choose, I decided to pretend like I was busy for a second and see if she's doing anything about the bill. She was just on her phone and ignoring the waiter. So I asked, how much is it? The waiter showed me the receipt and I'm pretty sure my eyes are okay $1624.25. Two glass of wine for $1600 and a popcorn chicken. I expected it to be expensive but NOT THAT expensive. I was like.. oh.. and she decided to take a glance at the receipt, then she asked the waiter ""How much alcohol % is the wine?"". I told the waiter hold up, he left and I confronted her. 

  


I said ""I'm not trying to be rude but you should've asked me first. I can't afford this."" She replied, ""Oh, I'm not that kind of girl, we can split the bill"". Somehow I knew she liked me and I'll probably get laid at her place later on if I decided to say okay but I was thinking, if we split, it's still a shit ton of money for a glass of wine and I'm not willing to pay for it. I told her again, ""I still can't afford this and you should've really asked me first"". She replied, ""This is usually how I spend my time and money with my friends when we go out. You can leave, I'll pay for it."". Luckily, she is willing to pay for it, I said ""nice to meet you"" and I left. She texted me immediately after I left, saying "" Why didn't you accompany me?"".  


  
We knew nothing about each other, she probably faked her age as well. I just don't understand how someone expect a stranger to pay insane amount of money for just a glass of wine on the first date. Anyway, it's a pretty funny experience overall and I sipped a $800 glass of wine for free.

74,r9dr85,1638703407,Am i scaring him off?,"I desperately need an advice 🥺🥺

I met a guy off a dating app a few months back. At the beginning everything seemed to go smoothly, he showed quite a bit of interest to talk to me, asking me here and there about my life and none of these are anything like sexting. He also mentioned he was looking for a relationship but still open to anything basically (not sure what this means either). 

But i basically held on what he said (about relationship thing) because I’m not really into hookups - I think they are a waste of time and plus I tend to form attachments with physical contact (even when i know from the beginning it’s nothing serious). 

So with this guy, we’ve met for 3 dates so far (in the course of 3 months). I do think this is quite little, honestly we couldve met up more often if he wasnt sick.. but yeah basically each time we meet it’s always at night and our times spent together basically just consist of us netflix-and-chilling, watching movies, cuddling and touching each other. We havent had sex but I did gave him a handjob and he also fingered me. 

Recently though I realized he’s been taking a step back with his replies. Not much interest to sustain the online conversation. I’m not really sure why.. So this has been boggling me because I’m afraid that I am forming an attachment emotionally, and perhaps falling for him (or the idea of him becoming my bf). 

Last night I raised this up because i am really confused. He said he’s looking for a relationship at the beginning but i feel like he’s treating me more like a hookup, which is really confusing to me. 

So I told him I want to make it clear at the beginning because I have gone thru similar instance before and I don’t want the same thing to happen again (bc I felt used by the previous guy). After the talk, his reaction was “but i thought you’re looking for friends on tinder” (i did say this yeah), on which i answered “yeah friends but not fwb” after that i sensed quite a bit of awkwardness and so i just dropped the topic and then i did gave him a handjob. Halfway he suddenly stopped me and said “i think it’s fine, i don’t want to use you, we can just sleep I’m tired” can someone explain to me what this means? What’s in his mind?

I did feel like we had chemistry + alcohol + I was lacking some physical intercourse experience so I’d say that’s why it happened so fast. But I basically totally enjoyed both parts of the evening.

81,r9e910,1638705509,Why do girls dance with guys at bars/clubs if they have a boyfriend? Or are not interested?,"I'm a 26m and I was out in Angel, London last night and to set some background the area is full of bars that become somewhat In-between a club at the end of a night, so the environment is friendly and people are generally more approachable and you can actually talk. 

I was approached by six girls in total, all of whom were dancing with me. The dancing wasn't casual to say the least, there was touching in let's say more intimate places from both parties, one even decided to put her legs on me. 

Yet, when it came to me trying to initiate something further, like going in for a kiss or asking for their numbers, I got a no back with most saying the reason was that they have a boyfriend. 

While I recognise that for some this could be an excuse, it surely couldn't be the case for all of them. So my question why would someone do this if they had a significant other? Or was it possibly something I did that put them off? 

I'm not gonna criticise someone for having fun, it's just that it leaves me feeling confused haha, so I'm curious as to why people do this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9e910/why_do_girls_dance_with_guys_at_barsclubs_if_they/

93,r9fhfv,1638710054,The Looming Dating Apocalypse,"  


I’ve read a few articles over the past year or so that paint a bleak picture of the dating scene today and in the immediate future. I’m certain there is an element of media scaremongering in all of them, but I’ve thought very deeply about them and wanted to get others’ opinions/input. 

To summarize: Despite everything we hear about the gender pay gap, more women are enrolled in college right now than men, and for years, more women have been graduating than men. More and more women are becoming working professionals and making comfortable sums while more men are losing ground in terms of financial viability. One article interviewed professional women in NYC who were having a hard time finding suitable men who made as much as them. Another used a phrase like “breeding apocalypse” to describe the increasingly disproportionate ratio of professional women to “broke dudes.” The consensus at this point seems to be that college-educated professional women are less likely to date or consider dating men who aren’t also college-educated professionals. With the number of college-educated professional men shrinking, that leaves fewer and fewer choices. 

My apologies if I haven’t summed this up very well, but my question is: Where does society at large (and dating in general) go from here? What will the future look like? My first thought was that we’d seen a large and growing class of disenfranchised young men who are deemed unworthy of dating or mating with, but then again, with such lopsided numbers, we could also see women loosening their financial standards for potential partners while more men occupy decently paying trade jobs. 

It could go one of a thousand ways, but I’m certain that we’re seeing a shift in a different direction. Where do you see it going?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9fhfv/the_looming_dating_apocalypse/
94,r9fo5o,1638710692,How long should a conversation on a dating app last? When is the ideal time to ask for a date or meetup?,"23 M just seriously trying dating apps for the first time.

How long are girls generally interested in talking for on dating apps? Are you after a quick exchange and then the guy asking for a date/meetup? Or are longer conversations where you can get a sense for each other first preferred? I know it's a bit of a ""how long is a piece of string?"" question really, and I know one woman can't answer for everyone, that is not what I'm implying, I'm just trying to get a sense for it.

I'm finding that most of the conversations I have with girls, even if the conversations are good and we seem into each other and we're finding interesting stuff to talk about, generally fizzle out after not too long, maybe 10-20 messages or so. I'm starting to think maybe I'm doing it wrong or something. Maybe I should just be asking them out after a few messages. Idk. Genuinely curious what you guys think :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9fo5o/how_long_should_a_conversation_on_a_dating_app/
95,r9fodl,1638710715,Now I get- this is for my advice for men &amp; women about dating,"I’m a 27F and have dated / talked to quite a few men in my lifetime. I’ve had 2 serious relationships that  both ended terribly and catapulted me to go to therapy. I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years on and off now and have grown so much in my confidence in relationships and what I want. Now I’m slowly entering the dating scene again and I realized something HUGE last night. People show their true colors to you in about 2 weeks.

There’s two guys I’m talking to. One was very considerate about me being sick and saying I had to cancel our date. He offered to buy me lunch to make me feel better. His small action really made me feel cared for and seen. He approached the situation in a mature way.

The other guy I’m talking to has fun conversation with me , but he completely ignored important things I was telling him and it made me feel unseen. Last night I broke down into tears and asked myself why I was so upset. I was upset because it reminded me of my past self who settled for less and allowed people to treat me however they wanted to on their time. It reminded me of my ex who was more into his own self than making an active effort to have conversation about my wants and needs. Needless to say after this breakdown, I realized guy 2 was making me anxious and this wasn’t a healthy attachment right off the bat. If it isn’t making me feel good I need to listen to my gut and act on that feeling. While guy 1 isn’t exactly my type, he’s been actively conscious of me aka asking how I’m feeling, talking about my interests, etc.I haven’t felt at all anxious when talking to him or thinking about him. Needless to say I do not think I’m going to talk to guy 2 anymore bc it really opened my eyes to who he is. 

Men and women-listen to your gut. It’s easy to ignore signs and red flags bc you like the attention and fun of dating, but in the end you already have the information laid out. Don’t continue to make excuses for people -they know how they act. There are good people out there who will treat you how you should be treated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9fodl/now_i_get_this_is_for_my_advice_for_men_women/
96,r9fp83,1638710802,Accepting being ghosted and moving on (ranty),"So I've been texting this girl for close to a month now. We've gone on two dates and one kinda pseudo date. 

 We were getting along grand. All the text conversations went pretty well. Big looong paragraphs. Even kept it up while I was on tour with the band in another country. Every day. Just chatting bollox,about music, everything. 
 Dates went ok/good too I think. 

In reality I probably should've taken off the rose tinted glasses and seen that she would consistently reply a good bit of time afterwards whereas I'd take like 1hr tops. Body language was very awkward on the third date too. Although she said she enjoyed herself and would do it again after the first one. Said the 2nd went good too. Third one probably could've gone better. It went great I thought but again,I haven't a clue how to gauge how a woman's feeling. 

Ghosting began the evening after that. I gave her space for that day and a half cause she had a super important exam. Thought about wishing her luck that day but I imagine she's been able be disciplined,and stay off the phone, and not get distracted (unlike myself) so I didn't. Should've though.

Texted her then yesterday to see if I could call, no response. Unsent the text. I'd say it's done that's the final blow. I see her active the odd time. See her post to her stories Message received. 

Definitely had feelings for her. Well probably still have. I pinch myself cause she is objectively out of my league. Like she's really cute. And super smart, funny and runs a magazine. She's cool

She could be thinking about anything. Apparently she just got out of a long relationship so that could be something she's thinking about. Or our mutual friend who's in hospital but can't be visited. It's a tough time. 


Maybe it's just me being impatient. 
But I'm accepting rejection. I would like to just hear it properly. I've let conversations die naturally as well in the past after a first date but after this much? I dunno is it wrong to want a no? I want to be rejected and move on. 

At the same time I don't wanna call her and give her some ultimatum. I value her choice and emotions as a grown ass woman. 

It gets muddier then. Texted a girl from years ago on tinder that I'm not even that interested in. That's not the play or maybe it is I dunno. 

Reading all these online articles about dating can be useful and also accelerates the emotional rollercoaster. As a man in my early 20's who's never been in a relationship. This was a great experience cause I got to feel (even if it wasn't real) what it was like to feel someone was interested in me. 

It's a learning experience anyway sure. I've learnt loads. Now I need to get back to my assignments and not fail this degree cause I couldn't stop thinking about yer wan. Ill try be patient and who knows maybe she installed insta and is ignoring me till exams are over. Time will tell

TLDR Recognize yer being needy before it's too late lol
