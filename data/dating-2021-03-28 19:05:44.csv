0,mfddke,1616976357,FWB hurt more than expected,"I'm hurt and bitter after walking away from a FWB, but I'm mostly really mad at myself. I just need to vent without judgement from friends. So this will probably sound really disorganized. 

Anyways, I met this guy at an internship 3 years ago. Saw each other for about 3 months, had deep conversations/connection but after a while I wanted to know where this was going. This was the first guy I have gotten this close/comfortable with in my life. I wanted a relationship, he wanted FWB. We enjoy each other's company but he doesn't want a relationship at all with anybody. Stupid me wanted him so I settled for less and continued this FWB thinking he cared about me and I could handle this kind of situation. We used to talk a lot/meet every week but after agreeing to the FWB, we only message each other every 2 weeks (sometimes longer) about sex, usually when it's convenient for him. When we decided on this FWB, I asked him to keep this a secret since we have mutual peers. I have caught him on more than 1 occasion talking about the things we do together. We have talked about it and he apologized but he did it again anyways! The last couple of weeks he has been treating me differently and made me feel bad for wanting to talk about my needs and how he has hurt me. Despite this, I still liked him even though he didn't feel like the same person I had met in the beginning. 

I thought I could date around until I met somebody who is relationship material, but it has been pretty unsuccessful. 
And it took me way too long to realize how much this has hurt me more than it would have if I just walked away in the beginning to focus on myself. I guess I was just so lonely and was addicted to that physical touch and attention. 
I blocked him eveywhere without explaining because I don't feel obligated to. My emotions blinded me, I didn't set/respect my boundaries, and I chose to ignore the things that were hurting me. I don't even want him anymore, I just feel really dumb for wasting so much time doing something I didn't even want in the first place. I can't believe I let somebody treat me as badly as he did to me. 
I don't think I would ever do this again and am treating this a lesson from my youth to have more self respect. I have value and I obviously deserve better, I'm taking as much time as I need to recover and learn to forgive myself so I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfddke/fwb_hurt_more_than_expected/

I made the mistake of only being rationally and emotionally attractive and didn't notice I also had to be sexually attractive so things got boring real fast.

I used to enter relationships not knowing shit about how the dynamics worked and expected everything to be okay simply because I was too inexperienced to understand what was right and wrong. I learned this at the age of 19. lessons hurt because you feel they could have been avoided but there's really nothing that can be done. I've been sexually repulsive all this time without knowing it.

I just have to be grateful for this. There's no other appropriate reaction.

In the past I was rationally repulsive, I fixed that. In the past I was emotionally repulsive, I'm fixing that too. Now I just realized I need to be sexually attractive too. ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfdhzg/alright_heres_what_i_learned_so_far_you_gotta_be/
2,mfdnwz,1616977344,Should I date an 18 or 19 year old just for the experience?,"So I (25M) have never had a girlfriend before and the older I get the more I realize a lot of girls my age and older see that as a turnoff. 

People always say your first relationships usually don’t last and looking through statistics that seems to be true. That kinda gives me some anxiety realizing the older I get that even when I do potentially get a girlfriend all that time and energy will probably be spent on something that won’t last. I know that’s not a great mentality to come in with but tbh I probably wouldn’t even want it to last since I wouldn’t want that to limit my potential experiences with dating other girls. 

Something else that scares me is that even girls in their early 20’s who are younger than me are likely to be more experienced than me so even dating them might be hard and they’d probably be turned off by my lack of experience too. 

My friend suggested I try looking for like an 18/19 year old girl just to get dating experience under my belt. He said they’d be the most inexperienced girls I could find and that they probably wouldn’t be looking for something long-term anyway and just looking to have fun. He said they’d also probably be easier for me to date since they might already just be somewhat attracted by the fact that I’m older and they wouldn’t really be able to suss out that I’m too inexperienced since we’d basically be on the same level playing ground. He said I’d probably have a rough time tryna date most girls in their 20’s - and I get it, it’s kinda like I’m reading at 3rd grade level so I have to drop down a few grades to fit in where I’m best suited. 

Do you guys think this is good advice? How exactly do you guys think I could go about trying to find and date a girl that’s that much younger than me?

3,mfdpmm,1616977513,"Guy I've gone out with twice and set up for a third updated his dating app profile, is that a bad sign or should I just ignore?","Hi everyone, I know this sounds kind of obnoxious and paranoid but basically I've been talking to this guy I met from an app for a few weeks. We've gone on 2 dates that went really well, and he asked me out again for last Friday night, but Friday morning he tested positive for Covid.

We actually found out we are neighbors (his house is a 2 min walk away), so to be nice I offered to leave him groceries or whatever he needs outside and he actually took me up on it, so I did that for him on Saturday and he was super appreciative and texted me a bit after asking about my plans for the night.

We haven't gotten physical yet (I was figuring we would on the third date, but obviously we couldn't hangout since he got Covid). But the chemistry is really good and on our last date we talked and laughed the entire time without any awkward silences.

At any rate, I haven't gone on the app much since meeting him just because honestly it feels like work going on that app and I'm busy, so I'd rather just not go on while I'm talking to this guy. I went on last night to show my mom his pic, lol, and I noticed he updated his profile with a new picture and some new descriptions (i.e. he wrote ""entertain me during my 10 days in quarantine!!"" - so he obviously updated it as recently as Friday).

I know I really shouldn't be upset about it I mean we have only hung out twice and not done anything physical, but I guess it just made me think, maybe he's not really that interested in me given that he's trying to find other girls to talk to? If he's just keeping his options open that's fine and expected, I'm just hoping I'm not just a placeholder and he's not really into me and just waiting for someone better.

does anyone have any advice?

6,mfdtaz,1616977868,Rejected twice,"Hi,
I will try to make this as short as possible. I met a women (20y/o) (I’m 22) at my work and got along in person. Exchanged numbers and I messed up badly through texting (over pursuing or as ppl saying ""simping""). Lasted for about 2 weeks of texting not much coming from her side of the texts. Got rejected after 2 weeks of texting (she was very polite saying she was kinda interested in someone else but rly likes being my friend and wants to stay friends) told her I was disappointed but appreciated her honesty &amp; stopped pursuing. 4 days later she says she didn’t even see my text til today thanks. Pretended to have deleted her number and she laughed. Told her I was just kidding 5 days later &amp; hoped she did well on her exams. Then a couple days later I told her I was interested in a few women but truthfully felt there was potential btwn us &amp; that I respected her being transparent about her situation &amp; if she just sees friendship moving forward I acknowledge her decision. She responds by addressing me as homie sorry if I hurt ur feelings but I am not interested in a relationship with you. I left it there then she texts me back 2 days later saying her friends sent that and it sounded very rude also that she is now seeing the guy she was initially interested hoping everything’s cool and we can still stay friends. I Responded two days later saying I’d appreciate you give me some space thanks (I didn’t want to leave things there w/o saying anything &amp; I undoubtedly will never argue with a women). it’s now been 18 days since we’ve spoken. I approached this women wrong by giving her all the attention. What do you guys who are not in this situation think of how I handled it &amp; how she responded ?

13,mfebq2,1616979648,Is he actually busy or just not interested anymore?,"For context, I went on a date with a guy from hinge two weeks ago. We got dinner and had drinks, which he paid for despite me offering to split the check. He walked me to my car and before I left, he suggested we go to his favorite restaurant for our second date. I said yes because I felt some sort of connection and we had great conversations during the night.

He told me to text him when I got home and I did. We both confirmed again that we had a lot of fun and can’t wait for the next date too. That second date was supposed to be last night but he cancelled in the morning because he said he has been too stressed out with work and doesn’t want to bring bad energy to the date. I want to believe that he’s actually busy but I’m also skeptical about whether or not he’s still interested in seeing me... since our first date, I’ve been the one initiating most of the conversations, which have been short. I was also the one that had to text him yesterday morning about whether or not our date was still on... I feel like if I didn’t reach out, he probably wouldn’t have said anything to me?

He also mentioned yesterday that we could potentially do something this upcoming week because he “should be better by then.” What does this mean?? I want to believe that he’s still interested but I’m a major overthinker.

I just don’t get why he would initiate a second date and express major interest through text, but not follow through with the date as planned... I understand he’s busy with work but he told me before that he’s almost always free at night on the weekends.

As time passed we had arguments here and there her, she was an ultra planner and I am not as I had not much going on with school and covid, jobless. I could never get a good nights sleep anytime we hung out. We went on a bday vacation trip and everything, then several months go by and one night she said she needed me to come over and was mad I didnt cause I was busy with finals. Someone who admitted they couldn’t relate to my feelings or problems or try to help. From that point on, she acted very distant and eventually told me she couldnt be my gf anymore and was willing to try something else like FWB. As time went by things were downgraded and we hadnt seen each other in weeks and she said she couldnt even text me a day anymore, I felt betrayed and felt she treated me with such disrespect to everyone else. I attempted a hail mary to save the relationship with asking her out on vday and was happy but said it wss too stressful and chose to chill with her friend who was going to be sad over an ex that day. 


I basically said have a nice life and told her she treated me like shit compared to how she was to me before. Within minutes of that text, She immediately  unfollowed me on everything. Felt I spoke my heart but she was shocked how I reacted and bragged about being a “heartbreaker” on her bio for about a month.  I felt bad and didnt wanna remembered as some asshole who cut her off, so I wrote a lengthy personal email apologizing about my current depressed state of mind and wished her luck with finals via text. That was several weeks ago and she hasnt responded. Ive been so desperate to hear from her but Im not willing to go further and push boundaries or space just for an awkward response. 

Its been almost two months since I had a convo with her and a relationship that was barley 5 months and I still feel like its my fault. She was the only handful of people Ive seen during this whole year and it hurts so much.

I was bullied a lot growing up, and online in more recent times (flooded with comments about how “f*cking ugly” I am). 

I acknowledge (in pretty much any aspect, maybe, not just about sex and relationships) that my view of the world is likely seen through a very corrupted and damaged lens.

I see all these, 30 and 40, even 50 and 60 (you get the point) year old virgins online, and due to my existing history, I feel I’m at high risk of joining them.

I’ve been told to focus on career/money. I’ve been told to NOT make money too big of a focus. I’ve been told to focus on myself. I’ve been told to interact with others. I’ve been told that a partner can’t save your life or give you meaning/purpose. I’ve been told that they CAN save your life and give you meaning/purpose.

OK. Let’s say I really went into overdrive and got qualified for top jobs, like engineering, programming, etc...

If I became successful enough, I could actually AFFORD this technology. So that could be a reason to focus on money, right? Better than being lonely AND poor, right? 

Life doesn’t make any sense to me.

I’ve struggled with social difficulties my entire life.

While having a hyperrealistic companion could provide not only sexual but emotional needs, I’m not sure any AI can ever be a proper substitute for real human companions. 

It could be both comforting AND depressing, accepting that you couldn’t get a match with any real life partners (of your preferred sex/gender).

I guess this is just me venting because I don't know what advice anyone is going to be able to give. I'll take whatever. Words of encouragement, your own personal stories, advice if you've got it...

I'm a late 20's female. I've dated a decent amount, had some relationships, but not once have I had a healthy relationship and I've never truly felt wanted by any guy I've ever dated. I'm smart, have a great job, good friends, hobbies, I'm active and in shape, and I think I'm pretty attractive.

The men who I've dated or been with are somewhat similar in the sense that they are cold, distant, I made the effort, and some were emotionally abusive. I've walked away from these relationships and haven't allowed myself to be in a bad relationship for too long, but it still hurts.

The last guy I was with had a lot of inner demons and struggled a lot. He didn't even understand himself so he couldn't begin to understand the pain he caused me. I felt unwanted and disregarded in that relationship and that was awful. It made me feel resentful and sad and it was for the best that my most recent relationship ended.

I went on a first date last night since my last breakup which occurred last summer. It went fine. The guy was nice. Haven't heard from him. I've decided not to text him or say anything because I'm always the one making the effort. For once, I'd like the guy to make an ounce of effort.

Now everytime she comes and they meet, they kiss on the cheek and hug (REALLY??

I will try to make this as short as possible. I met a women (20y/o) (I’m 22) at my work and got along in person. The day we exchanged numbers we spent our lunch break together &amp; she was fidgeting a lot, fixing her hair &amp; showing me funny videos of her &amp; her friends and she wouldn’t show one video bc she said she looked bad. Then we locked eyes for a good 5 seconds while not saying much then I broke the contact. After receiving her # I messed up badly through texting (over pursuing or as ppl saying ""simping""). Lasted for about 2 weeks of texting not much coming from her side of the texts. Got rejected after 2 weeks of texting (she was very polite saying she was kinda interested in someone else but rly likes being my friend and wants to stay friends) told her I was disappointed but appreciated her honesty &amp; stopped pursuing. 4 days later she says she didn’t even see my text til today thanks. Pretended to have deleted her number and she laughed. Told her I was just kidding 5 days later &amp; hoped she did well on her exams. Then a couple days later I told her I was interested in a few women but truthfully felt there was potential btwn us &amp; that I respected her being transparent about her situation &amp; if she just sees friendship moving forward I acknowledge her decision. She responds by addressing me as homie sorry if I hurt ur feelings but I am not interested in a relationship with you. I left it there then she texts me back 2 days later saying her friends sent that and it sounded very rude also that she is now seeing the guy she was initially interested hoping everything’s cool and we can still stay friends. I Responded two days later saying I’d appreciate you give me some space thanks (I didn’t want to leave things there w/o saying anything. it’s now been 18 days since we’ve spoken.

Despite having a healthy list of matches pretty regularly, no one seems to want to talk. Fair enough. My sense of humor is a little quirky and few people get me, but the ones who do seem to like me. 
 Anyways, I get to talking to one gal recently and we have a mutual interest in hiking. Not just casual hiking, but “we should get together for that 10 miler soon” hiking. Super awesome to find someone whose that down for the cause! She seemed a little off in text, but once I called her she seemed pretty cool. We have a date scheduled for Wednesday, and she pushes back to Friday. No big deal, I’m off work then as well and it’s just a slight shuffle of my plans for the week. Talk to her briefly Friday morning, and again as I’m about to leave. As I’m pulling away from my house she cancels... saying she has things she wants to get done before she “chills” but maybe we can get together later in the day. My response was a simple “yeah, maybe.” 
 She texts me today, just chatty normal stuff that we had talked about previously. I told her she seems cool in a lot of ways but I’m not feeling the vibe anymore, and that Friday was pretty disappointing. She was a little upset but understanding and respectful. 
 Point of the whole story? I’m proud of myself for standing my ground and not continuing to try and pick low hanging fruit. The me from a year ago would’ve continued talking to her.

45,mfgtk9,1616988824,Am I (31f) looking for reasons to end it with him (28m) or is this totally reasonable?,"Hi! I (31F) have been seeing someone (28M) for about 2 months now. Disclaimer: I went through a bad breakup in 2020 (beginning of fall) but it lingered a bit for a few months after. That said, I worked through things and healed a lot, so when I started going on dates, I knew I couldn't expect a lot but I was also open to new men.

I met him (28M) and during our first conversation, felt a really deep mutual understanding. We talked a lot about spiritual things, philosophical things, and we shared a lot of similar views. It was refreshing considering the city I live in (which I plan on moving out of in 3 months) is full of people who are really different from me (hence why I'm wanting to move), so it's kind of a scarcity thing when I meet someone who's deep, spiritual, not into substances, etc.

I was really excited after date 1, and date 2, and date 3... but then after that, I started to feel less attraction for some reason. Keeping in mind that my ex was trying to communicate with me during this time, but I was really focused on the new guy because I felt a strong interest at the beginning. But then the date before we went to his house, I started to feel less interested. It felt like our conversations had a *lot* of silence, and he seemed to like this, but I really need intellectual stimulation. I like to connect through conversation and had no issue with this with my ex (I know, it's wrong to compare people, but it's a baseline). This new guy also started telling me things about his past that then started to seem a little less... fantastic. I know everyone has a past, a history, but the way he described some things, it turned me off a bit. That said, when we kissed, I felt a connection, so I saw him again a few more times. Then when I went to his place, he was *obvious* about really gearing up for sex... lol, I know a lot of people are quick to jump into bed, but we're from similar religious backgrounds and I thought he understood that it'd take me a while (since we talked about it) and I thought he'd get it. But it was sort of like dating a non-religious dude, sex-wise... he was kind of pushy a couple of times, and then the next time I saw him, same thing, and same thing tonight. He assumes I'll just want it, even though I *keep* telling him I'll *verbally express* when I'm ready. Tonight it got annoying, and then I also started noticing how the silence wasn't just because of him being really peaceful... I sort of think he just isn't as intellectual as what I'd connect with. I started to accept this could be the truth, and then it got more and more obvious. And he's done little white lies already, but then quickly has corrected himself when he sees I can tell he's not telling the truth. He did the same thing tonight - we were both naked (I insisted on putting on underwear) and he was on top of me, I told him to get off just because I wasn't comfortable, and then he said he could get a condom so I wouldn't worry about contact (but implying we wouldn't have sex). The way he said it though, I could tell he was ""hoping"" it was just end in sex... so I called him out on it and he goes, ""no no I really meant it, for your comfort...."" (2 secs later)... ""ok yeah, I guess I was hoping for sex""... when I heard that, it just *turned me off so badly*. He seems VERY sex-driven, and I get that it's tough to date someone for a few weeks without sexual contact, but... I made it very clear early on that I wasn't like that, and he seemed to get that. I've dated non-religious men who understood more than this guy does.

Anyway, it's the little white lies (his willingness I guess to sort of lie so overtly, but he doesn't even ""mean"" to), the pushiness with sex, the lack of intellectual spark... I'm like... I should let this guy go, right? I can't tell if I'm just looking for reasons, or if I'm justified. When we were in bed (not having sex, just messing around) I got this very sudden ""I can't imagine myself doing this for the rest of my life"" message communicated to me and I just knew then and there that a lot of the attraction was gone for me (it was just so sudden that it surprised me). I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to act on this, but because I'm off dating apps and he's super into me and I have a history of moving on very quickly, I just can't tell if I'm too dismissive or if I'm just legitimately picking up on major things quickly.

about two-three weeks ago, i finally mustered up the courage and we went and sat in a park and just talked.  it went really really well and at some point, she also jokingly mentioned how her friends all knew me as “the awkward starbucks incident fella/that really awkward guy”. 

following that, she invited me over to her place for saint patty’s day and i went and drank and met some of her friends. at some point, i was outside with just one of her friends and they asked me “so how long have you and (girl) known each other?” as i was about to answer, (girl) comes outside and the friend says “-thats okay, you dont have to respond now.”

lastly, two days ago she invited me back to the park again under the pretense of sitting with her and “spying” on her other friend who was on date. as we were sitting there, she brought up being on facetime with her mom while she was waiting for me to get there and noted how her mom “REALLY” wanted to talk to me on facetime and was apparently very adamant about doing so. to which she responded “no mom that would be way too much.” 

phew. all of that to say, i very much do like this individual and have been eternally tormented within wanting to explicitly ask her on a “date date” as i am entirely unsure if these past events have been dates or not. i have just assumed they’ve just been hangin out (as to not be a weirdo by my own standards as well as not exist on a void-ridden plane of misplaced hope). 

and so, my question is- does it seem like any of these things might hint at her potentially saying yes to the date dates/being interested? idk, i am definitely over-reading a good bit of this but i also just really would like to ask her and just kind of need any logical basis for finding the tenacity to do so. pls help.

PS- on saint patty’s i legitimately THREW UP in her bathroom and was very much upfront about it (i cleaned it all before doing so). with that, she is still frequently talking to me and we have hung-out since which is incredibly baffling haha.

Considering I used to be a very cold person, this may not even necessarily be a bad thing - just leads to more hurt.

55,mfhghe,1616991270,My boyfriend (M37) has been having an emotional affair with his ex (F27) for 5 months,"My boyfriend of 2 years (M37) came to me a month ago and told me he has been talking to his "" ex-girlfriend "" (F27) for the past 6 months through text messages. She lives 11 hours away. I was having a really hard time at the beginning of the fall and my boyfriend said if we were going to stay together I would have to go to counseling. I did, and have since got a lot better at dealing with my emotions. I guess during that time him and his ex started talking again ( they were never really together, but had feelings for each other. she didn't want to date him at the time so he went online and that's how we met) they have been talking behind my back for months, and I told him before that I didn't want him talking to her when we got together. He said that if we were not dating that he would be with her. He said that they have a strong emotional bond and will always be friends, and he won't ever cut her out of his life.. I'm 31 now.. and I feel like I don't have a lot of time to find someone. I was crying and upset he didn't tell me sooner and said I needed some time to process this, it's been a month and I have noticed that he really hasnt been putting in any effort to try and fix things, and has still been talking to her regularly. We have been talking about having kids within the next 2 years and getting married. I don't know what to do. He says he needs me to help him get thru this and is willing to go to therapy to recover from this. Is this fixable?

56,mfhmbt,1616991923,Flying out to see a girl after 3 dates?,"Hey fam! So I (25f) matched with a guy (30m) on Hinge from California the day before I moved to a new city. We realized we're not in the same city &amp; that was that. A month later, I'm back in CA for a week and he texts me because he noticed my Hinge location was in CA again. We got drinks that night. Date was cut short bc I was late and had plans right after so I invited him to join me for my other plans with my friends. Everyone got on well and he kissed me at the end.

He texted the next day asking to see each other again this week. On Thursday, I go to his place for a drink and we go to a restaurant near his house where he admits is one of his favorite date spots. At dinner he tells me he finds me beautiful, intelligent, high energy, etc. We go back to his place where things get very heated. We're making out but I won't let him take off any clothes so I'm just teasing him. At one point, however, he puts his hand around my throat as if he wants to sexually choke me. I immediately jump back and blow up on him. I start putting on my shoes and telling him I'm leaving, he has no right to do that without asking consent, etc. I yell at him for a good 10 mins very aggressively. He says ""I could let you walk out and that would be it but I'd rather sit here and fight it out with you."" He also took full accountability and apologized. We went back to kissing and stuff and then I drove home. It was like 2 am at this point and he called me on my drive home to make sure I got home ok- we talked for 30 mins until I got to my parking lot.   


Then he texts me again the next day asking to see me again before I fly back to my city on Sunday. So he invites me over on Saturday night and says he will order in my fav food. If a guy is inviting me to his place for a date I feel like he's just trying to get sex out of me. I show up, he makes drinks, we eat sushi, talk, &amp; then things get heated again. I make it clear from the start: ""I'm not having sex with you. "" He says 'oh yea i know i can tell"". We continue to make out, dance, drink, vibe. At one point in the night I say ""For the record, I like you. you don't have to respond but just putting it out there."" 

Of course he responds saying he likes me too but i dont think much of that since its just a courtesy. Then, we both fall asleep fully clothed on his bed. When we wake up, he suggests we get coffee and walk around the park for a bit. Btw he pays for everything insistingly. We walk around the park for two hours and just talk. He walks me to my car at the end and says ""I guess i'll have to come visit you then"". i tell him yes open invite. He texts me that night saying ""I had a great time with you. have a safe flight back lil lady""  


So now its been a month since we have last seen each other. He has me on snapchat and has sent a pic here and there but no consistent communication. Has not called or anything since I've been gone.  A week after I left California he reached out saying he wants to visit me that weekend but i said im hosting other people that weekend. So then i texted him 2 weeks later telling him i'm still expecting him to visit soon. He said ""I haven't forgotten about you. You will be expecting me soon."" He texts me the next day with dates he wants to visit. So anyways, he is coming this weekend. He's coming Friday night and leaving Sunday night. I asked what he wants to do and he said he already made some brunch/dinner reservations because he is a ""planner and couldn't help himself.""  


So all of that said-- my q is why is he coming? is he coming just to have sex? is he coming because he thinks i'm fun and he wants to have a weekend with a cute fun energy girl? or is he seeing potential in pursuing this as something further?   


Also for context, we both are minorities in a very prestigious, lucrative but not diverse profession. We have that stuff in common.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfhmbt/flying_out_to_see_a_girl_after_3_dates/

58,mfho6f,1616992135,I want to stay friends with my ex and so does he but he’s acting very weird,"I was in a relationship with this guy for a few months. The whole time we were actually dating in person was only about a month and after that I moved away but he wanted to keep it long-distance. He was a nice guy but a bit weird and I was sick of calling and long-distance in general so I started to lose feelings for him. By weird I mean inappropriate reactions to certain situations, taking things too far too fast, or things like acting like a baby, literally. I broke up with him recently and told him I’m willing to stay friends since for me that relationship wasn’t that deep and he was a nice guy. He was devastated since he got attached very fast (in less than a month). He said he was ok with being friends after a while and I thought everything was solved but the problems started from there. He kept texting me asking about what kind of friendship I would like to have with him, how often I would call/text him, and things that are basically never talked about and just come naturally. This happened a few times and it made me really uncomfortable. I kept telling him I didn’t want to have these conversations with him but he kept saying “it’s the last time”. 
The craziest thing tho was a joke he made the other day. It was EXTREMELY inappropriate and about whether I like one of my guy friends (sooo inappropriate that I’m not even gonna retell). I always knew he made weird comments but this one was just too much. He apologized but I still can’t get over it. I don’t know if I should stay friends with him. He definitely got more hurt in this breakup so is this weirdness because of this? He has been weird like this before and offended me with some of his joke but always thought he was kind and friendly just not mature enough. Plus, he keeps saying he moved on but I feel like he hasn’t. He really expects me to call/text him everyday like I do with my other friends and keeps saying thats what friends do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfho6f/i_want_to_stay_friends_with_my_ex_and_so_does_he/
59,mfhu16,1616992819,Please answer honestly,"So I'm just asking because I'm genuinely curious how people think, and understanding what's a more popular mindset puts me in perspective more. 

Say you're dating someone you're not particularity satisfied with. It's not a bad relationship per se, and the partner really does love you. But they don't really fulfill you, and you know it, but it's a stable relationship.

You meet someone with whom you have insane chemistry with and you click fantastically with. And you're just friends with this new person (or old, could be they've been in your life forever, point is that they exist). Now you've not considered them romantically yet, because obviously you're in a relationship, but you are incredibly attached to them and grateful to have them in your life.

They come out to you one day as having feelings for you. And from everything you know, you know they are your soulmate, now that you've genuinely considered it. Like, every facet of them fulfills you deeply, in ways you're partner simply genuine just can't.  You know you'd be incredibly happy with them for the rest of your life.

67,mfihn5,1616995678,Guy ended things after first date because he didn't match into the residency he wanted? Was it an excuse?,"So I \[24 F\] went on a date with a guy who was applying to residency programs. We had a good first date, ended up sleeping together and the sex was actually great! He told me he wanted to see me again when he got back from a trip he was taking (so basically he would be back 3 weeks later). I said I wanted to see him again too. We texted every day just a little. I felt more reserved with texting just because I am just getting back into dating and felt a little guarded I guess. He was also weirdly clingy after sex, trying to interlace his fingers into mine, kissing my shoulder and neck throughout the night every time he switched positions to sleep, cuddled me a lot every single time I turned or switched a position. Which was nice, butttt, I guess it was a little much for me after just one date? but it did make me unsure of if I saw another date working out or not. but basically the weekend he came back from his trip, I felt like I finally was warming up to him and wanted to put more energy and flirting into texting and definitely give a second date a chance. 

Anyways fast forward 3 weeks, he said he was coming back from his trip on Sunday. The come Friday, he messages me and asks if I'm free Saturday. I told him no I had plans bc I thought he wouldnt be back until Sunday! He says it's okay and asks if Sunday works. I was honest and said that I was busy with school work but would love to see him next weekend. He said okay. Saturday night, he asks me again if I'm free Sunday. I said yeah I just have some work to do but what time were you thinking, also are you free next weekend? He said he would be if Match went well for residency, but if not it would be a busy couple of weeks. I said I completely understood how stressed he must be and that it was okay, that I would be here. 

He stopped texting me. I texted him Sunday to ask how he was, and he was pretty short with me. Then I texted him later--no response. I texted him before I went to sleep just to reiterate that I was sorry I couldn't hang this weekend but that I did really want to see him again and was looking forward to it. 

He texts me back the next day reallyyyyyy later in the night, basically saying it was okay that I couldn't hang, but Match didn't go well and he doesn't think he can handle a relationship rn bc of that. 

So, it made me kind of start to blame myself. Maybe I should have been more flirty and texting him more after the first date? I just hadn't been feeling it yet though. I would take a couple of hours to respond to him on text bc I was busy and also bc we only went on one date imo. And I guess bc I just finally got back into dating after a 3 year relationship, I was taking it slow. Maybe if I had done that, he wouldn't have said he can't date period? Is he making an excuse? Did he mean what he said? 

I explained to him I had been taking things slow and warm up to ppl slowly, and asked him if he was sure it was nothing I did. He said no, our first date was great, but he just thinks he'll be too busy figuring out his life rn after he didn't match for a relationship. I feel kind of bad now, like maybe it was me? maybe it wasn't the residency? thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfihn5/guy_ended_things_after_first_date_because_he/

72,mfiy52,1616997765,Unsure of whether my ex-boyfriend (35M) is still interested in me (26F) or just wanting to feel like a better person. Advice?,"I’ve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone the other day and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision. We caught up a week after we broke up but I've decided to not see him for my own reasons. Lately he's been initiating more contact and has been quite persistent in catching up with me but conditions the catch up as 'clearing the air'.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfiy52/unsure_of_whether_my_exboyfriend_35m_is_still/
73,mfiz8d,1616997902,I honestly have no idea how dating works.,"Honestly I have a hard time talking about this. But I noticed this place is pretty positive for the most part so I figured why not.

 Let me give a brief idea of where I'm coming from. I was raised by a single mom who was a nurse working 16 hr days just to support us. So from the get go I have a more understanding and respect for women as I pretty much only grew up with a women around. But because of that from a very young age I learned to take care of myself which placed me outside of my age group for the majority of my life. I'm pretty much the silent guy with his friends because I don't see the world with the same lense. 

 But anyways. I'm a 29 year old male turning 30 this year and have a ton of things going on I finally had time to sit still and look at my life. I only had 3 women in my life. The first was a high school fling that cheated on me(she was a sexaholic but still) the 2nd cheated on me because I didn't want to have kids at 22. The 3rd dropped me the moment I noticed she was just using me for money. So yea. Sadly I don't have great experiences with women lol. 

 Now I don't think all women are bad. I'm just unlucky. But in all that time I never really got out and dated. App weren't a thing when I was in high-school. My first relationship lasted 3 years. The 2nd lasted 7. The 3rd was 4 months. So I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I don't think I'm a bad looking guy. Probably a good 6 or 7 when I put the effort. I also have no issues talking to women. I actually end up being good friends with them the mass majority of the ones I talk too. But when ever I try to make a move I always end up just being their friend. 

 My friends say just walk up and talk but that never worked out or I get anxiety over my past experiences. So I guess I'm making this post to see what advice people have. Thank you for reading all this lol. I tried 2 years on those dating apps and I only got I wanna say 3 matches? All of them ended up ghosting me. So I really don't think those things are for me as stuff like that just makes me think there is something wrong with me.

So naturally I started over thinking things and when she came up I asked a few questions. At first he asked truthfully but when i voiced my concerns about being a fling until they got together he got upset, told me he liked me and was taking me seriously and then blamed his out burst on alcohol.

In fact, it's hard for me to admit it, but every girl I've ever approached or spoken to on some regular basis through school or work turned me down. This means that 100% of all girls I approached turned me down one way or the other. I've only kissed girls three times in my life, but here I am at 25, still a virgin, still no girlfriend, and still getting turned down left and right, and I can't help but think that maybe, maybe I should just disappear and just not show my face ever again to a woman, maybe that my genes were meant to die and that I wasn't meant to reproduce. I mean, being a non-white in the dating field is already hard, but add to that 5'8, below average - average looking and it just adds up. And trust me, I went for below-average women, but I guess some of them have just better luck with men. Involuntary celibate is essentially what I am, but it's hard to accept it when you're at this age, you just can't help but think of girls, especially when you're a man. Biologically, the whole point of human existence is to assure the survival of the human specie through reproduction.  I try to keep a positive outlook on life, I dress nice, get haircuts and I don't like to pull the pity card, but there are times when I feel like I shouldn't exist.

89,mflelx,1617008962,Do I end things with him or give him another chance? Please be brutal with me.,"I (27F) met a guy (31M) on a dating app a few weeks ago.

We went for a walk (covid restrictions) and hit it off immediately. We arranged a second date before the first date even ended.

So on Thursday, we had our second date. Dinner at his place. We got on amazingly and kissed. Just kissed, no sex. We discussed the fact that we were both looking for something more serious, rather than a hook up. He text me later than evening to tell me what a great time he had and couldn’t wait to see me again. 

Wonderful right? 

On Saturday he asked me to meet up  the following day (Sunday) and I agreed. On Sunday at around 1pm asked if we were still good for today. I said yes. He asked me to tell him a time which suited me. I asked if 5pm was good. No response. 

Later on I double texted and asked if everything was ok, he rang me immediately said yes sorry he’d been busy and asked if I still wanted to meet that day. I said yes, let me know when you’re home and il come round. Again, no response. 

Several hours later he pops up again and says ‘You ok? Just checking that you’re alive?’ (?!)

He was the one that didn’t respond or reach out, and I could see that he was online on WhatsApp, so the message didn’t make sense. 

This was last night and I haven’t responded. 

I looked on his dating profile and can see that it’s been updated so he’s been active on there. 

If you were in this situation would you:

a. Ghost
b. Explain that you don’t think we are on the same page and end it
c. Ask him what happened

Lots of women don't wanna date short men, but that should be ok. Who are we to tell someone to date a person they're not attracted to?

Who's out there telling guys they have to date fat women?😂😂 If you're not attracted to fat women you don't have to date them right? And sure, the body positivity movement has gotten much bigger the last few years, but their message is ""fat people deserve to feel good about themselves"", not ""you have to date a fat person"". If you don't find fat people attractive, just don't date them?? And if women don't like short dudes they shouldn't have to date them either. That still doesn't change the fact that it sucks to be immediately written off as a potential partner literally just because of your height. As fat people have gotten their body positivity movement, so should short men. Portraying more short men looking hot in ads and as romantic interests in movies may help change people's biases.

95,mflxvz,1617011381,Is she a narc ?," 2 years ago , I met this girl who is sister of my friend. She confessed her undying love for me just after few months of the death of her ex-husband(who died of blood cancer and the marriage lasted 2 years). Though I liked the way she presented herself but still I was reluctant to talk to her because I thought it was too early to talk to somebody who's husband just died. She texted me , I replied and then it all started. She expressed her feelings , and told me that she's madly in love with me. It all started from that point. She was always like ""talk to me on video , open your cam and I want your attention"" , ""see my closet, look how organised my things are"", ""I always buy branded things"" ""I like expensive perfumes"", ""I know you dont say that but you love me too so show your love for me in front of everyone"".

I don't know why and when that happened but I fell in love with her. She asked me that if i really love her I need to confess my love for her in front everyone and propose her. Just after an year when I really made up my mind to propose her. She was like ""better do it quickly , because you are making me wait"" ""If you really love me why not show your love for me in front of the world"". She was even talking to other rich and well settled guys who showed little interest in her and she thought that they might propose her and when I confronted her about that she apologized.

After 1 and half year, she told me she just wanted to get married and needed a partner and now that I am making her wait she was like ""you don't care about my feelings"" ""you're a selfish person"" , ""you have no idea what i'm going through"" ""I'm facing pressure from my family"" ""people of my age group are getting married and I am not"" ""you are not listening to me anymore""

She started giving me ultimatums and left me with no choice but to marry her. Anyways, I was like ""okay, if you are happy with that lets get married"". just after that she decided a date for engagement and planned everything herself. She told me that she's bought clothes and other things. I don't know why but I wasn't very comfortable with everything. I asked her that i'm not very comfortable and if she can give me some more time. She hurled abuse at me! said a lot of bad things about me and my family I couldn't believe my eyes what she was saying I immediately blocked her and went no contact with her. She texted me from another number that she's very sorry for what she did, she was upset and now I need to accept her apology and get ready for engagement preparations. I blocked that number too.

It's been 6 months of no contact. I have heard that she's found another guy with a lot of money. I still miss her but don't want her back.
