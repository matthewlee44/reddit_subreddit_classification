2,q0cycw,1633245826,I (M20) am very confused with a gril (F24) from my home town and runing out of ideas," I dont have a lot of dating experience thanks to corona and that i live in a very small town away from bigger cities and have little same age people around lol  
So basically we know about each other our whole life as we are from the same small city, participated in many events and such. 3 weeks ago a small group of us took a 2day trip, me and her were on this trip. On the first day she gave me a compliment and us 2 and another friend talked through the whole ride and on the 2nd one she flirted with me (put her head on my shoulder and lap), this hapened when there were no other guys around. later that week we had an after party where she was talking to one guy the whole night, we were siting at a table the whole night so i saw she wasnt intrested in him. later that night she aproached me and we flirted a bit- So i thought this was the time and shot her a dm after that. i asked her out 3 times and we canceled all 3 of them. in between we also had and event where we sat together, we vibed the whole evening together to the music and i noticed she was very interested and constantly looking for my eye contact. after the third was cancelled one she asked me out and after 3 weeks we went for a walk on a nearby hill and watched the sunset, i thought it went good as we talked alot and also laughed a lot also made loose plans for next trips. this was 2 days before todays trip. so today we went for a 1 day trip and she seemed to ignore me as there was a guy that spoke constantly and you couldnt talk unless you were far away lol. but he only talked to her(the same from the afterparty), me and her had a couple of convos on the trip and we laughed but it felt a bit distant. our group went for lunch later and i caught her a couple of times looking and me and vice versa. so my question is should i continue to try to pursue it or just leave it be as i am very confused and runing out of ideas what to do.  
probably worth pointing out that we didnt talk a lot over ig, just a day or two before we tried to set a date for the date or when i tried asking her out, we just sent pictures to eachother and liked them. also we didnt dm since our walk, as she sent me the pictures of the sunset later that night.

5,q0d5oc,1633246807,Why do people think ghosting is okay?,"Ghosting is a cowards way out. I don't get it. I'll admit I've had terrible dates and never messaged them again or I had a guy ghost me hours before a first date, even that I can kinda understand and say asshole move but whatever. 
Then there's situations like this. I was hanging out with someone for nearly two months, we hung out at least 3x a week if not more and only had sex once. We both agreed we just wanted a casual connection and we were very upfront and honest about wants and expectations. He tells me what a great time he has with me, he gives me books to read, I think everything is going well.
Then I broke my leg. I needed surgery and I'll be unable to do much for quite a few months. It happened a few days before my birthday and I went for surgery on my birthday. The first few days he was supportive, offered to bring me coffee and a fresh book. Then on my birthday he didn't even say anything (I mentioned it was my birthday because I was having a terrible day obviously) and just said he was feeling down. I sent him two messages, after a week I texted asking if maybe a connection isn't what he wants/needs right now (giving him an out because I would have liked to remain friends at least) but I never heard from him again. 
He was always so upfront, honest, and blunt. I never would have expected him to ghost me. I feel stupid for worrying about it, it was a very casual thing. I can't help but think he did it because I broke my leg so sex is off the table for a few months? But we weren't having sex all the time to begin with so? Maybe he just wasn't feeling into it anymore but didn't want to end it himself? 
Anyways. Any insight? Ideas on what possibly goes through a person's mind when they ghost after hanging out for weeks? How do I stop feeling bad about myself because of this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0d5oc/why_do_people_think_ghosting_is_okay/

I hadn't heard from her in 5 days so sent a text just saying I was happy with our pace and understand it can be sometimes hard talking via text. Heard nothing. It's been about five days since that text.

I know she has used her phone as she uses WhatsApp a few times a day. The other day she changed her picture. Though she looks older then her photos on Hinge and looked quite down tbh.

So, what do I send as a text if I do send one back to her? I was thinking of giving it a fortnight, as by then lockdown will be over.

We started texting day and night and had a connection, but after we finally met each other I swear I feel like I got pranked now.
I had the worst date of my life. The dude looks nothing like I thought!!

I had to ask my friend to call me and pretend she was crying so I made him drop me off at my friend’s place. Never had to do anything like that before 😅
His personality was also awful and felt totally different than the guy from the texts, he was stupid and he also kept telling me about how he went to jail after smuggling drugs to different states for years.

Right before this date, I had six great dates with a guy who’s been ghosting me for more than a month and I felt like total shit.

She's a foreigner from a well-known very wealthy Asian microstate. She has lived all over the world and is incredibly cultured. She is very subtle in her mannerisms and not at all sharing of her family or their source of wealth, and this is what alerted me. Rich people will show off a little. Very rich people will hide it until their mannerisms betray them, and this is what happened when we went for dinner. She's been all over the world from an early age, she has a graduate degree from a near-Ivy league school, and she deliberately avoided talking about what her parents do or how she was able to do all of these things.

 I feel slightly out of my element. I'm a first-gen immigrant. I grew up poor in a very broken family, fucked around for a long time, then got my life together, and just recently became quite successful. I like to think the self-made element of my success is part of what girls like about me. I don't want her to think I'm uncultured. I've been around wealthy people long enough to speak like one of them but only for a short amount of time. I'm certainly not an aristocrat by any measure.

I'm not really sure what to expect. I've never dated a girl from such an affluent, worldly background. She's a lot of fun and I want to keep her around. I'm just wondering what to expect and how not to fuck it up.

I’ve dated in the past but i have never related to or liked someone as much as this guy. I’m not particularly fond of the city i am from, i’ve lived here my whole life and i want to experience living other places too. On the date he asked a lot of questions about me moving and i was confused why he kept on asking it but i answered anyway, however one thing i did say is wherever i decided to move i wanted to still stay close enough to where my family is (my home city). I did mention the idea of traveling abroad to work for a year ect to work and I know he wants to do something similar too. We see eye to eye on almost everything, we have the same values, humour and he is extremely mature for his age. I want to settle down and look for a life long parter and i know so does he but i think during the date because i was talking about moving it didnt come across this way, it seemed like i was still trying to figure out where i wanted to be and i think this was a huge deal breaker for him. He has found where he wants to settle and was ready but i think i came across as if i’m still searching but in reality i’m not even sure that i would move so far away. He was questioning neighbouring cities and asking what I thought of them seeing if i would consider them which i would if i found the right place for me. At the end of the date he did say he wants to take it further with me if in the future it meant long distance which he didn’t want to do, he would rather not lead me on, the distance thing was bugging him and he wanted me to explore and find where i wanted to live as he felt like we were at different stages of our life with this. Honestly i just didnt know what to say at that point, a part of me was telling me to tell him i’m not planning to go far so distance wouldn’t be an issue, another part of me was telling me he’s probably making excuses. I went home last night thinking about if I should talk to him again about it because i really did have a strong connection with him but at the same time i dont want to come across as an idiot if i say something.

35,q0hcu2,1633266307,He (27 m) told me (25 f) last night that he’s going to marry me some day.,"I have been back together with my boyfriend for a couple months now. We grew up together. We lived on the same street and his sister and I are best friends.
I had a crush on him from the time I was ten or eleven. He fought a kid who took my bike and called me a racial slur. After that I just thought he was the greatest.

In my freshman high school (he was a junior) he started to give me little notes about how pretty he thought I was. We ended up dating for the next two years until he graduated from high school. He enlisted in the Marines after school and while he was    in the service we started to drift apart. I decided to break up with him. At 17 I just couldn’t imagine him being gone for another four years.

We only spoke once when he was on leave and there were hurt feelings and I thought we were done forever. But at his sisters wedding last year we reconnected. It was the first time we’d spoken in years. We both apologized for how we handled our breakup. 

We stayed friends until earlier this year when we both admitted we still had feelings and decided to give us another try. And it’s been great. We’ve been rediscovering each other. We’ve spent nearly every weekend together and are even planning a trip next spring. Everything’s going so good.

Last night we were falling asleep and I was laying snuggled up next to him and as I was about to drift off he said “I’m going to marry you someday.” We had been drinking wine earlier but neither of us was drunk. I was really surprised to heard him say that. I mean things have been great and we both said after our first night back together that we were exclusive.

I can definitely see myself with him forever. It might sound dramatic but I can. This morning he didn’t mention it again and I was hesitant to bring it up. It was a really sweet thing for him to say and it made me feel really good but I’m not sure it’s time to have that talk yet. Should I bring it up to him?

37,q0hj3w,1633266938,Are these signs he isn’t interested in me?,"On friday night, I met a guy from Facebook dating. I was the one to check in first if he left to the place yet, I got there late because I was helping a friend out and she lives like 8 mins from the place we met. When I got there he said “Wish you would have came earlier so we could have spent more time together”. We ended up sitting in his car and talked for a bit, since he had plans with his friends that same night? It caught me off guard, he did say I was welcomed to come, I did not want to go meet his friends. I was there for him and not them, we discussed about meeting again but didn’t agree when. We did makeout towards the end, I always do if I feel attracted which I did. And he liked it and I did too. The next morning I was first again to message and this is how the conversation went: Me: It was nice meeting you, thank you for your time. Him: Good morning yea it was. Me:Last night was nice we should do it again. Him:Yea of course. Me:When do you wanna hang out?. Him:Soon
After that he sent me a snap of him drinking and I snapped back saying “Damn this early haha” as a joke and he left me on opened.

This often leaves women frustrated or even offended at times it seems. When I was an adolescent, I looked forward to becoming an adult because I assumed people had mature conversations and explicitly expressed their feelings, intentions, desires, etc. To my dismay I got to my late 20’s and realized everyone pretty much still flirts the same way we did as adolescents. Flirting feels awkward, uncomfortable, and often doesn’t go well. If I could forgo it entirely I would, but I recently left a long-term relationship that took up most of my 20’s and now I’m faced with the nightmare of having to put myself through that again lol. Is it normal to feel this way? Is it reasonable to hope I can date without flirting? It doesn’t seem to work out well most of the time so I’m guessing not. Thankfully I’m tall, fit, a good conversationalist, and pretty intelligent/interesting. If I didn’t have these gifts I’d be doomed for sure haha. I’ve basically just planned the rest of my life in preparation for being alone, which I’m fine with for now. I’ve also had the idea that when I date to just tell them upfront that I don’t really flirt so they don’t get hurt or confused and reasonable expectations can be set from the beginning.

43,q0iplf,1633270927,"Me, her and her ex.","Situation:
- I like this girl, she knows it. We were texting this summer things went well until her ex came back and she ghosted me.
- She’s at my uni so I’m seeing her every day.
- We went out together last week, everything was flirty, she was literally lying to her ex/boyfriend telling him she was with her girlfriends. 
- We slept together, I tried to fuck her but she told me she cannot do it ‘cause she didn’t want to cheat on her boyfriend. (One of the hardest challenges my sexual instinct had to face, God I literally couldn’t fuck the girl I like who was in my bed with me.)
- she’s moving into my city for uni so not seeing her boyfriend that much anymore.
- she confessed that she was into me before her ex came back.
- she’s not able to give me a clear answer about us. She says we are not friend. She’s like keeping me in a “maybe” situation. “I’m not 100% sure about what I want” “things COULD change if we keep going out together” basically never giving me a straight “NO” neither a straight “YES” about our relationship.
- her ex it’s like a comfort zone for her that from which she cannot move on even if he cheated on her multiple times

What do I do  now? (Considering I’d like to try one last time with this girl ‘cause I like her so much) 

1: Completely ignore her even when I’m seeing her in uni. No more texts, no more going out, no more attentions. Moving on and stop chasing her.

2: Continuing chasing her hoping for her to realize she feels better with me, so she can move on from her ex and start a relationship with me. So trying to take her out of that toxic situation she’s in with her ex.

3: tell me Reddit anon what you would do
————————————————————
What’s making me upset:
I feel like if I stop chasing her she’ll simply move on and forget about me. Also the fact that she’s moving in my city and I’m not trying to get her feels like I’m wasting an opportunity.

45,q0j3hy,1633272140,Does She Like Me?,"I (26M) have been seeing this girl (25F) since beginning of August and things have been going okay. However, I'm very much unsure on if she actually likes me or not and here's why:

1) Communication inbetween dates. She's a bad texter overall, like she said she even replies to texts from her parents days after they've messaged her, so it's not just a me thing. She did say that she'd rather I call her, as she misses my voice and it's not the same when I verbally say something compared to a text. However, I've attempted to call her twice - first time she said her phone battery had died, and second time she said she'll let me know if she's free for a call but never said anything.

2) Actual fondness. When I'm with her in person, she's very affectionate - like she'd immediately reach for my hand so she can hold it, and when she sees me she goes in for a hug and kiss. So the worries of her not being physically attracted to me aren't there, but with other things like saying cute things she doesn't really say much.

3) Being supportive. Words of affirmation is one of my love languages, I love it when a partner says ""You've got this"" or ""I'm rooting for you"". I also say these things back, like for example when she said she is having a hard time with her assignment or something at work, I say something like ""Sweety, you've got this. You're smart and I know you'll smash this, don't stress too much and take your time with it"". But when I say I'm struggling with certain aspects of my life, I don't really get a supportive message or verbal response if I bring up something in person. Outside of the words of affirmation, being there for when they are going through a rough time, or are ill and you want to take care of them is something I find important. The other day when I was with her, I said to her I'm going to be there for her and if she needs to vent, feel free to call me. And again she never said she'll be there for me.

I don't know if I'm overreacting/being dumb here, but I'm just worried she's another person who's just leading me on and is going to drop me like that. Or that she's talking to other guys behind my back and I'm just being kept as the fallback option. We've been on seven dates and have more planned. However I won't be seeing her for a couple of weeks as she's on the final stretch of her professional qualification, and wants to tackle the hardest bits first.

So please, Reddit, am I overreacting here or is this just natural to feel this way? I've been in three relationships prior to this and I was hurt in each one.

P.S - we both decided to delete the apps after three dates, in fact she's the one that said she's ready to delete them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0j3hy/does_she_like_me/

I'm a teenager who only has experience in online dating, it's been like that until the recent few days. So a little background information, my goal is to study abroad, in order to reach my goal I have to take several English tests such as IELTS, TOEFL, SAT you name it. So I made a post on Facebook a few days prior asking for a study partner and asking for advices from the community. Then this fella comments on my post and says he's got similar plans and goals, I ask him if he's interested in a study partner and he retorts we can share data. 
 We spoke for the whole evening. During that he offered I should come join this event dedicated for a youth organisation and I promised I'll do my best to attend the event. So I waited for 2 days and visited the event without my family knowing or approving my little ""rebellious"" act. I found the meeting place and finally met him. Since I was a new member to the organisation he companied me and kindly served me food. It went on for about an hour and since it was getting so late and dark outside we decided we should get going. 
 We just didn't separate after getting out of there, him and I waited for our buses but it took some awful lot of time to get home. We discussed about many topics, our interests, some personal memories and our own plannings for the future etc. It felt like time had stopped functioning normally and that there was only him and I in the most crowded area. 
 Now we get to the troubling side, I feel like I'm catching feelings for him even though we spent only one evening together and some time chatting. I haven't felt this soft and needy for a long time, I always find myself thinking about him and hoping the best for him. 
 I don't exactly see myself getting into a romantic relationship with him because if it all comes to an end I might lose him and that terrifies me. I feel quite pathetic for typing about my struggle, it's just he's already become so important to me. 
 Does anyone have a similar experience? Can someone give me advice regarding the whole situation. I can't rest peacefully because of my ever contradicting thoughts and emotions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0jboj/my_feelings_are_troubling_me/

For starters, yes i understand that age and context is needed to assess the situation as obviously there is a biological clock factor.

49,q0jdmv,1633273027,I kissed my good friend but now I think I made a huge mistake.,"Bit of a long(ish) one sorry but I don't really have many people in my life I can talk about this to so please just hear me out.

So a little while ago I hooked up with a close friend, for context she got out of a pretty shitty long term relationship maybe 4-5 months ago. At first we would hang out just as friends I really didn't see it going any where else but it was hard just to maintain a platonic relationship with her she is super smart, really funny, so nice to other people and very attractive. After a while the chemistry started to build to the point that our mutual friends would comment on it and she even had a SEX DREAM about me!! So I finally built up the courage and kissed her while hanging out at her place with her housemates, she then tells me that she has been into me for a while and I'm terrible at reading signals (facepalm). I stayed the night but we didn't do anything else other than make out, we were quite drunk, in the morning she was still super affectionate cuddles, breakfast in bed together and a kiss goodbye. 

So I start to think ""wow this is happening, she's into you"", we continue to message quite frequently but she's super busy with her studies, can't make time at the moment to hang out, she says maybe next week, I get it I want to give her space, I don't want to come across as needy, it was just a kiss ect. After my last failed attempt to hang out she said she would get back to me and I've gotten radio silence since. I think I've totally blown it but I have no idea how?!? 

I don't know what to do, I'm thinking of giving it another week and then just straight up asking her what she is thinking/feeling. I don't want to loose this person in my life but also it'd be hard going back to just being friends because of these feelings that I have developed for her. I feel like I'm in a shitty limbo and it sucks! The last person I liked I told them after a couple of months of casual stuff and they cut me out completely, so Im super hesitant to actually say anything like that beucase she will likely recoil but I'm also really confused about where we stand and what she wants.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0jdmv/i_kissed_my_good_friend_but_now_i_think_i_made_a/

My name is Heather. I'm 27, my boyfriend is 31, and we have been in a long-distance relationship for approx 3 months, depending on when you want to define the beginning of our relationship. In short, I sent my boyfriend a few dirty pics and a \~30 second video and his response was entirely underwhelming. He just seemed almost completely blasé by it. I'm struggling with whether it was me, or if it's him, if it's early relationship growing pains coming out of the honeymoon period, or if it's just a symptom of long-distance.

As some additional context, we met on Tinder when he was in town for a work conference. He was a great conversationalist and seemed genuinely interested in everything I had to say. He was aggressive, but the ideal gentleman. I loved his ambition and values, but he was super down to earth and funny. We seemed to vibe immediately and things went perfectly for those few days he was in town. We had a lot of physical chemistry together and I don't think it could have gone any better, from my vantage point.

When he went back home, we kept things going. Basically daily texting and flirting. We had an agreement that we were exclusive and ""dating,"" so it felt like a proper relationship. Even if long-distance. I didn't suspect anything was wrong. He seemed happy and I was definitely happy.

I consider myself a very sexual person and one of my main love languages is definitely communicated through physical touch. For better or worse, I'm also just a really needy person. So being long-distance for the first time was tough for me. I wanted to spice things up and I sent my boyfriend a few dirty pics and a dirty video. Complete with the lingerie, good lighting, etc. Like it took a LOT of effort and curation to get everything perfect. I was super nervous to send it to him and I wanted him to really enjoy this gift. But his response was totally underwhelming. He was just like wow thanks this looks so good etc. Nothing escalated, he didn't send me anything back, he barely responded back with any level of discernible interest in me. I was really hurt by it and we just kinda glossed over it without mentioning it much.

Part of me wonders whether he's seeing someone else? Whether sexting him was too much? Whether I'm unattractive to him? Whether we're just not a good fit for each other? Whether this is just the reality of a long-distance relationship? Whether I should readjust my sexual needs? Interest in your thoughts and if/how I should bring this up.

59,q0k7av,1633275538,Problems with flirting,"I (M30) have never really felt any satisfaction from flirting. I receive it fairly often from women and I usually just feel like indifferent acceptance, even if I find them attractive or am genuinely interested in them. I can’t ever think of a time where I felt flattered, stimulated, or positively affected by it. It’s kind of just like a nice gesture I guess, but without investment it kinda feels empty and meaningless. Plus, I pretty much know they will lose interest quickly so it just doesn’t seem worth caring about until it’s obvious that it’s more than just an attempt to get attention and/or validation. 

For these reasons and others I never really reciprocate or go out of my way to flirt because it just feels completely unnatural, and often feels uncomfortable or awkward. I never really know how to give it, and I’ve never felt more than cordial gratitude from receiving it. Basically like how you would feel if someone offered you a piece of gum. Like “oh cool thanks, that’s nice of you”. 

I don’t have any good memories or positive experiences of flirting. I only seem to have regrettable embarrassing memories of it. When I think back to times I’ve flirted, even if it was completely fine or even went well, I usually flinch/cringe. Sometimes when that happens I’ll quietly swear to myself for being stupid, or I’ll ask myself “ahh fuck, why did you do that? Ugh gross”. Often times I’ll have to shake my head or do some other thing to eject the memory so I can go about my day. 

Despite not even actively dating for this whole year so far, these are a daily occurrence. Good days I have about 10-15. Bad days I have about 20-40 of them. Not all are about flirting but most are about some form of bad, awkward, or embarrassing encounter. Some aren’t even that bad I just flinch &amp; curse out of instinct. Then I think about it like “what was that for?”. At the beginning of this year I became single from a very long-term committed relationship so I am now unfortunately faced with the nightmare of having to deal with flirting again at some point, and I don’t really know what to do about it. 

I’ve considered just telling my future date upfront that I don’t flirt so they don’t get confused or hurt by it and can just judge me by other factors. I haven’t gotten to that point yet though. Thankfully I’m tall, fit, a natural socializer, and pretty intelligent/interesting. Without these gifts I’d be doomed for sure lol. As it stands I’m just working on improving my strengths as a person, and improving my life overall. I’ve kind of set dating aside and left it alone completely for now but I know eventually that will no longer be a practical or reasonable thing to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0k7av/problems_with_flirting/

I recently saw an old friend at the bar a few weeks ago, a couple days ago we started snap chatting each other, he asked if i was still with my ex at the bar, so over snapchat i asked him if he was still with his (just to be sure he was single) he said no and asked how my love life was going and i joked that its not, and he said the same, the next snap was him saying i should come to the bar he works at and get a drink. we ended up going for drinks, and the whole night we were laughing our asses off nonstop, it was a great time. some things i thought indicated flirting is he touched my lower back a few times while speaking to me cause it was loud in there, and iver all we were pretty close the whole night, legs touched didnt move, sat really close to me, and gave me a sort of lingering hug when he dropped me off and asked to hangout again in the next couple days. i still cant read the situation and cant tell if he just still sees me as a friend hes catching up with or more, i dont remember him ever being so touchy back in the day so it makes me wonder. what do you all think?

63,q0kpda,1633276998,Why can’t I find someone better than my ex?,"Throughout my teenage years, I got picked on in school a lot and most girls thought I was ugly. I got a girlfriend when I was 16 but I didn’t really have anything serious until I was 18. After many failed talking stages and ghostings, I started dating my ex in 2017. 

She was amazing at first, despite being amazing, she had a lot of red flags.  For starters we slept together on the first date, something I never usually do. Second she’s 5 years older than me and I always date people who are either around my age or younger.  Third and probably most important, she has some severe mental problems.


I was blinded by love so I put up with it for a long time. This last April I had the straw that broke the camels back.  she went off on me for something really small and punched me this along with her not showering or taking care of herself so I ended things and kicked her out because she had been living with me.


For the first few months, I did the whole work on yourself thing and didn’t want to jump into anything else too quickly. Well she’s started contacting me again pretty much begging me to take her back and saying she’s changed and I’m not buying it. 


With that being said, I’ve really raised my standards since I left her. I know I deserve better, I want to find someone that I think is beautiful inside and out. 


Having said that, I have a problem when it comes to the dating scene. For starters, I’m an introvert and I get really self conscious around girls. Secondly, the types of girls I’m after for the most part just aren’t into me which is kind of a self esteem killer.


So now I’m starting to thing I really can’t find any better than my ex and that’s really frustrating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0kpda/why_cant_i_find_someone_better_than_my_ex/

Long story short 4 months ago I broke up with my ex gf, overall it was a great relationship, but at the time I had stuff going on and needed it to end. I went no contact after the breakup talk and then…

Fast Forward, I want her back, still had strong feelings for her and everything. I reached out and it had some pros and cons. Cons, she said she had been with her ex again and another guy (whatever we were broke up) but still hurt. Then got mixed signals about wanting to be friends or a relationship. Anyway we chatted a bit, got a few breadcrumb texts almost daily that I responded positively to. Very short complaints about her anxiety or stresses at work. I confessed my feelings twice. 

But then, she would bring up feelings for her other ex or another guy. Kinda made me get hurt, and at first I ignored it. 

Anyway her and I hung out and had a picnic and went apple picking. It was a nice romantic date but after 3 hours we parted ways. Then no texts so I texted her and asked her “how’s it going?” She then said she cried at work and next day said she wasn’t sure what she wants with friends, work, another guy she’s talking to. I was positive and said you can talk to me about anything if needed and have some advice. 

I guess my question is what’s the long game to win her back. Should I keep up checking in? Maybe swallow my pride and talk about who she’s seeing and actually become a friend and win her that way? I do love this girl I’m certain, so I’d like to try or if someone has a better plan.

Basically, we’ve become good friends and we see potential for things to develop further - as this was the intention initially.
We’ve had phone calls, FaceTime, and long text chats (it hasn’t really stopped to be honest). 
Now time zone and location are the big issues here. It’s a storm we’ve weathered well though and with me at college and the lady having her career it hasn’t caused any issues. After I graduate, meeting up is on the table should everything be going well. 

The thing is, I would like to move things up a level - in a healthy way of course. 
I’m not wanting to make us official or anything as we agreed meeting up and going on a date was the best way to do this. 

What kind of level could I move this to without it becoming too full on but more than just general chats, memes, talking about our days, etc? All that stuff is great but I would like to move a little further and let this lady know I’m all in and want this to happen. I should mention we’re very comfortable around each other.

I was super awkward and “ugly” as a teenager/early twenties. Barely went out and didn’t have many friends so I never got any experience with boys and dating. 

I’m 24 now and finally feel confident enough to date someone seriously. But the thing is, I don’t know where to begin.

 I’m too embarrassed to ask my friends of two years, I just tell them that I’m really picky. But the truth is that I’ve never even kissed a guy. 

I have experienced mutual attraction, however, but Ive always been too avoidant to allow it to lead somewhere. And I’m really scared of someone finding out exactly how inexperienced I am (which is kinda ironic). 

How do I deal with this? Has anyone been in this situation and overcame it, if so, how?

94,q0o3tj,1633287162,Is there any way to make dating a little simpler?," 

I (26 M) wanted this to be a discussion and inputs from people who've got dating figured out. I know this sounds stupid but I feel dating is too complicated right now for this generation. I don't know why that is. There are so many people who feel alone and single and yet never seem to find someone easily.

Is it because we have unrealistic expectations of what a partner should have? I know I have been guilty of this where I felt unattracted towards someone because of one small factor. I have also faced this myself where an above-average conversation or date never lead to something more because they probably moved on to someone else. Dating apps suck especially for men who aren't perfect.

People always advise to work on yourself and meet people doing what you like. I don't know how that works either. I like working out and being active. I have been going to the same gym for many years (obviously not just for meeting someone), feel very happy with my health rn but don't know a single person there. Same with other activities, been on many hikes, classes in college, never made lasting contacts doing any of these. I don't know at this point how dating should really work. I guess I am just trying to understand if I am doing something blatantly wrong or this whole generation is sort of in a mess.

Any opinions or discussion is welcome!

95,q0o4bn,1633287203,How do I get this guy to take me somewhere other than a bar or to just come over?,"I (35F) started seeing this guy (36M) via Tinder a few months ago. I've NEVER had any success with online dating, mostly because I find the whole process of early dating exhausting and strange and can't make a connection. This guy though felt different from the jump and I have been interested in keeping up with dating him. We've been out maybe 5-6 times in the past three months only because we both are working a lot with opposite schedules and he and I have both been out of town a few times. I was surprised that he kept in touch with me so regularly when he was out of town. I realize in retrospect that maybe I seemed somewhat disinterested because I wasn't reaching out more thinking a month apart and my terrible schedule would mean he'd lose interest, but he didn't! 

All is pretty good - good connection, I think we're attracted to each other and the sex is good when it happens, dates go by really fast and are fun, he's so easy to talk to and I feel like I get so swept up in having someone to talk to so easily about all sorts of topics that I don't get around to being more direct about what's happening with us and only realize how I could have done that when I'm thinking about our dates the next day or something. The problem for me is **WE ALWAYS GO TO A BAR**. Always. It's getting boring. And always something in my neighborhood. I feel so socially awkward trying to flirt or get us back to bed when we always have this chunk of table in between us in a noisy place. He pretty much always suggests the same place, which is just a few blocks from my house. That led to him coming home with me twice - once because he walked me home and once because I invited him back on an innocuous pretense and it worked. But every other time we've hung out, he hasn't tried to invite me to his place and I'm so socially inept and clueless that I can't seem to figure out how to ask him to come home with me consistently, especially because we usually have to hang on nights when I'm not working but he's working early the next day.  

I don't normally have this issue, but mostly because when I start seeing someone romantically/sexually I've already known them and so we're already hanging out in some way that isn't something like Tinder dating over and over again. And I'm actually a really direct person, but feel kinda lost in this one. I feel nervous he's going to lose interest because we're not able to make this feel like more of a friendship (which I'm fine with, I just want to know if that's what's going on) or because he thinks I'm disinterested (I'm very interested - he's hot AF and cool) or because he finds someone who's easier to date/sleep with/flirt. He's been texting less (maybe just busy, but I dunno) but responds readily to my messages still. I've invited him hiking or to just come over to watch a movie and it's never happened. It's always just going to a bar! I don't know how to put us into a position where I feel better able to make a move and feel more comfortable then having a talk about what we want with each other. I don't want this to end just because the two of us are too awkward to do anything about it. 

Guys, what would you want a girl to do in my position? I don't know how to flirt lol!! What should I say? What won't seem so weird to write in a text maybe. Or seem like an ultimatum or something?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0o4bn/how_do_i_get_this_guy_to_take_me_somewhere_other/
96,q0oc0r,1633287814,I walked out of a date for the first time… but somehow I feel bad?,"This guy and I met and he seemed nice and funny at firs. We agreed to grab dinner this weekend and he picked me up. He was polite on the car ride to the restaurant, but things took a turn before we even got our food. He was just sorta sitting there staring at me awkwardly, not saying anything. I say “so what do you like to do for fun?” He literally says “eating, drinking beer, watching tv.” Just bad from the start. 

As the conversation continued he began to get argumentative. For example, he said he has been watching this cooking show and they recently grilled possum and raccoons. I said “ew, how gross” because well, we are sitting having dinner. And he goes on a tangent about how some people live in poverty and only have access to roadkill to eat. I said “well I just think of them as dirty, I get why they would need to eat them but on a cooking show it’s kinda gross.” He goes on about how there’s a whole culture and blah blah blah. I just nodded my head and listened to him drone on but when he finished he just sat and glared at me.

Ugh he was a jerk. He argued with me about like 3 other stupid things until I said “I’m ready to go home now” we had finished our dinner so, I was ready. He said “leave if you want to then.” I got up, went to the bar and paid for what I ordered and left. I didn’t want him thinking he bought me food and then I ditched him, so I paid for the shitty dinner. 

I’m still mad I even went. He was so smug and totally thought he was correct in every situation, like there is no talking to someone like that. He was like talking to a brick wall, never even listened to what I had to say. He just wanted to make a counterpoint no matter what I was talking about lol well idk why I feel bad, I guess because he was just super rude to me the whole date and I haven’t been treated like that in awhile by a man.

I used it in 2 different country, I used different dating app , not only tinder , but bumble , badoo and grindr  , literally after one day I hade bad view of all the scenario!

Secondly , with the last one only creepy men , and I got disgusted that also women receive this kind of message or just talk with men who after 3 text of message want to have sex with the excuse "" this is grindr !"" . OK I had fun to speak with someone , I send photo as well ( not hot photos or too much hard ) I received compliments for my body despite not being so much attractive , but literally it's creepy! 
I don't know if some cis and hetero  men can understand this , but being bisexual and young,  I feel also the impulse to have sex and trying everything to get it , but god... just don't want to be creepy or being like a supermarket product to use !",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0oidv/am_im21bisexualone_of_the_few_young_men_who/
