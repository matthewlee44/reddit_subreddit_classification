First date was a tennis date, second date was a Starbucks date. I got ghosted by both people afterwards…

I was upset about the ghosting, so I stayed away from apps for a few months. However, I got kind of lonely, so I recently downloaded Tinder, starting talking to somebody on there, went on a date with them this past Monday (at a restaurant), and think that I’m being ghosted again.

So that makes me question, are dating apps not for me? Is dating in general not for me? I like to think I’m a very kind person, honest, funny (imo), I try my best to make eye contact, keep the conversation going, I don’t think I’m ugly but I’m definitely not a model or anything.

The first two Hinge dates I had a feeling that I would be ghosted afterwards, but this third most recent Tinder date, I felt that things were going well. However that date was on Monday and I still haven’t heard back from them (up until today, Thursday).

I have been going on a couple dates with this guy and he happens to have a husband; he has let me know they are in an open relationship.

One day, one of the chefs (that I'll call Tom) said hi to me. I hadn't noticed him before he said hi to me one day but I was going through a rough patch and it was nice to have an OK looking guy say hi to me. I started getting a seat at the bar so I could look directly into the kitchen window where he often stands. Tom is the kind of guy that I wouldn't have taken a 2nd look at walking down the street but as I've gotten to see and talk to him more, I've become more and more attracted to him.

Over the past couple of months, he's become super-friendly. I can't even sit down before he waves and says hi to me by name. There's been a couple times where I've come in and he's asked if he can make me something off-menu, he gives me extra bacon &amp; cheese without me asking, he's always asking me to try some new things he's experimenting with, and he jokes with me. He made me a dare a couple weeks ago and said if I complied, he'd comp me a drink. The other day I told him I wanted a personal chef and he joked that for $50, he'd come over to my place at midnight to make me a snack. If I don't come in when he's in or I come in after my usual time, he'll smile and say something like he thought I abandoned him or he'd have to wait another day to see me. He's even told me I should talk to the manager about getting a job there. I'm the only customer he treats this way. I see him joke around a bit with others in the kitchen.

He has a girlfriend but I've been told by a mutual friend that it's rocky and it was rushed into when the pandemic started. I've overheard Tom say he's happier being alone with their dog. He was supposed to go out of state to see his girlfriend's family but decided at the last minute not to go, I don't know if she still went.

A few of the servers have made comments like, 'What's up with you and Tom?' and have warned me to be careful because he has a girlfriend. I've asked them what they think is going on and they've said it's hard to say, but if they were his girlfriend they'd be a little uncomfortable.

I don't know if my gaydar is going off or not because I'm clearly biased. I don't know if he's gay, bi, curious, or questioning. I'm having fun being friendly with him and the time I spend at the restaurant interacting with him is the highlight of my day. It's costing me a lot more money than I'd like to spend on eating out because I'm no longer going there for the food, I'm going there to see him.

For the past month or so, I've been wearing my rainbow Apple Watch band and once or twice a week I'll put on a shirt with a rainbow logo to broadcast I'm gay. His behaviour hasn't changed.

If there is something there, I don't want to rush it and I think it would be best for it to unfold organically. But this has been going on for a couple of months. It's the not knowing that is driving me crazy.

My friends are all gushing for me and say it sounds like Tom is being more than friendly with me. One friend suggested that if he's having trouble with his girlfriend then maybe he's in need of a friend. I struggle socially and haven't had a relationship in several years. I have a low self-esteem and don't often get attention from men so this has me all giddy.

Obviously none of you know if Tom is interested me, but have any of you been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice as to anything I can do to find out what's going through his head without actually asking him? Anything I could jokingly say to gauge how he reacts? I'm afraid if I make 1 wrong move, I'll never want to set foot in the restaurant again.

This is a long one.

So I (19M) met this girl (19F) on Tinder about a month ago. Two weeks ago we went on a date, and she said she had a good time. When we got home, we asked each other if we want to keep talking, and she said “we can stay in contact (if you want haha) and we can see what happens with the lockdown? it’s a very funny timing to meet though haha”. 

We texted over the following days, and then she got sick. I texted her asking if she was feeling better the day after, but she didn’t reply. Days passed without a response, so I texted again asking if she was okay. No response. Then more days passed, and I messaged her on instagram asking if we’re good. She replied days later, saying: “hey! So sorry if i am causing you confusion or any discomfort. i genuinely don’t mean to ignore or not text but with how things have been going i have just been off of my phone for a while and think i’ll have to continue doing that as school and work are getting intense again”. I replied saying ‘no worries, that makes sense. Lemme know if you ever have some spare time to call!’ , to which she replied “you too!!! enjoy your classes :) i’ll have to stop by one of your streams soon” (because I do live-streaming). That was the end of that convo. 

A week ago I sent her a message about how cute a dog pic she posted was, and I haven’t heard from her at all. She still follows me and views every one of my Instagram stories.

Our proximate relationship became an LDR because he had to move for work. I was trying to close the distance., but I guess it wasn’t quick enough for him. 

He visited Toronto (our hometown) in early January and was here for 2 weeks. We spent every other day together the first week. Then the second week, his family got covid and he went missing for several days. I thought something had happened but he wouldn’t tell me what it was, and he was acting really cold. He said some stuff about how he was in a bad mood, and then went missing again after a few messages. I figured he was ghosting and called him out for it, he said he wasn’t ghosting, but then went mia again. The same thing happened again. He said he wasn’t ghosting, but went mia and has been mia since- for a week now. 

I gave up and said I was moving on because this was way too much lol. He was depriving me of the dignity of a proper breakup if he wanted one. I had kept telling him to tell me if he wanted to break up, but he wouldn’t. He kept saying he wasn’t ghosting me and that he was sorry. 

So anyway, I told him I’m moving on and that’s exactly what I started to do.  
Last night, I  up finding him on a dating app (Dil Mil). (He’s back in Cali, has been since the 9th, but the app shows American and Canadian people.) 

So anyway, I saw his dating profile and it stung. At first I was like “alright, whatever, we’re not even together and I figured that much, but a formal breakup would’ve been nice”. This on its own is pretty shitty. 

But then I scrolled down and it said he was last active 26 days ago. 

26 days ago… we were together, we were going on dates that exact week, before he even ghosted me.

So he cheated on me and then ghosted me, despite being the one talking about how absolute garbage cheaters are.

I feel horrible, I’m going to have trust issues for the longest time.

He was my first relationship too. I know he’ll never do better than me in Cali cause of the absolute garbage he is, which is exactly what he’ll attract. But this hurts so much. I have so much important stuff coming up for myself and idk how to handle it. He also has my crochet hooks I ordered to his place to save on shipping, which he needs to send but idk how to get them back. They were really expensive and one of them was a gift for my mom too.

Today, he asked if I wanted to meet at his place to play video games…which ultimately sounds like a great low key date, but for further down the road. I don’t think he has bad intentions.

That just made me feel worse though. I feel sad and I wish I never did that. I miss him so much and I'm crying so much and my head hurts so badly.

If I do go out with them it’s just weird for me because on the “successful dates”, they’re clearly into me, but I truly am not at the point where I have any romantic feelings for them yet. Even past relationships where I’ve met them through mutual friends setting us up, based on my general attraction to them I’ve literally forced myself to develop feelings at the “normal” pace.

I look at my friends and they fall for their matches from dating apps so quickly without even facetiming or calling them. I’ve always found that I really only develop real feelings for someone after around 6 months to a year. At that point a lot of the time if they ever had feelings for me they’ve gotten over me, we’ve become friends, etc.
I guess it just takes me a while more than most people? And I feel like how the dating scene is right now, it’s very fast paced and I can’t match that. I even fall for people that I wasn’t initially attracted to or people that aren’t even my normal type, so I guess being a personality person may answer some of this as well.

It ended because I hated who I became. My partner was (is) a great person who treated me almost too kindly to the point where all my bad habits and my depression were so enabled, on top of financial dependency, emotional security, etc. A little codependent but I went to therapy, we communicated to the ends of the earth, I put my best effort forth, and we decided to be friends instead. In some ways, our friendship is still enabling as he’s a huge source of emotional support for me. We also currently live together because I work seasonally and he lives somewhere tropical and it’s winter, ya know. Life is easier with somebody else, we share a dog, and we have a lot of trust. Now that the expectation is friendship and I reestablished my independence, I feel good about our friendship. However, it took me the past year and a half to get there.

In that time, I’ve gone from thinking I am asexual to a lesbian, circling back around to my original sexual orientation lol. I heard the term “intimacy anorexia” last week and it blew my mind because it described so much of what I’ve felt the past few years. Unable to show or receive affection, overly critical, avoidant attachment, guilt and shame around sex, etc. I could dig much deeper into why this is, what other intimacy issues exist alongside it/perpetuate it, whatever. I struggle to commit because I’m a full-time nomad and I enjoy connecting with people because I get to leave in a way. It’s a problem, but now that I’ve begun identifying WHY my behaviors are so volatile around romantic relationships, I feel overwhelmingly full of hope. Regardless, I’m in no place to actually be in a relationship nor do I care.

I met someone a few weeks ago on a group hike and we talked for hours both events, hiking ahead and hanging out afterwards. After becoming ~actualized~ we went out on a long hike and spent the day together. He brought me all the flavors of a beverage I mentioned the last time we hung out and he bought me lunch. We hung out again and went to the gym. He immediately noticed I’d gotten my nails done, brought another very thoughtful item along that clearly showed he had been listening to me, and spent $100 on dinner and drinks afterwards.

We don’t text much, it doesn’t seem to be his style (he doesn’t seem to use or even have his phone on him a lot of the time). He doesn’t have any social media, so I don’t find this odd but it has revealed the amount of time I spend thinking about him and wishing he would text! Overall, it’s so refreshing to have a crush after my intimacy breakthrough I could cry, even if this goes nowhere. I also just moved so having a friend is really good for me.

As a long-time oversharer, he knows some of where I’m at right now and I’m also leaving the island in March to go back to work. I plan to be upfront about my own hang ups and communicate about my lack of desire for a committed relationship right now because I’m not trying to hurt anyone.

I guess I’m just wondering if this is clearly someone being into me or if I should manage my expectations because I feel so nervous! I’ve been in 4 LTRs and have done a lot of dating, so I thought I was good at this until my last breakup revealed some truths about me, and I’m really hesitant not to fuck up something that’s invigorating me so much with someone who is so thoughtful.

What should I do? The mutual friend is a friend I know pretty well (part of the same friend group, used to hang out a fair bit last 2-3 years but pretty limited in the last 1.5 years). Not sure how close the mutual friend is with my date. The thing is my whole friend group will eventually know about this cause the mutual friend loves to gossip (lmao) and I kinda want to keep this as a low-key thing. Also, I feel like this isn't a date anymore then right?

Should I just suck it up and go for it? Should I cross-check with my date if it's still going to be a ""date""? Should I just let the date know that I prefer if it was us 2 and if its for safety reasons (very understanable) we can go to a larger public place or a different place (our date was gonna be at a bar)

And I didn't had the  best luck with meeting friends as well and it left a big impact on my  view and value for friendship: none. I've still tried making friends but  due to my personality disorder + apathetic view towards it, I do not  have any friends that I care about and thus I do not have any social  support system. To make matters worse, my family is extremely toxic and  they're the reason why I developed personality disorder in the first  place.

I'm getting treated by a  therapist but I still feel a great gaping hole inside of me. My life has  been very lonely and even when I try to go out and do something fun,  I'm still alone and the fact that I don't have no one to share it with  makes it that much more brutal.

And  I can't help to think and wish that I want to be involved in a romantic  relationship. A healthy romantic relationship. I've been telling myself  that I don't need one because I don't want to depend on anyone but I  just can't help to admit that I want to have someone in my life that I  can depend on for help.

I began to take it as a “no” but thought of a last try - maybe he IS busy? A day before he came back to town, I asked if he would like to grab a bite when he’s back.

Ok I'll try to make this as short as possible but it's almost 4 years worth of info... so Bare with me! 

I'm F22, and a senior in college. When I was a freshman (august 2018) I went to visit my two best friends at their big university! My first visit I saw them talking to one of their new guy friends, and it was like a scene out of a movie for me. I was obsessed with him the minute I saw him and he's all I could think about that night, though I never even spoke to him. Let's call him... Chase. Shortly after this, I wrote in my notes ""I will marry chase"". Not to manifest or anything ( I didn't even know what that was at the time) but because I thought it would be cool to look back on if anything ever did happen. 

So I went to visit my friends a few more times before freshman year was over, and every time I went up there with the hopes of finally being introduced to chase. Coincidentally, he was never there the times I visited which bummed me out but I still had a good time. 


My second semester sophomore year ( Jan 2020) I transferred to the big university. I was excited to finally get a traditional college experience and was even more excited to be closer to chase. I knew for sure I'd run into him sooner or later.... well I didn't. After two months on campus we got sent home due to COVID.

I returned to campus my junior year (august 2020) and my first night back I went to a party and who was there?? CHASE. I saw him and was excited to finally meet that night. We talked for a bit and he was Just as I expected him to be ( very cute and nice) but I didn't get the fireworks I was expecting. Granted, I'm fully aware I was over hyping our first interaction in my head and I wasn't let down , just didn't feel a ""spark"". We talked that night and he flirted a bit but I knew not to take it personal as I saw him talk to a few other girls that night.

The next time I saw chase was in April of 2021, due to me moving home Because of COVID. That day in April We were with a bunch of friends chilling. We were sitting in a circle and I look at chase to find him
Already staring at me. I could tell he felt awkward for getting caught but I acted like nothing happened. I thought to Myself, why was he staring at me? Does he think I'm pretty? Or was it just a stare? 

I didn't see chase again until august 2021 where we hung out in a big group again. We chatted like normal but nothing special came of it. At this point, I'm starting to convince myself to just move on because obviously nothing will Come
of this since we've talked plenty of times before and it was just normal
Not romantic. 

Now I want to pause and share a little about me and chase as people.
 I have an insane fear of rejection so I never admit To liking someone first. This is a big reason why I've never had a bf. Any normal person would tell Their friends to try and hook them up with chase since they are pretty close,  but I always keep my interest in potential
Partners to myself due to Fear of rejection which I acknowledge is holding me back from
Finding someone. 

Throughout these years I've found myself attracted to other guys but couldn't shake my feelings for chase. Chase is very attractive and many girls talk about him. He's had flings with a few but over the course of college has never had a gf, which I find odd due to him being a hot commodity. 


Fast forward to Jan 10, 2022. I'm at a bar with friends and chase is there. I give him a hug and we chat for a few but it's like every other interaction we've had in the past, just normal. After that convo, I really let go of the idea of us every being anything and just enjoyed the rest of the Night. As the bar started to close everyone was leaving and making new plans. As I'm walking to the door with my drunk friend, I pass chase and he asks what I'm doing after this. I tell Him I'm taking my friend to her apt them going to Uber to mine. He then says ""let's go"" and walks with me to take my friend home.  On the walk home he holds my hand and we held hands the whole Way there. Granted we were both pretty tipsy but drunk actions are sober thoughts lol. 

At this moment I feel completely elated and couldn't believe that I was holding my dream guys hand. Chase ended up getting pretty sick later in the night due to over drinking so our friends came and got us and we both went home.  We haven't spoken after that 

Fast forward to today. I haven't seen chase since. Part of me is regretting not reaching out the next day to start convo or at least make it known I was interested, but I'm trying not to dwell on it. I've been hoping to see him again and have told myself I would be bold if I got to hang with him again. Graduation is in may and time is ticking so Ive been pretty anxious.

Well, I just got the best news ever. My best friend is having a cabin trip for her bday in a few weeks and just told me she invited our guy friends..... and chase is going. I feel like this is my last chance to see if anything could ever happen. I feel like the note I wrote 
In my phone, the moment I caught him staring at me and the walk home in January is all leading to this Moment. I've silently been obsessed with this man since 2018 and was about to give up and at the last minute realized he was attracted to me too. Please tell
Me if I'm delusional but I think this may be a sign? Idk. And the fact that he's never had a gf

Few reasons why I thought he was avoidant:

* Lack of long term relationships in the past, despite being 35
* Really not in to physical touch, e.g. cuddling, sharing a bed
* Would disappear for days if they were stressed, lots of focus on ""them time""
* Terrible communicator
* Incredibly hot and cold

And, I endured, because I thought they were worth the ups and downs, at the time. We had a lot of fun together (or, at least I did), felt we had a lot in common, but over the last couple of days, I've realised this is my childhood trauma, seemingly repeating itself over the last 12 months, with every single bloody guy I've dated since I left my partner of 12 years in 2020. I have an incredibly complicated relationship with my Dad, who was avoidant/emotionally unavailable to me as a child. Would rarely hug me, tell me he loved me, and it seems I'm now replaying this pattern in to adulthood.

To be honest, I'm kind of glad this happened. I got swept up in the newness of it, the excitement, the watching the sunrise of 2022 together, wondering if this was really going to be something, but I don't want to be with somebody who doesn't want to cuddle me, hold my hand, can't communicate, will blow hot and cold pending their mood. I want to be with somebody who is excited by me, wants to spend time with me, wants to get to know me.

So, I'm sad that it hurts, that this person after 4 months couldn't tell me they weren't feeling it, when I enjoyed my time with them, their company, enjoyed getting to know them. I would have been their platonic friend, in the absence of a relationship. I'm sorry that they felt they couldn't express their feelings to me.

But. I've been through this before, this being my pattern. I know it'll stop hurting, and I know I've learned a lot through this in what my non negotiables are. Never again.

We decided to hang out on 12th and then go on hike on the 13th instead because Valentine’s Day is on a Monday. We plan to do a Korean bbq dinner at his place however he lives with his older sister’s family. His older sister has bipolar disorder and she is very emotionally unregulated and refuses to seek therapy making it difficult sometimes to have privacy. It makes me uncomfortable when she overshares inappropriate topics about her life and uses me for her venting. I can’t really reject her because I’m at her house and I’m literally walking on eggshells with her. Lately I’ve been at his house a lot because I like to see him but I feel like it would be more appropriate to be at my place because of that. I want to respect their house but I also want him to make more of an effort to come see me at my place (I live with 6 roommates but we all have our own rooms and it locks). Most of the time though no one is really home at my house or only a few of the girls are there. We’ve had a discussion about him making more of an effort to come see me more before already and his excuse was because of work. Mind you all the Korean bbq ingredients would be easier to get since I live 1 min from an Asian market that has all the ingredients, so if I was to go to his place I would have to pack EVERYTHING (groceries, makeup, night routine, etc…) just to sleep at his place and cook there too.

We made out that night - in a club where her friend suggested that we should go. Afterwards, I invited her, her friend and another friend of mine to my place. At my place it was pretty chill; she mostly spent time going through my books while I was busy being the host. Nobody spent the night.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I was pondering whether I should thank her for an amazing night or not. Eventually, she text me first on Instagram saying thank you for the hospitality. I replied back, hinting on whether she wants to meet again or not. She replying by saying that we could meet one day to talk about books. I asked how about tomorrow. She said she is busy these days.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened on Sunday. And since then I've sent her another 2-3 messages with some random stuff that I hope she will find interesting - the last one was a photo of a book and a message asking her if she read the book.

&amp;#x200B;

But no reply back. Although I can see that she is online... And she posted an Instagram story with her friend at a restaurant.

anyways, i feel like hanging out with my friend has kinda changed my morals on relationships however. as he’s just gotten out of a long term relationship, he is down way more bad than i am, as after the break up he is very desperate and has urgency to find a new relationship. he kinda exaggerates about wanting a girlfriend at times. i feel like this tendency has kinda reflected towards me a bit. i feel way more inclined to have a gf than before and feel like i myself sometimes take or want to take desperate measures.

im not sure if i genuinely want a gf this desperately or if this feeling is a result of me hanging out with my friend more. i feel like it would be nice to have one, but ive never felt more urgency to have one.

its been a while since ive really bonded closely with a girl. last time, i ended cutting off a girl who flirted with me for a long time while having a boyfriend. i cut her off around august of last year and i still do obsess over it at times as i was genuinely attracted to her, and it felt like she had interest in me as well for a time. i feel like that may have impacted my relationship views a bit. 

anyway while i dont want to be in any urgency, it wouldnt hurt to have a gf either. i know i shouldn’t be desperate, as even though i mentioned all of that above, i am still very picky. i feel like there have been opportunities where a relationship could’ve happened but i was just not interested. my friend says i have the looks, and i dont think im too bad looking but i feel like im trying to find the right one. i hope it doesnt sound weird but there is this girl who works at a store that i found cute but i mightve just been desperate since she commented on something i was wearing lol. i kinda lack social skills to make a first move and the only place i go to is work so how would i actually go about getting the right one?

I (20F) used to teach piano and one day this absolutely hot student (26M) signs up for my lessons. This was 7 months ago. I’m into him from day 1 but I try to keep things professional. However, he did start to make some moves on me (he offered to take me out on a motorcycle ride, which ended up happening, and suggested that we have a lesson at his house to “switch things up” ie. Get me alone to make moves I’m assuming) so this entire time I gauged that he had an interest in me as well. He offered to take me out on a concert date. So it was very apparent that he was interested in me more than friends, but again I didn’t do much about it and he kept things professional as well. Then I thought I was leaving the country for an exchange program so I ended up stopping our lessons. The exchange got cancelled because of covid however, and I texted him saying my news and that we could go to the concert now. He said he would love to take me when they open again.

Fast forward a day or two later I saw his dating profile on Hinge which shocked me. I sent him a like and said “funny seeing you here haha”. He liked me back and said he was interested in me but didn’t want to cross any lines when he was my student because he was a gentleman. I said I was open to a relationship and open to having fun as well and we agree we would go with the flow. I was ecstatic. We flirted, texted some, confirmed that we liked each other and went out on a date last week. He admitted that he wanted me “from day 1”. Seeing him on hinge and everything happening felt so unreal. We had an amazing date, we opened up about everything, our secrets, our feelings, and lighter banter. We even had sex. I don’t know if this was a mistake. I knew it was kind of fast but we had known each other for 7 months beforehand. He also kept my panties, which seems pretty boyfriend material. He also asked me to draw us together on his bike, which seemed really relationship like too. 

He initiates texts with me two days later wishing me a good week. We talk a bit, and I message him yesterday but he hasn’t responded yet and it’s been 12 hours. But that’s not what’s bothering me, what’s bothering me is that despite our date and meeting seeming really special I saw that he updated his Hinge profile picture (from a shirtless selfie to a normal mirror selfie) and it left me really disappointed. I know I should have assumed he was still seeing other girls because we didn’t have the talk yet and it is really soon to have it. He also hasn’t asked for date two and it’s been 5 days. Maybe it’s too soon, I’m not sure what the timeline is supposed to be for dating because this is already really new to me. 

My question is, when is it a good idea to bring up the talk in this case? I just don’t want to waste my time with someone who isn’t on the same page, I like him enough to get off dating apps and stop seeing other men. I don’t feel comfortable being this intimate with someone if it’s only a hook up. I maybe shouldn’t have had sex with him but what’s done is done. I don’t want to seem clingy or too eager either and scare him off because he is really special to me and I don’t want to ruin things.

Not to mention he gives me red flags - that being him + his friends that I see as the wrong crowd. Some of them sleep around and smoke and do drugs socially. He was telling me all confidently he’s DONE drugs, socially. I decided to consider that a red flag, along with another tinder guy that did something similar.  

Anyway that night I messaged him I didn’t see him as more than a friend and he was upset at first, then said it was okay a day later asking if we could still talk.   I watched a movie with him.  Then continued to text him everyday.  

I’ve been told to stop talking to him, and told myself I need to stop.   I liked talking about a common interest.   
For about four days now he hasn’t been talking to me or opened insta dm.   I kind of miss him and feel abit let down.   

This frankly has happened before, becoming obsessed with messaging a guy that’s into me, except I don’t feel the same way about (because he’s not Good looking enough) about my day.  The other dude eventually stopped giving me attention. 

I don’t know why I get like this. I’m not much of a talker because I’m abit shy, but I love to text. I mean it’s for the best I stop taking to him, eps  if I don’t even want a relationship, right?
