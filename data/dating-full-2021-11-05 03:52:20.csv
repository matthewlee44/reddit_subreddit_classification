I thought it went well, we were moderately touchy, there were a lot of compliments thrown around from both sides, and I let her know that I thought she was cute, and she said I looked like a model which was really nice. She asked me to help balance herself and I held her hand a bit, I’m just trying to emphasize that there was some flirting going on. 

She told me a bunch of times saying said she had a great time, thanked me for paying for dinner and everything, texted me after thanking me again and told me she had fun, and I was feeling good. I asked her out for Halloween day and at first she was down and then she said she had to reschedule and she told me she wanted to do something Halloweenish and I proposed a couple ideas, but then she said maybe next week would be better.

I was a little bummed and put off, but whatever, maybe Halloween’s a big deal to her, but she told me she just ended up watching movies when I asked her what she did that day. Like if I liked someone I would be down to go out with them on a day like Halloween especially if I have nothing to do.

She doesn’t seem like a texter either, and idk do you think I’m just overthinking things or does she just seem like not that invested in things. We’re scheduled to go out this Saturday, and I’m hoping that I can make some moves and have her be a bit more invested.

I don't know if it went good or bad and honestly I don't know if I should go out with her again. 

She's cute and smart and we're both from the same country (that means we share similar culture and language, but we're from different states) and attending the same grad school at New York. During the data I flirted with her and we had a great conversation (about almost everything ). However, she told me that she downloaded tinder because she was bored and wanted to make friends and figured out that guys are the easiest to find and she even stated that she doesn't want to date (She moved new to the US). Then she said that she went out with four guys from tinder but decided to stop seeing them again because she didn't like them. Also, she said that she has no male friends and never had one.

I was blown away from this but I figured out that I should calm down and go with the flow. I then tried to come closer and touch her hand but she pulled away and said that she doesn't do physical touch on a first data. (She said she's shy too) This confused me because she already said she's not looking for a date yet somehow considered our meeting a date.

I decided to stay away from her and respect her boundaries. I even offered to end the date because she told me that she usually sleeps at this time but she said that she wants to stay more. 
However, I had to end the date because I felt somehow uncomfortable with her due to her statement above (and told her it's late and I have school tomorrow) (It was 12:00AM). 

Anyhow, I walked her home cause we live next to each other and didn't kiss or hug or anything but she told me that I should let her know if I want to go out with her again. No, I don't know if I want to see her again that why I need your advice.

Some points to consider:
1- She said that she likes how I look like and mentioned that my look and behavior made her think that I'm 28 (I'm 23 with a perfect beard).

2- She said she doesn't want to date yet when I tired to hold her hand she said she doesn't do that on a first date

3- Is she testing me or playing games?

She’s new in the city and wants to be an actress. She works a lot though to make ends meet, and has little free time. She has explained in detail to me about this, so I know she’s being truthful.

That said:

First date: she gets free Broadway tickets through her school so we went to a Broadway show, then got dinner and a drink after it. Dinner and a drink lasted about 2 hours. It was more of a meet and greet, and some fairly personal and genuine conversations. Solid first date, ended in a hug and that was it. Didn’t kiss, but that’s OK with me.

Texted her a day later for dinner and a movie the following week (or tonight). She agreed. We set it up and all that jazz. 2 days ago, she texts me saying her boss called her in for work tomorrow morning at 5:30AM. Very early considering she commutes by bike. So she asked me if we could watch the movie earlier, but also stated if I can’t she would still go and watch it. Being polite and out of respect, I said let’s scrap the movie and do dinner to end the night early. I wasn’t going to keep her up and make her worry about the time.

Anyways:

Second date: it ended 2 hours ago. Since we scrapped the movie, we just did dinner. She came straight from martial arts practice, and before that, school. So she had literally her school bags and gym bag with her. This girl has very little time, so she went out of her way to still see me.

So yeah, dinner lasted almost 2 hours. But during the 2 hours we had, we talked the entire time, had strong eye contact the entire time, high fived once, laughed plenty, told stories back and forth, talked more about interests… just generally spent more time getting to know each other. During the first date, we did, but this time it felt more fun and casual. There was light flirting and teasing. She asked me plenty of questions. She asked me if I could “critique” our pizza and I did, really well, and she genuinely impressed by how I spoke. It was fun.

Our first date was a little… down? She kept venting to me about struggling here, how she’s hardly making friends, how she never has a day off… shit like that. But tonight was more “happy.”

That said, the restaurant was closing up. She had work the next morning, so we split up and went home after a nice hug goodbye.

But I didn’t kiss. There was no build up. It was just a nice dinner and getting to know each other more.

At the beginning of our date she did suggest we should see the movie next week. I told her we should but we can talk about it later as I don’t know my schedule yet (neither does she). At the end I brought up the movie again, and she said she’ll let me know when she’s free next week. That was it, we hugged and said goodbye.

So… what now? Did I fuck up, Reddit? Does this seem like it’s going well so far and if so, how should I continue going?

 I was also questioning my feelings of affection and infatuation to her, like not feeling the drive to hold her hand, smell her hair, look into her eyes, etc. We met in the summer, spent about a month seeing each other, and then went long distance and i kept the communication mainly because i wanted to give it a chance judging from her personality and good nature. My my feelings of pure ""in love"" were not really there. 

Now that I broke her heart I feel absolutely terrible. Didn't get any sleep last night and I keep blaming myself for not giving this enough of a chance and bailing out on the plans like this. I am getting a cocktail of feelings and I have always been very bad at deciphering my feelings. Yet, I unfortunately act a lot out of emotions and because I don't understand my emotions I tend to make my life miserable.

I remember as a kid, I may meet a girl and take an intense liking to her. Sometimes I can super shy and would run away from her. Other times I would following her around. There are other hard to describe feelings. 

As an adult, that hasn't been happening. Often times there is a sexual attraction. There are much more consideration to personality beyond just whether or not the person is fun. Feelings are not so intense. Everything feels cold, and calculated, and cerebral. Instead of being intense, emotional, surprising, and out of control. 

Main Question: Is that ""supposed"" to happen ?

(You can stop reading from here. The rest if you want to get even deeper.)

This very very very slow transition started, I think, 5th grade. Something I didn't really think of until I was an adult. I started to miss the feelings I use to get as a kid. I would often dream about certain past crushes, and in the dream we are both older versions yet for some reason are at the school we went to other. There dreams are, from what I remember, non sexual in nature. In fact, a lot of the time it is unrequited feelings in the dream. And after waking up, I would feel feelings. I am wondering to what extent is that just nostalgia.

I'm a first time poster here on reddit, so bare with me. I will first write you guys some backstory: about a half year ago my then-boyfriend and I broke up because he decided it was a great plan to cheat on me with his colleague en to send her flowers while vacationing with me. When I found out I ended our 6.5 year relationship then and there and never looked back. I decided to dive into my pain and focus on healing, which I did for a few months. 2 months ago I decided it was time to dive back into the dating game. With a healthy dose of hesitation I decided to install Tinder on my phone. Here I met a very nice guy (let's call him K). K was open, communicative, sensitive, which triggered something in me as this was everything I had missed in the relationship with my ex. We decided to meet up after a week of intense talking. When I saw him I was instantly smitten and I felt he felt the same. We went for drinks, everything was great but it was also moving quite fast. However, he told me we could take it as slow as I wanted and that he understood it was not easy for me to open up. We saw each other 4 times over 2 weeks and went for drinks, dinner and a movie. When we went to the movies we kissed the whole time and my heart was exploding thinking I had really found something special (as I usually don't really develop feelings quickly). When we were in the movies, he whispered in my ear he was falling in love with me and i reciprocated. He also said he never felt this much for someone over such a short time span. We talked about him coming to my birthday (which is a month from now) so I thought we were really building something. However after the date in the movies (which was on Saturday) where he told me these things, I noticed K started to pull away slightly on Monday. I felt my senses tingling, but I decided I was being overly sensitive because of my dating history. But I felt more and more distance throughout the day, which is noticeable when you usually talk constantly. So when I asked him he admitted that he felt like something was holding him back the last 2 days and that he didn't know what he wanted but that he did really like me. I told him he could call me at the end of the day to discuss it and that I didn't want to have this convo over text. When he called me he was pulled back, told me he wasn't doing great. I asked him what was going on but he couldn't really give much more subtext than ""I just felt my interest and feelings decline a little and I don't know why"". I was very confused by the contrast of these words and the way our date went that Saturday. When I told him I didn't get it because I would never say I was falling for someone if I'm not sure, he didn't really provide more insight. So then I decided to close the door myself because I didn't feel like pulling at him to communicate (which I always had to do with my ex). So I told him that I know what I deserve and that I need someone who provides more clarity and stability, and that I wasn't going to push and chase him. This seemed to irritate him, as he became distant instantly and his voice changed. When he didn't really say anything else I thanked him for the nice dates and wished him the best, and I ended the converstation. All he had to say was an irritated ""ok then bye"". But now I feel like I miss talking to K and I'm not sure if I made the right decision I made to close the door so fast. On the other hand he didn't really give me much to work with.
I would love to get you guys's idea about his fast pullback after telling me he was falling for me, and about how I handled the situation. Obviously the situation with my ex has made me more conservative, but was my reaction a bit too much? Do I talk to him again now that I feel like I miss him?

In general I (21F and British if that makes a difference)think it’s safe to say I’ve not been the luckiest with my love life situations in recent years so when my long term relationship ended in the summer I joined bumble, as per the suggestion of my friends. I’m new to the online dating scene so would really appreciate some advice about this very odd situation. I was just scrolling through it last week got a fair number of matches, spoke to a few but the conversation just wasn’t flowing so these just died out, or I had some that very clearly just wanted hook ups and were quite forward about it to say the least. Then one night I got a notification saying that someone (he’s about a year older than me) had extended their match with me (I must have missed it the first time and forgotten to message) so I messaged the guy because I thought it was nice that he’d been somewhat interested enough to extend the match. Again I’m new to online dating so I’m not really sure what extending the match on the guys side would mean or what he necessarily intends from it, but still. He replied back fairly quickly, seemed super sweet even made a joke about him extending the match. We messaged a little and it was very different to other matches like this was actually a decent conversation which held up on both ends. He then asked if we could message over insta or text and maybe organise a drink, to which I thought yeah great so I gave him my insta and we messaged on there. Again he seemed lovely we were just speaking about our week/work and a few other things and this was in the evening one night, I think I mentioned I was packing for a trip I was going on the next day. He then says ‘ahh I was going to ask if you fancied chilling together but no worries if you’ve still got a lot to do tonight’. I kind of then thought oh does he just want to hook up but the conversation did still go on for a bit regardless. The next evening I was out with friends so I was a little tipsy, I thought fuck it I’ll just ask and see if he actually wants to go for a drink so I suggested it. He replied and said he’d be keen for drinks and seemed enthusiastic about it, asked me what days I’m free this week. I told him and he said sounds good he’s not sure when he’s free yet but will let me know. I thought that sounds fine so I told him yeah that’s fine. He then says ‘sounds good, and if I don’t message you next couple of days just remind me please xxx’. Now this is the bit which I found quite strange like why would someone have to remind you to message them? I just responded with yeah no worries I will and he replied quickly saying something like ‘that’s great, look after yourself’ and thought I’ll leave it a few days to see if he messages if not I will. He hadn’t messaged after 3 days so I did, I think I just said something like hey we should get around to organising something. I sent this yesterday and he still hasn’t opened the message or replied. As it’s insta you can see if someone is online, (I wasn’t stalking by any means but I just happened to notice when replying to a friend’s DM). Tbf he hadn’t been active much most of the evening because it said something like active 4 hours ago but he would have definitely seen I’d messaged and been online after I had sent it. I think he was on this morning (I did look this time just because I’m confused as to why he didn’t reply). And again hasn’t opened the message. So here’s where I need people’s advice/opinions: 

Trying to look at possible reasons (I’m an over thinker) and I’ve come up with the following, pls let me know what you think is most likely:

1. He just wanted to hook up- this one seems fairly plausible I mean it’s a dating app, I guess in some ways bumble is just seen as a slightly more acceptable version of tinder but people use both for the same thing. So I wouldn’t be surprised if this was the case. However part of me wants to doubt it just because the conversation really didn’t seem like it was going that way, I mean why bother to ask about my degree or stuff I was working on. And why say you’re keen for a drink. And why bother to even extend the match, surely they’d have been other easier matches to speak to for a hook up? (Again I don’t know too much about the matching process or number of matches guys actually get on bumble) 

2. He got cold feet/lost interest- this is also very plausible, unfortunately I guess people just lose interest sometimes. It just feels strange or frustrating because he pursued me first, so when this does happen it makes you feel like you’ve done something to put them off? Anyway this is always a possibility in the dating world 

3. He’s talking to other girls- again also very plausible I would assume. Only thing I would guess is that if he wasn’t active on Instagram much then maybe he isn’t necessarily talking to other people, or on there anyway. But of course a lot of people on dating apps do message multiple people at the same time, and get bored of others quickly so I wouldn’t be surprised if this was the case. 

4. He wanted an ego boost- now this is an interesting one. So I’ve heard that a lot of guys will go on dating apps and pursue someone to then ghost them, or so that it switches to that person pursuing them which gives them an ego boost. I’ve probably not explained that very well but you get the idea. 

5. He is just genuinely busy- I do think he is quite busy with his job from what I’d gathered from speaking to him, which is of course understandable. But even so he had always replied much faster than this so I’m not too sure in that sense. 

So that brings us to now where I think it’s been about 24 hours since I messaged, which I am just going to assume he’s ghosted me? I guess I’m just needing advice about all of the above possible reasons. Also how long do I even leave it before I fully accept that it is ghosting, like is 24hrs enough or should I still give him a bit of a chance to reply? It’s kind of disappointing when this happens I guess, just don’t understand why someone would go to quite a bit of effort to talk even off the dating app to then just ghost. Anyway I would appreciate any advice/own stories/opinions on this situation. And in the mean time I think I’ll be avoiding dating apps for the rest of 2021 at least",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1123787,public,self,Did he just ghost me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qn8z1l/did_he_just_ghost_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

I’ve been dating this girl for over a year now.  I love her more than anything in this world.  She is on the spectrum which always finds us in social interactions in public that seem to only be hilarious to me because people don’t know how to take her or she’s not aware of the social situation lmao.  The problem is when we first started the relationship I was very clear about how important health is to me and in a future wife.  She agreed and acted like she was super into it as well.  Over the past year she has gained over 30 lbs.  She was very small when we first started dating so this is a ton of weight.  I still love her but no longer find her sexually attractive.  She begs for sex and I just can’t do it.  Every time I see her with her clothes off it reminds me of the laziness and lies she told me at the beginning.  Far more importantly she has EDS so extra weight will literally take decades off of her life.  I don’t want to be married to a woman who is only going to live to 40 and leave me with kids because she wouldn’t lose the weight to stay healthy.  I don’t see her weight slowing down any time soon.  What should I do?  I’ve tried getting her to go on more exercise based dates with me but any time I do she complains about the pain.  Her doctor has told her she has to be more active regardless of the pain because if she’s not it will only get worse and worse.  She always finds an excuse to not be active and be lazy.  I try to get her to track her calories but she just flat out tells me no.  I’m really at the end of it.

First date went well, although when I tried to schedule one for the next weekend she initially said yes but then texted me saying she was busy with school and suggested the next weekend. We went on a few dates over the next few weeks, and hung out on campus a few times too. On the 2nd date, she asked about previous relationships of mine and my opinions on them, I told her I had been in a couple relationships and she said she hadn’t been in one before. We didn’t text super often but we talked about how we don’t like texting that much, and we still each initiated on text once or twice per week during this time. We also exchanged playlists.She unprompted sent me a personalized video of something she was doing with her friends, I sent one back a little later. The 3rd date I wanted to try and make some sort of move but it didn’t feel right, I wasn’t getting the right signs from her but now I realize I should’ve done something.

Because early in the week following this date, I told her we should hang this coming weekend because I won’t be around the following weekend. She said sure but then later in the week said she was too busy to hang that weekend. Because of this it created a 3 week gap in between dates, and when we got lunch this past weekend, she paid, and then invited herself to a party at my house only to cancel an hour later. We talked about seeing a movie that is coming out this weekend, so I gave her one last shot and checked with her to see if she still wanted to see it, and she said her parents would be in town this weekend and it would be a bit hectic so she didn’t want to commit, which is a total cop out. She said to let me know what I think of the movie. 

Basically idk exactly what happened and I think that’s why I’m upset about this, although I understand it’s pretty normal for dating not to work out. I think I feel bad because if I get to this stage with someone I’ve always converted it to a relationship, and I feel like I fucked something up this time which sucks because I really thought she was a really good match for me. At the same time though it seemed like it was more so something on her end. She is genuinely busier than most college students, but no one is too busy to not hang out with someone they really like.

Is there anything I can do here? I have to see her in class today, but then I don’t have to see her for 2 weeks. I was just gonna not text her again and give her space, I’m curious to know what happened but I don’t think there’s anything I can do. Im sure it was a combination of a few things for her, she said she can be anxious, she hasn’t been in a relationship before, she takes school really seriously, maybe I didn’t make a move early enough but she made it clear she wasn’t in to just hookups and then we had that gap that killed momentum I guess. Idk I got so many mixed signals from her that this one stings and it went on for a while for nothing to happen. I guess I’d rather just know it’s over than continuing to be strung along. And we got to a point where now it could be weird to just be friends. She’s not a bad person or anything, I just want to find out what happened because it seemed undisputable that she was into me at certain times and I wonder if I said anything or if anything in particular happened. But I never will find out right? I just gotta back off and never text/bother her again? 

Like I was thinking of if in class today she says “lmk what you think of the movie” like how she said on text and I thinking what if I just said “I probably won’t let you know, it’s clear you don’t wanna be bothered and you’re just saying that to be polite”. Because she seems to say things in person that she doesn’t really mean just to avoid conflict. I wouldn’t say it in those words but you know what I mean.

We held hands and made out on the date.

We had really good chemistry in person and over text. We told each other that we drove each other wild and he told me that he was falling for me, was obsessed with me, could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match, things that no one has ever said to me before.

But I got a little too clingy and needy when he said that it seemed like I didn't know if I wanted to be with him because I raised some concern about not knowing if we'd be sexually compatible because he seemed more sexual than me. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that he'd have to have sex with me to see if he could get them back. I didn't want to have sex with him so soon, so we went our separate ways.

I've tried to move on since then, but I'm finding it really difficult.

I've gone on a few dates since then but I haven't found anyone that I had that same chemistry with, someone who liked me as much as he did, and I definitely haven't found someone as attractive as him.

1. How often do you get rejected for your height?

2. Do you bring up your height in advance?

3. Are you often cold approached less than your shorter female friends?

4. How tall would your ideal partner be? 

5. Do you wear heels on dates?



My responses:
2. Sometimes! Every time I have my height (178) listed on my Tinder bio my matches drop. And I even live in a tall country!

3. Yes. All the time. I think I am conventionally attractive, and try to make myself approachable with my body language, but most of the attention seems to go to my shorter friends. The only exception is when I'm sitting, then I get approached in person surprisingly often, lmao.

He just stopped initiating everything.  I thought he was not interested anymore, so I call him out on it but he reassured me that he was just busy.  

Few weeks ago , I was feeling really anxious towards our connection and I told him that I felt like I was getting played and I was kind of sad about it, and that if he wasnt not interested anymore, to fucking be honest with me and stopped playing games with me. He said : ''We already had this conversation, I'm just really busy with school and my 2 jobs. Maybe we should stop waiting for each other (to which I respond that I didnt want to stop)'' He continued saying that he didnt understand how this conversation was different for the previous one, and how it would make me feel less anxious, but the reality is, I didnt think he was THAT busy. Anyways, he told me that he would probably only have free time to see me after the New year, and that before that, he wouldnt be able to start any conversation with me (but if I was to text him, he would text back).

We had been friends on tumblr for a long time but hadn't talked in this point in about 6 years. Things were always flirtacious when we were younger, but we had a 6 hour time difference so things clearly never escalated.

Fast forward about 6 months, things have been escalating. She's separating from her boyfriend, and is really wanting to come and visit me. We make plans to get together in January, but as she was going to buy the plane ticket, I got cold feet. She was very hurt but understanding. I explained I didn't want to uproot her life, create an attachment, or potentially ruin her situation with her current bf if she decided she did want to give it another chance with him.

I proceeded to date a girl for the following four months which eventually fizzled out, and we picked things back up where they left off. I proposed she come and visit me in August for my birthday, which she accepted. At this point, she had moved out of the shared space with her boyfriend which she said she was currently separated from and looking to get out of the relationship, but some entanglement issues had to be resolved. 

The night before she visited we had a phone call where we explained that we were just going to keep things casual and fun, with no expectations. That's not what happened. We both got very attached, very fast. We started immediately making plans for me to visit in December, which she booked an Airbnb for us and set up an itinerary. I went ahead and booked my flight and made accommodations on my end to come visit. She was sending me gifts weekly, of what I've surmised to equal about $500-600 in about a month. All the gifts were insanely thoughtful and applicable to my interests and hobbies. We also started to discuss one of us potentially relocating in the future to stay for a few months to see if we were compatible in a coinhabiting environment.

Things were fairly normal for the following month and a half, and then there was a drastic change in the situation. She became more distant, but was strangely still wanting constant communication. But things just definitely felt off. I would occasionally check in and make sure things were ok, which she would insist they were. Finally she came forward and explained that she was starting to become uneasy, and the reason she was ending her previous relationship was to find herself and become more independent. Despite this, I explained to her that I wasn't trying to rush into a serious relationship and was trying to take things slow. She was still discouraged.

I told her to take a week to think about things without my input or presence and I thought that would be best for her to get some clarity. We reconnected a week later and I told her I was still open to coming to visit if she was down. She said ""I was hoping that was what you were going to say, but I'm still unsure.""

I expressed to her that I was going to go ahead and make my own accommodations to visit and take the pressure off of her, as I was already interested in the location to begin with and have been looking to move for a while now and she could now feel less obligated to the situation.

A week goes  by and I'm trying my best to not be overbearing, and creating a little bit of distance so she doesn't feel smothered. She contacts me an in summary basically said ""it feels like you want exclusivity and I can't offer that to you right now, and I'm trying to work through it and I don't know what to do"" -- I explained to her I had never asked for exclusivity and was totally willing to take things super slow and just see where they went naturally. But by now I'd hit a breaking point, and told her I was going to create some distance for a while and give her time to think about the situation, and I was going to continue to visit and if she wanted to see me, she could, and if she didn't, I would have a good time on my own.

For the following two weeks, she posted every day on instagram (not in her nature), and was constantly baiting in her stories, adding songs we would listen to together, things I was interested in, sad song lyrics, mirroring things I had posted, etc. We would still watch each other's stories and like each other's posts, but we weren't directly communicating.

Last night I sent her a text saying I had slightly modified my travel plans to be close to where she was, but not quite where we had originally decided because I didn't want to be impeding and the other location was more accommodating for a solo trip with more things to do and to call me if she wanted to talk about it. She called me shortly later, and initially took the disposition of she didn't want to go there (she is incredibly agoraphobic, and struggles with anxiety.) I told her that was fine and maybe I could just come see her for a couple days while I was nearby. Eventually she came around and said she was open to the idea of coming to me, she just needed time to think about it. I called her out on the social media baiting which she did not deny, and said ""I clearly knew what I was doing."" She then proceeded to ask ""Well, how did it make you feel?"" and I responded ""I wish you would have just called me instead.""

I don't really know what to do going forward. My instinct is to go basically no contact until the trip, but the whole situation is really overwhelming.

If you're going to serious relationship, you need to set boundaries not only with your new partner  as we usually do, but with your family too. 

It baffles me that so many guys don't see this. Probably because that's how they grew up and think it's normal. But it's not your partner's place to set boundaries with your siblings or family, it's yours. And you should think better about these situations. 

Your partner will not always tell you that your sister was rude to her when you left the room. She will not tell you she noticed that your sister started to invite your ex or girl that likes you for meetings since you started dating. She might not tell you that your sister shouldn't be calling or texting constantly over minor things  when you're out having a date night. She may not tell you that it's not ok that your sister wants to come with you when you two have and you decide not to refuse to not offend her. Etc... 

I have experience with crazy obsessive sisters, or sisters that would sabotage our relationship and the guy couldn't see it. You can not imagine how many times I've turned down a guy just because he has a spoilt or entitled sister and considers it cute or acceptable. It can be a brother too but men tend to be more ""protective"" over sisters. I used to see it as something cute, a caring sibling, now it's just a huge red flag. 

It's not cute, it's annoying. Your girlfriend will find it even more annoying because she doesn't have the same sentiments to your siblings as you do. Do not let things be in a way where your partner has to tolerate something. It will only create more serious problems if you get married. 

So many guy friends I have are the same and I see how it affects their relationships. One of them can't get married because his girlfriend isn't comfortable with his sisters always involved and he can't see anything wrong with that. 

If you're dating a good girl you totally see as your future life partner, think more about these things and make her feel like one.

I’m curious as to what ages range different demographics look in for casual partners?

———————————-
Rambling back story below 

Im genuinely curious. Iv always been very promiscuous and yet found myself in long term relationship. I lost my virginity quite young (14 *shudders*) to a ‘long term girlfriend’. We were together for 2.5 years. I slept with a couple other people and then got into another 3 year relationship. I went pretty hard.. pun intended.. for a few years after that until I met my fiancé. 

We’ve been together for 6 years now. For a few years we have been in a comfortable and practiced open relationship. Our sex drives are vastly different and due to my previous work I was away more often than I was at home. 

I ended up with a few regular FWB which meant I could scratch the itch without the fuss of picking up or using apps. 

We’ve now relocated meaning if I want to make some new connections I need to put myself out there, something that I haven’t done for a while. Plus due to Covid I am now magically 2 years older than I think I am.
