0,po7pwk,1631641494,Girl toying with me?,"So at sixth form ive know this girl for a couple weeks and i have talked to her a bit and she followed me on instagram then 30 mins later unfollowed. I played it off and i was going to follow shortly in the next couple days . The next day i was sitting down near her and her friend and they both followed me, so i went over and started talking with them and when i asked if she followed she denied it and laughed to her friend like i caught her ( i followed her when i was talking to her and she accepted me) . And when i got home from college i saw she was no longer following me from when she followed me earlier that day. So tomorrow im going to play it off like she never unfollowed me or else i will seem desperate.
But i figured she must have an interest if she followed me on that one night and she followed me in the day time and talked abt me with her friend. 

Important:
- i found out she has a boyf when i asked who it was on hee home screen and she said her bf
-she is shy so its sometimes hard to keep the convo going but i do my best (i cant tell whether she is shy/nervous or doesn't want to talk to me)

So my questions are what does this stuff mean?
Is her bf on her acc unfollowing a random boy?
Is she toying with me or trying to get my attention?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/po7pwk/girl_toying_with_me/

He messaged me as soon as he got home and we had been messaging on and off until Sunday but the couple of days before that it was more me that was initiating and he was just answering but it wasn't constant communication. 

We haven't messaged since Sunday and he hasn't suggested ant more plans - I assume this is because he wasn't actually into me or was at the beginning but is probably saying other people who he prefers.

6,po86wi,1631642995,I am in love with the wrong girl,"This one is though for me. She has been my best friend for years and I cant help but crushing on her from time to time. The chemistry between us is pretty great, we have some common interests etc.  


we have been at the psych ward together. We have been there for each others trough Hellfire and Brimstone. I would say we have been in some sort of platonic relationship but sometimes we have drifted off into a grey area.  


Right now we are back into that grey area since I slept over at her place this weekend. Nothing happened and usually nothing happens. She didnt hint that anything were going to happen anyways. She just wanted to feel safe for the night since she get really anxious sometimes.  


I have come a long way since I spent several months with her at the psych ward. She has come far as well but she is still staying home a lot, I struggle to get her to meet me outside of town and so on. You can say that I am functioning slightly better than her.   


Right now I regret never spending the last 3 years together with her in the first place. I feel like I should have even if she was far from perfect. She is very pretty, our personalities match, chemistry match. It is just that she is ill and not always emotionally available.  


Last weekend I was at her place watching Netflix all day. We went out of her apartment once to grab some food. I treated her like a friend since she has been treating me like one recently and I had no reason to think that I wasnt in her friend zone. And I was ok with that.  


She briefly touched my ass and that is a quite sexual move. Maybe she missed my lower back but it got me thinking if this Platonic relationship thing I have with her is just a clever lie I have been telling myself.  *She likes me and I think I am in love with her.*  


But I am conflicted. I will have to put in most of the effort for the foreseeable future. She isnt functioning 100%. I dont think I would mind being with her for the time being but I have no idea about how things will look like a few years down the road. If she is still ill and I have gone too far ahead then I suspect it will be a world of hurt for both of us.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/po86wi/i_am_in_love_with_the_wrong_girl/

My bf (23M) and I (22F) have been together for a while (friends to lovers). Two weeks ago he told me about this girl and her friends he met when he was out with his friends. I got a really bad feeling about that girl as soon as he told me. I felt like something was going on and he wasn’t telling me that. Not the feeling that he was cheating on me with her, but that there is something more to it.

Last night, he told me about that night and told me what they were talking about and my mind was instantly like “why did you talk like that with a person you just met”. When I was about to go home he said that has to tell me something. He told me that he knew that girl from highschool and that they didn’t meet that night as he told me. I asked why he didn’t tell me that before and he said that he didn’t want to tell me that through text since there was a possibility I could get it wrong. I believed him without questioning it more.

As soon as he told me that, I felt relieved. The stomach pain, nausea, anxiety, all of that was gone. I feel more calm now that I know the truth. I felt so uncomfortable before because I knew there was something else and I didn’t know what exactly.

10,po8dpn,1631643573,Super Shy Guy 32. Been in relationship most my life. Dating seems impossible for someone like me.,"Been single for a while now.I have no idea how to flirt without feeling rude. To say I'm socially awkward is a bit of an understatement so any flirt attempts (even when people tell me exactly what I'm supposed to do) are pretty out of touch and will likely come off terribly.  Online dating seems to be a complete dead end as I've matched maybe 8 people after literally reaching the point of it telling me I have to check foreign country options and none of them messaged me back after I did a friendly intro message. I know I'm supposed to do joke intros and stuff for online dating but man a joke just feels so disingenuous for someone like me. My humor isn't like that at all... I just want to be a dorky, affectionate, shy person but that doesn't seem to get my foot in the door anywhere online or in real life. I can't tell if I'm looking for advice or just need a pep talk.

 I don't do well alone and finding a partner in a world where meeting people in real life seems impossible without being rude(especially due to my horrible awkwardness and lack of natural social skills) and the fact that online dating feels worse is really rough.

 On top of that it really does a number on my self esteem and that's sad because up until recently I actually really liked me and would have said I was reasonably attractive if I was your type. Just lacking in social skills and flirting skills which I know is huge but man I didn't realize how much of a difference it makes. I don't want to be rude until I'm skilled enough to flirt in a way that doesn't suck but I feel like I don't have a choice if I want attention from anyone... 

Anyway I'm just venting into the void that is the internet. I don't expect a solution.

12,po8hay,1631643876,Reaching out to a old crush/co worker,"
Hi everyone,
So, last year while working at Asda, I met a girl who I fell for hard pretty much instantly. I liked pretty much everything about her, but unfortunately I waited to long to ask her out and another one of our co workers beat me to it. This obviously really sucked but I accepted it,and  thought maybe in the future when I’m no longer working with them and if she became single I could try  reach out on Instagram and maybe go from there (obviously not straight away after she became single though). I didn’t have a proper Instagram account at this point, just a blank one that I use to follow pages I like which is why I didn’t follow her then and she doesn’t have Facebook.

I ended up leaving the job in April and haven’t spoken to anyone there since then, at this point they were still together. I do have a proper Instagram account now. However, I’m pretty sure she knew I fancied her at the time, so I’m worried that following her now will just seem weird to her, especially if she’s still with her boyfriend. We never spoke outside work and I’ve not kept in touch with anyone there. I also kinda left the store on bad terms after getting fed up with management, so this might also make it a bit awkward to try and get back in touch with her. 
Just want to clarify as well that I’ve not just been sitting around waiting for her to become single, but I’ve not had anything serious since then and she came up again in my thoughts and I was wondering how she’s been.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/po8hay/reaching_out_to_a_old_crushco_worker/

Right now I’m happily in a relationship with a man that I actually like and consider a high value man.
But in the past year I dated a couple people that I knew I didn’t like from the start. I either wasn’t attracted to them, or considered them to not be good enough (less educated, not financially stable, no hobbies/social life, etc.)
Yet I wasted so much time dating these people mainly because I liked how they treated me.

Now I’m just annoyed with myself, I feel like I wasted so much time settling for people that I knew I wanted to leave. It made me very selfish/uncaring as a gf. Being around someone That I considered not good enough didn’t make me want to strive to be better.

We really get along, we make a good team when it comes to stuff that matters to both of us; we can cook together nicely, plan trips with no hassle, we like the same sort of activity, etc. 

But there is one major issue for me: I'm an insecure guy, and I tend to anxiously attach, and she is quite the opposite; trusting, secure in herself and in her looks, knows what she wants. This becomes hard for me to deal with mixed with her much-greater-than-mine sex life. Over the first few dates she was very open about having a super active sex life for a while in the past, which included quite a few ON,S and some open relationships.

Knowing all of the above brings thoughts like ""am I ever going to be enough?"", or ""is she just going to find some other dude"", even though she has explicitly told me that she hasn't felt like she does about me in years, and that she doesn't need nor want to see other people.

I notice myself becoming uncomfortable over unreasonable stuff — for instance she usually tells me when she finds people on TV attractive, and it makes me squirm... What the hell, dude?

I feel like the disparity in our levels of confidence, self esteem, and experience could pile up into a big ball of anxiety for me, and result in self-sabotage. I don't know how do deal with her, or my feelings about her experiences. She tries to be reassuring, but I feel so dumb and little :(

23,po9ots,1631647563,ONLINE DATING WORKS!,"👉 ONLINE DATING WORKS 👈

Online dating is the easiest way to meet amazing women and get 2-3 even 4 dates per week, ONLY IF you follow some rules 👇

If your thoughts of online dating are these:

❌ There is no one serious on these apps
❌ Women ghost me and disappear 
❌ There is too much competition
❌Only attractive guys get matches

Then you seriously need to change the way you approach the online dating.

✅ First and foremost, UPLOAD QUALITY PICTURES. 

It's so simple yet, so many guys wonder why they are not getting responses. If you don't have good pictures, hire a photographer for a very small amount of money.

✅ STOP SENDING ""HI"" AND ""HOW ARE YOU"" OR EVEN ""YOU ARE HOT"".

These messages are huge turn off for women, simply because it shows that you are just another typical guy who doesn't really know how to communicate properly. Be different, send something funny or ""weird"" so it catches her attention.

✅ Stop being so overly excited about your matches.

Of course, it's great when you get matches. The serotonin levels are high at the moment. But, you don't even know her. Qualify her first, before you dive into arranging a date. And most importantly STOP being needy.

✅ Check how invested she is.

Check the length of her messages, and always match them with the length of your messages. Stop asking questions all the time, make positive assumptions about her. Also, convey a bit of your personality, so she can trust you before asking for a date.

34,poaoip,1631650553,Do you ever ‘get over’ your first relationship?,"LHowdy. 21F. There’s a lot of context — sorry!

Last November, I broke up with the guy I’d been dating since I was 12. All through high school, college, most of university — regardless of whether or not you can call it a ‘relationship’ at 12, it was a long 7.5 years in which we basically grew up together. 

The breaking point was the final time he ghosted me; not replying to any calls and texts for a week whilst I was away at uni (likely would have gone on longer, but I text him to say I would be ending it), and it was the third time he’d done so. The second time (around six months prior), it was three weeks with no response and I never got a full explanation — I told him at the time that if he needed mental health support I’d help him get it, but that I wouldn’t be put through it again. 

There were other issues in the relationship; I didn’t like that he was aimless in life, disagreements about what we’d do once I graduated (he wanted to stay in our home village, I wanted to move away), I felt like I had to ‘look after him’ and do all the cooking, make all the decisions, we had less than ideal communication — a good handful of things. But ultimately, I think we were both more content than we were happy, and it couldn’t have survived as an adult relationship. So I ended it. And after 8-9 months of *constant* texts and calls from him (I blocked him in March, he went as far as contacting my family etc until I set some boundaries with them in June), I finally have some peace.

But I keep getting bursts of just *missing* him. 

Or maybe just missing the comfort of the relationship? I don’t know. I had a short thing with somebody else for a few months before breaking it off because I just couldn’t feel ready to commit to someone new. It feels wrong to think about *trying* to get that close with another person, and it’s as though I can’t just relax and feel that way about someone else.

It’s been almost a year now, and I know for sure that things with my ex couldn’t work — nor do I want to try them again. But, God, does this feeling ever stop? He was the one person I felt fully at ease around, and I’m scared I’m never going to be that comfortable around somebody again. I don’t want to date, because I don’t want to be constantly comparing somebody to him; that wouldn’t be fair. And I feel guilty about feeling that way, because I’m the one who ended it in the first place. 

Has anybody had a similar situation? Have you managed to feel at ease in another relationship? Does the feeling ever go away? :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/poaoip/do_you_ever_get_over_your_first_relationship/

38,pob65h,1631652047,Lost my mojo...,"So, my partner and I broke up last October, at the time I was constantly being eyed up, felt I was looking okay and feeling overall quite confident.

So, almost a year later, I went on a few dates before my birthday, managed about 5 in a couple of months just before I turned 40.

Then it happened, I was officially middle aged. I got rid of the apps because I was fed up with the quality of matches, some of the strange behaviour on dates and it was bringing me down.

I assumed I may run into someone, I might get a look thrown my way I could act on, or even a random conversation in a coffee shop.

I wasn't expecting the earth but honestly, it feels like I've lost my mojo, it's almost like I have a a neon sign with 40 blinking above my head. I don't know if it's mental, or I'm looking too hard into things but I feel a bit invisible to women if I'm honest.

I'm at the gym 6 days a week, I'm in good shape, always look smart and keep my hair well groomed.

Now I don't expect anyone to solve this, and personally, I feel like I may be putting out some sort of negative energy or maybe my lack of confidence is outwardly perceivable.

I'd just like someone to say, oh yeah, been there, it will come good, you're over thinking it. It's because of the lunar cycle etc.

I should note, this is the longest I've ever been single and at the start I purposely did the spending time with myself thing but now I think I've crossed over into some sort of middle aged wasteland.

Honestly, after hearing that i dont know how to feel going forward. If she knew i was writing this shed just get upset and say ""i shouldnt have never told you how i felt"" and shut me out again. After 4 years, how am i supposed to feel? Do i stop doing the things i was doing bc part of me wants to take what she said into consideration and make change so that shed feel better? I really dont know and if i tell her how i feel shell just throw it back at me. I always viewed her as a strong woman who does and should have confidence but now?

we did have sex once but I told him I don’t want something casual; he said he doesn’t want that either, so I said I want to get to know him better before we jump into anything. Last time we hung out he told me he sees something in me, mentioned getting into a relationship in the future, that he would wait until I was “ready.” But keep in mind.. this is in the context of me saying no to sex almost every time because again, I don’t want something casual and he knows that. 

fast forward to now, we talk literally every day, but it’s gotten a little dry and we haven’t hung out in about a week. I don’t want to initiate “hanging out” because I’d rather go on a date, and I’ve said no to a few of his offers to hang for the same reason. Basically I’ve been waiting for him to step up and actually ask me on a 2nd date because I’ve told him that’s what I want. so he hasn’t asked me to hang in a while even when he knows I’m free. 

my overthinking ass (was it obvious) thinks there are two possible conclusions… 1) he just wanted me for sex/casual and was just saying those things, but now realizes I won’t give him that until he puts his words (wanting to be serious) into actions so he is giving up; or 2) he thinks I’m not interested anymore and/or thinks I’m being wishy washy because I won’t initiate anything and have turned down hanging out, so he doesn’t want to try….

56,podf9s,1631659261,"Getting mixed signals, I'm confused","First a little bit of a backstory, I am 22F and in 2019 I kissed my friend's sister on a drunken night out because I felt like she was looking at me some kind of way and thought it would be fun. I knew I liked girls back then, but I didn't really have much experience. Then, we meet on another night out and make out again when we are left alone. After that we didn't see each other for like 6 months and the same thing happens. Didn't really think much about it. We are sort of neighbors but she lives in another town because of college. So we usually see each other when she visits her family. 

Corona comes and she is back home. Since we have a mutual friend we started seeing each other more and tension was building up. She started getting in my head. We would hold hands, make out, feel each other around. I felt like there was real chemistry between us. Then she started going back and forth coming home and to that other town. We were talking and went out a couple of times, but she started replying to my messages like once a day or less. I felt as if she lost interest. We stopped talking. I was pretty disappointed but oh well.

And now, about a month ago I did a bad thing. I kind of have a boyfriend now, nothing serious, but still, quite a disrespectful act. I was at my friend's house, we were drinking, smoking etc. and her sister (HER) comes home. Drunk/high me follows her to the bathroom and kisses her. The next day she messages me saying how shes glad I did that. We start talking again and go to this festival together in separate friend groups. We shared a tent and spent every night together. We even discussed the possibility of us actually being a couple. When we got back home we went on 2 dates and slept together. We continued messaging every day and then she went back to college town (most of her friends are there). For some reason when she's in college town her replies are much rarer but I can see she's active on social media. I'm not the best replier so I don't really mind. She comes back home again and starts replying actively. Goes back to college town and the slow replies are back again. It took her over 24h to reply to my last message and I just don't feel like talking anymore. Getting one message a day makes me feel like she lost interest again and I am again left disappointed. I cheated on the guy I'm seeing for what. I have been planning on ending things with him romantically (and will do it soon) since we are more like friends than lovers, but that doesn't make it alright. But that is a whole other story now.

(I’ve never had a girlfriend before so I’m pretty oblivious about such cues.) And by flirty I mean: she will sometimes hug me (I have not seen her do this with any other guy at the workplace), she usually calls me nicknames, she asks me to come over to where she is sometimes and usually chats me up a little or asks me a random quick question, occasionally asks what I’m doing on a weekend and suggests drinking or other kind of outing, she also rarely suggests her giving me her phone number but her friends/female coworkers have pretty much always stopped or interrupted thinking that i’m being bothered by her (I’m a very passive, laid back person so I understand them acting that way lol).

At first I thought she just liked messing with me like in a platonic/friendly way, but now I’m starting to believe she’s possibly romantically interested in me. And her general “warmth” has begun making me kind of like her a lot. 

I think I would totally date this girl if she asked me out in a way that wasn’t too subtle for me to understand or if I knew for sure she was into me in this way and that I had the perfect opportunity to ask her. I just don’t know how to approach this being a total relationship virgin. 

And yes, I’m aware of the risks that are involved with dating a coworker, I think she is cool enough that I’m willing to take those risks! 

Any advice on this would be appreciated!

70,poewyr,1631664535,Should I text him? Is he thinking about me too?,Please bare with me this story is a bit long but I will try to summarize it. I was seeing a guy for a month and we hit it off everything has been amazing. He told me he was looking for a relationship at the beginning when we first met and we saw eachother every weekend and talked everyday on the phone when we both weren’t working. Everything was going great we had this crazy connection and bond and agreed we’re both so alike. I never felt this deep for someone before it was an amazing feeling. Recently he expressed he’s not ready for a relationship and is worried if he gets into one with me he’s worried he will hurt me or break up with me. This confused me and I was surprised by this because we both said from the beginning we want this to turn into one. He didn’t explain why he just said he’s not ready right now and wants to take things slow. Although he was always calling me babe and telling me everyday he missed me etc. When we were together he would hold my hand and always be very affectionate. I asked him if he was talking to anyone else and he said no he is only interested in me and I said the same. This past weekend we were spending time together and he then told me he doesn’t think he’s over his ex and that if she were to reach out to him he’s unsure if he would want to try things again with her as they had spent years together. I felt totally blindsided and hurt because he told me prior that it wasn’t a good relationship and that they mutually ended it. I was really starting to fall for this guy and we talked about always spending weekends together and then this came up out of nowhere I instantly started crying. He apologized and told he he still really likes me and has feelings for me and said he’s just really confused and needs to think. He hasn’t messaged me since. Is it over? I just feel so hurt and taken back by this as I thought we were on the same page on where we were heading.

After some friendly small talk, it eventually led to him asking if I was married, then for my number.  I gotta admit, I was flattered!  He ended up messaging me later that afternoon and we ended up chatting for about 2 hours or so.  The conversation went well in my opinion.  His engagement with me was spot on; he asked a lot of questions; asked for a photo to show to his friends and family; complimented my appearance.  He also asked me out to dinner this weekend, to which I said yes.  Before we said goodbye I made sure to mention that when he had time during the week to shoot me a message to let me know how he’s doing and if he had time for lunch.  He told me he didn’t want to say yes because he has a pretty tight work schedule for the next couple of months but said if he could find time to break away he’d for sure have lunch with me.  Needless to say, I got super excited about this and got my hopes up (doh!).  Well, it’s been a few days and I haven’t received a single message from him.  I know that he’s swamped with his job but I have to admit I’m a bit hurt that I haven’t heard back from him yet.  I keep overthinking things (for example, if he were really genuinely interested he’d find time to reach out; maybe he’s really not interested in me; he’s talking to other women, etc.).  I’ve gone back and forth with myself about sending him a message first but the thought of a delayed/no response would send my anxiety through the roof.

74,pof4jw,1631665310,Hearthbroken and lost,"Hi guys, I need you advice, Im feeling lost.  
My boyfriend (29M) end our relationship on sunday, he say that he didnt feel comfortable with the last things that happen between us and he wasn't feeling as much as I do, and that makes him feel uncomfortable and frustrated, those were the reasons. We were dating for 7 months and I things were really good, i feel in love with him and i felt that he could be the person to spent the rest of my life.   But he think I took things a little fast for his taste, he is a more self contained person and im more relax.

I admit my fault in the things, i know, make him uncomfortable, and apologize for it. He only say: "" I forgive you"". The things that make him uncomfortable:

\- Told him my family want to meet him, and invited him to a carnita asada party.  He felt pressure and scared of that, I only mentioned twice, when they gave the invitation and confirming if he will go. 

\- Wearing a ring in my anular finger that he gave me (cause i like it and he gave it, after i ask if i could keep it, just that, it didnt symbolize anything deeper, for me it was just a reminder of him that I can have daily).

\- One day I got mad due work stuff , he showed me a ring that he use to have and I ask the really dumb question of who he gave it, and he answer with the truth (ex-girlfriend) and I got jealous, and he got uncomfortable due my jelousy ( I admit I was wrong and apologize for it at the moment). Later it got really late and he live far from where we were and I told him I drove him near his house, he didnt want to cause he feels it should be even and that wasnt, I didnt care and drove him near his house, he got really mad, I cry and apologize for my tamtrum of leaving him near. This was the end of the road.

On sunday I feel insecure and sad, and after the evening together i just pull the trigger and ask if he wanted to dump me, his answer was yes and he told me all this stuff, and that he wanted to end it after the reunion with my family (which I think he wasnt coming but thats the date he puts in his agenda to dump me) and he tols me that we should keep the plans for the weekend and talk more deeply about it ...

We have been talking almost like normal, I just talk as if he was friend no cheesy stuff or cute emojis, sending him hugs like I do with all my friends, and he has been sending cute emojis and been a little more caring ... now I feel im the cold one ... I dont know what to think.

I dont know how to feel, I dont know if I should see him on the weekend (I want to, but if all things are going to the end why I should go, thats the questioning).  I dont know if it still worth it?

75,pof5i8,1631665410,I'm (27F) on the fence about a messy guy (30M),"TLDR: How to tell potential partner I need them to clean more?

I went on two great dates with a new guy and we went back to his place after the second and hooked up.  He's nice, funny, has a good job, we share interests, want similar things, and there's mutual attraction, but his place was kind of a mess and it's killing the vibe for me. He basically had no furniture, just a mattress on the floor, boxes and clutter everywhere, etc. The bathroom was the worst by far, toilet was gross and there was hair all over the counter.

Both of us have depression and the pandemic has been weird so I can empathize, but we're at an age where I expect people to put in a certain amount of effort for a good impression and to make sure I'm comfortable (the lack of consideration is the main issue and bothers me more than the mess itself).

I'm conflicted because I'm really excited about the potential and he seems seriously interested too, but if we're going to keep seeing each other I need him to like... clean. I have no interest in being someone's mom. I figure I have nothing to lose by just telling him that, but I'm not sure how to bring it up without coming off as critical or like it's some dramatic ultimatum, or maybe this is just doomed from the start.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pof5i8/im_27f_on_the_fence_about_a_messy_guy_30m/

So I text him on Friday ‘what’s the plan for Saturday? Are you free’ he doesn’t respond rile Saturday morning that he has made plans with a friend. 

It’s fine that he has plans with a friend. The issue is I am waiting around for planning a date and I feel like he is putting forward no effort.

He’s holding back. And it’s because building a relationship is like an investment. You have to think about the long-term value, not just how it feels right now.

That’s why you may have been confused by his behavior. He seems to really like you, but something is holding him back.

87,pog65x,1631669183,"A few friends told me, in the most genuine way, that they have no idea why I’ve been single my whole life, and it’s something I cannot seem to answer","

So for context I’m 23, a virgin, never been in a relationship or on a date or anything . As far as I’m aware no girl has ever been interested in me in that way beyond one or two drunken makeouts over the years. I think it’s a mix of having been an ugly duckling growing up, having self/esteem and confidence issues, overthinking and being a nervous wreck around people I like, just being unlucky in falling for unavailable people, not acting on feelings, etc. Over the years I’ve worked on my looks, I’m a bit more confident with girls I’m into, I try not to overthink so much, and I’ve just in general worked on myself a lot and naturally come into my own a little more.

At the weekend there I was out at a party with some friends and was kind of joking around with a bunch of the girls I’ve been friends with for years who we met there, and in particular jokingly flirting with one of them, and while we were both laughing together she, in the most genuine way, asked in the middle of our conversation ‘how the fuck are you still single after all this time? It makes no sense.’

All of our other friends instantly agreed and started going on about me and kind of just giving me compliments. Usually I’d think it’s just people being nice; people always say that kind of thing when my whole romantic life comes up and it feels empty. But this was different. This was just a bunch of girls I’ve been friends with, who are able to look  at me from the point of view of straight women, having such a good time and a good laugh with me that they were just genuinely baffled by the fact I’ve remained single this long. It had nothing to do with our conversation beyond the fact I was jokingly flirting and it probably made them think along the lines of me and relationships. This isn’t the first time either; another girl I’m friends with thought I was lying to her when the fact I’m still a virgin came up, and outright refused to believe it for the longest time.

It was a big confidence boost and I feel like I’m on the right track these days in regards to all that, but like, what is the answer here? Like why have I remained single for so long? I just laughed and had no answer for them, but it did get me thinking. They seemed completely genuine, truly baffled by the fact I have never had a girlfriend. I’ve always assumed there MUST be something wrong with me and people were just being kind, but more and more often people really do seem like they can’t understand. The thing is, if they’re right and I’m not some kind of undateable guy like I always thought growing up, then I must be missing chances, or not doing something right, or just being the most unlucky dude on the planet.

It’s just left me more confused. I kind of accepted over the years I’m unattractive, I came to terms with it and honestly just kind of didn’t try so much outside of when I really fell for someone and couldn’t ignore it, but now it’s like I’m wondering am I actually kind of attractive and I’ve just been doing something fundamentally wrong for a long time? I honestly just plain, straight up do not understand what the hell I should be doing lmfao, I’m 23 but I feel like the way I approach relationships is the same way a 14 year old boy does.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pog65x/a_few_friends_told_me_in_the_most_genuine_way/

That night, we kinda cuddled and made out but nothing more. Now a couple weeks passes and we are still talking on snapchat every single day, I would send goodmorning text, she would send good night text, stuff like that. We were flirting pretty hard with eachother by now, I made it clear that I really liked her and I think she liked me too. She would send me suggestive tiktoks everyday and she would talk about wanting kids and how handsome my kids would be. She came over to my place and stayed the night for 2 nights in a row. Those nights, stuff happend and it was a really good time. now it was about the end of August and we were both going back to Uni. we go to different Universities about 2 hours away and it was clear we weren't gonna be able to see eachother often. we kept talking for about a week and we called eachother at night and we would go to sleep on thr call and wake up with thr call still active, this happened a few times. Now, the night before our first classes began (both our classes started on the same day) she said she just wanted to be friends, that this whole thing was too fast and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I was devastated, i thought we both liked eachother and things would of picked up but no. I was nice in responding, I said that I understood and it was fine and we both wished good luck in our classes.

I have no idea why it happens, maybe they realize that I am not rich and they don't like the idea of ​​being with me, or maybe I am much less attractive in pictures than in real life. I am also quite smart, I am studying for 2 different majors at the same time, and I have a very large community of discord where people share summaries of subjects and quite useful things, so in fact I am quite popular at my university, I always win martialarts and esports tournaments and everything. So I'll just post my instagram here and hope people can criticize my instagram and help me improve it. I will pay special attention to the opinions of girls, but boys can also help.

98,pogxec,1631671935,28 Forever Alone and With Issues,"I need some advice. The following I am about to say may be difficult.

My issues have taken over my life. I have never been able to cope. I am only recently coming to the realization that I have lived life wrong. In many ways, I blame my parents for sheltering me for far too long.

Growing up, I had only focused on school, work, and employment. As a result, I now live comfortably and set. I make good money, I can buy whatever with little to worry, I have no debt, etc. However, I am not happy. I never realized it until 2 years ago when I met my first GF online. (The relationship failed after 2 years. We never even got to meet due to covid and her government denying non-citizens to visit.)

For years I had avoided relationships. You could say I was traumatized from a young age by my own parents improper handling of me telling them how I was in love with someone. I was so hurt by how they reacted that I avoided relationships at all cost. From High School and thru college. It was deemed ""unnecessary"" or a ""distraction"".

I have finally opened up about my problems and now it feels like its way too late. I have been so sheltered that knowing that finding out someone has previously been in a relationship makes my head spin. I can't consider dating someone that hasn't gone through ""the works"". 

I now have an OCD where I feel like a person that has had sex with someone else shares the DNA of that person forever. I also went through something called ""Retroactive Jealousy OCD"". This is how my thoughts work. Imagine each person being their own flavor of drink. Every drink is unique. Imagine taking a drop of one drink and it drips in the other drink. That drink is now contaminated. Its not like you can filter out or undo or clean the contents of that other drink. That is what it feel like mentally. People say its all in my head. But if that is true, why do we have STDs? Its not even the STDs that worry me. Its the fluids in general.

So I am 28, never kissed a girl, let alone been with one overnight. Now its all I want. To be with someone and to feel loved. Except I will not find someone that has never been ""contaminated"". Women that fit that category are most likely women from High School and early college days. All probably have done A to Z and have children by now.

Casual relationships, Hookups, and all those things were unheard of for me. I didn't even learn what it meant until a few years ago. But now these thoughts and my disgust stops me from being able to open my opportunities or from turning women away. I don't know what to do. I feel disgusted with today's society. I have always felt that people didn't do such things until after they got married. I always thought it was uncommon. How many times do birds find a mate in their lifetime?

I suffer from depression due to the loneliness and hopelessness. I feel like I am too late. I am getting older. I don't feel like I will find someone that will fit my wants. I don't know how to change my mindset. I don't know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pogxec/28_forever_alone_and_with_issues/
99,pogyze,1631672100,My boyfriend is paranoid and assumes what should I do?," 

Here is a little a bit of our text:

Boyfriend: What's up babe? Don't hear much from you anymore. If you don't want to hear from me then say. I feel like you are contacting me less and less.

Quote:""If you don't want to hear from me then say"" &lt;-------- This leads me to think that he's assuming because I have not responded to his message.

Coincidence since your ex is back in your life (Not going to say his name for purposes). Maybe I'm being paranoid. Anyway, I'll leave you to it and not bother you as it feels like I am.

If you ever decide to stop contacting me at least say goodbye.
