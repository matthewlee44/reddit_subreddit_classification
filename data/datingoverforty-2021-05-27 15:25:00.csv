The last time I tried it, it was probably 10 years ago. I remember matching with a lot of women that seemed pretty fixated on a LTR or nothing. 

That's fine, but it's generally not how I find myself thinking. I generally just try to meet interesting people and let the relationship be what it may from there. 

Frankly, I don't really know how much I care about a LTR. It's great if it happens but I have no interest in seeking out a LTR just got the sake of an LTR. 

I kinda want to take my time, date around, see who's out there, and just enjoy meeting some new people. 

Do other people approach it this way on OLD? Is it well received?

How much of this should I share initially and/or on my profile? I don't want to over share, but I also don't want to waste mine or anybody else's time if they're in ""LTR or nothing"" mode.

Sometimes he’s perfect. Sometimes, he’s a flawed human. And sometimes, he’s been just awful. But the perfect times kept me attached. 

I’ve had some suspicions. Things that he said were not adding up. But I chose to believe what he said. 

And tonight, he meant to text another woman good night, but he texted me, and I’m sure because he said her name at the end. 

I responded that he texted the wrong person and he blocked me. 

Deep down, I knew this was ending. But I just feel like I don’t have a ton of time to find a partner to “spend my life with” and I enjoy having a partner. 

It just feels like maybe I am destined to be alone.

14,nmwcek,1622203407,How do I try and accept and reconcile myself to a single life with no more intimacy.,"Hello all. So I (48f) have been single for about 8 or 9 years now. Before that for a number of years, it was a succession of casual relationships, fwb, dating etc, nothing that became too serious. But I very rarely went more than a year without some kind of sexual partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided that I was totally done with casual sex, I just kept getting hurt over and over again. So I gave it up and decided I wouldn't have sex again until I found someone who wanted something a bit more serious, who wanted a real emotional connection. All these years later I still haven't found anyone who wants that with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began to feel like there was something majorly wrong with me, so I have been through all the therapy, working on myself, all that kind of stuff. I have learnt that you can be the most amazing person on the planet, and still sometimes just be really unlucky in love. And that seems to be the case with me. I am happy with my life, got friends, hobbies, a job I love, my amazing fluffy dog of 14 years. 

I am happy with who I am as a person, I mean I am not perfect, I am overweight, have an addiction to chocolate, but generally I am pretty awesome. So I think my good points far outweigh any bad points I may have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really miss being intimate, I miss kissing, cuddling, holding hands, sex, all that kind of stuff. I miss it so much it feels like I am mourning it. I am grieving a fulfilling and varied love and sex life. 

But I have kind of accepted and reconciled myself with the fact that I either have casual sex, or I don't have any. And I do not want to go back to casual, so I have to accept that I am celibate now, and have been for years. The last couple of years, I have accepted that from now on, unless a miracle happens, then it is self love only for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, recently I have started hanging out with someone that I am starting to have feelings for, there is links on my profile to posts I have made about him. But this post isn't really about him. Since hanging out with him, the thoughts of kissing and intimacy and sex have all come rushing back. 

Just the thought of kissing someone makes me want to cry because I want it so badly. But still not with someone that doesn't really like me back. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, to all those that are happy being single, or are happy with no sex life while they are dating and finding someone to do that stuff with, how do you get over the longing for sex?

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get over the craving, and longing for kissing, cuddling and sex, and all the other intimacy that goes with that? Are there any methods of getting over it? Are there any other ways, or advice, or anything you can tell me that can make me stop this longing?

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to be happy being single, because I can't force someone to love me if they just don't. But I just cannot get over this one part of single life. 

Any help really appreciated!!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nmwcek/how_do_i_try_and_accept_and_reconcile_myself_to_a/
15,nmwcgf,1622203413,I’m not going to F you.," Hello all- Ive ran in to a situation a few times recently that I’d love some perspective on.

Me: 47M, single professional no kids, living in a medium to large US city. 

   Ive went out with 2 ladies recently that have said something to me that throw me off, and I’m not sur if my internal reaction to it is appropriate.

 Situation 1: First date with a woman. Age appropriate, no kids. Met a local place I know, and had a Pretty ok time. I’m 100% a gentleman, and cross no lines and never even hinted at anything physical. At the end of the date, she brought up comtiniing the date and we discussed locations. She suggested we go back to one of our places (hers was first suggested but is a far way compared to mine). Her next line is “but I’m not going to F\_\_\_ you”… not said playfull. I was put off by this as I wasnt at all going in that direction. 

Situation 2: Our 2nd date. The first date was ok, ended with a light kiss. I never crossed any lines or hinted at anything inappropriate (again). Middle of the date we were talking a bout cooking and I mentioned that I really love to cook (I do) and she asked when am I going to cook for her. As we were planning an event for our next date, I asked if she wanted to come over Sunday afternoon and I’d make us a meal and he answer was “ Yes, but I’m not going to have sex with you. Just putting that out there”.  Not said playfully.

  I’m a little offended at these statements And I dont understand if this is just a sign of the times and a reaction to how other guys approach women. I very much like dislike having to walk on eggshells Around a topic that I’m not even exploring (yet). Both of these events happened within a month of each other, so Im thinking it might be me.

20,nn0m9b,1622216533,Pulling back on the sex,"I’ve been casually seeing a guy that I met on Bumble (but knew of, have a ton of mutual friends prior to matching). It’s been about 3.5 months. We both agreed on casual in the beginning but I caught feelings and told him. He told me he liked me but wanted to continue what we’ve been doing (which I agreed too because it was early and I do like him). When we first started seeing each other sex was a huge part of it. I would go to his place and we’d basically tear each other’s clothes off as soon as I got there and after that order in and watch some movies. I would also spend the night (but he never seemed to get much sleep). We typically only really see each other every 2 weeks (he has a lot going on professionally and it works with my kid schedule). We do text back and forth usually about once a day (although that has slowed down a bit). Lately things have changed a bit (not in a bad way necessarily). The first time I saw him after I said I had feelings things seemed pretty normal. He’s always gotten a little distant after we spend a decent amount of time together (in that he doesn’t initiate for a few days, always responds quickly though). I think he might have some commitment/attachment issues and I’m willing to be patient (I’m not looking to get married or move in with him or anything). Last weekend he suggested picking me up and taking me on a more traditional date. I wanted to go to his place so that we could be more physically affectionate (my sister was at my house and he’s allergic to cats so my house was a no go) but I told him I wouldn’t spend the night because he had something to do early the next day and I know he doesn’t sleep well. He apologized but seemed into it when I suggested that. We went out to eat (he paid like usual) and then went back to his place. The date that we had been on before was just lunch. He didn’t try to get physical at all. We cuddled, laughed and had a blast. Should I be worried that it’s been a month since we’ve had sex? I’ve never been with a guy who didn’t at least try to initiate (the guy I’m seeing now is a bit old fashioned and doesn’t really like me to sext or get too dirty via text). My thoughts are: Maybe he’s having some issues (he’s 48, I’m 43), he’s afraid that having sex will just lead to more feelings for me and he doesn’t want to deal with that (IMO cuddle is way worse for feelings so the fact that we cuddle for hours is worse) or maybe he’s trying to slow things down to see where he’s at emotionally.

21,nn23kz,1622220625,Sexual attraction and desire for emotional connection,"I occasionally see some discussion &amp; comments suggesting that the primary reason many people want to be with someone is an initial sexual attraction.  I don't doubt this is true, though for me I tend to look for a long-term partner when dating, and I want to be sure I have an emotional connection with someone.  I tend to look for an emotional connection before I think about having sex with someone.  Sometimes I've wondered if I'm demisexual, since I tend to feel more sexual attraction to someone after I get to know them and if I start to feel like we get along well and like each other as a person.

When I'm looking to meet someone, I'd admit looks are important to a degree.  I just feel like I'd want to date someone and get to know them a bit and not have sex too soon, since I know my sexual attraction for them would be affected by how well we get along and like each other as a person.

23,nn3dnm,1622224066,Wasting Time Is A Crime,"It is a crime committed against the most valuable resource we have: Time. 

Post divorce,  I began dating a man who made me promises of a future together.  He said we'd travel and share a life and a home. 2 years later, not one thing he said came to fruition. I had been played. The lies were bad enough, but the most egregious offense is that this man wasted my time. Time that is no longer on my side. I just turned 48. I met that man when I was not quite 45. I was fresh out of a 20+ year marriage and admittedly naive. I met this man and was swept off my feet. I should have known.  By the time I realized he was bad news, my heart was in  it. My mind told me to leave this one behind, but my heart held on, holding our hope for him to change and for all his beautiful promises of having a life together to be true. All it was, in the end, was a waste of time. If I want to put a positive spin on things, I can say that I learned a lot from that relationship. I sure did. But I could have done without the lessons, to be honest. I could have done without that kind of heartbreak and abuse, that I am still haunted by, despite leaving him behind. 

Ending a relationship can be hard. Even when you know it is the right thing. The best thing. The ONLY thing you can do, it is still hard. But just because something is hard, it doesn't mean you shouldn't muster up all the strength in your being and do it. 

I am so grateful I was finally able to do that because that ending was only the very beginning of good things. Since leaving behind a relationship that did nothing but waste my time, I now have made time to nurture the important relationships in my life with the people who deserve it. Because I ended one thing, I am now open to the start of something new. Because I put an end to wasting time, this amazing person has entered my life and I'm once again feeling life is full of possibilities.  

If anyone is feeling like they are wasting time, the best advice I can offer is to make the decision not to do that anymore. Make the decision to start using your time more wisely and only spend that currency on those who are truly worth it. You deserve far better than you've been getting and it is only once you get some distance, that you gain perspective.

I’m 40 and from NYC and found that I’m only attracted to underweight guys. Throughout my whole life of living here, I’ve just been attracted to really really skinny guys (like actual “underweight” BMI with delicate bones).

I became single again recently and now a lot of my old usual options are typically married. The last time I was single I had a ton of dudes to choose from, but now I’m only attracted to men around my age or a lot older.

I’ve tried dating different options but found that the only guys that drive me bonkers are really underweight small guys.

How do I meet a guy like that that’s between the ages of 40-60? I’ve tried dating sites but the options are super limited because “underweight” men are a really small percentage in general.

*Is there another CITY or COUNTRY (English speaking) that I should move to to have more options like this?!*

40m here, divorced almost 5 years ago. For most of the the since then, I just had no interest in anything romantic.  Like none at all, just couldn't bring myself to go through it again. Just lost all belief in love etc. Late last year I kind of had a moment where I realised that closing yourself off like that is not a very fun way to live, so I thought fuck it, if I ever want to be happy I need to get out there and try. Even if it meant risking getting hurt.

Went on a few dates, nothing really life changing. Then I met a girl a while ago via OLD. Really hit it off straight away, she was attractive, intelligent, but also down to earth and non judgemental. Basically everything I wanted. It didn't take long for things to get physical, and just between us the sex was incredible!  I didn't know it could be so good,  like I finally understood what people write and sing about. 

Needless to say I caught the feels. We'd been dating for two and a half months and last weekend hung out at my place. I thought it was time to see where we were at, I let her know that I really wanted her to be a bigger part of my life and we had a good conversation about how we both felt  and we both agreed we wanted more. I actually cried in front of her because I was happy for the first time in years.

Fast forward to today.. not so good. Id been trying to get hold of her for a couple of days with no response. I know she's busy with shift work and all, but after 3 days if no response I texted and asked if she could be better with communication, as it doesn't feel great to not hear back from someone for days.. and she texts back ""sorry, were just not suited, better if we don't catch up anymore, I'll see you around😊"". That's right, she broke up by text and ended with a smiley face emoji. 

Wow. A complete 180 from when we parted. I just can't believe that I finally let myself open up and be vulnerable to someone that I really liked, only to have my heart broken immediately. I think she has a problem with commitment, and I really am kicking myself for not seeing the signs and keeping myself in check, but the heart wants what it wants.

I accepted when I started dating again that I had to be prepared to get hurt, but it still sucks when it happens. I guess I'll  take a break from it all for a while, and one-day dust myself off and try again. Just hard to see where I'll get the courage from to do so.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nngiuz/why_does_this_have_to_be_so_hard/

They love guns, trump, and Jesus. I don't care for those things and I think it keeps me from finding a man that I could be compatible with where I live.

I dated younger guys because they tend to be more diverse and are still single. Problem is they use me for sex because they don't see a future with me. It really sucks and I feel hopeless about finding a companion. I've tried OLD but it's just not for me.

We're pretty compatible and share mutual commitment and enjoyed each other's company very much. He started therapy a couple of months ago to deal with his emotional intimacy issues that surfaced when he admitted he felt more than he can show after I got upset that he'd ignore/forget/not register things I'd say. I was supportive and hopeful. 

The straw was when he wouldn't be supportive of a mutual disappointment we went through. 

It's disappointing because I can see he's trying and that he wants to be able to give me the substance I need.

37,nnnbnb,1622294310,Did the other person ever mean anything to you when looking for sex outside of your committed relationship?,"I've got a question for the folks who have actively sought out a person to cheat with while being in a happy committed relationship with someone else. No judgment only curiosity to help me to understand the thought process and to help heal.

I met a guy thru OLD that presented himself as single. He was great to talk to and seemed very interested in me. I found him to be incredibly attractive so the relationship went sexual quickly. 

As time progressed I could tell by his actions that something was off. I originally blamed it on him being anxious or different then went to me being the issue. Looking back I see every sign of being a side chick. I liked him so I didn't want to believe what was clearly in front of me. My fault here and am learning to trust my instincts more.

I found out by him asking me if I would still have sex with him if he was in a relationship. I'm assuming he felt bad about leading me on and put the truth out there. This was after being intimate many times. I was then able to put all the pieces together and everything made sense. Honestly I fell bad for his girl because she deserves better. I'm sure I'm one of many that he has played this scenerio with and he is putting her at an unknown risk.

I know thier is no cookie cutter answer to this and every one is different including him. My question is why do people in general present themselves as single just to cheat? Ultimately you hurt the person that you are cheating with too. You have brought them into an unknown triangle and have no intention of a future with them. Is this because you see them as a throw away and simply don't care if they get hurt or is it because you are missing something so badly in your relationship that you feel it is ok to mislead others to get it? In this situation do you care about the other person at all? Again no judgement just trying to rationalize why he presented himself the way he did and understand his point of view.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nnnbnb/did_the_other_person_ever_mean_anything_to_you/

39,nnnvi0,1622296201,Would you date somebody who is 49 and has nothing saved for retirement?,"I mean, we’re super casual at this point. But learning this about him just made me think about what to look for when I’m ready for a serious relationship. 

I make a good salary, have no debt, have my house more than 50% paid off, and have both individual retirement savings and am working towards a solid pension. I am also saving towards my kids college which will be paid off prior to them ever stepping foot on campus as freshman. I also have recently begun looking into long-term care insurance for when I’m older and I am purchasing an investment property in the next three years.

After a conversation we had last night, I would guess that he has less then $50K in retirement savings and no pension coming. He makes an OK salary and has a mortgage on his house. He’s changed jobs and moved a lot, so I don’t think he’s really built anything up. 

I have always had the position that I won’t date somebody with serious debt because of how hard I’ve worked to secure my financial future. While there’s no debt here, it’s highly concerning to me that it nearly 50 he’s not prepared for what’s coming. This wasn’t something I really thought about in my late 20s when I was last dating because lots of people were preparing for retirement – even though I already was. But now, those years are eminent.

Again, this is a casual relationship. But it made me really think about what to look for when it’s not. I have a lot of concerns about having to float somebody else in our old age and taking away resources from my children.

I generally get my age guessed at 38-44 which of course is just about as flattering as anyone  could want.    :)    I also seem to get attention from younger woman  the youngest being 27 when I was 49, thats a 21y age difference.

Recently I met someone aged 35 through a mutual friend and was rather taken aback by her friendliness and open character. Now even though I have confused friendliness with flirting on numerous occasions in the past, there was very little doubt here as the innuendos were being made left, right and center.    

Needless to say, I held the boat off but is has got me thinking a lot about acceptable age differences!   I have some friends, she is 47 and he is 73 (although you wouldn't think so)  they have been together for 30+ years and are probably the happiest couple I know!

44,nnsn01,1622310662,"I find it difficult to ""shop around""","I've been online dating for a couple months now and find my big struggle is shopping around for someone compatible. Some background: I grew up Mormon, married young with zero experience in romance, divorced after 17 years due to no connection (see my first reddit post...). Post separation/divorce, I jumped head first into a long term relationship after a tiny amount of dating. I broke up with that GF a year ago and now here I am again, trying some dating. So far, I'm finding myself getting too emotional or mentally involved with a girl that I'm not compatible with. 

I think my problem is coming out of covid and getting over excited about the slightest amount of affection. After kissing, I get all attached. It makes me want to focus my energy on only her. I also feel bad telling women I'm still looking around. Maybe I feel safer in a monogamous relationship because that's all I've known. 

Ultimately, I want a long term relationship. I just don't want to make the same mistake again. I want someone that's easy for me to talk to and both attracted to each other. If I found this person, I think it would be time to try only focusing on her. 

I want my intentions to be very clear upfront: ""I just started looking for that someone. Eventually long term but right now I'm not.""

46,nnsw3d,1622311411,I ended it after 4 great dates because he was emotionally aloof and it left me feeling too vulnerable.,"We had chemistry, he was mature, we are both looking for a relationship. I felt sparks but he was always emotionally hard to read (even when asked).  We were more intimate on our 4th date ( no sex) but he pulled back on texting afterwards.  I didn’t know if this was part of the already inconsistent texting I had experienced or a result of something else, but it left me feeling needy all week.   In short, I could imagine having sex with him and then going crazy wondering why it didn’t draw us closer together .  I realized he hadn’t ever even complimented anything about me and I didn’t know (other than maintaining contact and going on dates ) if he thought I was cute , beautiful, liked my eyes or anything.  I don’t want to feel like I’m living off of someone’s breadcrumbs of affection (I would too because I can be a sucker for emotionally unavailable men).   

In every other regard I genuinely liked and enjoyed this man.  But I ended it because my gut said it wouldn’t work.   Now I’m scared I let a good person go because of my own anxiety.   He was gracious in accepting my ending things and it hurts.  I’m doubting if I made the right decision. He was a decent person and we all know how rare that is.

He did mention a potential red flag however.

69,noemiu,1622391773,For those not actively pursuing dating...what would make you start actively trying?,"So I hadn’t actively pursued dating in about four years. It was more of a passive approach. I’d go about my normal life be open to the possibility and it seemed to work out ok. Obviously I didn’t get as many dates as when I was in OLD but they were higher quality ones so I was pleased. Whenever I felt lonely I had a couple of single friends I could hang with...one of which we physically comforted each other on rare occasions. 

Then covid hit. My previously single friends got married, I pretty much didn’t interact with anyone except one coworker and even my occasional NSA hook up doesn’t seem to be an option.

So I thought about putting myself out there again but I’m thinking I might just wait. I want to have some single friends to rely on again, get more active and healthier (quarantine meant I spent too much time on my ass binge watching shows) and getting settled at my great new job.  When I look at it like this I can see it’s probably going to take another year before I’ll feel like enough of myself to hit the singles scene and that kinda bums me out.

We’ve gone on four dates in the past three weeks and have seen each other every weekend since our first date.  We both made it clear we were looking for a LTR and after the first weekend where we had back to back dates, we discussed how we were not talking to anyone else but were just going to focus on how this was going.  

Sounds amazing so far, right? He will text in between dates, and sets them up in advance but when I text back he takes up to 12hrs to respond.  He sometimes will ask a question and I’ll answer and then get crickets...which is completely frustrating.  Why ask a question if you have no intention of following up?  I’ve mentioned how this a trigger for me due to past relationship cheating trauma and he said he’d work on it.      He has two phones for work and one personal phone, so he’s always connected.  I just got a tattoo done and was sitting for it for 6hrs and he hasn’t even inquired about it.  To me this is an indication of lack of interest.  I realize everyone has different communication styles, but if you were really interested in a person wouldn’t you be more invested in their daily life?  

It also seems like now that he has me “locked in” the communication has waned a bit.  Prior to our first date we’d talk on the phone at length and that has completely evaporated.  

I know it’s very early in and I’m trying to go with the flow...but I’ve been ghosted and submarined in this OLD environment and it just sucks.

73,nognzd,1622397684,Our situationship is over for good reasons; can/should we be friends?,"I posted this in a couple other subs, I've been racking my brain (and the Internet) and I've come to no good conclusions on my own, so I'm gonna need your help.

I (F41) met Javier (M32) on Bumble in September 2020. We hit it off immediately. He was clear right away that he wasn't looking for a relationship right off the bat (he actually said he was just looking to meet new people and new friends) for reasons that would later become clear to me. I was always clear that I was looking for a relationship. 

Well, without boring you with the details, you know how the best laid plans go. We dated exclusively for about six months (during the pandemic, meaning that we spent a lot of one on one time together), neither one of us changing our minds about what we wanted. What did become operative information over the course of the six months was why he didn't want a relationship - his father had passed away six months before we met in March 2020 and at the same time, he realized the six-year relationship he was in wasn't what he wanted in April 2020. He felt like he was always ""falling into"" relationships and not making the conscious choice to be in one. In short, his world had been shaken up and spit out and he had a lot to figure out about himself going forward. 

I understood this. The upheaval in his life is unprecedented, especially in the midst of a pandemic. I once asked him, ""What if you met the right person for you right now? What would you do?"" He said, ""I would blow it. I wouldn't even recognize it. I am not open to it.""

We broke up almost two months ago. We finally had to come to terms with the fact that we weren't (and never were) on the same page and it was getting into territory where someone (me) was going to get very hurt. It was amicable, respectful, and kind. It almost felt like we were on borrowed time as it was. I'm not over him (and I don't anticipate I will be anytime soon) but I also recognize and accept where he is in life. I know sometimes ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" is just an excuse, but it isn't here.

When we were breaking up, he truly wanted to find a way for us to stay in each other's lives. Our friendship was strong and we both opened up to each other so much that it almost seemed like we shouldn't let romantic timing get in the way of our connection. I told him I needed time and space and he told me to take whatever I needed. 

I reached out to him this past weekend and asked if he wanted to go on a hike next week. He said yes. In the past week, I've vacillated between ""I'm not ready"" to ""But I accept where he is in life.""

I'm not over it. I just know that right now - and for the foreseeable future - that a relationship with him is not going to be an option. He needs to heal, he needs to make sense of the world in the wake of his dad's death, and he needs to not get roped into yet another relationship. But I miss his friendship - and I know he misses mine - so much.

As an extension from another post by a member who thought he was ugly, many replies referred to ""staying in his league"" or ""searching below his league""...... all of which were referring to appearance only.

Are there really aesthetic ""leagues"" in which were expected to play in? How do we know which league we ""belong in""? Is there a way to specifically categorize each of these leagues? If we figure out which league we belong in, should we then be dismissing people in other leagues? Who decides which league is higher or lower?

For me, I have no idea which league I would belong to. Some people find my very attractive, while others dont at all, and still some others have no opinion at all.

98,nphcdz,1622507108,"Please tell me your stance on ""old toys"".... 🍆","I would like to hear the opinions of others.... here is situation:
Me 47f (divorced)
Him 44m (never married)
I recently started to date an old flame and we have been friends through both of our breakups. 
When I was out of town last week,  we spent hours on the phone,  primarily talking to him about fantasies,  things I like,  want to try....
Now I'm home. 
I ordered him a fleshlight and was wanting to show him all the fun with it.  I asked if he had any lube and he said ""yes,  upstairs in my room,  bottom drawer"". I open the drawer and there was easily 15 different toys,  devices etc and it threw me off guard a little bit.  I didn't mention anything until 2 days later.  His response...""do you expect me to get rid of everything,  a couple things have never been used and (ex girlfriend) bought one of those but we never used it,  I tried it myself. I guess I don't know the rules"".

WTF?

I buy new toys and get rid of one's that I have a memory with from other people.  I don't want someone's leftovers. I just feel like this is a lack of respect.

99,nphd1t,1622507167,"I'm getting dumped over erection problems ... and I'm a woman (vent, sorry!)","I'm 48F, been seeing a 57M for several weeks now.  Not exclusive, but I was liking the potential.  Several days ago communication slowed down noticeably.  I finally asked him what was going on, and it all went back to the last time we had sex (only the second time, too).  He couldn't get hard, and was pretty freaked out.  Which I understand, especially since he said it's never been a problem before.  I did my best to assure him I was enjoying myself plenty, because I really was, and that I wasn't worried.  

Well, communication slowed noticeably since then.  I finally asked him what was going on, and he said he thought maybe we shouldn't see each other because if he can't have sex anymore he doesn't want to ""put me through"" it.  Mind you, he hasn't seen his doctor yet (later this week), had any tests done or even tried a little blue pill.  There could be dozens of reasons why it wasn't working that don't necessarily mean a bigger problem.  And I dated a guy with type II diabetes for two years, while there were tons of problems our sex life was not one of them -- he had a prescription, timed things accordingly, and even when it didn't work from time to time we could still be intimate.  So even if this is the new normal for him, I'm fine.  Physical intimacy is a lot more than PIV, and shouldn't I be the one who decides what I can handle?  

Before anyone says it, I already know -- he's probably not into me, this is just how he's getting out of it.  I'm just frustrated.  I thought I may have found that needle in the OLD haystack.
