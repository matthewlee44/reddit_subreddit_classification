This is more of a vent but God it stresses me out when I'm chatting with someone like this. Especially when it's someone who has said (like me) that they prefer to get to know someone *in person*.

I'd happily arrange a time and a place then go no-contact till then! I love meeting new people and I have a waaay easier time being genuine and funny in person, but it feels like every message I have to send back is another opportunity for me to make a fool of myself.

I really struggle with flirting over text, and honestly I've just been ignoring flirty messages from this guy cause I can't think of anything to say.

As someone who used to be painfully shy but has worked through it, it pisses me off that although I am fine in most social dsituations nowadays (even nervy ones like a date) messaging (especially the endless kind) gives me this immense amound of stress where I spend days feeling jittery and uncomfy.

And when a guy is messaging that much it's bound to get banal... and oh boy does it get banal quick! 'What did you have for dinner?' etc. I want to be *surprised* when I meet someone, not already informed about every detail of their life.

I feel super, super guilty about not replying with witty-enough stuff, or not replying quickly and it eats me up inside!

How do you retain the information and apply it accordingly?

My guess, is you find a way to make it practical. In the past, I would forget all my lessons and break down and double-text a girl or over pursue. The usual unconfident behavior. This lead to me being rejected a lot by a lot of girls who have given me a chance by my initial confident levels at the start of the courtship. But last week I found this little nugget on Amazon from a book ""Moves: Dating is a Game."" It takes all the skills and lessons we have learned from playing video games, and then the book shows how those same skills can be used in the dating world. Making it practical while using something all of already know. As it covered Texting, Dating, Marriage, and Online Dating with video game comparisons and scenarios, I felt like it was a great way of making dating easier and would help me retain the teaching in a memorable way.

We previously dated for a couple years and hadn’t talked in a few years after a pretty nasty breakup.

She says from the get-go that she doesn’t feel ready to be dating anyone, and I tell her that’s okay as I’m not loading any expectations on this and really would rather focus on enjoying each other’s time. Fast forward a couple months and we spent lots of time together, going on dates, spending whole weekends together. She even introduced me to her friends.

Then one night (4mo in) she abruptly starts crying and saying she can’t do this anymore and questions where this is going. I tell her that since we actively go on dates, it’s going towards us dating, as that’s really the active form of the word. Now what I meant is that we were casually dating (dating seems to mean different things to everyone nowadays) - she then vehemently says we aren’t dating and that we never said we were exclusive. She was right, we had not discussed this before, and I found it a bit odd how seemingly offended she got at the idea of us dating exclusively. Given how much time we were spending together, I would be a little bit surprised if she had time to really develop something on the side but I suppose it couldn’t be ruled out.

She then confesses she’s falling for me, and says she still wants to see me. I tell her I also feel a connection with her and that I look forward to seeing her again as well. She then leaves for the night. 

This is the last time I saw her.
 
After that night, she became very distant and “busy” every time I tried to make plans with her. This goes on for about 3 weeks until I finally ask if she is avoiding me and she says, over text, that we aren’t on the same page about this and finally, that it’s best for her if we don’t see each other.

I expressed my disappointment in her choosing to do this over text rather than in person as I thought we had developed a bit more of mutual respect for one another, that I was surprised given her previous expression of feelings for me, but that I respect her decision and feelings and hope she finds what’s best for her.

She then goes off about how I used her for sex, and that she would’ve never started talking to me again if she thought there wasn’t a possibility of us dating. She then contradicts this by saying that my actions didn’t indicate I was using her just for sex, which in hindsight I think maybe she was saying to blame me for her developing feelings.

I told her there was no way I would’ve been hanging out with her for this long and going on dates if this was a purely physical relationship, nor was that ever really a possibility given the intensity and tumultuous nature of our past. For context, when we first dated, she initiated us breaking up.

I told her if that’s really how she feels than we should meet up to discuss this in person because I felt there was a huge misunderstanding and I am very confused by the whole situation, especially if she thought I was just using her for sex. She said maybe, but then never made any effort beyond that and ultimately got annoyed when I called her out on that and said that I lacked patience and it just wasn’t a priority for her anymore. It’s been about a month now with basically no contact.
 
Can someone help me make sense of this? Are my feelings of frustration unfounded? Is there any path to reconciliation here? Should I reach out to her or just forget about it?

I approached this with a high degree of caution and it seems like right when I let my guard down for only a minute it went to shit. I know ghosting/fading and shit is common nowadays but it seems quite ridiculous to be seeing someone for over 4 months and for them to just drop out like that. Especially given the history. Maybe she’s as confused as I am? No idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you help me figure out to simply state I wont go out with you again, without being insulting - but also without trying to explain or 'soften the blow'

Note: I think 'softening the blow' makes people feel worse. Because its insincere and they know you say that to everyone. So the more you try to let them down easy,the bigger deal you are making out of somethingt hat shouldnt be a big deal. so you telegraph to them that your expecting them to take this hard, and therefore that it must be a bad thing when you try and cushion it beyond ""No thank you"" 

I refuse to 'explain myself' to men when I choose not to go out with them again. They almost always try and 'debate' me about it. As if my preferences are something I can be wrong about and they want to argue with me about it. 

I will not, out of principle, offer reasons to men when I turn them down anymore.I will not offer reasons to men when I see them a few times and stop seeing them. I do not owe them my time and this is just a boundary I have now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't like the assumption that if you go on one date with someone there is a assumed obligation to communicate with them again, and that you have to have a mini 'breakup' with everyone you get a coffee with.

\-

Context

Every time I tell men the 'reason' - they argue with me about it (what the fuck is that?) - for instance I have a few deal breakers, it has nothing to do with their personality but if they are religious, we are incompatible, if they have or want kids, we are incompatible. Those things are deal breakers.  You would think knowing that it was a dealbreaker that preexisted and has nothing to do with anything you said or did would be a welcome peice of information - but it isn't. They often act like they dont believe I could have a 'valid' reason for not dating them. Then after those conversations I can give them a new reason, they are infantile and their behavior is repulsive. 

I also don't like 'explaining myself' when its a request for a first date with someone I dont or barely know, or after just a few dates - because all of my thoguhts and feelings and motivations are none of their business.I am not obligated to share how I feel about a person I barely know or offer them a lengthy psycoanalysis of them and myself and why I dont want to go otu with them again. I might have reasons that are extremely personal, and they dont have a right to that information.

Not to mention, sometimes the reason is ""I just don't""

Met a girl through handling a work event. She doesn't work in the same company as me. She's in another company that has worked with my current company a few times. I'm 26, Male &amp; she's 26, Female. First time meeting her today.

Our colleagues who are older (35 \~ 40 years old) in both of our companies were trying to play matchmakers and get 2 of us to open up to each other. 

After the work event all of us went for a meal together. She sat next to me. Small &amp; casual conversation,etc. I'm a little messy when I eat, she opened a pack of tissues and offered them to me. Don't know if these are positive signs, maybe I read too much into it. 

Turns out she lives pretty close to me so we took the train home and had more conversation. Ended up talking a lot about traveling and how Covid messed up plans. I asked for her instagram and we both followed each other. 

Couple hours go by. I DM her something generic saying ""Hey. Thanks for sharing about your travels. Great to meet you today. See you at future work events"" &amp; after 2.5 hours she replied ""Hello no problem! Nice to meet you too! See ya around :)"" . 

So now I'm just sat here thinking what should I reply back to her ? Ideally I think I should try to set up a date. Or is it pretty obvious she is showing no signs of interest and I should just not reply and back off (&amp; just keep a professional working relationship for the future) ?

I  (28F) had been dating a 28M for 3 months almost to the day until last  week.

The previous week we had  gone to dinner as usual and went back to his place to make dessert and  watch a movie. Everything seemed fine and based off what he said there  was nothing that happened to make him dislike me. But after I left his  place in the morning he went radio silent which was completely unusual, I  had also notice he had either unmatched me or deleted his Hinge profile  - another red flag. I waited about 5 days before reaching out to  basically ask what was up and to my surprise he replied saying that he  really liked me but that it was been super important for him to ""be  with"" someone of his own religious background to honor his grandparents  and that he had been seeing someone else of the same background and  wanted to pursue them instead and he was sorry if I felt like I had been  misled.

I absolutely felt misled  as we were seeing each other twice a week for the past 3 months and  always went on dinner dates or to the movies, etc. we never just showed  up at each other's places to hook up late at night and we were texting  daily. We had talked many times about our families, if we wanted kids  and religious backgrounds and he had always stated that he wasn't  religious. When I did reply back questioning him he ""clarified"" that he  didn't celebrate the holidays or anything but he wanted to pass down his  heritage to his kids. What I know see that I failed to lay out for him  is that he had basically said he was fine repeatedly sleeping with me  knowing full well from the beginning I wasn't of that same religion but  he couldn't ""see himself being with someone"" like me? How is that not  offense?

I've been feeling a  mixture of anger, guilt (as he basically blamed this information not  coming to light because I never asked for ""next steps"") and sadness  because I do miss him and I now question the sweet moments we had. It  seems clear to me now that he never ever intended us to become anything  because he wasn't ever going to date someone not of the same background.

So I went out with a guy a couple of weeks ago. We hit it off really well and I ended up sleeping over. He goes on a month long vacation and I essentially thought things were over between us (lack of texts, said he’d call but he didn’t, etc). So I proceeded to move on and slept with other people. Much to my surprise, he texts me and tells me he misses me. Then he somehow asks if I was sleeping with other people. I don’t give him a straight answer but I basically tell him well we aren’t exclusive and I thought we were through. We have more conversations back and worth but he does say he didn’t think I’d find someone so fast and the fact that I said other people indicating that there was more than one. Eventually he said I should do my thing and that he’ll survive. 

Anyway, I did tell him that I’ll wait for him and keep to myself (aka not sleep with other guys). But now I feel so bad. Because I would have never slept with these guys if only I knew where his head was at. I told him this and also said I don’t want him to resent me for it and that I only “moved on” cause I thought we were through. How do I move on from this?

I had a radical operation called a hemicorporectomy and I lost my entire lower body. With my prosthetics, I look like a paraplegic. I've gone back to college, gotten a job and live normally. I sit in an orthopedic ""bucket"" that attaches to cosmetic prostheric legs, and then of course in a wheelchair.

Three years from my operation, I am totally recovered. My upper body has become incredibly strong. I graduated from college and have a good job, live alone in an excellent apartment, socialize, and am completely independant.

I think that there is a big difference between people who get this operation because they have debilitating and life threatening  cancer, and are already very ill --- and people like me who are in general  good health and are injured. 

This operation is more common than you think, probably because of fast accident response, helicopter ambulances, sophisticated emergency rooms, and well trained and equipped first responders. In my big city rehab center, there had been two others my age, one other guy and a girl. All recovered to perfect health. 

From what I saw in rehab, I am far better off than someone with paraplegia, who has all the multiple systemic issues what come with spinal problems.

I wear cosmetic prosthetic legs. Transferred from my wheelchair to a couch, chair, or sofa, I look like a very handsome, muscular, slim, healthy guy. 

So it's not all that big a deal except that, so far, no girl has gotten past her initial shock and disgust. Several times I've developed great potential relationships which reach the flirting and kissing stage. This leads to her hands touching my legs, which are obviously cold and hard. I explain that they are prosthetic. That's been the end of romance, so far, without even going into the rest of it.

So far, I've never really dated, as such, but because I am otherwise handsome and fit, girls my age have started conversations and been friendly, so I've ended up in several dinner or coffee dates, but the talk always goes to "" 
Are you ever going to be able to walk"" and then "" what happened"". I say I was in accident but don't go into detail.

There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She would ask me what my weekend plans were/ i would ask her

She would also ask me what i was doing after work. She took a genuine interest in my life/school/ family. Would get excited when we had something in common

Very awkward and shy when she would first sit across from me. Only started the convo 40% of the time. Other times she would just sit there and look at me until i said something. Would always blush/smile. 

If my break was 15 minutes or so she wouldn’t leave until i got up and left. Seemed to genially enjoy talking to me. Applied the rule that if i were talking to another dude i would be uncomfterbal here with this type of silent behavior but seemingly just enjoying my presence. 

There is no way she is interested in me as she is a 9/10 in my eyes and im maybe a 3 at best. She is athletic i am not. 

I am genially friendly and a lot of people like to great me when they see me. Talk for 3-5 minutes. But usually don’t take breaks with them. When ever someone would great me i would try to include her in the convo as i know she is shy but she would only smile at look at them then get on her phone until i was done. Really cant figure this out. 

Seemed to get slightly annoyed if someone took my attention away from her. Or if she saw me talking to another cute girl on the sales floor she would turn around and flip her hair and i think intentionally made me see her walk away.  

Another thing i truly cant figure out is when i would be sitting down talking with her. On quite a few occasions she would speak so softly i couldn’t hear her and i would ask her to repeat herself 3-4 times until i would just go with it and act like i heard her. Really confused as to why she wouldn’t speak up. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i asked for her number and she gave it to me right away. She seemed to reach for her phone 4 or 5 times while the words came out of my mouth. Weird 

I texted her the next day and we talked for about two days, then when i hit her up on the third(basically said what are you doing today) i didn’t get a response. However i just figured she was busy so i tried again the next evening. And we picked up where we left off. 

Things were going well so i figured i should ask her out as it seems i had been stringing her along for 6 months. 

She made some of what i thought were hints in the past. Such as asking me if i had any valentines day plans. Made sure to tell me she was doing nothing. She also mentioned that shed been hit on by some of our coworkers but she wasn’t interested.  

But there it was as soon as i asked her out, a rejection. I really couldn’t believe it as i was so sure she liked me. She told me she didn’t think she could as she hasn’t really gone out since the pandemic. I gave it a chill understanding response. Then she told me she thought she had worded that weird and she had a household family member with health issues. 

I felt a little embarrassed that i got this one so wrong. I told her that i wouldn’t speak to her anymore because of the awkwardness but she told me not to do that as she really liked our relationship. Whatever that means. We went back and forth for a little but i finally agreed i would still talk to her and “treat her the same”

A few days went by with no communication on either side until the next time i saw her at work. I tried my best to avoid her and i was embarrassed. She came and sat with me on my break and i couldn’t avoid her anymore. 

She got all dressed up(its a casual environment). She had her hair down and done, and make up done to perfection. I couldn’t help but notice this  as i already thought she was beautiful, now it seemed that she was doing this to mess with me. She was extra smiley and we talked for 45 minutes, 10 or 15 over our unpaid break times. She just really seemed to be picking up what i was putting down even more than normal. 

Im sure it had nothing to do with anything though. But once i saw her like this i realized i was in pretty deep. I texted her later and said i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. 

I then went on with two paragraphs i wish i could take back and told her i didn’t need space for ever that i would like to talk again sometime just not now. I told her she was a great person, it wasn’t her it was me. And i really liked her as a friend. 

She said its ok just don’t worry about me. I asked her what she meant and she said dont worry about me ill still be chill and your friend. 

Didn’t think much of that until the next time i saw her she looked sad. She also looked as if she had put no effort into her appearance. Heck she wasn’t even in dress code.  I knew i messed up and then tried to talk to her. She flat out ignored me. 

I texted her and told her it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work now. I said this like 4 different ways and got no response. 

I said i was sorry the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me. She then told me she wished not to speak to me anymore. 

Why would she be so sad/mad if she wasn’t interested and i agreed to be her friend i just needed time to get over my feelings for her so i could approach it with a clear head. 

If she liked me as a friend why didn’t she just say she liked me as a friend. I don’t get it as if someone i was friends with had feelings for me i would tell them this and give them time to get over it. 

I feel like she must have known i was into her as i was always asking her about her life and looking at her a lot. 

I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

To add on to this if she wasnt interested romantically but she liked me as a friend. Why wouldnt she tell me that instead of making up an excuse?

I don't get it. We all have our shit, but you are supposed to deal with it, not shovel it onto people who barely know you. Or did I miss a memo?

It's not intimacy or bonding or whatever, it's manipulative and crappy to try and make someone feel bad for you to get them to like you, it's exploiting people's empathy. No stranger is going to magically come along and fix you or your insecurities or your past traumas... that is your job to do with a professional.

Hello relationships community. I am in my 20s and am currently multi-dating. I am really frustrated with men in their 20s that I have dated. There seems to more gentlemen in this age group anymore. For context, these men are not bums. I do not online date. Every man I have gone on a date with has approached me through my mutual friend group, work or people from my community centre. I work for a Fortune 500 company for background and date men who are educated and from good family backgrounds, yet they all want me to ‘build’ with them. They will never offer to pick me up for dates , after the 3rd date they are always looking for me to pay etc so I end up wasting my time on 3 dates and then not wanting to see them again. I recently went on 3 dates with a 27 year old man. On the first 2 dates things were good, we first met for a quick lunch, second time dinner, third time disaster. He invited me to Cactus Club and we had a great time, till the bill came. In front of the waitress he asks me to pay half, I was so embarrassed but paid without protesting. Then later when he asked me out again I said no. Another 26 year old guy I went out with for lunch embarrassed me so much. A burger at the restaurant we went to was $25 dollars and he straight up said ‘25 dollars with a burger’ so loundly he sounded like a country bumpkin. Obviously there was no second date. I cannot handle going 50/50. My sister went through the route of going 50/50 with a man and now is stuck working with a toddler and her husband penny pinching when she makes over 100k which is why I refuse to accept that. Honestly both my sisters and I calculated how much we spend just to be eligible to be in the dating market with waxing, makeup hair, nails , pedicure that I feel I have already paid for dates before I even show up. These are expenses I have to budget $400-500 for every month and therefore I expect the man to pay at least the same amount on dating me.

So here is the turn in the story. I recently went on a date with a 42 (from my company) and 45 ( from an event for accountants, he works as a partner) year old and oh my lord the difference was astronomical. One brought me flowers on the first date and both sent me an Uber. I have been on 5 dates with these men and one even went on a shopping trip where we had so much fun. The other donated 2000 to the charity for homeless youth that I volunteer for by the 6th date. My point is, these 15-20 year older men treat me like the prize. For context , I am not a supermodel. I have no problem getting men but I am just a cute looking girl, so my conclusion is that men love young women and will do anything for them. Also, I want to make it clear that I am not sleeping with any of these men. I am not a sugar baby either. That will not happen until I am engaged. From now on I am turned off by guys my age.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,756594,public,self,"Men in 20s are not providers , we've lost chivalry",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5nbx6/men_in_20s_are_not_providers_weve_lost_chivalry/,all_ads,6,,,,,

We always went out together (both in college in philadelphia) and never had an issue with going out alone on different nights, no trust issues or anything of the sort. She goes out a lot more than I do just because it’s not really my thing and I would rather hang with my friends, but she likes to start arguments and then get drunk later that night and act like it was never an issue. I’m getting really tired of this and have noticed my attitude shift from being angry about it and wanting a solution to “meh” and understanding that’s just how she is. I’ve been in love with this girl for a long time and i want things to click, but i don’t know if me accepting that part of her is what i’m supposed to do because it’s her or if i’m supposed to look elsewhere because it’s part of her that i’ve really started to dislike. I always feel like i only get to see her at the end of the night, and when i do she always yells at me about something i did (usually what she asked me to do becomes an issue later on at night) and i’ve tried to offer my side up about how i want to see her during the day and how i’m tired of feeling like i’m always the problem, but she just sees it as an argument and avoids the confrontation when she doesn’t want it. She always says she loves me and that has held me on the ground for a while, but i almost feel like she says it to just keep me happy. At the same time, why would she even bother keeping me happy, like what gain does that bring her unless she genuinely does like me and just can’t get it out the way i would like it to come out? These are the issues i’ve been wrestling with for a little while now, any advice helps!!!

So I (24M) work with this girl (20F) and for the last couple of months I've slowly developed really strong feelings for her. I don't want to make this a big deal, but I will note that it is uncommon. I don't date, and I never get romantic feelings for anyone. I'll admit people are attractive, but that's about it. So developing feelings for someone takes a lot. There's just something about her that I really enjoy. She's interesting to me, she's extremely kind and warm, a friendly person, somewhat introverted and reserved like me, and I'm very comfortable when around her. I find that all of that makes her very beautiful. I'm starting to talk and get to know her more. I'm definitely going out of my way to interact with her. We also just started texting, albeit I'm the one who starts the conversations and they don't really go as far as I'd like, but it doesn't get weird. It always ends on a good note. I just would like more to come from that, I'm just terrible when it comes to texting. I'd actually prefer to talk in person in these situations which is weird because I'm very introverted and shy. Overall though I'm finding this very rewarding. Seeing her at work now is a highlight of the week for me. But, I feel like I'm getting too caught up in my feelings clearly. The main problem seems to be my anxiety, which is making me overthink and freeze up. A lot of that has to do with the fact that I don't know if she likes me like that. I'm terrible at figuring out social cues. I know she doesn't dislike me or anything, and she likes me as a person to work with, but I can't gauge if she likes me in a different way. Could she, probably. Does she, no idea. I will say that she seems somewhat aware of my feelings for her, at least my intention to hang out with her outside of work, but that hasn't changed our dynamic at all. We continue to talk and have a good back and forth, and we've started to get more personal so idk. I've asked her to hang out and she said yes, but it won't happen for a bit cause she'll be out of town this week. I guess the thing I'm worried about is that I don't want to get too enamored with her, and her not feel the same way, but more importantly that I've made things weird and uncomfortable, because I would like to still be friends with her. I definitely don't want to do the wrong thing here. Part of me just wants to tell her how I feel, but I'm so anxious to even to do it so I feel stuck. I know this doesn't really seem like a thing, but my anxiety is making it so difficult for me right now.

After all my last and only “real” relationship of 5 months left me in a very bad place with an awful perception of what love and relationships should be like (more so than the dumpster fire that is my parents marriage). Turns out it’s not supposed to feel like a loosing war of walking on eggshells every day of your life. 

Anyways, I think I may have finally gotten a win. And the best part is that the guy in question has been my strictly platonic friend of 7 years and, one of if not, my longest friendship. I feel completely comfortable around him, can actually be my true self, and he already knows all of my shit good and bad. It’s just crazy how it never occurred to me before to even question if maybe just maybe that that’s someone I should be with. 

And since he knows me very very well he understands my “special needs” and trust issues. He was literally there to comfort me after the first guy I ever dated (his best friend) for only a month came back from a vacation completely disinterested after a solid 3 weeks of love bombing the fuck out of me. 

And when I had to deal with my ex boyfriend of that 5 month long relationship, he was the only person who didn’t make me feel like I was crazy or that shit was all in my head. 

Through all of my failed attempts at love he’s always been there. He’s listened to me cry and carry on about mediocre guys more times than I can count. 

And not once in the past 7 years has he ever pushed the boundaries of our platonic friendship or tried to get me to sleep with him.

Things only changed because the thought of there possibly being something more got put into my head and then after three days of it festering there in my brain I decided to act on it. He came over my house and with a little help from my friend liquid courage I made my move and let’s just say he didn’t leave my house until three days later. 

Now speaking from a couple weeks in the future from that day, we’ve gone on our first official date and will soon be going on a second and I cannot wait. I am in a constant state of pure giddiness and I don’t know how to handle it. This is all so crazy and new to me and all I know now is that I want to feel.

Only thing is that we were both in committed relationships.

We both recently got out of our relationships, I broke up with my girlfriend and she got broken up with not too long ago either. We had chats about each other’s breakup, she feels sad about hers but respects the decision of her ex-boyfriend.

Last weekend I had a party at mine, she ended up joining with some friends. Again we started talking to each other most of the evening and things became quite flirty, a lot of physical contact, eye contact etc 

We ended up talking in my room, when she mentioned that a few weeks ago she kissed a guy that asked her out on a date as she was curious what it would be like to kiss someone else as she’s been in a relationship with the same guy for the last 3 years.

We continued chatting, and I couldn’t help but think that I was curious about kissing someone new too. I decided to go in for the kiss, we started making out quite aggressively and eventually got to 3rd base which she initiated. We then returned to the party, stayed quite close and very flirty.

As the party went on quite late, we ended up having lunch with her friends/flatmates at a restaurant, before everyone went home and she stayed over to sleep. We didn’t have sex, just cuddled and kissed before falling asleep. 

The next day I had plans, so she woke up and we kissed each other goodbye. I texted her to ask if she got home safe, to which she replied “yes, thank you for asking”, and I left it at that without us texting since (this was 4 days ago)

I’m now wondering: should I ask her out on a date? Or wait for her to text me before I make the next move?
On one hand we had a fun night together and get along great, and clearly there is some physical attraction between us. Our conversations are also very flirty (joking about how we’ll fall in love with each other, how she’s going to invite me to her home town etc).

On the other hand, we both recently got outside of relationships and a date might be too early for her. Maybe this was just a fun hookup/rebound as she likes the attention, as from what I’ve heard she’s always been a quite flirty person.

What do you think? Should I just accept this night as a bit of fun in my life as a single person, or ask her out on a date? Should I take the next step to text her even if she hasn’t reached out since when I asked her if she got home safe?

Any advice is appreciated!

So I met this guy, super sweet. Really nerdy, has chill vibes all around. I pretty much tumbled into a crush after two dates the the third we even got to smoochin. All good things. But, despite only going on a few dates and things being really good (minus both of us being awkward as hell) there is this voice in the back of my head saying,

I have a feeling that this comes from when I was younger and I dated the wrong people for too long (i.e I was groomed when I was 12 by a 16 year old, year long relationship with an emotional abuser at age 13-14). The only relationship I had that was actually good lasted a month. Then I got traumatized by a friend who basically wanted me to sell my body so HE could have money to spend (I was 17, he was 19 going on 20).  I had a fling in 2019, but other than that this is my first REAL dating experience since 2017.

I think personally my brain trying to guard me from being overly attached BECAUSE of all the stuff I've been through. I basically made it out in my head of how I want me relationship to end up (like a fantasy I do want to make this work out because he is adorable, and I just like the moments when we can lay together and the world isn't as loud. I know I like him because I can be alone with him and feel like I'm recharging when he touches me affectionately (autism + being an introvert tends to cause me to be repelled by people I don't want to be close to).
