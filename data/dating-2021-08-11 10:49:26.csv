0,p2ftdv,1628697165,I (21M) went on a date and kissed a girl (20F) for the first time and I can't stop thinking about her.,"So I've been talking to this girl for about 18 months... just over Snapchat. I met her on tinder and we had talked about going out a couple months into talking and she was all about it. We even FaceTime once talking about what we were gonna do, but fast forward a month and she told me she wasn't interested anymore because she was busy transitioning to college and work.

 She didn't want me to un-friend her because she really enjoyed the conversations we had. I left her in my contacts, but I didn't talk to her for about 2 months until she eventually started texting me again and things just kinda went back to normal because I was bored and also deployed overseas.

The flirting found its way back into the way we talked to eachother and she just talked about how she really wanted to go out with me when I got back from deployment. 

I got back and we just went out yesterday and I had a much better time than I thought I would. We went to the dog park because my dog was with us and I had just planned on taking her back to her place after a couple hours, but she clearly didn't want to go home, so we drove around for 30 min talking until I saw the lake and so we sat by the lake. 
As we sat down she faced directly towards me and didn't say anything. I should have realized at the time she wanted me to kiss her because it was the perfect setting, but I decided I would wait till I dropped her off at her place (and I was kinda nervous because I've never kissed a girl.)
I wasnt biting so she just started showing me videos of her making out with people on a party bus and showing me fun things she does probably to drop the obvious hint.

So now I take her back to her building and I expect her to get out, but there was just awkward silence and she stared at me, so I kissed her and all of a sudden her tongue is in my mouth and she's nibbling at my lip. I pulled away for a bit to see if she was wanting more and sure enough she was stroking my hair, touching me, and said she wanted to kiss me more. We were in the parking lot for two hours before she finally left.

So thats how the date went just so you get a feel for her personality. I cant stop thinking about her now and she's very affectionate so would she appreciate me still texting her or do I limit how much I talk to her for now to not come off as needy? Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR -
I talked to a girl for 1.5 years online before meeting her in person and we had already built a connection and when I went out with her finally, she seemed to want to be more physical and affectionate (kissing and touching). Should I keep texting her and maybe tell her I miss her (because I do) or back off for a little bit and mention a second date?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2ftdv/i_21m_went_on_a_date_and_kissed_a_girl_20f_for/
1,p2ftfs,1628697170,"Not to kink shame, but the increased amount of guys expressing interest in being pegged is... interesting","I find sex and kink trends to be an interesting observation out there in the dating world. Remember when everyone was all about eating ass a few years ago? Right now, it really seems like we're going down (pun intended) the eating ass-to-getting pegged pipeline because I've matched and talked to at least five guys in the past three weeks who've brought up unsolicited their desire to get pegged. I can't say I ever had guys bringing this up even when they made unwanted sex comments during conversations, so I'm inclined to believe it's as much about the kink as it is the trend.

But first of all... I'm not a prude by any means, and maybe I'm in the minority as a woman here, but this isn't something I care to have brought up before the first date or even soon after the first date. I'm thinking a lot of guys out there think maybe women might find hearing him talk about being pegged to be a turn on since it's supposed to show that he's comfortable in his masculinity/sexuality even as a straight guy, but it's still just as weird a thing to say to a woman as it would if he talked about wanting to hookup.

I'll try anything once and am not kink shaming, but maybe wait to bring up your pegging fantasies after we've been officially dating for awhile.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2ftfs/not_to_kink_shame_but_the_increased_amount_of/
2,p2fxjv,1628697517,Christian woman broke my heart because I'm agnostic,"A 30 year-old Christian woman ended things with me (30M) after 2 months because I don't believe in the Bible. Or at least she says she needs space to think about whether things could work.

After spending 10+ hours together on every date and her telling me ""she's never been in such a good relationship"", she ended things abruptly. Although I was willing to compromise because I do love this woman, it looks like she is not. She believes in no pre-marital sex and no co-habitation before marriage both of which I'm willing to be slow with but not willing to forego.

She knew I was agnostic from my dating profile so I can't help but feel like she was being careless.

8,p2gxra,1628700504,The dating game,"Hi All,

So I was dating a girl for about 2-3 weeks and I would see her 1-2X a week. Everything was going great right at the beginning or at the first date she told me that shed like to take things slowly and I agreed.

So we dated and I realized I was taking a little too fast by texting and calling frequently but she would also do the same things too. Everything was going great and she would sometimes text me at night and say things like ""I miss you"" but no body stopped her to come and see me so I once reacted to her text message saying that ""if you miss me maybe you should come see me then and nobody is stopping you"" So I stepped back and stopped doing what I was doing since she wanted to take things slow. (less text messages, longer period to reply back and so on). 

Couple days after we meet and I sense this weird vibe from her and immediately knew something was off. Later I drop her off go home and I get a text message saying shed like us to stop seeing each other since we're not at the same pace. Me being confused at what she's talking about I agreed but I did tell her what she was saying does not make sense. (dumped over text) by the way I'm 32 and she's 25.

So couple of days passes by and I get a text from her saying that I wanted to let you know that I've been thinking and I didn't let the conversation flow (I guess she meant that she didn't hear my side of the story since I just agreed to it but I was also confused since what she said didn't make sense) and it wasn't an easy topic and that she was overwhelmed. also she said that not all comments were true and quite irrational (whatever that means), wanna meet and talk?

So me being me I have no idea where she's going with this I asked where she's going with this or asking me here? and she said it wasn't right to do this over text and we should have talked. So I responded by saying so now you'd like to tell me in my face that it wouldn't work out? anyways I agreed to meet her in person.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate chess games and dating games also I do not have the patience for this sort of games. What is she asking for here? if we start dating again and this is the beginning what would come after?

10,p2h2sk,1628700894,If I like you I’m going to answer fully in text,"So recently I was dating this girl, we were both really into each other. At the start of dates I’m usually to the point with texts and not texting a lot.

It has been about a month, and it was going really well. Now when she texts questions about what I’m doing I give a little more detail actually putting some effort into it.

This goes on for about a week, and she says she isn’t feeling it, she said I was too into her and it was putting her off. I’m grateful that she actually gave me a legitimate reason so I just said thanks for being honest and moved on.

But this paradox men have to face when texting girls they’re genuinely into is bizarre. If you show some effort you come across as too needy, but at the same time you like them so you want to show some effort.

Anyway, it’s been a learning experience for me. I understand why you need to text less, it’s because if you text more you remove the mystery or you come across as liking her too much which both kill attraction for girls.

We met at a bar and got drinks on our first date and it didn’t go great. In hindsight, I should’ve just stopped speaking to her then, but my self esteem is pretty much nonexistent and I’m very ugly and desperate and lonely so I asked her out again.

Our date went awful. She was 20 minutes late, she was rude to me(which wasn’t new), rude to waitstaff(also not new), she complained about everything from the venue, to the food, to my outfit and cologne. 

When the bill came I decided I probably shouldn’t ask her out again unless I really can’t find someone, so when the waitress came and asked about the checks, I firmly said 2 checks. The girl then said, “You really know how to make a girl feel special. Do you not bring money on dates?” I told her I was low on cash I couldn’t afford both of ours. She then said, “Well I didn’t bring my wallet. What are you going to do?” We started bickering and they waitress said she’d come back later.

During the bickering I told her that I had the money to pay, but she has been so unpleasant and rude that I don’t want to see her again and I don’t think I should pay for her meal. She got even madder. After 10 more minutes of arguing I decided I was done. I told her I’d go talk to the waitress near the cash register and see if something could be done. I got up walked to the register, explained the situation, and she let me pay and leave.

Did you date that attractive person? Did your self-esteem hit that your not worthy enough? Did you take the risk, and have a happy relationship?

First of all, somehow I only get woman who want to try a relationship but they are bored after a few dates and a bit of sex and maybe a short relationship and move on. The longest relationship I had was 4 months (I was 21 at the time). I really hate myself for not getting it to work for much longer. My standards are very low. As long as the person is interresting and fun to talk to and we have an attraction with eachother I try to get on a date with them with the goal to maybe reach a relationship and hopefully much more (Most of the time it doesnt work out but we keep in touch anyways, I got some nice Friends out of these situations). I use tinder and parties as my dating platform. Maybe I m just not fun or boring after a few dates/relationship.

Don't get me wrong, I have been through my share of hookups and drunken sex, I was just never romantically involved with anyone.

Last month, an old friend (female) I haven't seen in years reached out to me on IG. She has lost an enormous amount of weight and looks decent now, but she's not hot as my actual crush. And she is showing a lot more interest so I could probably pull this off and have her as my practice girlfriend, to practice sex, talking to a girl, studying female behavior, etc. And we have a lot of common interests so I could actually begin to like her over time.

Has anyone done this?""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2jjvr/is_having_a_practice_girlfriend_to_practice_sex/

Also that along with being nice, for some reason every girl always says that about me. I know it’s known that girls usually don’t like nice guys, due to the majority of men acting like that to them, so they get bored of it.

33,p2jq62,1628708614,Help me settle a debate with my friends!,"Hello All! I (24M) have recently gotten into a friendly little debate with some buddies of mine about dating, and wanted to turn it to the internet! **TLDR at the bottom.**

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I was telling them when I meet a girl I'm interested in, after about two weeks of talking and going on dates I let them know my intentions. Nothing too serious I just say something along the lines of ""Hey I really like you and enjoy spending time with you, just so you know, I'm looking for something serious and hope you feel the same way!""

&amp;#x200B;

Now my friends were saying this is a terrible dating strategy, they said it comes off as desperate and *waaayyy* to forward. They are really into the ""gamifying dating"" thing where if a girl likes you, you pretend you're not interested, or wait ""x"" amount of hours before replying back and all that stuff. Also, they said that its impossible to truly get to know someone after only two weeks of talking, and that process actually takes months and maybe even years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as far as the gamifying thing goes, I *reeeeaallyyy* don't like this mindset. The thing is, I'm not in high-school anymore, if I like someone and want to date them, I'm going to tell them.  I think I'm an honest person when it comes to dating and I'd like whoever I'm with to be the same way. As for the second point about taking time to know someone, I concede that is absolutely true, but here's the thing. If there's one thing I've learned in my 24 years of being on this Earth is that *intentions matter*. Not everyone approaches dating with the same intentions (ESP ON OLD). You can meet an AMAZING person who is an absolute joy to talk to and hang out with, but they could only be looking for something casual, or just not interested in dating at the moment, or they just want to focus on their career, or they could be religious and only want to marry someone of the same faith, etc etc.... So the reason I do the ""two weeks"" thing is I want to make sure the other person is on the same page as me intentions-wise from early. That way no one ends up wasting time.

Let me know what you guys think of my ""two weeks"" strategy, I know this is only my perspective and I didn't really convey the other side as much, so let me know if I am actually an idiot and need to slow down when looking for a partner

Thanks for reading!

34,p2jthz,1628708875,How to slow down after sleeping with a guy,"I (30 F) slept with a guy (40 M) that I knew a little many years ago, but we reconnected recently and met up. We connected on an intellectual level and in terms of interests and humor.
The first date we just talked and walked and on the second we did a long trip in nature and ended up spending the day together and sleeping together at night. I felt very aroused and excited to be physical with him, but I also had a gut feeling that maybe things are taking off a bit soon. I had a bad feeling that reminded me of another guy some years ago whom I slept with and didn’t really wanted something more. I told this guy that I am not fully comfortable and he was ok with it but I guess we had both had some wine and at the end of the day it happened because i couldn’t stop myself and he didn’t try to stop either… it was really fun and we have great chemistry but now I am a bit worried that I will become his sex buddy and that there are no chances to develop the relation into something more. We don’t really know each other that well and I don’t even know what he is looking for. My gut feeling tells me that he is not looking for anything serious. I feel like I don’t want to start questioning him because who knows how they feel at this stage anyways and I am only infatuated because of all the oxytocin and nearness we had - I guess I would feel better not having sex but now that it happened I worry that there is no going back or that it will seem serious and boring and will drive him away. Obviously I will listen to myself and stop the sex but I don’t know if there is a good way to do it so that he remains interested and doesn’t see it as me trying to withhold sex as a way of demanding that he develops feelings for me. I am super confused and would love some input, thanks! He complimented me a lot on my body but also on my intellect and personality. I realize that went beyond my own boundary and in hindsight would rather not have slept so soon, but now what happened happened, how can I step things down without scaring him away?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2jthz/how_to_slow_down_after_sleeping_with_a_guy/

36,p2k01c,1628709429,Should I be Concerned?,"Hello Everyone,

I recently met a guy on a dating app. He 24 and I am 21. We went on our first date recently. I have some concerns that I don't know if I should be worried about. From the beginning of communication between us he was very straightforward. He told me what he wanted: he wanted a long-term girlfriend, for us to understand each other, call each other every night or at least communicate everyday, and see each other at least once a week. None of this is bad in my opinion. 

However, he keeps over explaining himself on every topic and repeating what he expects from the relationship. He also seems to have a schedule for how things should be going. He keeps saying we need to understand each other and keeps wanting us to just ask each other questions all the time. I'm not sure this is how you get to know someone, maybe it is. He is also super affectionate. Mind you, he did tell me he was before meeting. But he wants hugs all the time, cuddles, and tried picking me up on our first date. I think this is too much so soon and kind of scares me. He also keeps saying how much he likes me, thinks I am cute, and thinks I am a good person. Thing is, we haven't talked for long (like a week). Just agreed on a lot of topics about what we wanted in a relationship. He also brings up our races a lot. I am black and he is Indian. Yeah it is a rare mix, but I feel like he shows off when we're out in public. Especially when other Indians are around. 

I'm not sure if a language barrier is going on or if a cultural one is happening. But I am surely not used to this. I could also be paranoid because I dated a narcissist before and am constantly checking for warning signs in the early stages of a relationship. There's just something off and I can't put my finger on it. He is awkward and this could also be throwing me off.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2k01c/should_i_be_concerned/

38,p2k093,1628709449,this is soooo long but i need help,"this is EXTREMELY long so just buckle up &amp; enjoy (even though it’s a very sad story but it’s interesting i think lmao).

i’ll start off by saying this.
i (22F) have a boyfriend (22M). 
my issues: hashimotos disease, POTS, IST, depression, GAD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, hypochondria, medicine anxiety, migraines, anger issues &amp; abunch of other daily symptoms i suffer with.
his issues: depression, ADD &amp; suspected borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. 
okay now that you have all of that - here we go.
in 2018 i was with a different boyfriend (23M). i was having super weird problems going on (heart palpitations, shortness of breath, etc) despite being pretty physically healthy (i was only 19 at the time). i went to the ER 6 times for these problems, and was always told it was anxiety. one day, on our way back home from a trip, it felt like my heart exploded inside my chest. i immediately told my boyfriend to go to the nearest hospital. there, i asked them to check my thyroid as i had been googling things that could cause heart problems &amp; also knew my mom has thyroid disease &amp; it’s genetic. an hour later i was diagnosed with hashimotos disease (a chronic, life long disease) &amp; was also made aware that my cholesterol was at 480 because of it! not super exciting to hear at 19 years old. my mom and boyfriend (at that time) labeled me a hypochondriac before the diagnosis because i was constantly googling things that could cause heart problems. but it turns out, i was right. i started taking thyroid meds &amp; was feeling like 85-90% back to normal. was able to go on a trip to vegas &amp; enjoy it with no heart troubles. then, that boyfriend left me. which was fine, he was an alcoholic and just not my vibe really. we had dated for 3 years at that point tho so it was a bit sad, but for the best. a week or 2 after the breakup, i met up with my current boyfriend. we had known eachother since we were 10 thru facebook (he went to school with my best friend/cousin). we had never met until that point after the breakup, were always just online friends but were always deeply in love with eachother. so i met him finally. &amp; we clicked instantly, as we both knew we would. we became inseparable, we were so in love. he made me feel safe, happy, and beautiful and i hopefully made him feel the same way. this is around august 2019 btw. so, as we all know, COVID news starts going around by December19/January20. we ignore it at first, but then it starts to ramp up. we quarantined ourselves around March. I believe that we did get COVID however, around April/May20 because i got extremely sick (dizzy, heart palpitations, exhaustion, couldn’t eat, almost fainting when standing or sitting could only lay in bed) for a few weeks. he was also sick but not as bad or as long. we got over that and moved on (though to this day i deal with daily dizziness) then, we got our own apartment (my first apartment!) together in august20. we had so much fun, had friends over (safely), had movie nights, game nights it was the best time ever. we were so happy and in love. then, 2021 hit. 
in february i found out he cheated on me, his reasoning being that i didn’t have a job and it stressed him out (i’m unemployed but only due to my illnesses - i’m an artist trying to sell my pieces but we all know how hard that is. i also constantly apply for at home jobs but those are so hard to get, especially now with them being so sought after.)
in april, my life long best friend said i was horrible and a shitty person (i will defend myself to this day - she has a severe victim complex and was completely in the wrong but that’s a story for another day). 2 days after that, my absolute best friend in the whole world says basically the same thing, that i’m selfish and “boring” (can’t do a lot due to my illnesses lol). those losses devastate me. i end up in the ER a few days later with a racing pulse that won’t slow. i stayed there all night &amp; it still didn’t slow, but they couldn’t help &amp; sent me home. that made me spiral, &amp; i became bedridden. this lasted 2 months. i went to a cardiologist, got my heart checked &amp; it was perfectly fine just fast for no reason at times. so, i had the motivation to pick myself up and better myself. i started doing a bit more, &amp; one day i woke up &amp; decided to clean my living room for the first time in a long time. i did it, sat down on the couch, and got hit with the most intense bout of vertigo i’ve ever felt in my life. like, thought i was ascending to heaven type vertigo. i quickly ran to the bedroom crying &amp; scared. my boyfriend was nice &amp; told me to just lay down. the vertigo didn’t go away for 2 weeks. i was bedridden again. it also caused me to go into a SEVERE depression. i was finally starting to feel okay again &amp; got pushed right back down. it hurt me really really bad mentally, as it took a lot out of me to get out of bed the first time. now, i’m still here, bed ridden and stuck. 
the issue is that my boyfriend and mom believe that prozac would help me because they believe a lot of my issues are anxiety driven. i too think prozac would help me, but here’s the story with that. 
when i was 12-14 i took prozac, it helped me a lot! my parents were divorced, so i would be dropped off with my dad every other weekend. he is a very big “holistic” person. no medicine basically. he didn’t even let me take advil when i had a headache. so, he learned i was taking prozac &amp; didn’t like it. he constantly told me it was poison, i was going to d*e, etc. he would text me when i wasn’t with him “you still taking those meds? wish you wouldn’t”. even went as far as to buy me books for my birthday about how prozac is poison. so, that traumatized the fuck out of me. i stopped taking the pill shortly after. i also can’t take advil or any pain meds due to him (so my migraines are super fun to deal with lol). 
i currently take levothyroxine, propranolol and xanax as needed. it took A LONG TIME for me to take the propranolol, but i took it because my heart really was just too fucking fast. 
because everyone wanted me to start taking the prozac, i looked into it to see if anything bad could happen with the medicines i’m on (that’s reasonable, right?). i see that prozac and propranolol could potentionally cause some pretty severe issues, which scared me. so having that fear mixed with the dad trauma, it’s pretty fucking hard for me to take the prozac. my depression has turned into the very bad thoughts, you know the ones. i expressed that to my boyfriend, who told me that he no longer feels any feelings towards me, he barely loves me, &amp; is forcing himself to stay with me daily. i admit, i understand how it can suck to be dating someone who is bed ridden + dealing with their depression &amp; panic attacks. but i DO NOT ask for him to do everything for me. i ask him to refill my water bottle (it’s a gallon so he only has to do it once a day) &amp; then if he could grab me a snack when i’m feeling dizzy (maybe once a day 3 times a week.) other than that i’m fine, i go to the bathroom on my own &amp; whatever. the last few weeks he just hates me. honestly, can’t stand me. and i understand, but all he says is “take the pill and i’ll stay” (prozac), but doesn’t understand my intense fear surrounding it. 
today we had a big argument, &amp; i took the prozac for him. i’m still shaking thinking about it, it’s fucking terrifying for me. he said “i’m not going to be proud of you for taking it 1 day. talk to me in a week”, this is after i told him about my very bad thoughts which he didn’t give a shit about because i don’t deserve to have those thoughts if i won’t take the prozac. 
he doesn’t think he’s in the wrong, at all. doesn’t understand “my issue”, thinks i should just take the pill and move on. so i did it, and now all of a sudden it’s not enough. 
i just don’t know what to do. am i in the wrong? should i just shut the fuck up and take the pill? idk. 

TD;LR i have a lot of trauma which i explain in detail &amp; my boyfriend doesn’t really care about it &amp; our relationship is about to end",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2k093/this_is_soooo_long_but_i_need_help/
39,p2k5dd,1628709902,I think I finally found the one! Just want to give some heartfelt appreciation for women who aren't afraid of men,"Some years ago I found myself profoundly depressed, going through a divorce following a protracted dead bedroom situation in which my ex-wife treated sex like a treat I must earn, or a chore she would only do distastefully and as little as possible. I promised myself I would never again be with someone who made me feel bad for desiring her.

Once I was 100% divorced and therapist-approved to date again, I found that many of the women I dated had a similar attitude to sex as my ex wife. It seemed that, for many women, sex is a dirty thing that must never be discussed openly, not until the nth date, not until ""commitment""--and it must never be given out to a man who didn't ""earn"" it in some way.

Many of these experiences seemed excruciating for both of us. One time a first date caught me staring at her lips while she was talking. She asked what I was thinking and I said I was imagining what it would be like to kiss her. She immediately called a Lyft, went outside to wait for it, and told me not to ""follow her outside and bother her"" (as if I would). Another woman asked for a bunch of private information so she could run a background check on me before she would agree to a date. Another came back to my apartment and then reacted with appalled horror when I moved in to kiss her. 

Every time something like this happened, I would feel something similar to what I felt when my ex-wife turned me down--crushed, hurt, deflated, defeated, humiliated. This is a difficult way to feel when we are hoping to feel affection and desire! Every time I felt that feeling, I moved on, even if the woman who made me feel that way offered to ""give me another chance if we take things slower."" It got very discouraging and I became more and more reluctant to bother with swiping or dating or being outgoing at all.

And then I met my favorite person!

Here's how things progressed when I found her:

On the day we matched, we exchanged numbers and started texting. I asked her for a picture and she sent a cute mirror selfie. I sent back a similar photo, complimented her top and asked what she was wearing underneath it. After an agonizing 20 minute wait, I got to see her beautiful breasts for the first time.

Day two, we talked on the phone. Our conversation ran for over two hours, including a little bit of everything but ending up on sex. I asked her if we could FaceTime and masturbate together before hanging up the phone and she said yes. It was amazing!

Day three, she came to my house and we were naked in bed within 20 minutes. Best first date ever, and the first of many to follow. I think for the first few months all of our ""dates"" were at home. We would cook meals together, watch tv, and of course, have tons and tons of fun truly ""getting to know each other.""

It's been about two years now and we are still together. We have built a beautiful partnership on a solid foundation of excellent sex. I feel closer to her than I've ever felt to anyone. I am glad I waited for her instead of trying to stick it out with women who weren't a match for me.

Looking back, I feel guilty. I also feel like I failed in some ways. Half of me wants to blame myself, and another half of me is looking back and realizing potential red flags I may have missed. 

We had been talking for a while, and she was giving me a lot of attention despite telling me she wasn't wanting anything serious. She was FaceTiming me, texting me a lot, commenting heart faces on my Instagram pictures and would text me in the morning wishing me a good day at times. 

I got accustomed to her presence and attention, reciprocated it, and definitely liked it. She is 20 and I am 23, but she was pretty dope. She is younger/can't even go to bars legally Yet so I'm not that surprised it didn't work out. 

We didn't talk about where we were at until maybe a month and a half ago. That's when she finally told me she wasn't looking for anything serious. I'm not either necessarily, but I wish I would've voiced this right from the beginning. After a few dates and over 2 months of talking/dating, nothing was mentioned about intentions. Next thing you know, I'm sitting just short of the 3 month mark and confused about everything. 

She was giving me A LOT of attention like I said earlier. It was slightly off but I got used to it and enjoyed her consistent communication. After I voiced my thoughts on where we were at is when she started backing away, despite us agreeing we weren't looking for anything serious at the time. 

Last time we hung out she asked me about my band I play in. She said ""I bet you get a lot of girls"" and all this. I didn't know how to respond and thought it was weird. She's younger so she hangs around younger people. She was complaining about her friends to me and telling me all this drama I did not care about at all, I zoned out eventually. 

Last week after almost a month of the changed communication patterns I was casually direct with her. Communication had become 1 sided and I flat out asked her where her head was at before I initiated anything else. 

She mentioned how it was hard to see me when I live an hour away and that she's content with friends in her life right now and doesn't wanna add anyone else to it which I understand. She's still in college so I really can't be upset about that. When I was 20 I felt the same way. 

She told me she needed some ""space from this relationship for a little"" and it confused me when she said relationship. I said ""thank you for letting me know what you need. If you need space I'll leave you alone &amp;amp; if you'd rather cut ties it's all good , I just don't want energy wasted on either end""

She got pissed. She was like ""I've said it so many times now. I just need space rn. Thank you."" She removed me from her private snap story, but not her normal one. I'm not gonna reach out for it's likely done. I wish she hadn't gotten so mad at me. I didn't respond. 

The fact that she was all over me, asked me about other girls and all this other stuff makes me wonder if I dodged a bullet or not. She was cool and maybe I got infatuated, did I miss any red flags here? Or does she sound like a typical young college girl?

I seriously will like to get to know him and give him the benefit of the doubt while he opens up but the fact that when I propose a video chat after he said when would that be when I started to trade him in meeting, he did not respond to that.  I have checked to see if he is a scammer but he is not a scammer, neither he is married per his social profile which has everyone of his family, friends and co-workers.

78,p2o96t,1628722458,I seem to have some mental barrier,"Hey folks,
I (M22) seem to have some sort of mental barrier that's preventing me from meeting and/or making moves on girls that I like.

So, I moved to this new place in like April and since the Covid restrictions have been lifted, I was able to go out a lot with new friends that I have made very quickly over there. And that's the thing: I am a very sociable guy. It only took me a few weeks to get to know actually quite many people and there are even a few opportunities to go and ask a girl out. The prepositions are perfect! I have got phone numbers of several girls, I could message or ring them and ask. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that even my social situation is more than I could hope for after moving to a new place.

I simply can't go on a date. Whenever even the possibility comes up in my head that me and her could be thing, my mind just goes crazy. I'm starting to overthink flipping everything. Reading signs from her that probably aren't there. I'm also getting really really nervous around potential dates which prevents me from having a normal conversation I just black out and say stupid stuff or just nothing. Which is so weird because I definitely am able to make interesting conversation with my friends.

Also a thing I became really good at is finding excuses for not asking someone out. This kind of goes hand in hand with reading her ""signs"". It's like: ""Umm... I'm going to be rejected anyway"" but also like ""I'm going to be away for a weeks next month so going on a date before it wouldn't be good because we wouldn't see eachother after it for a while"". I just keep pushing it away from me and eventually nothing happens. 


But I think that is only secondary. I feel like on the basis of this lays a deep shame or/and embarrassment of these kind of topics. I remember my father ALWAYS making fun me having a thing with girls. Even though there weren't anything. I always tried to hide my acquaintances as well as my feelings so I became really shy about it and also really receptive for and anxious about stupid comments (I do these as well, It's normal, but maybe not in the way my dad did it). 

Does it make any sense to you? Idk maybe it does, also idk if this counts as rant or question or whatever. But I figured I could do with some advice!

86,p2oteu,1628724301,Girl cheated on her bf with me and I still feel slimey?,"So a couple weeks ago I went out with my family, one of my cousins brought her friend, and we have been flirty in the past, but we just held hands and we’re touchy and that was it. This time she was grinding on me throughout the night, I was dancing with her, and I knew she had a bf but I didn’t think that was all that bad.

We get back to the hotel room, we’re both super drunk, somehow my brother in law basically dares her to suck my dick, she does it, but stops midway through bc she was crying a little bc she was cheating. I of course stopped and felt extremely bad and my brother in law later said that he took full responsibility for sort of taking advantage of the both of us, he said he was just trying to get me laid, but he he like basically convinced her to suck my dick.

Well I was feeling horrible, but she sort of got over it somehow in like 10 min and while everybody was sleeping she came over to my bed, we fooled around for like 2 hours, getting each other off, she sucked my dick again, and she wanted me to cum on her which I did.

I was just so drunk and at one point I remember just almost falling asleep while I was getting a handjob, and I took a long time to cum bc I was drunk and high. She kept asking me if this was cheating and I would say it’s whatever you want it to be, and  I asked her a couple times if she wanted to stop, but she always said no bc she was horny. 

I sort of remember just closing my eyes and acting like I was asleep but she was still humping my leg and licking me, even though I was basically not moving.  And she wanted me to add her on social media while we were sort of messing around, so I saw her post a story of her bf and god I just feel terrible for the guy. I’m not going to say anything bc I don’t need the drama, but the poor guy bought her shoes, she was wearing 400 dollar shoes that he had bought her that night, and he probably has no idea.

It’s honestly really jaded me and I told my friend about it and he was like that’s why I’m paranoid about my girl going out, bc shit happens and it’s made me aware of the cruelty of dating. I almost want to unfollow her bc it’s such a bummer that that guy probably thinks that everything is okay meanwhile she’s dancing with guys at the club and getting cummed on and it’s really tarnished my expectations I guess.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2oteu/girl_cheated_on_her_bf_with_me_and_i_still_feel/

88,p2p09z,1628724942,Let's talk about the NICE GUY," LET'S TALK ABOUT BEING THE ""NICE GUY"" and some simple steps on how to stop being one..

❗Have you ever wondered, why you are not getting on second/ third dates with a woman you really like?
❗Or getting ghosted after 1 month of having a ""great experience"" with an attractive woman?

👉 Let me get this clear:

❌You are the NICE GUY

How do I know?

Well, I've been the nice guy for years and that led me nowhere. In fact, being the nice guy led me to loneliness, depression and low self-esteem.

But, what the so called ""nice guys"" are? 

I will name a few behaviours which lead into being one:

❌You are afraid of expressing your true self.

❌ You are afraid of expressing your sexuality! (You don't even talk when it comes to sex in front of women)

❌ You are afraid of conflict.

 You don't want to upset her by any chance, so you stop communicating your beliefs or expressing a different opinion.

❌Your level of agreeableness is 100%! 
You agree with everything she says, proposes or even when judging other people! 

Do you have to be a brutal-6 pack looking- alpha male, who's disrespectful to women? Of course NOT! 

But you have to implement new strategies and start changing yourself!

✅ Start expressing your true self and be A LEADER in every conversation or situation you are in. Women love to ""follow"".

✅ Everyone loves sex, so do women. Start talking about sex with women. Talk about your experiences or your fantasies! (Please don't be a dick, always respect women)

 Showing that you are cool about sex, and that sex is something normal to talk about, is the most important step in dating.

✅ Embrace healthy conflict, and challenge her. 

Women love to be challenged and to confront different opinions. 

✅ Stop agreeing in everything she says or wants. 

Again, be a leader and disagree if you feel you have to!

89,p2p3gy,1628725258,Is this normal?,"I’ve recently started getting myself back out into the dating community after being single for about 2 years. I decided to download bumble (a dating app for those that don’t know) met this great guy, conversation was great could easily talk to him for a few hours. We started throwing out date ideas of what we both wanted to do. I naturally decided on going for drinks or maybe a walk somewhere (good idea right?) he wanted to have sex… in his car… on the first date. Literally what??? There’s a few steps missing there buddy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2p3gy/is_this_normal/
90,p2p7fg,1628725635,You attract what you are. Become the type of person that you want to be with,"When you know your values and are living your life in line with your values, you will naturally bring people into your life who share those values.

While its still equally important to take action and insert yourself into situations where you can interact with new people, **the greatest factor which determines on average the caliber of people that surround you is YOU**.

Who would you be more attracted to?

A positive person who is striving to better their life and does not become jealous of other's successes or.. a person who is resigned to their current status and just mopes and complains about everything.

The daily choices that you make on a how you **choose to approach life** are what will in the end determine your results.

93,p2pgjl,1628726509,Bipolar ex girlfriend urgent !!,"So I have been in a relationship with my bf for over 9 months now and his ex girlfriend from 7 years ago randomly messaged me on Instagram accusing my bf of being a rapist and abuser. She said that she had screen shots of him up to date of him still trying to get at her. She only sent one screenshot of the inbox and none of them show full proof that he was trying to get at her the last message he sent was way before I got with my bf so it didn’t count. My bf says that he emailed her because they shared a cat in common which she kept and didn’t allow him to see him, When I asked her for full proof of the messages she said she didn’t hAve to prove anything to anyone that she did her job by telling me and then blocked me from social media and had her people block me too, she couldn’t provide full proof but made her accusations against my bf ( her ex ) to protect me from him. Right now I am in huge conflict with him because of her and he claims he left her because she is bipolar and it turns out she is. According to my bf she tried committing Suicide a couple times shaved her head and tried to crash a car with him, also suffered from substance abuse that’s why he left her. The only reason he tried to reach out was to see his cat but she never responded to him. We only heard from her after he tagged me on his social media that I was his girlfriend and she privately message me to accuse him so I can leave him. I honestly don’t know what todo !

94,p2pswv,1628727727,Waiting Game,"6 months being single I remembered one of the reasons I got into a relationship. Pursuing multiple people at once is a waste of time. Another thing I remembered is trying to find someone who is ""perfect"" in the beginning is impossible. Wasting all this time and money chasing women.

But I think I'm gonna go back to working on myself. Then see if someone I like comes along. Seemed to work best the last time around.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2pswv/waiting_game/
95,p2pufs,1628727876,Hear me out.,"
A month ago I (18 M) meet this girl (18 F) who is traveling for college in september, we both showed interest in each other and we started talking more. We went on two dates, she met my friends I met her friends and it was going good, we had a talk and decided to have no feelings attached to our relationship that we were just having fun and enjoying our time together. Two weeks later me and my friends hosted a big party (600 people) and she came we spent most of the party together had our first kiss and she left 3 hours later at 1 AM, the party was still going till 4 AM so when she left I was pretty upset and met this other girl in the same party who showed a lot of interest in me, we spent the rest of the night together until the party ended. Fast forward a week later I had a gig as a dj for a prom, I invited her and she came, but she barely spent time with me and was talking to other guys at the prom which bothered me but I didn’t think much of it. We sat together at the prom alone for a while and I tried to kiss her again but she wouldn’t budge and started telling me that she was traumatized from her ex’s behavior etc. The next night she had her friends farewell in a night club where me and my friends had reserved a lounge, she called me and begged me to come, which I did, I walked in and was going to my friends lounge when I passed by their table so I said hi and she came with me to our lounge and met a couple of my not really close friends just some people I know, we went back and sat at her and her friends table, I got close to her and we were talking and drinking for about 30 mins when she started going to my friends lounge without me, danced with some of the guys there which I didn’t like, and she wouldn’t spend time with me, I started getting mad, I hit my breaking point when she got drunk and continued dancing with a guy I didn’t like. She had to leave at 1 AM and I was pissed to the point where I let that guy accompany her in the elevator to her mom’s car, I told her friend I’m breaking up with her later that night, and left to my friend’s house. That same night I get three paragraphs from her (which I didn’t fully read because it was really long but what I read was) telling me that she only has 1 month left here and she didn’t wanna be committed to anyone and wanted to party and have fun without me being in the picture because she can’t trust me fully, which I was okay with so I didn’t reply to anything she sent and left it at that. I find out the next day that she kissed that guy in the elevator  (I took care of him), and I find out that she knew what I did with the girl at me and my friends party, which explained her behavior. She talked to one of my girl friends complaining to her that I didn’t reply to her messages and she deserves to hear my point of view, but I really don’t want to talk to her (because if I do I’m going to hurt her with what I have to say) but my friend is telling me I should.
