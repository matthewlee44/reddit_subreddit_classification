0,rygsnx,1641586701,could it be bad to stop pursuing other dates after a good 3rd date with someone? 28m," Im  conflicted. I dont at all mean going steady. I 100% dont expect that  for atleast another 3-4 dates from her and I want it to happen  naturally. so no real timeframe. If it does happen..

I  was feeling a bit burnt out from dating at the end of the year, but  then I met this women and so far its been great. My other matches dried  up and I stopped paying much attention.

but I got a potential first date tomorrow and another who asked me for a date on a dating app.

After  being on dates with 15+ people over the last 6months I know that im  into her enough that Im not too interested in pursuing anyone until I  see where this goes.

but I think it could be bad to put ""all my eggs into one basket"" so im filling inclined to go on at least one other first date.

but  at the same time I am not sure I have the energy for it. I dont want to  go on a wasted date with someone I might have been interested in if I  could get my mind off of this current girl Im seeing.

so it might be easier to hold off. Imo a stop in seeing her will be hard regardless I have readily other options or not.

Im not sure if its bad practice to do this though.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rygsnx/could_it_be_bad_to_stop_pursuing_other_dates/
1,rygssx,1641586711,Why only lawyers are attracted to me?,"I know it might sound silly, but I wonder if anyone of you has ever experienced something similar - **that only (or mostly) one occupational group is attracted to you?**

&amp;#x200B;

I got me thinking because lately I've realized that ALL guys that were romantically interested in me after I graduated high school were lawyers/went to law school and are lawyers in the making. Actually all the guys that were hitting on me in high school also ended up in law school. It wouldn't be suprising at all if I also studied to become a lawyer or at least someone else from the field like judge/prosecutor, but I'm in med school intending to become a doctor one day. I also don't have any lawyers in my family or my friend circle. I met those guys rather randomly: in high school, through mutual friends, at a bar/club or on a dating app. They all turned out to be lawyers.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is that? The only thing I seem to have in common with them is that I'm really into politics and I'm open about it. I often talk about political topics and post articles or stuff on my social media. But it's more towards economy than legislation so I don't know if it makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have anything against lawyers, but I just don't see them as life partners. They often appear to me as cocky and argumentative (and since I am too, it just pisses me off in a relationship). And I know there are prenups and shit, but one day I'd love to start my own business ventures and know I would be afraid to trust my lawyer man/hubby with whole paper work. Long story short: I'd be afraid they'd trick me into something. I don't know, I feel like I could never trust a man like that in 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the reason behind it? How to change that? How to attract other men, not the same ones over and over again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rygssx/why_only_lawyers_are_attracted_to_me/

we’re been dating for 9 months now and i feel like he doesn’t trust me with other people whatsoever. i have these two friends who are male and are relatively close to me and we’re all buddy buddy no romantic feelings involved at all. i understand 1000% that he’d be cautious of me having guy friends and i do not talk with them everyday or leave him to call them or hangout with them etc, he’s my priority. i only hangout with one of them and i’m never alone its always me him and a childhood friend because he moved away and we barely see eachother once every two months. we were close before i started dating my boyfriend btw. so basically my boyfriend will always say “oh ur gonna leave me for them” or “he texts u like all the time” which let me say, one of them has been texting me a lot more recently but only because we talk about fnaf lore since security breach came out LMFAO. he always extremely over exaggerates saying we text all day everyday which is completely untrue and its a little annoying when nothing i say is heard. he makes up things and then doesnt listen to me. one of them edates a lot and has clearly stated he has no romantic feelings for me. the other also has stated he has no romantic feelings for me at all, and has many feb and relationships. they are both aware of my relationship and have no intentions of intervening. i have told my bf multiple times that they are just friends that i’ve had for a while (one years before him)and he always says theyre only talking to me because they want to be with me which sucks and is so annoying because its untrue. its not like i’m talking to 100 guys everyday, i just have these two friends who are literally just friends. he believes that friendliness = infatuation and its just too much sometimes. he wants me to be completely isolated from everyone and gets really irritated when i talk to people. i dont even know what to say to him anymore because its like i love you but you need to understand that i have friends too. 

he thinks that anyone of the opposite sex immediately likes me and it hurts tbh. i dont know what to do, i dont know how to make him less.. obsessive? thats a harsh word but i mean taking a step back its really too much. girls are allowed to have simple basic friendship with guys without it being romantic at all. its just two people who are friends. i’m openly pansexual to him and i talk to a bunch of girls and non gender conforming people. why is it so different that i have two guy friends?why is it so hard to understand that theyre just friends? he’s a year younger than me so maybe hes just not as mature but one year shouldnt make THAT much of a difference… 

i have ABSOLUTELY no feelings for the two at all. he says he believes that and trusts me but doesnt trust them which i get but he takes it way too far. 

i talk to them both a couple times a week. what is so wrong with having friends? why does their sex determine so much :(

it makes me feel like he doesnt trust me at all and its just so overwhelming. any advice right now would mean the world. i honestly do not know what to do to get through to him i’m so anxious and stressed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryi1a2/my_boyfriend_thinks_everyone_likes_me_and_its/

I've known my friend for almost 3 years now, but we met in person for the first-time last week and have been together every day since they were vacationing at my place. We met online over an online game and over time we grew to be good friends. And, yes, we've video called plenty of times before now. I didn't really think of it at first but something about seeing them in person and realizing how similar we are really sent my heart a flutter. They often joke about their lover tendencies and it showed so much. Music is their language and being polite is their nature. And it's **so** dreamy. They are a really sweet person and I appreciate them completely. I couldn't help laughing and smiling really hard around them because every second was absolutely great with them and it felt like it was mutual. They left today to go back home and I feel a bit sad and empty.

*Nothing sexually happened between us, but* ***GOD*** *I had a deep urge to kiss them when I was sending them off. (I didn't.)* We just hugged for a long time three times and talked a bit. I had to break myself from falling into a deep conversation because it is that easy for us to ... It hasn't been an hour yet and I miss their presence. They said they would call me on their way since the drive is over 6 hours and I feel that I'm like a puppy waiting at the door.

I'm not in a rush to say anything to them just yet but I'm really nervous about my feelings because I don't want to dive into my emotions and possibly loose such a great friend if the feeling isn't mutual. Cupid hit me in my skull and I'm wondering whether I should pull out the arrow or be brave (eventually).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryk0fq/friend_crush_what_should_i_do/

I love waste my time in her house while we talk in the night , that place give me peace and her mother is so nice with me, she always give me advices about the problems that i have with my family.

When i first met her i wanted to try something with her, we had some chemistry but the things just didn't happen as i expected. She  was already fliting with a guy. I kept this feeling locked deep inside of me cuz we become close friends, and when i say close, i want to say really close, she and her mother say things like ""mi casa es su casa"". 

She and the guy started dating but after two months they broke up cuz he was too problematic. I kept this whole time not giving vent to this feeling that i have. Now i don't have to run from this feeling but we built this whole thing where my favorite place when i want to forget my problems is her house, i feel so happy when i, she and her mother just take a place in the table and talk about everything posible. i don't wanna lose this.

That’s not to say it’s acceptable to guilt, shame, harass people for rejecting you, but I don’t think it’s an inherent part of their personality, just the result of stress and rejection.

Put simply, like most human behavior, our experiences make the difference. It’s not as though the people who are continually having sex and being in relationships are inherently more patient and understanding…they have likely never experienced the same degree and frequency of rejection that other do.

42,rylokm,1641599406,He’s my colleague… should i make a move ?,"Hello everyone! 
Asking for your help here. 
I (F, 24) have really been into one of my colleague (M, 24) for a couple months and I am analyzing everything instead of making a move… I need your help!! 
I have the gut feeling that he likes me but I would like some feedback. 

Here are good signs : 
- he initiates eye contact pretty often 
- he tries to get to know me and is smiling a lot/laughing/making jokes when we’re together 
- he can also talk about personal stuff when we’re just the 2 of us. Once he even showed me ALL the pictures on his phone for an hour long, telling me stories about his friends, his family etc
- he sometimes make comments such as « oh you didn’t make any comment on my shirt today » (I tend to compliment people a lot and he knows it) 
- he started to initiate contact on social media, texting me after work  but keeping it short and sweet (asking questions or sending me funny stuff) 
- he seems to be really curious about me. Even if we’re with other colleagues, he would ask generic questions to everyone but await for my answers, looking at me and asking back until I answer
- he compliments me in a weird/indirect manner (he saw a pic of my sister, told me that we look just the same and that she’s super pretty…)  
- He once brought a female « friend » to one of our party and we spent the whole party just the 3 of us, but we only talked him &amp; I, and he texted me after leaving the party telling me that her friend thought I was really nice. He then texted me the day after to have my opinion on a subject we had the night before 
- he once came to my place with other colleagues and he looked everywhere and was really curious! He made compliments about my flat and emphasized on the fact that we live really close

But some of his actions unfortunately make me doubt! 
- I initiate contact more than he does 
- He sometimes doesn’t text back/doesnt try to start a new topic by text msg
- he can me more distant at times. We can spend 4 days at work doing everything together and then have almost no contact for a couple days
- We aren’t really touchy, he doesnt really initiate physical touch
- I invited him twice (once for an activity and the other one for a drink), he wasnt in town both times, but he didnt invite me back or proposed another day


I am obv more invested than he is but sometimes I feel like he might be too shy to make a move ?? 
I feel that people see me as a pretty confident girl with a strong, direct personality and I don’t know if that scares him or if I should just give up lol.

Initially, I just wanted started talking to her to have long term friendship which I stated to her at the beginning. She told me she was looking for a long term relationship /friendship. So we just started talking getting to know eachother (at this point we don't know what each of us looks like etc) and she wanted to connect more inwardly first rather than by physical appearance. We really communicated happily and talked about goals, relationship etc etc  it really was a heart to heart chat. After talking for a couple weeks, she sends me her picture and also ask me to send her my picture. She is the most gorgeous person I've seen, and I just feel like a potato and feel pretty insecure about my appearance. She also jokingly asked me my height/weight. And as a short dude I tell her 'around' 5'7 (I actually don't know my height but it's probably closer to 5'5)  because I'm quite insecure about it (probably my biggest insecurity). She is 5'6. Which means I'm like an inch shorter. Also, she is extremely wealthy and smart and actually been helping me earn money through investment. Now I feel so damn inadequate as a man. 

Anyways we just keep talking, and i emotionally feel so connected with her, and now want it to be more than just friendship. But I can't stop thinking about my appearance. I want to express my true feelings and meet her but my insecurities are holding me back. Also, I would feel so selfish if i ask her to be my gf since she is infinitely times out of my league. But again, I don't want to be just friends with her anymore; it would break my heart. So I'm getting anxiety thinking that she likes me (my personality) but then when she sees me, she might get disgusted. So I am not sure what to do at this point.

63,rynuxq,1641605460,Help,"I know some people will find it an overreaction to his behaviour.But here goes. LONG POST. Back story: I’ve had an extremely hard past one month, both physically and emotionally. At the start of last month became very physically and mentally unwell in a matter of days, lost all my appetite, barely ate anything a day for about 1.5 weeks and lost 6kgs in a week. Had heart palpitations, weakness, etc. too and developed a constant dizziness that is, although my appetite is mostly at least back, still stuck with me and doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Been to multiple ERs and was finally admitted to a hospital for a week where they gave IV and tried to figure out what’s wrong, unfortunately mostly couldn’t and ended up getting discharged still not too well. 

Well, I was discharged from hospital a day before Christmas Eve and on the next day my family was booked in (me included) to fly for a week’s holiday interstate for some intense hiking. On the other hand, my boyfriend of 8 months has also had a trip scheduled to the same state but completely different places, and since I was unwell and his trip was to be a bit more chilled just visiting friends and family, and we didn’t want me to stay home alone for 8 days, he invited me to go along on the trip with him and his 8 year old son (met him before briefly). I was scared since still so lightheaded and weak everything was a huge effort, plus the whole situation, but I was also sooo excited  to be with him for 2 weeks straight and create memories with him, this was our first holiday together ever. 

Well. Mostly it has been amazing.. we drove 17 hours a day and lots of road trips, hanging out with him and his son at his house for a few days before we drove up interstate, going shopping, shooting basketball, visiting family, him and I started watching a series together every night, and each night I had some alone time with him to look forward to... and just lots of chilling, laughter together. Although dizzy still every day, had a great great time. It was out of a dream. Feel like I’ve gotten to love him so much more and developed some kind of bond with his son.

The last few days of the trip were a bit weird and, well, in lot of ways uncomfortable. Well firstly, those who know me I’m a massive introvert, only comfortable socialising and being myself with people I know really well, otherwise with strangers I can be quiet, very shy and come off as straight up antisocial. Well we stayed at lots of different of his friends and family and I must admit I wasn’t too social, when they were in the room talking and chatting loud I rarely managed to come out and engage for long, just the way I am with people I don’t know well. I tried to force myself to for his sake but I just couldn’t. I felt awkward because of this lots of times and tried my best, and what HAS bothered me a bit is that he’s always tried to kind of push me to socialise and commented hinted on how I don’t talk to people and why I stay in the room for so long. In turn it has made me think that he’s disappointed in me because yeah people learn a lot about each other during a holiday and maybe he lost interest in me because of this ? Like I sure seemed like some big antisocial weirdo. I did talk to his friends here and there though quality over quantity. But I always couldn’t wait for our time together at the end of the day, the highlight of the day.

Then if this wasn’t enough, there’s this married  couple who have been his bestest friends since childhood apparently who we also visited, they have two very young kids, I found out before we got there that he and the woman used to date back in the day when they were teenagers and inside I immediately heated up, even before I found this out the way they talked on the car loudspeaker together made me uncomfortable, calling each other darling/honey, “love you”, blowing each other kisses.. we spent NEW YEARS EVE with them and the woman (who’s just two years younger than him) got high and a little drunk and got too touchy with him for my liking, even walked up to him and kissed the top of his head right in front of me and her husband (who is his absolute best friend), and seemed kinda flirty. Then my boyfriend is like to me multiple times that night: “Isn’t ....(name) so cute?” when she was dancing high and singing and he just seemed to stare at her laughing and like with adoration. I think from that night he could tell I was jealous, because I can’t really hide my feelings well on my face and I always could just nod and keep smiling in agony. But we didn’t bring it up cause obviously the holiday and stuff plus they’re his best friends and I didn’t want to make drama. THEN, I found out on the way back home from the holiday that we would be going to their house to stay with them for two nights and days! You can imagine:) well as I thought, it was a super hard and uncomfortable two days. He LOVED it though, was beyond excited to stay with them and see their kids cause they actually met through him and he says their bond is so strong like family. I’m already introverted around strangers (need a lot of time to warm up to someone and get to know them) then add into that some jealousy too.. ugh. So the day we spent with them, listen to my luck, the husband was away at work and so it was only me, my boyfriend and the woman at home for a day plus the kids. Uhh, awkward?? I ended up hanging with the kids mostly while he hung with her mostly the whole day, helped her cook, look after the kids, helped her with everything, listened to them chat all day, while they both knew perfectly well I was around, then we went down to the beach, she was a car in front of us and he called her for a brief chat from our car, then at the beach they went into the water with the kids and I was swimming around them trying to enjoy the water at least.. but I felt absolutely miserable the whole day. I think he could tell, yet he just hung around her. Got out of the water to chat  to her with a baby in her arms. Literally looked like they were the couple and I was a third wheel or a babysitter. When we walked back to the car they walked in front and I was walking with the kids behind them. He still called me honey and babe and talked to me briefly at times though. But I don’t know if he was just very exhausted, or/and that he had a 13 hour drive in front of us, or I don’t know, but the past two days he wasn’t very affectionate towards me, us two barely talked, and then last night for the first time ever since we’ve been together, he just came in, lay down and went straight to bed without getting intimate. I know how much he loves getting intimate, he never skips a day if we get the chance. We did have a long drive ahead of us but nevertheless. With his other behaviour. He just rolled over and went to sleep, no cuddles no kisses even. And that knowing we only had like 2 or 3 nights together left on the holiday for us, he gave that up. I fell asleep kinda crying a little cause I felt hurt by his sudden lack of love and that whole day was kinda a lot emotionally and in every wa dealing with the constant dizziness and stuff.
Today, we drove the 13 hours home and I’ve had this sort of fear for days, that maybe because he’s found out on the holiday that I’m introverted, antisocial plus all that stuff with that woman, that I won’t hear from him again after we get back. 

Despite these past events, the two weeks together have been amazing and I want it back so bad. I had him with me all the time for two weeks and now I just feel very lonely. It feels like it was just a dream and I miss him so damn much that I felt pretty much incapacitated for about 2 hours after I got home. Will take a few days to find my feet or maybe longer. Now add to that also the fact that what if he’s been planning to just ghost me or break up with me after we got back from the holiday? Few days ago we mentioned me sleeping over at his place for the night when we get back so that I can just go home the next morning. But today he said he can drop me off tonight actually and did so, even though I really wanted to spend another night with him but I think he may have just wanted to get a really good sleep after the marathon drive? Had instances during the holiday where we woke each other tossing and turning at night. We did get closer on the drive today and he said he’ll “talk to me soon” and kissed me. I know he’s exhausted but what if he just said that and he won’t. I mean he did see some more, quite problematic sides of me that weren’t too attractive at all",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rynuxq/help/

I see absolutely no benefit or difference in guys that aren't tall vs guys that are tall in a relationship and I don't really understand how height has to be such a critical trait for attraction to the point that its nearly a deal breaker. I'm not even a short man either and I'm getting told i'm too short not even by tall women, but by short women like wtf? I was talking to some tall women and they get the same shit but in reverse, like tall men saying they're too tall when they're clearly shorter.

I soon start to catch feelings, and I ask her out. Of course she said ""no"" and things got akward and tense between us after i asked her out. Then during the break i see her post something to the tune of "" When you thought you had a friend but he was trying to get in your pants""

Now personally im uncomfortable towards sex since my last GF died, but that wasnt the impression i must have given her.

I met this girl here on Reddit a few months back over an idea I had for a drawing. We hit it off pretty well, and we still talk pretty much every day except for when we're busy.

I live in America and she lives in Germany. We've talked to each other via voice chat multiple times and we've shared our appearances with each other as well. One of the things we both like are the colors of sunsets so we like to share pictures of the sunset from our sides of the world with each other. She's also told me before that she thinks it's cute when I try to talk to her in German, and that I've made her blush several times.

About a week or so ago I ""tested the water"" so to speak, by flirting with her when I sent a picture I took of the sunset by saying, ""A beautiful picture for an equally beautiful girl..~~I'd say that in German if I knew how~~"", and her response was ""Hehe, wanna know how?"". She then proceeded to show me how to say the phrase in her language. 

The next day (December 24th) she gave me a drawing that she made for me as a Christmas gift.

Skipping a head to New Years Eve I took a picture of the sunset and wrote ""Happy New Years From America!"" on it, and sent it for her and her family. 

A little bit afterwards she said, ""Just saying, meeting you was one of the best things to happen to me in 2021."". Somewhat at a loss for words I said, ""That means a lot to me.""

**Here's the part that's actually relevant to the title:** 

 I've found myself falling for this girl, but I'm not sure if she shares any of those feelings. She used to go out of her way to greet me with ""Good morning"" or ""Guten Morgen"", but just stopped doing it out of nowhere a while back. 

Sometimes she'll also take a while to respond to a message, like a few hours, but I'd see her pop on for a bit and go back offline shortly after in between, which I assume is her talking to other online friends. I don't overtext, and once the ""ball is in her court"" I wait for her to respond, but I'm just confused...

The logical part of my brain says, ""If she wasn't interested in you, as friends or otherwise she wouldn't be talking to you.""

The pessimistic part of me says, ""Well if she was interested in you, she'd find time to respond sooner wouldn't she?"". 

Am I overanalyzing the entire situtation? Does she just like me as a friend, or could it be a bit more than that (however small)? Am I just being kept around for attention and should just move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryotez/met_a_girl_online_but_cant_really_tell_if_shes/

I have always moved fast with previous partners. Typically spending everyday with them until we move in, but my two relationships have lasted 3 and 4 years. 

I was looking on tinder and ended up matching with an old flame from freshman year of high school. He lives in Houston and I live in dallas. We grew up next door to eachother and our families still live there in dallas. 

We ended up talking for a month and he came to Dallas for Christmas. The night we met he spent the night and stayed over for 23 nights in a row. We met eachothers family multiple times. Spent Christmas with both families + new years. We met eachothers friends and communicate daily. I have total trust in him. 
We would move in together but he's finishing law school and I'm finishing my degree. We have a plan to move in once he graduates in a year and we will visit eachother every week or two (we live 3 hours apart). 
I'm afraid it won't work, but doesn't have any reason not to. We are perfectly compatible in every way. Phone sex is a daily fun activity and we both have planned visiting times. He also comes to Dallas for weeks over holidays and breaks. 

Any advice on how to make the most out of this relationship. We are very serious about making it work, but I don't want to waste my time. I might just be pessimistic. I do believe it will work, but I have no idea what issues will arise since I've never been in an LDR.

I really love her and so does she and we spend a lot of time together, she sleeps at my place for multiple days and i go sleep at hers and we're really happy together with minor arguments about outside stuff and not about us or eachother so i feel really safe around her and i wanna grow our relationship. We met in November on a dating site and went the extra step in December and ever since we either live together or talk on the phone.

Before meeting her i had a fwb which i stopped seeing even though she told me i shouldn't but i respected my feelings for her and honestly lost interest in anything else but her. She broke up in august with her ex of 2.5 years and  she seems really happy that she left him and even though he is clinging on her she told me that she couldn't care less and she even went out with another guy before meeting me and she didn't feel happy around him and she broke up with him around the time we met.
Things are moving fast between us and we both acknowledged it but we both feel really happy around eachother. I've been in a lot of relationships before and so did she but we agreed to stay as special friends.
She doesn't mind if i am sleeping with other girls but she told me that she'd be sad about it but she also told me that she doesn't want to sleep with other boys and i don't want to sleep with other girls either.

I'm the jealous type, and more than 3 boys talk to her who actually love her on a daily basis and I usually would be crazy about it but i trust her enough to not mind it at all, and it's making me question my sanity because it's a big step for me.

The problem is she is leaving in august for Erasmus and before that she has a uni trip of two weeks to another country and she will try to go on vacation also to another country where she had another situationship with a guy after she broke up with her ex.
She told me that the main reason she doesn't want us to date is because she wants to be free when she travels, she doesn't want someone to hold her down, she told me that she doesn't have in mind sleeping with someone else but she is not sure if she will end up doing it.
Her trips are a bit far but with everyday I'm spending with her I'm getting attached more and more and honestly i don't know what i can do.

I need her now in my life, not only because i am challenging my biggest change in my life (international student) but also because I'm the happiest when she is around.
She is also out my league but doesn't make me feel like this and according to her she was satisfied the most with me and i feel like she is.

I don't know what i want to hear and i don't know what to ask but i just wanted to talk about it.

I am lost and there are a few things I know I could do to better myself but getting to that point is always a struggle. I got on here to just put my thoughts down where maybe someone could see them. I guess I don't know who or if anyone will actually see this but at least it is out there. It all started when I was about 20 years old... I was in love with this girl her name was Katelyn, she was my high school sweetheart and we were a month away from getting married when I found out that she was cheating on me... that ended the wedding and started a downward spiral that I have been stuck in ever since. I am not sure how I can even get out of this whirlwind of disaster. I was so young and naive when she had cheated on me and it opened my eyes to a world of chaos. Where everywhere I look someone is doing something that isn't morally right, or innocent. There is so much chaos in the world and I feel like I am contributing to it. But after she cheated on me I haven't been able to find love, most likely because I don't love myself never have and never will. But, I find myself entangling myself into messy situations. I once was loved by this girl, her name was Taylor... and it wasn't perfect but she would of done anything for me and you know what I did... living with her for 2 years, I decided that I wasn't happy anymore so instead of just leaving I started cheating. For another 2 year I cheated on the girl who care about me the most. Someone who gave up everything to be with me. And I didn't choose her because I was stuck in the past and didn't know how to let the love I had for Katelyn go so I ruined 5 years of this girls life for me to be alone. If I would of just sat down and really thought about what I had I would of never left. I would of stayed with her forever because she was the best thing in the world. And I will forever regret this day, the day I left her for someone who didn't even give 2 shits about me.... after that moment I have ran into relationships that don't last because honestly I don't love myself... and that's probably the reason nobody stays now. And now I am faced with another decision... a decision where this girl cares about me alot and is perfect in every single way. But I just don't care about her the same way she cares about me. She is literally everything I have wanted and more but I am just not attracted to her as much as other people. And I feel like if I go down this path then I would either be settling and or end up hurting this girl in the long run. And all I want is to look at her and feel everything I have felt. The love, desire, that moment that you know she is the one for you. For now and and forever I want to feel that. And I don't... but I also think that you can develop feelings for people after awhile.

81,ryp5n4,1641609299,A Close Friend. Sh*t.,"So, a few days ago myself and one of my closest guy friends from college (high school for some) were talking and somehow the conversation got to dating and how hard it is etc. 
Then he mentioned how he doesn’t think he’s attractive so how the hell do I think he’s handsome (this guy is very classically attractive). 
So I say “There were 3 girls we both knew that had a crush on you.” 
Take a wild guess who one of them was. This girl right here. 
Anyway, we joke around and everything is normal, he doesn’t react negatively or anything. He makes the old “we would have been a power couple” but that’s it - he’s a little emotionally unavailable and neutral kinda guy. He also kept mentioning how he was immature and clueless (he really was, three girls having a crush on him and this man watched football highlights in history class) 
Fast forward to tonight, he’s out drinking (we’re both at university quite far away from each other) and he posts a photo of him and two girls. 
I say something along the lines of “you’re getting girls let’s gooo” You know, how friends do. 
He replies with “No!!” and “It could be you!!” He’s clearly drunk. 
What do I do? He wants to hang out because we haven’t seen each other for almost 2 years and we used to see each other almost everyday. 
I don’t know how to approach this. 
I really don’t want to ruin our friendship if anything goes wrong - a Marianne and Connell situation is not ideal.

What is the most strategic way to go about asking if she is still interested? I wouldn’t be worrying about this if I just wanted something casual, but she seems smart and is definitely very pretty

93,rypw2v,1641611526,How do you ask a girl how many men she’s been with without offending her?,"Look I’m not a sexist, nor do I think that women lose value based off of the amount of men they sleep with. I don’t think any of that pair bond shit is true either.

Im just an average guy with average, “equipment”. I’m a virgin but I highly doubt I’ll be one of those guys who is super talented in bed and can give mind blowing sex. I know that’s just not going to be me.

The only solace is that 90% of guys are also not that and a lot of that 90% won’t even take the time to try to learn.

If I’m with a girl with a low body count, chances are she hasn’t had anything better that what I could do. If I’m with a girl with a body count of 30 chances are at least one of those guys was able to blow her mind. Now I’m left in the dust and will never be able to live up to the standard he set for her. Sex just won’t be remarkable and I’m terrified of being settled for sexually.

I want to be able to ask a girl if she has a high or low body count for this reason. I however know better than to just do that as it’ll offend. So is there a way for me to be able to do this without offending?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rypw2v/how_do_you_ask_a_girl_how_many_men_shes_been_with/
94,rypzbt,1641611817,"Went on 1 date, now he wants me to fly out and visit him…","I (24F) met this guy (27M) on Hinge and went on one date. It was a great date that lasted 7 hours, we kissed a lot, and it was hard saying goodbye. He was in town visiting his parents but he actually lives in a different state. He went back to his city and we’ve just been texting since. This was 2 weeks ago. He asked me if I’d fly out and spend a weekend with him. I told him I’d love to but I will think about it since that’s a lot of $ to spend right now. He said we can pick a weekend that works best for both of us and I can stay at his house. 

I’ve never experienced something like this. Since he invited me should he pay for my ticket? Is this a red flag? Is it too soon to do something like this? I like the idea of it, I just am nervous since we only went on 1 date. Yes it was amazing but I don’t even know what we’d do for a whole weekend together. He said he’d take me all these different places and it’s exciting, I’m just not sure yet and I need advice. 

I want to go but I can’t afford a plane ticket right now but I think that would be weird to tell him. Is that a turn off?

Should I ask him to come back to my city for the weekend? 

I need advice please :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rypzbt/went_on_1_date_now_he_wants_me_to_fly_out_and/
95,ryq1hl,1641612017,Confronted guy I’m dating about paying for dates,"So to give a synopsis, me and this guy that I have been seeing have been dating for about a month. He knows that I am on disability for a connective tissue disorder (ehlers danlos) and therefore live on a low income every month. He explained early on that the type of relationship he agrees with is more traditional early on. Given my situation, a more traditional relationship would suit me as well. He is a teacher, so he doesn’t make a ton of money but mentioned thinking about a career change. At first he payed for dates. I have never gone on a date where a guy has ever asked me to pay for my meal. If a guy did this I would think that he is not in a position to be dating yet. I am old fashioned in that sense and I feel like taking a woman out to dinner and holding doors is the few chivalrous things left that men can do to make a woman feel special. Plus until women are payed equally and men put as much as an effort into grooming themselves for a date, I think it’s only fair. I don’t really want to get into an argument about this here, and people are allowed to have a relationship run on their terms between two consulting adults. 

I felt that this guy misrepresented himself after saying things like “men should be providers” and things of that nature, when he started acting very low effort as weeks progressed. He loved that I was a good cook and I noticed that he would often text me “making anything good for dinner?” And if I was making something he liked, he would invite himself over, “I’ll stop by after work”. He ended up doing this four or five times a week and when he did he would often eat second helpings of my food. I told my friend about it and how this guy recently also told me that he lost 100 lbs. My friend warned me that this guy seemed to be taking advantage and was only interested in me for what I can do for him, and that he probably thought “jackpot” when he found a woman who was good at cooking since he clearly has loved eating. My friend said “he wants a woman who can be his personal cook and can fuck him too”. At this point we had already had sex. I told the guy that it would be nice if he was going to come over so often if he could contribute to my food expenses for dinners since I live on a disability income. He said “oh I didn’t even think of that. Sure”. But I still was annoyed that he didn’t offer in the first place  and acted like he hadn’t even thought that making tons of food cost money . That comes across as someone who is interested in what they can get out of people .So far since we have been dating I have spent more money on food for us than him and I’m on disability. 

For Christmas, even though we have only been dating a little over a month I noticed that I spent more on his gift than he spent on mine. He bought me candy and a coffee mug , about $10. I spent about $30 on him. 

Yesterday he asked if I wanted Chinese food and I said sure . He said ok wanna split it ? I instantly got turned off and I snapped and said “so what happened to mr.provider? you say things like men should be providers etc”. He replied and said jokingly “I identify as gender fluid, plus you won’t be my girlfriend yet”. I instantly thought what does me being his girlfriend have anything to do with it ? I thought he was making an excuse. If anything in my experience men try harder to impress women before they become their girlfriend. The fact that he’s not trying from the start seems like a red flag. I almost wanted to say “well I’m not ready to be your girlfriend, but since you think that you should only pay for dates if I’m your girlfriend then maybe I should be only having sex with you when I’m your girlfriend too”. I refrained from saying this however.

Having dated very wealthy men who wouldn’t even bat an eye about paying for a dinner, this is A huge turn off for me. But it’s not just that. It’s the fact that he was trying to eat all of someone’s food on disability! And the Christmas gift made me feel like I wasn’t important to him. $10 is nothing. Part of his gift was Reese’s pieces and dollar store candy lol. Please tell me I am not wrong to be turned off by this behavior and I should just pull the plug lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryq1hl/confronted_guy_im_dating_about_paying_for_dates/

97,ryqb2w,1641612871,Is he truthful or lying?,"So there was this guy ( M 28), i am  ( F 22)  , i just knew newly last august and i was freshly out of a 6 month long abusive and toxic relationship , honestly i moved on pretty quickly since why would i be sad from being free 
Anyways after few weeks of being friends , we confessed there is some feelings , i offered we could be in a relationship , he said okay but if we didn't make it please promise me we'll stay friends..
3 months later he suddenly says he doesn't have romantic feelings for me anymore and its better if we just stayed friends , i cried , he cried and we hugged each other he promised me nothing will change and he will still care deeply about me and he still loves me a friend 
The thing is as months goes by if i mention other guys that are interested in me , he seems jealous a little 
He doesn't initiate hugs with his female friends but with me he kinda initiates and hugs me really warmly and tightly ..
sometimes when he drops me off he hugs me a really long hug while his head is resting on my shoulder 
He met new girls during a group trip but is never interested 
Even after the break up we never stopped talking.
3 days ago i asked him if he has feelings for me , he denied , he said im one of his most closest friends , like his closest male friend and that he loves me the way he loves him ( similar to siblings love)..
I asked him if its because of his stressful life or because he havent found a girl with chemistry yet , he replied with the second option 
Yet after all that , his actions are not so friendly 
Like today he was with me helping me study he would always carass me or carass my thighs (not in a sexual way )  in public 
And he doesn't mind if i held his hands interlocked 
So are we friends and he doesnt have feelings like hes saying 
Or hes lying? Or because there are some stress going on ? or he feels he won't be responsible enough to take a serious step so hes friendzoning me so i would give up? 
Ps: he asked me if i have feelings again , i obviously denied and replied with no ofc we're friends lol cause im scared he'll leave 

Td;lr : im confused wether my ex who is my most close  best friend now Have feelings like me or not?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryqb2w/is_he_truthful_or_lying/

99,ryqikl,1641613545,My online date has been very distant the past few days,"I have been talking to a guy online for about 5 months. The past few days he has been pretty distant. Getting increasingly distant by the day. He was planning to come visit me in a little over a week and even took time off of work but I’m not sure what will happen now. Most of his texts are emojis or one word answers. He is less inquisitive now. He doesn’t say good morning much, doesn’t ask me questions, and has even gotten less sexual. 

I’m not sure if he got cold feet or what. I was a little conflicted about whether it was a good idea to have him come up since my family will be out of town. Maybe he just wanted to come up for sex and decided it’s not worth it since I made it clear we could only do dates in public and I don’t want to get too physical. I am not sure if I should bring it up or just let it go.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryqikl/my_online_date_has_been_very_distant_the_past_few/
