1,oo3n4q,1626792970,I had a weird date last night [30/M] / [30/F],"I had a date with a girl I used to text on AIM with back when I was 14. We didn't talk for a decade or so, she got married. She's been divorced for two months after being married for 10 years.

Anyway, we meet at her place for a drink. It was fun. We then go to a bar and get food. She's playing with me and pushing me some and I can tell she's having fun.

I invite her over to my place and she loves my cat, I play her some piano, but then she started saying over and over I am too serious? Like I contemplate and think too much during conversation?

I guess I can come across as being nervous sometimes on a first date. The odd part here was I think because me and this girl knew each other for so long, especially during our teenage years, we had false ideas of each other built up in our heads. She told me I wasn't exactly what she pictured. That I was much more ""grown up"" then she thought.

We ended up kissing some, foreplay got a little heated, but I felt like neither of us were really into it. I took her home and I think we both were pretty disappointed we didn't have sex. I said goodnight and I was so tired I stumbled out the words ""hope you have a good night"" and she said back sarcastically after kissing me ""you're so romantic"" and it was awkward. I still haven't heard anything back from her today.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo3n4q/i_had_a_weird_date_last_night_30m_30f/

I am a very independent person (26F) who likes my space, but often I find it difficult to find compatible men. My busy job, interest in pursuing my own hobbies, and chronic illness (fibromyalgia) add to my need for recovery time between social activities.

I am self-aware enough to realize that I have a somewhat avoidant attachment style- I‚Äôm perfectly fine with only seeing a person I‚Äôm dating once a week, find very serious romantic overtures kind of cringy, and often feel very ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù about relationships in their early stages. I get lots of interest, but men have a tendency to become very clingy, very fast for some reason. Wanting to text all the time and see me 3+ times a week after only a couple dates. I often feel that many men I have dated don‚Äôt have their own social lives outside of the girls they date! Relationships with family and friends and my one longer past relationship (ended because of a move) are/have been perfectly functional with this need for space, but although I can get a date, I often end things early on because I can‚Äôt cope with giving someone so much of my energy and attention, and begin to to feel suffocated.

Can any introverts or slightly avoidant people give me hope? Anyone have a relationship where you give each other your own space for hobbies and rest but come together to do fun things? 

Is this a normal need for space or will it continue to impact my dating prospects?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo4b53/dating_as_a_person_who_needs_space/

I am pretty new to this whole ‚Äúdating‚Äù thing and needed some advice for this girl that I have been seeing for about a month now. 

It all started on Bumble, I saw her profile and she had a picture with Steve Carrel and thought to myself ‚ÄúWow i‚Äôm a huge fan of the office, this could be a great talking point‚Äù. So long story short, we start messaging and I happen to mention to her how my favorite episode is when Michael gets gum stuck in his hair and Dwight uses peanut butter and covers his hair to get out the gum. She laughed and said ‚Äúthat is one of my favorite episodes as well‚Äù. Then we go on our first date to a bar, and I thought it would be a funny joke to bring a jar of peanut butter and say I got gum stuck in my hair and she laughed and we continued on with a normal conversation. I walked her home, gave her my jar of peanut butter and went on my way. 

A week or so passes and she texts me asking to go out for a 2nd date, we go grab dinner at this nice Italian place and she brings the peanut butter. She gives it back to me and laughs ‚ÄúI only came to give you back your Jif Extra Chunky PB‚Äù. I felt uncomfortable as to if she only wanted to see me again because of the peanut butter. But, I put it behind me and went on with the night. 

This is where things start to get weird, I asked her if she wants to come to my parents beach house for the weekend and she said she will only come if I bring the peanut butter. I thought it was a joke and responded ‚Äúyes of course lol‚Äù. Then when she arrives at my parents house she asked me where it was and I responded ‚ÄúI thought it was a joke‚Äù and then she storms out and tells me that she never wants to see me again. 

This has left me very distraught, was she only dating me for the extra chunky PB I had? Or is she just playing an even bigger joke on me that I am just not understanding.

Then I start texting her again that Saturday. Surprisingly completely unplanned I go out to a bar that night, and I bump into her. Things were going really well, she mentioned how she thought it was so sweet how I asked her for coffee since she felt like every guy was after a hookup on tinder. Then we hit it off really well, and we ended up staying at my place. That night I didn‚Äôt try to make a move on her since she was really drunk. But then the next morning we started making out and one thing led to another, and as we were about to have sex I just went completely soft and couldn‚Äôt get it back up. I explained to her that I was a virgin so I guess I had anxiety with going through with it.  Then shortly after her friend came to pick her up but we talked about meeting for coffee in a couple days like we planned originally.

Then I texted her a few hours later saying I had a good time and that she also forgot her earrings at my place and then she found it funny and then I told her that I can give it to her on our date, to which I never got a response. Then the next day (today) I decided to text again asking if we‚Äôre still on for today and still no response.

I‚Äôm curious is the reason she‚Äôs ghosting me is because she thinks I‚Äôm another one of those guys that is after one thing, and even though it seemed like I did try to hook up with her, I actually wanted to date her from the start it‚Äôs just that things got a little too intimate too fast.

I‚Äôm just wondering if I should just forget about it as it is, or should I wait a couple of days and say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I moved things too fast or if I made you uncomfortable‚Äù, but at this point I‚Äôm guessing she doesn‚Äôt care about getting her earrings back either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo5z4a/is_it_too_late_and_i_screwed_things_up/

I‚Äôm well aware that everyone knows of this but I‚Äôm hoping this could raise clarity for someone experiencing a ghosting as I have recently.

- no1: if you met them once or not at all then it simply doesn‚Äôt matter

- no2: they‚Äôre going through some deep shiz, but in this case they‚Äôll come around and let you know what happened

- no3: perhaps you took the wrong steps and ended the attraction whether it was neediness, lack of confidence or completely wrecked things by showing aggression or a lack of empathy (my personal situation was neediness paired with a lack of confidence) the best you can do is move forward and do things that will attract other people, make the most of yourself with a proper mindset

- no4: they left you for someone else, you‚Äôll probably see the proof of this soon enough if it‚Äôs true and I pity the guy/girl dating the person you were if they just turned their back on you like that, they‚Äôll do this to anyone and they reek of insecurities

- no5: you know did everything you could but this person still left without at least telling you anything, they have the right to like anyone they choose but you have a right to know wtf happened, don‚Äôt stress it because in this case the trash took itself out

No3 can get confused with No5 which creates a conundrum but for me I know I could‚Äôve approached the person that was interested in me with more confidence and focusing more on my life rather than texting them so much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo7ysf/on_the_subject_of_getting_ghosted/

50,oo9em5,1626809977,Ghosted," A few weeks ago, I (F25) met a (M33) guy through Bumble. We had an intense connection and everything felt so natural between us, as if we had known each other our whole lives. 

He asked me on an initial dinner date after talking for a week, then cancelled that afternoon saying he was going to a family event that will run over. That should have been a red flag but I told him it was okay things happen. That evening, I told him since he cancelled on our date why don't we just go for a walk later on once he was done with his family even and we did. 

As soon as we met in person it was like sparks. We spent a lot of time with each other and he said he liked me and wanted to get to know me better. After 2 weeks of hanging out, we were watching a movie at his home and since it was so late I slept over. 

We were making out and he was feeling me up and so I suggested escalating it, and he responded that we should just cuddle because he wanted to wait. Which I respected and found to be very kind. He drove me home that night and then ghosted me. 

During our last night in bed, I told him I felt him putting away and asked why. He said that we were spending so much time together and he did not expect that. He also felt we were moving too fast. 

I told him we could slow down and go at a pace which he felt comfortable. 

After not hearing from him when I sent him the thank you the day text. I gave him space, then 2 weeks past and I still had not heard from him, so I texted him asking if he was ok. No response‚Ä¶ then a few days pasted and I got upset and I called him 3x times and texted him telling him that it was fucked up.

What would have meshed with this?","As a preface I'm not bitter at all, and she was actually very nice.  We went out twice and met on Bumble.  Without a better way to word this, she was extremely good looking and pretty young.  I think I was solely attracted to her looks.  I think her profile said she was 29.  Even though she's a "" misses big shot'' lawyer, I think she was not making too much money.  She had roommates, drove a beater, and had student loans out the butt.

Each time we hung out she would solely talk about work.  I mean in details about criminal cases.  She is a public defender.  Both of my parents work in the legal field, so I was able to keep up with the conversation at least somewhat.

I remember secretly thinking ""Well if she wants to talk about filing some motion trying to get guys sentence reduced, I guess we'll talk about that.""

""If she wants to talk about some weird case she read in law school, I guess we'll talk about that.""

""If she wants to talk about how the real money is outside of criminal law, I guess we'll talk about that.""

""If she wants to talk about staying in court till 9 pm last Friday since the judge moves like cold syrup, I guess we can talk about that.""

Now I'm aware I'm probably not the best conversation partner.  I would try to change the subject to something more light hearted / cutesy, but then the convo would inevitably go back to her time in law school / court.

So here's my question.  What would have meshed with that?  Like... what could I have done differently?

I hope I worded that right.  To use an analogy it's like you go over your buddies house, and all he wants to do is watch Star Trek the whole day.  You agree, but then he boots you out saying ""dude you're boring.""  I'm just thinking I'M JUST DOING WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO!

My biggest mistake is being vague about it. ""Are you free this week?"" ""Want to go for coffee sometime?"". The reason I do this is because I don't know her schedule and I don't want to pick a day that she won't be free. I'm kind of waiting for her to say ""sure, I'm free on this day"" but instead it goes all awry. 

So, I have to pick a specific day, a specific time, and a specific place. But I don't want to blurt out ""Hi let's meet for coffee at 7:30 pm tomorrow okay thanks bye!"" and come across intense or overly persistent. and I also don't want to be like ""wanna do something sometime?"" because then I'll seem vague and less confident.

62,ooak2k,1626813448,How to prepare for after the honeymoon/ cute love phase?,"
Hello all, 


So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a solid almost 8 months now and to say we‚Äôre madly in love with one another is an understatement. My intentions are to eventually marry her and in the next year or so if everything goes to plan and start a new life together filled with love and happiness! I can‚Äôt imagine not ever being madly in love with her! 

Currently after almost 8 months the two of us are what most would refer to as the puppy love/ cute love/honeymoon stage etc‚Ä¶ 

To say that the two of us are all over each other and absolutely crazy for the other would be a definite understatement and I think we‚Äôre building a solid foundation for what truly lies ahead! 

In my opinion, we‚Äôve already gotten ridiculously comfortable each other, our communication level is really strong in my opinion, we love each other for who we truly are, and we overcome obstacles pretty easy as of now. 

All of this being said, much to my disappointment and fear, I realize this phase isn‚Äôt destined to last forever and alas there will be a day where the two of us aren‚Äôt simply all over each other and crazy as we once were. To be completely honest, I get anxious thinking about it as I don‚Äôt truly know what to expect. Additionally how do we as a unit navigate these waters so we don‚Äôt jeopardize what the two of us have been building for? I‚Äôve never experienced even this far into a relationship let alone the phase where the two of you grow apart. 

Is there anything we could be doing now in the lovey phase that can help us in the next phase of our relationships? Any tips, recommendations, ideas? Also what can I expect to encounter possibly along the way? 

Also any stories you‚Äôve experienced along the way would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks again!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ooak2k/how_to_prepare_for_after_the_honeymoon_cute_love/

64,ooax6r,1626814569,I‚Äòm autistic and have the feeling that no one will ever want me,"I (18M) am autistic and have depression. I‚Äôm from Switzerland so I‚Äôd like to apologize for potential mistakes.

I‚Äòve never dated anyone and I don‚Äòt think I‚Äòve flirted with anyone either. I‚Äòm mostly pretty lonely and have left school because of my bad mental health. I‚Äòve been staying at home since last February and I‚Äòll be starting a new school in August. During this time I only talked to a few people; my parents, my psychologist and rarely some other family members and I‚Äòve been feeling really lonely lately. It‚Äòs also the first time ever that I wanted a romantic relationship. I feel as though I want someone who I can share my emotions with, I can hug, love and trust and who shares these feelings and who shares their emotions with me as well and who loves me and all of that. I hope you understand what I‚Äòm trying to say. I just want someone to want me. Anyways, these feelings are pretty new to me and I actually appreciate them because the emotional numbness seems to fade at least a little bit. I‚Äòve also been taking a SSRI for 5 days now but that has yet to take effect which is normal. I hope it can at least help me to get more positive emotions and more mental drive and motivation.

While this has a positive side it also has a negative one. Now I have a feeling that no one will ever want me. I‚Äòm quite short (1.70m) and pretty skinny (I only weigh around 55kg). I also have a really bad posture. My mom tells me sometimes that I walk like the hunchback of notre dame. Often I feel like an alien around people and I feel as though I have nothing in common with them. I have pretty bad theory of mind and often I have no idea how other people perceive me and my actions although I try my best not to hurt anyone. I try to be as nice as possible to other people but I never know whether someone is interested in what I‚Äôm saying or not. So I might come across as selfish although I try not to be that. Social cues fly over my head. I also have no special skills, neither in the arts nor in science or any other field. My social understanding reaches that far that I understand that I‚Äòm not entitled to a relationship and that it is on me to find a partner. That‚Äòs not that far imo. As a coping mechanism I hug my stuffed animals and have imaginary girlfriends.

So who would want me? Obviously I‚Äòm still young and I haven‚Äòt lost hope however I find it hard to imagine that there could be someone who says: ‚ÄûI love this person‚Äú in relation to me. I‚Äòve read that working out is a good idea however I‚Äòve been at a gym at my old school and it really bored me so now I try running in the woods everyday (6-10km everyday // depends on my mood). And I also read that one should be ‚Äûworking on themselves‚Äú but I don‚Äòt think I really understand what this means. Could anyone please explain what this could mean, especially in my case? And how do I talk to other people as I‚Äòm very socially awkward and quite anxious as well (I never really talked to people in school // only the teachers after the lessons because I liked them)? Like, how do I initiate a conversation, maintain it and progress if I‚Äòm talking to a girl I like in a romantic way without feeling as though I‚Äòm falling through a hole in the ground and dissociating? There may not be a general ‚Äûrecipe‚Äú for this but tips would still be appreciated. 
And last but not least: Can anyone relate this? Some empathy would be appreciated as well as I‚Äòm quite lonely and a bit sad :) .

While being in one of the shops, I spotted my ex. We broke like a year ago, but we broke up, because we didn't talk, what I need in a relationship. We didn't communicate enough... so I spotted her and we made eye contact a couple of times. When we made eye contact, I felt something in my chest. And I remembered all the memories I had with her. So when I got home, I checked her IG profile and she was posting some dudes, so I stalked them (what is weird thing to do for me, since I'm not that kind of person). And I thought, maybe I didn't got over her and I missed her? But the thing is, that when she was in a relationship w another guy, she DM'd me. We chatted for a bit and that's it. Well, that DM was a bit random :Ddddd so here's the thing. Right now, I'm spending some time with another girl, but I still remember her and I have this feeling in my chest, which I can't get when I'm around with that new girl. So my question is, what should I do? Do I still have feelings for her?

70,oob4cr,1626815162,Why do guys only want to be my (30/f) friend?,"This is the third time this has happened in the past year, that a guy I‚Äôve been attracted to has asked me to meet up and hang out for drinks and stuff, and then it turns out he just thinks I‚Äôm awesome and cool and wants to be best buddies. I‚Äôm wondering what I could be doing wrong. 

With the latest guy, we have so many things in common, fantastic conversation, we laugh and have loads of fun, and then he ends up talking about the girl he just started dating (and all the doubts he has about her, like that she‚Äôs not into what he‚Äôs into and definitely doesn‚Äôt want the things in life that he definitely wants, etc etc). I‚Äôm there like, oh good, another guy who wants to be my best friend and tell me all his dating woes. 

The time before, it was a mutual friend and I really thought there was a strong attraction there and that something was going to happen (I actually asked about it here). Eventually I got tired of not knowing and asked him what the deal was, and he said he was so flattered and thought it was ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù that I put myself out there, but saw me as a friend. (Months later we got really drunk and some sexual stuff happened, so I‚Äôm still confused about that one because I think he is attracted to me, but I‚Äôm apparently only good enough for a one night stand I guess. We‚Äôre still friends, we hang out very regularly.)

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm unattractive. I‚Äôve dated lots of people, had what I consider to be a normal number of serious relationships, but the last year I‚Äôve been single I‚Äôve not had much luck. I‚Äôve been on a few dates, not been really drawn to any of them, and only from the apps, nothing organic.

What‚Äôs wrong with me?!

I am fit (I lift weights and am curvy/strong so I know it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I‚Äôm not at all manly, I have a small waist and feminine curves). I‚Äôm always getting compliments on my long hair, my clear skin, my style. I‚Äôve worked on myself a ton and am mentally healthy, fun to be around, successful in my career, great social life. 

But it feels like every guy who I am attracted to and would like to date just sees me as a friend or a bro or something. They tell me I‚Äôm hilarious, intelligent, interesting, kind. I‚Äôm kind of sick of being those things to be honest. I love my male friends and I‚Äôm glad they like me as a person, but I don‚Äôt want to be some sexless buddy forever. I want someone wonderful to fall the fuck in love with me. And I feel like nobody is seeing what I have to offer.

My first serious relationship was when i was 20, and that was a crap show. I didn‚Äôt know how love was, and i had two abusive step dads growing up, so i just took all of the b.s that happened because ‚Äúi loved her‚Äù. She was controlling and tried to isolate me from my friends as much as possible (I even had a curfew !!!). The relationship didn‚Äôt last too long, especially since she graped me (yes dudes can be graped; no she never had my consent, i woke up to her on top of me and i was too weak from being drunk to push her off of me, and she never stopped even though i begged).

After that i dated someone who started off nice (we were friends first) and she said she had an abusive ex as well; we bonded over that and eventually started dating. She really helped me get started in my career, so i was loyal to her. Eventually, i noticed a lot of lies and deceit. She also began to exhibit the same behaviors as the previous person, but i honestly just thought that that is what a relationship was like. Eventually i left her after some gold digging (she claimed that she did uber, but the landlords always saw her come right back to the house not long after leaving). She then proceeded to tell anyone who would listen that i graped her in front of my nephew (I DON‚ÄôT HAVE A NEPHEW). But, I‚Äôm a muscle bound intimidating black guy and she was a tiny little Asian women, no one believed anything from my side until months (with some people YEARS) later they noticed inconsistencies in the story, plus she claimed the guy she dated after me (who she used to beat on, i later learned) did the same exact things as me. 

After her i dated a lady who honestly was a great person until a year into our relationship she cheated on me repeatedly. The dude she cheated with is a friend of mine now and we get beers sometimes.

We went for a pretty long walk today and she seems more distant than usually. She is an extrovert but now she is almost silent. Even me as an introvert finds it slightly uncomfortable. She says she feels off and I can see that. With that said, we had a pretty amazing date today. We went eating breakfast together and I did most of the flirting. I saw her sitting there staring in my direction and her eyes were just blank, like she wasnt even there. I asked her about it and she told me she was about to have a panic attack. But we walked around for a good while, lied on the grass a little while I played her some music. Gave her a massage until she got stressed out and wanted to walk again. She invited me in to her appartment and we chilled a little in the couch. She managed to have a decent conversation then. Guess she is more comfortable at home. After a few hours break we went for a late evening walk and decided to sit at a lake, dipping our toes in the water. She suggested we take a bath. I just told her ""you first"". After about 10 minutes of thinking she stripped her clothes off and jumped into the lake. I did the same thing. I was really thinking that if I was going to kiss her it was right there but she didnt go in too deep. I was in the middle of the lake by the time she was in. And she got freezing cold. And a bunch of guys hopped in and ruined the moment anyways. She got ashamed and put her clothes back on. So we walked home and got a new date tomorrow. I was in love with her 2 weeks ago but seeing her being this distant and emotionally unavailable scares me. I want to committ but she doesnt seem ready.

I do look really good for my age and I am in really good shape which certainly helps -- but I'm thinking about giving up on younger men for the following reasons (only based on my personal experience of course):

* Some younger men are genuinely into older women and have always dated older women (which is what I prefer) -- but many younger men seem to be interested in me only because they couldn't get the younger woman they wanted
* Since I'm older they figure I will do a lot of the kinky stuff that younger women won't do -- which is true to some extent BUT if it's the only reason they want to be with me (which is often the case) then it's basically a turnoff
* Immaturity -- this is probably the main reason -- a lot of younger men don't demonstrate much consideration or common courtesy so I basically have no choice but to drop them.  
* Default Booty Call -- a fair amount of these younger guys also drop me i.e. ghosting but then of course I hear from them 2-3 months later when whatever other prospects they were chasing fall through and they want to get laid.

I'm not unattractive. I rated myself a 6.5 and girl friends told me I'm more than that. I get compliments from time to time (eyes etc). A fun and beautiful girl I had a date (and more) with told me my baldness also has a rugged masculine look to it. She says that with hair (picture) I looked like a typical fuckboy/prettyboy.

I guess that is where the problem is.. 
In high school when I still had hair I had a lot of succes both on dating apps and irl. 
The few matches I get now, however, are with a few exceptions very low quality and they barely put in effort. IRL I can't judge because the lockdowns prevent proper socialising. A cute girl I had a great time with did ask my ig at a bar a while ago so IRL I still ""have it"" I guess.. 

I have a feeling this lack of matches is because im bald and while irl personality, confidence etc have a greater effect, online to swipe only looks matter. 

And i notice that with the girl friends I have, all the guys they swoon over on dating apps look like that typical fuckboy I was talking about (with that fluffy full head of hair). 

Should I just give up? It's honestly affecting me quite a bit.

Thanks and have a nice day ^^",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oodn56/23m_and_bald_should_i_give_up_on_dating_apps/

I'm a 28 year old African American male, back towards the end of 2019 I had just got out of a close to 3 year relationship.

One thing I've noticed for a long time when it comes to dating is that I've never been able to date a woman I actually like, my standards are not super high, I go for fairly cute girls, some girls I consider to be cute my friends don't agree with, but even then, I get turned down all the time.

I've been told I'm not a bad looking guy on numerous occasions, but every girl that I'm attracted to and interested in, I never get a chance, my ex was the only one that gave me a shot.

Every other girl either rejected me, or tried to friendzone me, it's gotten to a point where on a few nights laying in bed,  I considered giving up on dating altogether. I've found myself thinking what's the point liking this girl or being attracted to her? There's been times where I see a girl I like and I do absolutely nothing, because again I ask myself what's the point? Crazy thing about this, is that I have good conversation, and I can sometimes get a phone number, or social media, but after that it's usually nothingness. What should I do? I want to have a family one day, I shouldn't be having high school troubles in my dating life at this point, it's very frustrating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oodpen/need_advice_from_the_fellas/
