2,qcn7jw,1634805143,Women of Idaho seem to dislike bigger men,"I've lived in this area all my life (29M) and my confidence in myself feels depleted. I never seem to ever get a girl interested in me. Going through HS I used to have girls talk to me all the time about their personal problems (mostly their previous relationships) and whenever I tried to make a move I get instantly friend zoned or the ""I'm not interested in dating"". Then I'll see a friend of mine hooking up a few days later with these women I've talked too. Towards my last year I shot my shot with someone and we happened to connect. I fell in love cause it was the only thing I knew at the time I would ever achieve. After a couple years I proposed to her then an unfortunate even lead me to leave her behind as I had to go to jail for 4 months. In the time span she cheated on me with my supposed best friend and my cousin. These men are alot more muscular and toned then I was. Literally could have any girl they want and I've seen countless girls literally throw themselves at them. Made me very envious and frustrated that I never received the same attention. She kept this as a secret for 8 years then confessed to me at the beginning of this year. I've tried dating apps. Tried talking to some other women I've known growing up and I still get the same results as I did in highschool. I feel like women in this area hate bigger men entirely and I understand completely. But what I'm frustrated of hearing is how they are out there and they would love to be with someone like me. I just don't see it whatsoever. My confidence is pretty ruined from the knowing of what has happened to me. I'm on a full steam hype train to get fit and healthier because I feel like big guys are totally last place to have any loving or faithfulness. I just want to know what it's like to get attention like these built men I knew. I've never understood or felt the attention that they would constantly receive. I've always felt like their personalities sucked ass cause they knew they were always going to get attention no matter what. They way women would treat them and look at them in their eyes are looks I've never received ever in my life. I've made alot of progress on my fitness journey but the pain still lingers. I feel like I'll always hold fat shame and never trust anyone. Just wanted to know how other women out there feel about someone like me? I love the sport of boxing so I'm drilling myself with alot of boxing exercises and training. That's the type of body I hope to achieve one day.

3,qcne49,1634805969,Relationship Attachment Style,"I know in order to get a proper analysis, it's important to go to a licensed psychologist and get tested under clinical conditions but for now, getting that done is difficult. So I won't blindly rely on and take comments here as absolute truth, but it will help me learn more about my attachment style.  


To give you a context, I have had a good relationship with my parents. They're happily married and I'm the only child so I've been pampered a lot. However, in order to provide a good life for me, they worked long hours, with me seeing them just 2 hours a day ever since I was  5-6 years old. It made me grow so used to being alone, that I started keeping thoughts to myself and have become somewhat of a big introvert.  


I can be an extrovert when I want to, I can mingle around people and do small talk, but I can't really do the deep feelings kind of stuff. I've had some great friendships (of 5+years) which I just broke off. I still can't pinpoint as to what made me cut if off, but I just straight-up ghosted. And the biggest regret I have is it didn't make me feel bad. I was more guilty of the fact that I could end it so easily.   


However, I'm the exact opposite when it comes to romantic relationships. I've never had a relationship last longer than 6 months and I've seen a pattern. I start off cool, take time to develop my interest but over time I get clingy. It often leads to mismatched expectations and eventual breakup.   
Even a 6-month relationship ending hurts me more than 5/6 years of friendship which I broke off so easily.  


I'll go into therapy once I start earning but for now, well I don't really know what to do and how.

Yes, I get the whole argument that “I won them anyways, so why even worry!” That’s the point. I’m sick of having to ‘win’ them over because of my race - not because I’m out of shape, not because I’m unattractive, but because my skin color is a few shades too dark.

Now, 2.5 years on, I would love to have a someone in my life, but I feel as though my situation is quite a turn off. The payments are high, the rent is astronomical, the child support payments are high, and I have 5 of 6 kids stay with me 4 or more night a fortnight. I'm also in the midst of a massive weight loss effort (my fault entirely for letting myself get fat, but I'm putting in the work, and results are happening- albeit the weight is coming off much slower than it went on).

Am I dreaming that I could find someone who is willing to partner up with a man that has so much baggage? Do I give up and resign myself to the single life?

I try to be a decent guy, and I work hard to be positive. The demons in my head are telling me there is no point. A date that I can afford at the moment is a picnic on the beach, or a walk along the water front. A gift means a bunch of flowers I picked from the neighbors garden when they aren't looking.

Back story: we have known each other for 10 years when I first lived in the same town as him. His mom and I are pretty close as well because she’s known me as long as I have known him. He and I have mused about maybe wanting a future with one another and have not labeled our relationship. 
Skip to current day, still no label. However, I got asked on a date. I feel like I might be an asshole for asking this, but should I tell him? Would this open the door for the chance to label our relationship? Or should I just say yes to the date? This date would be with another acquaintance-friend that I actually live closer to, and I am bi, so this date would be with a girl (my first date with a girl since publicly coming out as well). But the guy I have been talking to that lived across the country is literally such a sweetheart and treats me so much better than any other guys I have dated, and he cares about my family and actually remembers what I tell him.

18 yo dude at college, nerdy and not a complete pile of shit in terms of looks, I am attractive enough yet there is one thing I lack: Experience. Yes, I never had a gf and it's something I thought it would be about damn time to change. 

So in the last month or so I developed a crush on another student at college, we had some talks, chats and I soon realized that not only did we share interests but also that I actually liked her a lot. Now it ain't the first time that this is happening, I have had several crushes throughout high school but out of cowardice, I never did anything. But yesterday I thought to myself: not this time. So I hyped myself up and gathered every last ounce of bravery I could find and asked her whether she wants to meet up anytime soon. I didn't go into detail all that much, because I didn't want to overdo it and leave the next step to her. 

Now I don't know what it was, whether it was too early, too late or something else, but now I'm being ghosted. It has been almost a day since I messaged her and I know that she must have seen it, out of experience with her writing behaviour and because I saw her online.

About a week later, she calls me and says “hey, I want to make sure we are still going as I have another trip that week and was invited by a male friend that I will cancel.” I said to her “why didn’t you tell me?” Her response? “Because I’m a popular girl!”

Bruh, that came across so disrespectful. I have had her on ice (not answering her calls or texts) for several days. The audacity. Put it to me straight. Am I overreacting? Is she trying to make me jealous (which won’t work because I will walk first before fighting over a female)? Is she trying to get rid of me? Is she trying to make it se like she has options and want me to chase her (I’m not chasing no one)?

It felt very disrespectful and I am going to a show on Saturday that she will be at. I’m going to tell her in person about it and possibly dead the connection right there.

She also told me some sh*t about a close male “friend” she grew up with who helped her break things off with her ex. This same “friend” allegedly stays at her home in a guest bedroom when he visits. He also invited her to Vegas. Her female friend who was supposed to join them backed out because she felt that there is something between them and didn’t want to be the third wheel. She also said her ex felt there was something between them. She also told me her male friend said she really doesn’t know me.

I am laid back and not the jealous type but this chic, for someone who is 51, seems very immature.

26,qcqdpi,1634818363,"The girl (18 F) seems to lost interest, despite our relationship being almost perfect. Should I (21 M) end it with her?","Hey guys. So the question in the title. I've been dating this girl for almost two months as of now. We have committed to a monogamous committed relationship, looking forward to what comes next, and we are officially BF and GF. It started very well, she approached me on the street and wanted to introduce herself. It happened for the first time in my life! I liked her, so our improvised hang-out was good. We had 3-4 more good dates before we kissed and told each other we have mutual feelings for each other. We liked each other from the beginning, and both developed romantic feelings quite fast.

It was all perfect. She seemed genuinely interested in me, in my life. She told me numerous times that I was the perfect boyfriend for her, and the one. She liked me for all my flaws, all good and bad in me. She helped me through a rough time when I lost my family member and on other occasions. At one point she spent more time with me than alone or with anyone for that matter. Our sex is one of the best sex I've had in my life, it's just so perfect. She said the same thing about me. It seemed like a dream. We have so much in common, and mainly our feelings are truly mutual and very strong. And most important, we've been communicating about everything. It was like a breath of fresh air, after dating and seeing girls that would ghost, cheat, lie, and all that stuff. 

She used to initiate conversations first, but I did my share of initiating too. It was always two-sided. We saw each other last time exactly 1 week ago. Last Friday she was busy, and the following evening I've got sick. Like very sick! I've got COVID, and this whole week I'm feeling so shitty, and even though going to ER a few times. Gladly I'm A BIT better and can get up from bed and walk now, but still, no energy and my depression kicked in so hard. I'm still suicidal at times. So it's been the worst week ever.

At the start of my illness, she used to text me 24/7, but now it's been more than two days since her last message. She doesn't seem to be interested that much anymore. I wanted her to come over, and babysit with me, (As would I do if she was ill) but she didn't. In my ill brain, I picture her having fun with other guys, and texting endlessly, and making out with someone else. When conversation dies with one guy, it's usually getting longer with someone else, isn't it? I don't even have the energy to do anything, and I cry like a little kid for hours. There is a lot of bad things happening in my life besides Covid, so I'm in very-very bad shape.

Should I just leave it as it's, waiting for her to text me? I asked her to initiate more during this period, because I don't have the energy to do anything, and that I'm so down. Or should I do write something to her? I'm not even sure anymore what to say. My gut feeling is very very bad, and I think something is well wrong and off.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcqdpi/the_girl_18_f_seems_to_lost_interest_despite_our/

We had lots of similar life experiences and interests and went on 3 dates. The dates went extremely well from my point of view. There were some good signs, she asked me to meet her mom, we held hands, cuddled and kissed and had some pretty interesting conversations. We chatted at least once a day for about a month via text.

Out of no where she texted me saying she “wasn’t looking for anything serious right now but wants to stay friends and is open to exploring this in the future”. This surprised me because all the signs she liked me were there for the past month. I was caught off guard and accepted her offer for friendship. I cut contact after that and 2 weeks later she started texting me with small talk. This was starting to hurt so I sent her a text basically saying “I was starting to catch feelings for her and I was disappointed that things had to end so I’m not interested in staying platonic friends but I’d be open to something casual”. She replied saying she’s “not into hookups but respects how I feel which is completely valid”. Haven’t communicated with her since then.

This was a girl I saw myself dating long term. I felt bad for bringing up something casual but I thought that was better than just friends since she didn’t want anything serious.

It seems like I'm mostly doing the talking and the initiating and I'm personally not into that, like I would  engage in a conversation with them but they're mostly so awkward and I don't know if it's just my luck but most of the guys that I've met on dating apps tend to be that way; which is fine but it's not necessarily my type. I'm very feminine, I always dress nice, I'm fit and I take care of myself and have been told I'm attractive but I just have problems with attracting the type of guy that I want.

31,qcrabi,1634821285,I got blackmailed by my girlfriend.,"Last time i dated with her and it was all going fine. I was immediately deeply in love. I left my house and moved in with her.

But now comes the humiliation. Her mom from 70 years old lives in her house and she wants my to have sex with her, i don't want it but at the end i did it, just because I loved my girlfriend so much. After i had sex with her mom, i act like i was oke and it didn't bother me.

But when i was in the bathroom i break out in tears and i cried. It was so gross, i has to do all different kinds of sexual acts with this and i almost puck'd.
It was traumatic. 

But she wants me to do it again. I said hard en clear 'No!' But now she blackmailed that if i don't do it, she will break up with me and kick me out of her house.

32,qcrxsa,1634823266,So... I'm unsure,"I'm not... The most open to dating, I've had 2 bad experiences. One was an abusive girl, not a nice person AT ALL and cheated on me, lied all that shit... The 2nd girl was really nice, I liked her but we just didn't work, didn't part on bad terms but it's shit it ended, y'know?

I don't know if I offer much to girls, I don't have the confidence to start a chat, I can keep it going and alive but it's that first step. I keep myself in shape, I'm groomed and hygienic, I work and I enjoy going outdoors on my free time along with working out. To me, that seems like an average ticklist, not great but not horrible, right?

How do I... Overcome that anxiety of not being good enough for a girl? I've given up on Tinder (because, well, it's Tinder lol)

Also, for what it's worth, I'm 21 Y/O, don't yet drive (in the process of it)

33,qcs21z,1634823617,Why do lesbians on dating apps set their preferences to be shown to all people?,"Honestly this is the most confusing thing I've seen. Living in Brooklyn, a good chunk of profiles that women have show that they're lesbian or queer (some dont even show that too from ones I know personally) which is totally fine but they request for the profile to be shown to everyone. Then they tell all men on their profile not to swipe right while calling them some kind of derogatory remark about being hetero or cis. On hinge its pretty straight forward, just 3 options saying you're interested in men, women, or everyone. Why even set your preferences to include men if you're going to get upset for some reason? I'm not shaming anyone for their preferences or sexuality or whatever, I'm just curious because I've been berated on these apps for being a hetero cis-shit male just for accidentally swiping right.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcs21z/why_do_lesbians_on_dating_apps_set_their/
34,qcs71o,1634824038,How do i deal with this situation?,"I [18F] am talking to this guy [20M] calling him jake for the purpose of this. Jake and i have been out on like 4-5 dates till now, but things as i see it may stay as casual dating and/or turn into a more physical type of thing rather than being about feelings. Jake is great, but i tend to stay on edge with him and not really that comfortable. It's not serious between us and i don't see it turning into anything of the sort in the future.


I recently started talking to this new guy as well, also [20M], call him Adam. Adam and i have been talking for a bit now, but not been out on any dates. Adam's personality is incredible and i have never had someone understand me so well without having to explain myself the way he does. He's very smart which is something i look for in people because i wld want their priorities to align with mine.


Things have been going great with Adam, but three things have been on my mind which i can't get rid of. 1) i don't find him THAT good looking (he is but I'm just not that attracted). This one's an easy one cause things may be different when we go out. 


2) The pace of things. He seems to be going faster than i am cause he's sick of the traditional way of going at things which i get but don't really agree on. I've been through too much for the stage of life I'm at which makes me way too cautious when dealing with such things and i like it VERY slow. He mentioned that he doesn't really believe that there is a reason for that but he'll be fine to go along with it. It's making me feel a like I'm being rushed.


3) I have no idea how to put things to a stop with Jake and just hop onto something serious with Adam. It's making me feel like a hypocrite for some reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcs71o/how_do_i_deal_with_this_situation/

I'm mid twenties. Dated 3 girls in my life. It's been the same with all of them - Much happier to talk about them than me. 

I think this is maybe cause I'm a good listener. No matter who I'm talking with I nearly always listen more than I talk. Not cause I'm quiet. But cause I value listening. People want to feel heard. So do I.

I suppose my question is. how common is this? Am I asking for too much for someone to say. “I'm going to shut up now. Let's talk about you.”

47,qctmzy,1634828136,"We have amazing chemistry and get along really well, but my [31/F] hand tremor makes him [35/M] ""uncomfortable"". Should I continue seeing him?","Hi everyone,

I met a guy on Bumble a few weeks ago. We had great conversational chemistry over texting and the phone. Meeting up was difficult because our state is currently in lockdown due to a surge in covid cases. I am immunocompromised because I have lupus, which made the situation more difficult. I disclosed via text message that I have lupus and a hand tremor. He said he was fine with these things. I decided to take a risk and go to his house for dinner.

We had dinner and watched a movie at his house, and later made out on the couch. We had great conversational chemistry, and we seemed to get along really well. He was funny and kind. He said he liked me too and that so far, I was everything he was looking for in a woman.

The next day, he messaged me to organise another dinner, although did say that he still had a lot to learn about my tremors. I asked him what bothered him. He said they didn't bother him, but he just wanted to understand them, and the things I can and can't do. I answered all of his questions as honestly as I could.

We met for dinner again. I checked in with him about my tremors, and he said I had answered all of his questions. We had an amazing time. I said I wanted to wait to have sex until we were exclusive, and he said he was fine with that. He also said that he does not intend to see other girls until he knows whether things are going to work out between us. We were intimate in other ways and I stayed the night.

I asked him what his long-term relationship goals were in relation to kids and marriage. He said he wants kids. He also told me that he is currently still married, but separated. They formally separated four months ago, and intend to divorce once they are legally allowed to. I asked whether he is ready to move on. He said he is because she checked out of the relationship 1-2 years ago. Apparently they were rarely home at the same time and she was never affectionate. I'm fine with this.

I asked him why he was struggling to make eye contact on our date. He said he didn't want to look at me while I was eating because he thought it may make me uncomfortable because of my tremor. I asked him if my tremor bothered him.

He said he had an amazing time, but he is conflicted. He said I am everything he is looking for in a woman - in his words - open, honest, emotionally intelligent, career-focused, independent and kind. He also commented that I was beautiful and had an amazing body.

He said, however, that he is very uncomfortable with my tremors because he has no experience with them and he has never seen a tremor before. He said he doesn't know when to help me. I told him that I will tell him if I need help.

I said the only way my tremors will affect him is how they appear to his eye, how they feel on his skin, and what other people think of me/us because I am self-sufficient and have found ways to adapt. He didn't really comment. I said I didn't know what to do or say because they're part of me and I can't change them. He said he knows that, but he can't change how he feels about them either. He said he feels like a jerk saying that, but he doesn't know what else to say. He said he wanted to be honest with me about how he was feeling.

Regardless, he said given our chemistry, how well we get along, and the fact that I am the ""full package"" and ""perfect"", he would like to spend more time together to see if he can become more comfortable with them. He also said he has multiple medical conditions, but he doesn't feel comfortable disclosing them yet. I'm not bothered because I work in healthcare and I'm familiar with health problems. I became teary at the end of our conversation and said I had to go. I haven't heard from him since.

There was another comment that caught me off guard. I showed him a photo of what I looked like before I got sick. He said, ""WOW! You were a bombshell! You were totally out of my league. At least now I have a chance with you."" He said he was joking.

I'm interested in everyone's thoughts on whether I should pursue a third date. I feel like such an idiot for being intimate with him.

This phenomenon has really caught my attention and my curiosity. Normally, people do not ghost someone who has confessed their feelings over text, but text back with an excuse or the blunt truth.

But this guy who I had talked the longest to about a month, with video calls and watch parties in between asked me out last friday for a movie I really wanted to watch. I was nervous (23F) first date and all and I knew he (25M) was too bc on the car ride to the theatre he was sweating bc he was running late. Anyway 10 minutes into the movie I could feel him rubbing my hand, I opened it and we held hands, I didn’t know how I felt, it was exhilarating but did I like it?  Idk
I had honestly thought of friendzoning him on our first date bc he was my height (not taller), not really my type (not that I really have a type), was broke up his gf a year ago and felt I might be his rebound, but basically movie was followed by dinner and dessert and then a ride home where he kept holding my hand at every red light or moment where we could. And finally in the car he gave me a peck on the cheek which I returned and then we were kissing, lip locking and a bit of tongue and teeth too.
I just came back from a second date which was also fun, we talked about his ex and my body insecurities. I really like how comfortable he makes me feel. He had mentioned before the second date, that for a first timer I was a good kisser, and with that in mind at the end of the date we made out longer and harder, we then basically masturbated together in the back seat with some oral included too.

58,qcuput,1634831150,"My first FWB, lessons learned, good/nice girls finish last.","I (26F)have been single for over 2 years following a breakup from a 3 year relationship.

Earlier this year, I got into my first FWB situationship for \~6mo with a guy (25M) I met at my previous workplace. The breakup from this feels way worse than my 3y relationship.

There were red flags. Issues with control and lack of emotional maturity. FWB was his idea, he proposed it and I was eventually convinced.  But he also didn't have the best self-esteem, he'd often say that 'I bring more to the table than he does. I initially thought he was self-sabotaging, and felt bad. 

I was wrong, It became so sour. After every time we had intercourse, he would say that it would be the last. He had many excuses for why we shouldn't have sex again, e.g. he felt I would develop deep feelings for him, he needed to focus on himself and his goals, he was becoming celibate. He was so up and down.

After each time he told me an excuse, within the week he will try to initiate it again, and the cycle continues. I liked him, so I never really made it hard for him to come back. The control went even further, earlier in our situationship I tried to initiate it, and he shut me down, told me he needs to focus on his goals, and sex is not on his mind. 2 days later, he messaged me late at night for sex, to which I said no because it was too late. Our dynamic was becoming toxic

I realised he had too much control, by this point it felt like it was too late. It felt like he didn't respect me and took advantage of my kind, reserve, and submissive nature. whilst at the same time continuing to imply I was too good for him.

I've now blocked him on everything after a big argument, 1 month ago. But it still hurts, I opened myself up and became too available to a man, that wasn't available to me. There were several points, I should have put an end to it. Ultimately i regret being too nice/kind/good, guys like him don't respect it and take advantage. He's an odd character, has never been in a relationship (but claims he is the relationship advisor in his friendship group -LOL), lacks emotional maturity, has control issues, but is also very self-aware that I was too good to be with a guy like him.

Knowing that she had sex with a guy in those few days we were apart while I was literally in bed, depressed, and crying everyday kills me. Everytime now she says I love you and acts all cute, all I can think about is her nasty messages with the dude and her having sex with him. 

Is it worth it to confront her about this and miss out on being happy while she is still living here?

Or should I just bury it down, act like nothing is wrong, and enjoy the time I still have with her?

Any and all advise is helpful. Thank you for reading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcv0t2/would_you_keep_a_hurtful_secret_if_it_meant_your/

We had a date set for Friday but she couldn't wait either so I went over to watch her fold laundry and just ended up talking for hours on and off the fire escape and falling asleep in eachothers arms. No sex, not yet just snuggles and a peck but that's all I want. Going back today though since neither of us got any sleep so more cuddles this time hopefully. She likes being held and I like holding her. She's so squishy and soft too. Thicc pudgy goodness and she says she likes skinny and red hair so she got what she wants too. I just feel so right holding her.

I only know this person strictly from her work, as one of her customers.
Right off the bat, a lady friend of mine told me many years ago NEVER to ever ask a girl out at her work, because its creepy....but I feel like this is the only option in this situation, and I have asked girls out before at their work under similar circumstances and had success with it...

The problem is I can never catch this person without all of her coworkers there, or without a bunch of other customers she's already helping, and I flat out just dont feel comfortable asking her in front of an audience and I would think that would be ackward for her too.

There was one time she was by herself and I struck up a conversation with her and she seemed receptive to me, but that situation has never presented itself again.

The last time I saw him, he went out of his way to express how much he enjoyed talking to me. In other words, at first he admitted he only wanted to hook up, but after getting to know me he realized there was something of substance between us. He followed up with me the next day, and confirmed the arrangements we made. Long story short, there is a 99% chance he has now decided to ghost me. I had no secret hopes of turning this casual situation into a serious relationship, but I did enjoy his company and was open to staying in touch. Dating is so frustrating these days, why go out of your way to make arrangements only to pretend like you never made them in the first place and back out. Im not even upset over him, but I am upset over the fact that words and actions seemingly have no weight  anymore. I can find another date and/or another casual partner but it’s such a waste of time. I won’t even try and find a partner for a serious relationship because we all know that’s near impossible. People lack integrity and values, they’re myopic and self-serving to an alarming degree.

It's so cliché.. but we started as good strictly platonic friends and one night we were together until 1am and I was telling her bye and went to kiss her cheek and she bobbed and I weaved and we ended up kissing, laughing and ended up kissing like our lives depended on it and one thing led to another and we ended up in bed together until the morning with this raw, passionate, emotionally fulfilling sex. We both ended up calling out of work the next day and just spent the day in bed. 

We had several conversations about not ruining our friendship but obviously that was out the window and we agreed to keep our emotions out of it until either of us decided we were done or someone else came along but we'd have no hard feelings at that point. 

About 2 months in we're basically in a relationship without the title, talking/texting all day, greeting/goodbye kisses, kisses for no reason, holding hands, dinner dates, consistent sex, spending the night with each other, cuddling, telling each other how we missed that person, you know, relationship stuff. We both knew long term it shouldn't work (she didn't want to deal with my child's mother) but we both got involved emotionally and then things turned toxic.

I told her I wanted to try and see where it went with us and she didn't. So I started hanging out and talking to other women friends/interests, not making her my immediate priority (no sense in my mind if she isn't going to be a romantic partner and only wants sex), stopped talking to her all day/every day and told her I was working on slowing things down so we could figure out what the next steps were for us. 

After a few days of things slowing down I called her and told her we needed to talk. I told her I was done with this arrangement and it was time to go our seperate ways but would like to be friends if we could (you can't, at least not initially). She lost her mind and started yelling at me about ""how could I do this to her, what was my problem, she told me not to get involved emotionally"". I was so dumbfounded because I told her she was the one who didn't want more and why was she getting angry with me? That got me yelled at some more..

Obviously I had/have feelings for her and enjoyed the time her and I spent together, so it feels like a break up to me but the thing is, I got into this knowing this would likely be the outcome, so why am I sad about it? 

I'm sure in someway I'm going to be the asshole of the story but I'm so dumbfounded by all this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcvpl4/broke_it_off_with_my_situationship/

My concern is that when I’m dating, I’ve become hyper aware of women who only show interest because my career success sounds impressive. I don’t know if this is simply an insecurity influencing my perception or actual reality.

The reason it bothers me is because I have a friend who’s gf of 2 years broke with him after he lost his job. The last thing I want is to end up with a woman who when/if I’ve lost my life’s work, leaves me. In truth, I’d rather be liked for my looks than career success. It sounds bad, but at least our looks will fade together. I’ve even considered lying about my job when first meeting girls. It sounds awful and I don’t think I’d actually do it.

72,qcvz7z,1634834707,Does any other guys have trouble trusting women?,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot for the part couple of days and have been trying to dissect it and possibly rectify it. Maybe this sounds a bit cringe and unconventional but I feel like I can’t trust women enough to give them something long term. Whenever I’m dating a woman in the back of my mind I feel like she’ll never be loyal and that it’s just “my turn”. 

Dating women feels like a never ending balancing act; showing them too much attention turns them off and so does not showing enough and there’s so many more examples. The lack of accountability across the board is astounding, I’ve met very few women in this day and age that are actually self-aware. It never feels like women care about men it’s always “what can men do for women”. At this point with woke culture and the “girl boss” movement men can do nothing for them despite having built literal cities for them. Wars have been fought for women and it still feel like they aren’t pleased, they’re always looking for something wrong when everything is going great or for a reason to disqualify men. 

I remember in middle school the girls were already going to night clubs and bars and  running laps around guys sexually and it was confusing to see considering they weren’t even old enough to drink. Now all my female friends love to talk about how “men ain’t sh*t” and “all men are trash” when they literally cheat on nearly every guy they complain to me about. One thing I’ve learned about women over the years is that 99% of the time they cheat to get back at a guy while men cheat purely for the physical release, cheating sucks but one is just more cruel and vindictive.

I didn’t even get into all my thoughts about why I feel this way but the more I date women the less I want to commit. I love women, the way they look, they way the smell, how they talk, walk, etc. but I do not love their innate lack of logic. I just want peace and it seems like it doesn’t exist with women, I hope I’m wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcvz7z/does_any_other_guys_have_trouble_trusting_women/

Anyway I thought it gone be right move if I pretended that I asked her this way I can figure out if he really like her , so I did it I told him that I asked her and she said no bc she have crush on someone else. Forget to mention he asked for her Instagram and Snapchat before I told him that she doesn’t want have 3some with us . So he start talking with her and she called me in the same exact min telling me that he start texting her. 4 months later she texted me : she said I should be honest with her and if I want smth from her to tell her in the face not to tell someone else. 
I was shocked I didn’t know what she’s talking about so I asked her and she said that my bf was talking with her for the last 5 months asking her for 3some with us and telling her that I’m shy to ask her . 
At this point I was a bit mad , I was about to talk with him when she said no stop let me talk with him first and she told him that she agreed about the 3some shit . they start talking and she asked him wdu like about me he said I’m wondering how your butt looks like?!!! That’s what she told me so I got so mad I start talking with him and he was acting like he doesn’t know shit and he just ask her once 5monthes ago and she agreed today he called me dramatic and he texted her : i see you’re starting the drama . 
2 days after everything was okay we opened a new page he didn’t admit anything but I thought that everyone deserve second chance. Everything was perfect until I met her yesterday and she told me that he texted her agin : are you mad at my gf? And after that he told her : I want tell  smth when i see you next time.

I was mad and I asked him to stop talking to her bc it’s so weird. His reaction was wtf ? What are you talking about.(I ignored him)
And after 2h he replied to an old text it was 3days ago .
I was so mad so I told him that we should talk. We start talking and he told me that my friend is jealous and she just want ruin our relationship and I should choose him or her.

74,qcwj8q,1634836286,Girl showing interest after I go cold. How do I navigate these waters?,"I \[30M\] been dating this girl \[30F\] for 4 months and I actually quite like her as a person. She's stunning and intelligent. We have similar interests and values and overall we're a good fit for each other.  What I don't like about her is that she's kind of unstable/uncertain about things across her life (Career, family, our relationship).

We established exclusivity very early on (1 month in), but she said she had second thoughts about that later (2 months in). But we continued to see each other, seemingly exclusively, for a while. 

Things were going well between us. I've always tried to be the best guy that I can be to her. We were seeing each other 1-2 times per week and having sex regularly.  We went on a week-long trip together in August, and had a really good time together. We were enjoying each other's company.  We've made date plans for October and November. 

I last saw her about 10 days ago. Her mom was going for surgery, so she said she needs to spend some time with her mom and take care of her mom afterwards. I understood and agreed. I told her that If she needs any help or anything, I'm there for her. We texted and called normally. 

Earlier this week, after seeming cold or distant for a day or two, she texts me saying we should talk ""about everything"" and meet up for ""a bit"" in a ""very low key"" environment. She tells me not to worry about anything. I agree. 

I call her for a chat later that same day. I later ask her if everything is okay between us, she said it's not a straight forward answer. I told her that I wanted to make things work between us, but if it can't, that's perfectly okay. She tells me that I should text her goodnight later. We have a nice little exchange. 

I figure she either wants to break up or says that we should keep seeing each other, but not-exclusively. 

I backed off yesterday. I became more distant in response to the telephone call. I needed the space to really figure out whether I even want to continue things with someone who is uncertain about me. I dont want to be constantly putting forth effort into someone who doesn't want to do the same for me. 

In response, she sent me a sweet good morning text (i normally initiate), sending me kiss emojis, and cuddling bunny gifs, and tries to continue conversations through text.   I'm more distant than normal, but I reciprocate politely.   Today, I didn't text her, she didnt text me. 

I figure we maintain some distance until we have ""the talk"" on the weekend and figure out things between us.

To be honest, I really like the gal, and would like things to work between us. But I don't like her uncertainty/instability. This is not what I want in a partner.  

Am I over reacting to this situation?  How do I best navigate these waters? 

Do I continue maintaining space between us (at the risk of alienating her from me), or do I continue being a sweet guy (at the risk of looking like a pushover)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcwj8q/girl_showing_interest_after_i_go_cold_how_do_i/

We had a lot in common, had the same sense of humour, and time with them just seemed to fly past like nothing. I really had not had that much fun with someone else in a long time. I was actually really convinced it was going to work out, but I had a lot of personal things to get through. I was insecure, and anxious and I think that translated into me being really desperate and needy. He also came across a little emotionally available at the time. That dynamic unfortunately grew tiring for the both of us, and eventually led us to stop communication. 

Although it hasn’t been that significant of a time now, I have made a point in improving myself and stepped away from the dating scene. I’ve been seeing a therapist, reconnecting with old friends, and overall feel a lot more confident in myself and have decided to start looking again. 

I went on a date with another guy yesterday, and even though it was great and we had a lot in common, I just can’t seem to get the previous guy out of my head.

He went out with his friends last night which is no big deal. He usually texts me when he’s on his way home. He texted me “leaving soon” but hours and hours later he still wasn’t back. Slightly concerned I tried calling him several times with no answer. 

Another hour goes by, still nothing. At this point I’m panicking, thinking car accident or worse. So I call his buddy who he was out with (our mutual friend) but he tells me the guys all went home a long time ago. 

Ok - now im REALLY concerned and I’m thinking I need to start calling hospitals along his route home! So I grab his iPad (synced to his phone) to try and find his last location. 

WELL! I found texts from him to another girl saying he’s on his way up and needs her room number! So he can’t answer my calls but he has no issue using it to meet up with a girl I’ve never heard of before? 

At this point I’m furious and open his Instagram. Sure enough, his DMs are filled with flirty messages to girls. Some I know, some I don’t. 

Fast forward - he admitted to meeting up with a girl after dinner with the guys but vehemently denied anything happened. I have no way to prove this, and the point is he lied and hid it from me. 

He also admitted to the flirty DMs and said it just felt good to get the attention. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. The only reason he confessed is because I caught him either actively cheating or WANTING to cheat. I’m inclined to break up with him but we have a home, a step child, an engagement, etc.

The trouble I've encountered is this, when it's come up in conversation (childhood, college, etc) about past dating, relationships, etc. well... There was dating at BYU and dating through church, and that's it, meaning.... I am still a virgin. I was ""scrupulous"" in keeping the commandments, a true believing member (TBM). Granted my virginity has only come up twice, both times the women acted like this was a bad thing. I wasn't looking to have sex with them right then, it wasn't even in my mind, but they connected the dots... ""Mormon... BYU.... never married... are you a virgin? I'm not going to lie, and well... this is when they tell me to either go ""get experience"" or that they have ""needs""...

Am I just being blown off? (No pun intended). Married / Committed / ex-Mormons / ex-fundamentalists, was this an issue for you? How would you recommend I proceed if / when this comes up?

As a skinny slender guy, I have approached conventionally attractive and average women with normal weight but never went anywhere.. I have only gotten sexual interest from older women or overweight women. Unless the guy is skinny but tall, then he better eat a lot of calories or hit the gym. This is a strange behavior phenomenon that I've noticed a lot. Maybe on a biological term, fat, muscle, or both= protection?

It was obvious she was faking the No English and assumed I was hitting on her. She said “Okay” and then left the machine and I finished my set and then I told her I’m done. She thanked me and asked for my name. I told her “No English” and walked away.

Like the title says, I (m27) need your help! I have tomorrow evening a first date with a woman (f26) whom I met on happn. I have a few questions I am uncertain about what to do.

1. When I meet with her, do I hug her or just say hi?
2. Do I tell her before my date I am not a great talker, on the date itself or not at all?
3. I might go ask her for a kiss at the end. Should I tell her it will be my first kiss at all?

93,qcy8ov,1634841114,I'm 9000km away now,"We met two years ago in the same city but I recently moved away. We were never a real possibility for pragmatic reasons, but for whatever reason, I was love at first sight with him and till today, I still love him to bits. But as we are really not possible, I often turned him down on meeting up although upon his insistence, we did meet up a few times and we were intimate. Perhaps to say we had sex is more on point as he was always seeing multiple people and mostly only wants sex.

The last time we met before I left, he seemed to get a bit emotional and ended it because again, we are not possible to begin with anyway. So for the last months, we haven't been communicating at all until a few days ago, I received his text again. He basically wants to find out if i will come back visit soon. He seemed to kinda have a gf but he never mentioned so I didn't press further.

I guess my question is, does he like me a bit? Or are men like this, even if you're thousands of km away, they will still try their luck to see if they can be with a woman? 

I mean, if I were him, I would have given at multiple points of our ""situationship"" and certainly would forget  the other person if she is no longer living

94,qcy8uk,1634841126,Today I realized I was the douchebag and I feel terrible about it,"For context, I'm really inexperienced with dating. I've only been in one relationship and have been on a handful of first dates in the year since my breakup with my toxic ex. None of those dates have even progressed to a kiss. In my last relationship we met at a college party and slept together by the third date, which was the first time she came over to my place.

Fast forward to the actual story, a few weeks ago I met this really fun, cool person through Hinge. We'd had three really good dates over the span of 1-2 weeks. The progression was a single kiss, to multiple kisses, and we started making out by the end of the third date. Now on the 4th date, I invited her over to my place where I surprised her with flowers and we spent an hour at the nearby aquarium before we went back to my apartment where I cooked dinner for her, we got high, and watched a show on my bed. She had an open invitation to spend the night (because she lives far away) and seemed to be down as she came with an overnight bag and talked about getting ready the night before. While we were watching TV, we started making out again and I let her know ""if anything I do makes you uncomfortable, let me know"" which she agreed to before I started touching her. After a bit of light touching (never went anywhere near her pants but unbuttoned her top a little) she suddenly told me that she should probably get home tonight. I ended up walking her to her car, we kissed one more time, and I asked if I'd be seeing her again to which she replied ""maybe, I can be convinced"" in a flirty sort of way.

Now I've been confused for the last few days because she's seemed kind of distant, posted about a date with another person (totally fine, we're not exclusive), and kind of blew me off the two times I tried making plans with her. Last night it all finally clicked that I was probably going too fast and even though I let her know to stop me she probably felt pressured to keep going. I'll admit that my hope was to get a little more ""physical"" but I think I got so caught up in my excitement of dating this frankly amazing girl that mixed with my inexperience, I didn't realize that it only seemed like I wanted sex. I looked up some r/AskReddit threads after I came to that realization and saw that most people don't even talk about becoming exclusive until dates 6-8! I thought I was taking it slow but apparently my definition of ""going fast"" was as fast as a bullet. I feel absolutely terrible and I want to apologize to her but I think I've already come across as clingy enough. I don't want to mess this up, even though I probably already have. I'm not exactly looking for advice (unless you know a way I can fix this lmao) but some support would be appreciated. Man I feel like such a douchebag :(

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Got too excited dating a girl. Accidentally made it seem like I only wanted sex. Apparently my idea of going slow was still too fast.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcy8uk/today_i_realized_i_was_the_douchebag_and_i_feel/
