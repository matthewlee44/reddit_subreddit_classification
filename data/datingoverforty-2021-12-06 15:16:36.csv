1,raijb9,1638826870,"What's Great about Dating in your 40's, Two Dates In","Early 40's man dating again for first time in 15 years. Can I share what is wonderful about dating at this age, at least judging from my first two dates? Being more comfortable with myself. Let me start by describing how each date started:

Woman #1: I get to the cafe early and wait outside. She arrives right on time, and before we even go inside, she says ""I don't usually go for guys like you. I've always dated musicians or artists.""

Woman #2: I get a different cafe early and wait outside. She arrives late, irritated at having to pay a lot for parking. She doesn't like the cafe I've chosen and calls it ""a cafeteria."" So we sit outside, which she is not enthusiastic about either, since it's a bit chilly. 

The beginnings to both of these dates would have totally thrown me when I was younger and more insecure. Yet both ended up being very enjoyable, because I didn't give into anxiety.

Woman #1's comment was ambiguous, and it did tap into some latent anxiety because I was already a bit worried about her finding me boring. She was very fashionably dressed, and I'm kind of square in my appearance. But at the age I'm at now I was able to take a comment and roll with it. I like confident women, and this one speaks her mind. All good. And the coffee went great. She definitely didn't find me boring (and she had, so what). It felt nice to kind of kill off that anxiety. Afterwards, it even occurred to me she was possibly complimenting me with her comment.

Woman #2 also made me feel not great to start. She was clearly not in a good place due to the parking hassle. But I didn't take anything personally. She was late; she didn't research parking beforehand; she didn't bring a coat on a cold day; she has oddly strong opinions about what constitutes a good place to drink some coffee. So I stayed even-keeled. And the date got better. We had an activity planned after the coffee that went really well, and she warmed up a whole lot.

I'm not going to post whether there were second dates here, because I don't think it matters relative to the point I'm making. They were first-date successes because I had a good time at each getting to know someone. And I didn't over-analyze sh#t in the moment and give into anxiety. I was completely myself at both of them, let the chips fall where they may. Something I couldn't do in my 20's. 

I'm also sharing this because I've been reading about others (at all ages) who seem to be giving into anxiety at dates, and maybe this can inspire you to try to just be yourself, and measure the success of the date along that metric of being true to yourself instead of how your date responds to you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/raijb9/whats_great_about_dating_in_your_40s_two_dates_in/

I have not made myself available to ""date"" until this summer.  Met the man here at my house.  He does the yearly brush inspection.  Apparently, we've met 3 times.  I apologized because I don't remember him.  I know someone comes yearly but since we've never really spoken, I don't remember him.  I asked him why he kept coming back (inspection isn't his regular assignment).  He said he wanted to meet me but wasn't sure how.  Anyway, this year, I actually approached him.  Conversation happened, number exchanged.  That was June.  We've gone out 4x since.  Have had sex 2x.  From the start, I told him I didn't want a serious relationship.  I told him I want full disclosure.  I just wanted come out of sex retirement.  I also told him I've been warned about going out with guys in his profession.  Lots of cheaters.  

Here's where I differ.  I have no issues being the second person.  I know this will piss off a lot of people.  A month after we started dating, he told me that he wanted to work things out with the current GF because they have a young kid, I told him go for it.  He can reach out and we can stay friends.  They went on their trip and when they got back, he messaged me as soon as they landed.  He couldn't stop thinking of me during their trip.

We talk nearly every day.  We talk about everything.  He has asked me if I would ever want something more permanent.  I said, if I ever do, I wouldn't uproot my adult child.  I also don't want to be with the man all the time.  Meaning, I'm perfectly ok if he worked 4-5 days and just be with me on his days off.  

A friend told me that I'm really not ready for a relationship.  I know that.  I don't know that I ever will be.  I know there's tons of red flags here.

I believe people who say they‚Äôre introverted/extroverted/misanthropes, and generally believe their hobbies, with some possible skepticism regarding fitness/activity level.

But as a woman I‚Äôve learned to wait to verify when men say they‚Äôre humble, nice guys, gentlemen, have conservative values, have liberal values, are old-fashioned, etc.  These kinds of labels mostly concern character, and are best perceived by others.

21,rb665z,1638902664,How to get/give that number:,"I was surprised how many people questioned whether I also approach people IRL, or if I just give advice that I don't follow myself. It's all about planting as many seeds as possible. 

1st: Start a conversation with EVERYONE possible. Acknowledge people. It's good practice for you and some people feel invisible, so it's good for them. You also never know how attractive someone might be until you see them smile. Just say things. Make some relevant observation, and see if they reciprocate. If they don't, move on. Some people will be put off, most won't. Be that mom in the grocery store line who talks to strangers. Start with less intimidating people. Old men and women are great, and some of my most important lessons have come from octogenarian strangers. Start out with people that are unlikely to interpret your friendliness as a pick up. Flirt with old people. They know it's innocent. I'm straight, and I flirt with people who are my same gender. It makes talking to attractive, single strangers less awkward. I've been both obese and a personal trainer in amazing shape in my adult life. The results were pretty much the same with this practice.

2. If you like the way the conversation is going, try to mention something that would justify sending them a message, or ask them to send you something. Links to hikes, local events, restaurants, and books are my favorites. Make sure to tell them casually that they can text you ""if they have any questions"". I've taken landscape photos that happen to catch a nice photo of someone else and told them ""I accidentally got you in my photo, but it's a really good picture of you. If you want, I could send it to you. I'm super outdoorsy, and I've done this completely platonically and made some cool friends. The worst they say is no and think you're weird. That's on them for assuming it was a come on. AS IF!! You didn't mean to BOTHER  them with your friendliness. 

3. I prefer to offer my number rather than ask for theirs. It's less scary for them, and it puts the ball in their court to initiate further contact. You can always block them later and use a google number until you've deemed them ""real"" number safe. But it saves you being the sole ""pursuer"".",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rb665z/how_to_getgive_that_number/
22,rb6qi3,1638903758,Wondering if I‚Äôm too old for OLD.,"Specifically app dating. I had a lot of likes/matches on Hinge when I was 42. I am attractive (or so I‚Äôve been told) and people have often expressed surprised at my age. I paused my profile for around six months while dating someone and reactivated when it didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve since turned 43. I updated with new pictures that are more flattering than the old ones, but lucky if I get a few ‚Äúlikes‚Äù per week (and no one I would be interested in matching with). 

Wondering if other people have seen a drastic drop in matches after a birthday (e.g due to shifting out of prospective matches preferred age brackets). I know there could be several other factors, just curious if this could be one of them as I saw it suggested in the Hinge sub (to someone in their 30s!). After reading that sub and seeing that most people posting were in their 20s or early 30s, I started to wonder if I was aging out, assuming that population might be representative of the predominant demographic on the app.

27,rbcysu,1638920781,"Trying to process, understand and do the right thing - help please!","Ok - I know I have a lot of issues to deal with and understand. Really interested to know what people think I should do or how to deal with this. Could also post on AITA I suppose? It‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm asking.

Background:
I‚Äôm now 41m with two kids 12, 10. My 20 year relationship ended when my wife got it on with a work colleague. All good between us now, I fought for it to be civil and we 50/50 coparent well - the 3 of us üôÑ they‚Äôve been together ever since.

I had a 2.5 year relationship after this (a really good one with a single mum of 2 kids - my first ever match and first ever date until it ended)

But since only a few weeks after that ended and at the start of lockdown I met online another amazing lady 35 now, no kids wants kids.

I think she put ‚Äòopen to kids‚Äô on her profile, so did I. I have kids, I like kids, my ex had 2 kids, I don‚Äôt want to exclude single mothers, I have always told myself if I met the right person and fell madly in love I could have more kids - I wouldn‚Äôt rule that out anyway. 
But she absolutely wants kids of her own.

3 months into my new relationship (it had a few jump starts) and the kids issue is getting pretty intense. Our relationship moved quick, she‚Äôs freaking lush so this was ok, is great with my children which was really nice and had basically said that she absolutely would have kids with me (previously with any partner she was just not able to see it) and that as I knew she wanted to be with someone that wants kids‚Ä¶ So how about it?!!

I back tracked maybe at this point, or at least couldn‚Äôt articulate my ‚Äòyes I‚Äôm open to having kids‚Äô into a ‚Äôyes I want to have kids with you IF our relationship stands a test of time and love‚Äô. I felt the pressure so badly and basically just messed everything up. We have been in an on off state for like 18 months and basically I‚Äôve/we‚Äôve just ruined what could have been such an amazing relationship, and maybe marriage and kids. But maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have got there - I don‚Äôt know.

It took me 10 years to get married previously and a further 5 to then have babies. Obviously we were from 15 and into our 20‚Äôs so that‚Äôs different.
By her just saying ‚Äòyep I‚Äôd have kids with you‚Äô just put the pressure on me. It was just then for me to decide I wanted it.

The biggest issues came from the air of disappointment at the reach for the condoms. We did start having bits of unprotected sex - it just felt like we were going about it all in such an unhealthy and destructive way. We hadn‚Äôt reached any ‚Äòyes let‚Äôs start a family‚Äô milestones so really what were we doing!?

I‚Äôm now left with a relationship in tatters from so much on/off and a person I really like and love that I can‚Äôt be with. Even to be friends I‚Äôd take but I don‚Äôt think she will have it. She‚Äôs so in my head and can‚Äôt shake it. Can‚Äôt move on. But know I can‚Äôt make our relationship work unless I ask her to marry me and have a family (I‚Äôve honestly seriously considered that, but argh the pressure(?!). Well it‚Äôs too late now).

Anyone?

A quick edit: thank you for so many helpful comments

36,rbnfii,1638955377,LDR BF wants to relocate to my city and I think it‚Äôs premature,"Edit for context:

I don‚Äôt think I did a great job describing ‚Äúus.‚Äù I call him my BF because the reality is we‚Äôve been seeing each other exclusively, but we agreed early on and again before I moved that we don‚Äôt need a label on this. Our lives don‚Äôt intersect very easily and that was obvious from the beginning, plus I knew I‚Äôd move eventually. So for those who describe it as ‚Äúdating‚Äù ‚Äî I.e. not a commitment or LTR ‚Äî that‚Äôs what we agreed on. We also agreed that if we meet someone we wanted to be physical with or wanted to get to know we would tell each other FIRST. I‚Äôm not someone who can be intimate with more than one person so that communication is important to me. It just so happens that we really like each other so we make more of an effort with each other more than what I think is typical for two people who are ‚Äúdating.‚Äù

Another point of clarification: I would LOVE for him to be in the same city with me. That man is a beacon of light in my life and I think he feels the same way. It‚Äôs just the idea of his moving FOR me that concerns me. There‚Äôs nothing else for him here. He doesn‚Äôt know anyone but me and it‚Äôs a very different vibe compared to where he is now. It seems like a big sacrifice and I genuinely am concerned about what‚Äôs best for him as a person and his life, not just our relationship. With all of the context above I hope it makes more sense.

Original post:

My (47F) BF and I have been doing pretty well with our LDR. Even when we were in the same city we saw each other once per week on average due to our jobs and commute. We currently see each other every few weeks but talk even more than before. Now he‚Äôs talking about looking for a job in my city. If we were committing to an LTR of course that‚Äôs the right move, but I just don‚Äôt feel we are there yet. It feels premature. What if he moves ‚Äúfor me‚Äù and we find out we aren‚Äôt a fit in the long run? It just seems like a huge step to take as an experiment to find out if we‚Äôre meant to be an LTR couple. I feel like I will be pressured to make it work and stay even if it ends up not being the right fit‚Äî out of guilt because of his willingness to make such a big effort. I really like him and don‚Äôt want to break up, but also don‚Äôt want him to move away from everything he knows in an attempt to propel things forward. 

I need to talk to him and want to find the right words such that it doesn‚Äôt blow up everything. I don‚Äôt want to give the impression that I don‚Äôt want an LTR with him. I just want us to evolve into that as a couple first, and once we‚Äôre sure, then make the efforts that go with the commitment, not the other way around.

However, I never know when she's gonna be triggered. Seems like at any point, with anything I say, she might freak out. She doesn't communicate right away, she just withdraws and assumes the worst. She's angry. She's gets her feelings hurt over the smallest, most random things. I never know when she's going to retreat from me. It's so up and down. She's sensitive and that makes her passionate and loving, but it also means she could explode at any moment. After a few minutes/hours, we always talk it out and wind up as loving as ever. She always apologizes for over-reacting and hates it about herself.

How do I cope with this? How can I support her? How can I make the relationship better? Without this one issue, we are absolutely perfect.

45,rc8elu,1639020034,Ghosted with Gratitude,"Hello all you beautiful people! I apologize for the long post. 
I haven‚Äôt dated much in the last four years since my divorce. And haven‚Äôt really even tried the past couple. Well, I reluctantly decided to give OLD another try. I finally matched with someone I felt like I would like to get to know. I let her know up front that I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of OLD and the back and forth texting and would like to meet. She agreed with the sentiment and we scheduled a video chat through the app to see if we connected and should meet in person. It was literally one text a day leading up to our scheduling of the video and then no chatting until we confirmed the day and time. We both greatly appreciated the lack of back and forth as we are both busy with work and I have an 11 year old. 


The day and time of the video chat arrived and we missed are initial attempt to connect because we both tried to call each other at the exact time of our call. But we connected a few minutes later. There was almost an instant connection. We laughed and chatted for about an hour and a half. She let me know she would like to meet in person to which I was more than amenable. She gave me her number and we shared a couple brief texts immediately following the call. 


I reached out mid morning the next day reiterating how much I enjoyed our call and was looking forward to meeting. I received a reply at 10:30 that night. She mentioned a rough work day and that she was also excited to meet. 


I responded the next morning, inquiring into her rough work day and giving her some times and days I was available. I also, mentioned that I would be interested in chatting again as I wouldn‚Äôt be available until the end of the week. 


I sent that message on Saturday. I haven‚Äôt heard from her sense. I know ghosting is a common thing but it just seemed so odd after chatting with her. My head has been all over the place, second guessing this and that. After a lot of soul searching I came back to gratitude and messaged her this today,


‚ÄúHi Jamie. I hope all is well. My romantic side has been persuading me to hold onto hope that you needed to unplug for a while and you would be in touch any day. But my logical side is pretty sure that you must have had a change of heart. If it‚Äôs the former, I hope to hear from you soon. If it‚Äôs the latter, which seems exceedingly more likely, I just want to say thank you and let you know how grateful I am that I was fortunate enough to meet you. I had all but lost hope that there was an intelligent, interesting, feisty, beautiful woman still single out there. While we may not be a match, I am now reinvigorated with a new since of optimism! Thank you! I wish you the best. And take it easy on those spiders.‚Äù
The spiders thing was a joke from our interaction.

I soon discovered that relationships in 40s are pretty complicated. All the females I have interacted with are dealing with divorces under various stages. All of them have kids from their previous relationship. What I understood is that there is something called \*decree\* which makes the divorce final.

Sometimes I come across females with status as separated and they are separated from their spouses for years. What does this exactly mean? Are they still married? What is the (Indian) society's view in general on this \*separated\* status.

I'm guessing my no-new-kids policy would alienate younger women who'd not yet had kids, right? For near aged women who are also in their 40s, though, how many expect to begin motherhood? And should I state my stance in my profile to get it out of the way or should I explain it in person later?

To be clear I'm not expecting a childless woman with no intentions of becoming a mother, as I feel that's a rather narrow demographic. I would openly accept her kids from previous relationships, just simply not be looking to add to the Brady Bunch.

It's the last thing I want to do because she an amazing woman and talking to her makes me really happy but if that is not in her best interests then it's just selfish of me.

I hope I'm not breaking rules.

So at the start of the week I got some news that I would have a week off at work and didn't have anything to do that week coming, so I decided to post an ad on some craigslist type of site but for finding sexual partners. I posted an ad in men looking for couples, so far so good the same night I get a single email from lets call her Lonely\_Lover and her husband Cuck. the first few email she tells me that her Cuck never ever fucks her anymore and that she's looking for a Horny\_Guy (me) to hit it off with her while Cuck would be watching a part of it (preliminary) and talk about life. Lonely\_Lover wants it to be a regular thing (like a few times a week maybe more, stay the weekends, maybe even 3some with a friend of hers (F35)) without necessarily let her Cuck know.

We have sent about 150 emails back and forth in a few days and pretty much have a perfect chemistry already, but idk I feel like there is something missing, might just be the fact we haven't been on a coffee date and have her Cuck be the thirdwheel lol.

Lonely\_Lover also doesn't know I don't have loads of experience sexually, should I tell her or keep it between me and me?

Does any Women or men in a similar situation have any advice for me? like should I threat her like she's my age and kinda my lover, like get her flowers and all ? (her cuck would be mad but we don't care)

any advice would be 100% appreciated

87,red6q4,1639270478,My boyfriend ghosted me after 4 years of dating ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been a month of no contact,"And I‚Äôm doing ok actually and accept that he was most likely cheating and lied to me a lot. What‚Äôs bad is he hurt my daughter because she called him ‚Äúdad‚Äù and he encouraged it.  He‚Äôs the only ‚Äúdad‚Äù she‚Äôs ever known, her dad lost visitation when she was 3. 
Anyways, I haven‚Äôt heard from him at all, I just see he reads over and over emails I sent him prior to realizing he relationship ghosted me.  I mean he reads them everyday‚Ä¶then this week he started sending me blank emails.  They aren‚Äôt spam I checked the email address in the header and it‚Äôs correct and nothing looks off or suspicious.  After a few times I responded because I thought it was an error just telling him this was happening as an FYI (stupid me).  They‚Äôve continued to arrive and just seeing them is bothersome to me.  Why: I feel like it‚Äôs either a mind game and he never cared about me at all so everything he said and did was total bs and why anyone would do that to a mom and little girl (she was 3 when we started dating) and involve his own two kids is so sick. Or 2. He doesn‚Äôt know what to say and it‚Äôs a way of letting me know he‚Äôs there 
Today I finally sent him an email saying to stop sending them unless he was trying for positive communication leading to something healthy and good and if it was for an ego boost or to play with a toy, he needed a little girl, not a woman‚Ä¶I also said words don‚Äôt mean anything and I look at actions‚Ä¶.if he was testing the waters with me they were warm and friendly as always  I‚Äôve know him 20 years and he‚Äôs my best friend and I‚Äôm always here and while dating I never had a grass is always greener on someone else‚Äôs lawn  I was incredibly happy and felt lucky to be with him  I‚Äôm not responsible for his need for a self esteem boost 
In closing I said whoever he left me for to pursue or chase that she was providing the satisfaction and fulfillment and happiness he was seeking and I meant that because everyone deserves to be loved. 
He read that email 30 times today 
My question is why would he do this all week ? I was just finally feeling good, I won‚Äôt take him back unless he does the right thing which won‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶.
Now I‚Äôm kind of down and thinking about him  before this I stopped and was refocused. 
What does he want? I blocked him on text and iMessage so he couldn‚Äôt message me but blank? I need advice‚Ä¶thx",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/red6q4/my_boyfriend_ghosted_me_after_4_years_of_dating/

91,refeul,1639277834,Communication (lack of),"I‚Äôm a little conflicted about communication between dates. I (42f) have been on a few dates with someone (53m) with a fair amount of time (two weeks on average) between each one. We‚Äôre both single parents, and hIs job requires frequent (like every other week) travel. It‚Äôs a balance that‚Äôs so far so good working for us. We have a great time when we‚Äôre together. The time flies. 

It‚Äôs the time in between our dates that feels awkward to me. Usually we don‚Äôt see each other for two weeks. Initially (prior to the first time we met), we were communicating on the dating app. Then we switched to texting trying to figure out when to see each other again. After our last date, he texted me before I even got home, and we exchanged a few more messages that night and the next day. He called me that weekend, and we talked late into the night. 

Since then, he‚Äôs traveled for work and the communication has been lagging. I get that he‚Äôs busy with his work travel. But I‚Äôm nonetheless disappointed that I didn‚Äôt hear from him for five days. I should mention that he is recently divorced, and I suspect I am the first woman he has dated. 

He tried to call me a few nights ago wanting to plan our next date. Due to the difference in time zones, it was very late for me and I missed his call. I sent him a text the following morning that I‚Äôd love to talk later in the day to figure out a date. He replied that he was traveling and would ‚Äútry to connect‚Äù with me the following day. I told him that waiting to talk to him meant I could miss out on finding a sitter but if we could tentatively just name an evening, I could get a head start on my childcare. We ended up picking an evening at the end of next week. The following day (yesterday) was the day he‚Äôd said he would call. He didn‚Äôt. Now I‚Äôm feeling slightly annoyed. I haven‚Äôt talked to him in a week aside from the few texts about trying to get a date on the calendar and needing to find a sitter. 

In my past experience, too much texting is bad. I can‚Äôt get a sense of how interested a man is if I keep texting him asking him about his day or whatever. So I‚Äôve tried not to repeat my past mistakes and have only texted in response to his messages to me. Also I feel like it‚Äôs been ingrained in my head that women shouldn‚Äôt pursue men (I know that could be an unpopular thing to say).

Today I finally caved and sent him a text asking him how his weekend was going. I know I want to hear from him and I thought (hoped?) he also wanted to hear from me. Communication feels important when you‚Äôre only seeing someone once every two weeks. Since I sent the text, there has been radio silence from him. I can see he‚Äôs been on the app/site where we met. I guess my question is a rhetorical one. This is a red flag, isn‚Äôt it? 

Should I just ignore him or wait until a day or two before our date to ask if he still wants to go out? I‚Äôm still very interested in him, but the communication (lack thereof) is a problem for me, and especially that he completely ignored my text today.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/refeul/communication_lack_of/

I thank everyone for taking the time to comment, even the ones I didn‚Äôt love reading. I needed to hear it all.  

He told the ex wife a day or two after I posted this, and she outwardly did not seem to care, which is what I think the appropriate reaction should have been. I didn‚Äôt ask the details of the conversation but he said her only concern was is he dating someone she knows (the answer is no). That‚Äôs it. He is currently in his home state visiting for a few days, his family and friends anyway. He may run into her in those circles and this does not bother me at all. I don‚Äôt believe he wants to reconcile with her but if he did, I would wish him well. I would be sad but I would absolutely be happy for them both. 

We spent a happy and quiet little Thanksgiving together. I hope the same for Christmas. 

I had and have zero interest in forcing  people to meet who are not ready.  Seven months is enough for some and not for others, and as I said the truth came out which is that it wasn‚Äôt family related at all but that he was nervous to tell his ex. What his reasons were I don‚Äôt fully understand, but I do love that he is sensitive and cares. I don‚Äôt love that he lied to me and I was clear that is a boundary that crossing won‚Äôt be tolerated again. Some of you intuited that he was used to dealing with a high conflict partner, which I am not, and I think that was a contributing factor to not wanting to tell her and in being dishonest with me. 

A lot of you were so up in arms about him being legally married when we started dating. I came to the internet to ask so I have to take all the commentary I asked for but I still don‚Äôt feel bad about it. A marriage is a legal contract at its core. The emotion and commitment had fled long before we were together and physical and legal separation combined with really having deep conversations and knowing my partner were enough for me. There is no one size fits all answer, but I was having the best time dating around and sure wasn‚Äôt so desperate to settle with a man that I would accept a married one. I fell in love with a great guy who still had paperwork to do. 

I appreciate the time spent reading and the answers I got! Thank you!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rent7p/update_thinking_about_ending_it/

99,req099,1639319023,How do you know when someone is insecure,"I‚Äôm (44F) consciously working on becoming more confident in who I am. I used to be and my ex husband subtly drilled my confidence and light down to nearly the pit of hell before he left me. It‚Äôs been a few years and I feel at a place where I can maybe have a good time just dating and getting to know people.. 

TLDR I am consciously working on my thinking and approach. Fake it til you make it right? So what are some things you see women do that make you wonder or notice she is dealing with self image problems? 

I‚Äôm healthy, I‚Äôm average. Technically I‚Äôm 3‚Äù taller than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù American woman (67‚Äù vs 64‚Äù) and 20lbs less than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù woman (155# vs 176#) but am the average size 10, more soft than toned, average looks, etc. etc. I‚Äôm fine with all of this and don‚Äôt even consider it really in any other area of my life but now thinking of dating, of someone kissing me at the end of a date and feeling my love handles or notices the spider veins I have (not horrible ones) or stretch marks. One reason for this (of many) was when my ex and I first started dating, I mentioned I was struggling with my body and he said ‚Äúit was no big deal but when I was holding you I did notice the little squish (roll) on your side‚Äù‚Ä¶. I was 135# at the time and no kids. 

I‚Äôve had a few abdominal surgeries and have scars there and on my breasts (didn‚Äôt get implants, was another procedure.) Do I warn a guy before he sees? I‚Äôm not Frankenstein there but it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôve had some surgeries. I also have diastases recti which is where the ab muscles are separated from pregnancy and leave that pooch/skin above the pubic bone and am having to get that repaired along with a breast reduction (three pregnancies was not kind to my body and yes I exercise and eat healthy). 

It‚Äôs just been a long time since I dated‚ÄîI got married at 23‚Äìand I had much more body confidence then.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/req099/how_do_you_know_when_someone_is_insecure/
