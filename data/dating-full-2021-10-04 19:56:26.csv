We matched on Hinge a few days prior and had exchanged numbers, texted back and forth for a day or so, and agreed to meet up (his (32/m) initiation) - this happened in less than a week's time. 

The majority of the date had all the good signs - easy, flowing, and engaging conversation, occasional physical touching, and an inexplicably great goodbye hug (not an awkward, quick one like at the end of bad dates - it's like we got as close to each other as possible in those moments and hugged a little longer and tighter than you normally would).

However, I'm thrown off by a few things that happened towards the end of the date. At one point, he said he ""sucks at dating"" and would ideally like to meet his next partner by being friends first and then evolving into a relationship. Then, instead of hinting at a next date, he invited me to participate with him in upcoming group events he was *tentatively* planning on scheduling. (To top it off, I'm the one who had to send him a post-first date text the next day.)

I guess my question is, if this guy were into me, why would he invite me to a \[tentative\] group hang instead of scheduling another date? I get he prefers a friendship to evolve into a relationship, but if that's the case, why is he on a DATING app? Is he only half interested and just keeping me in his lineup?

We may still be in that 'Honeymoon' phase where you overlook a lot of your partners' faults and such but we seem to have excellent chemistry.

I don't know if I'm physically attracted to this girl. I'd say she's average (and I am too), but my physical attraction for her seems to come and go. I feel like questioning the relationship over physical appearance is a shallow approach, and since everything else is wonderful I should 'settle' and enjoy all of the awesomely positive things about this relationship. 

I haven't been in a lot of LTRs and I'd say I'm fairly inexperienced, hence my concern as to whether I'm making the right decision or not.

I’ve been on dating apps for a while now and get a couple of matches a week. Every time the convo either never starts or dies off pretty fast.

However now I use tinder. And I’ll be honest I kind of just want to have sex again. My sex drive has been pretty high the last couple of months and although I’m looking for a relationship I do just want to get a bit fruity with someone.

The day after a date, what are your expectations on post date etiquette?
For some background, this woman and I text daily for about 2 weeks.
Good morning, good night and everything in between. She canceled on me 2 hours before our first date, and I had to cancel our second date but we survived it.
I drove 2 hours total, spent $140 on dinner and drinks.

She was going to a football game the next day, and I didn’t hear from her at all.

I sent her a text at noon asking how she was, then at 7:30 again.

She text me the next day asking why I would “keep sending texts” and that she told me she was busy.

I didn’t know there was a no contact order in place.

She told me she didn’t want to see me again.

She was beautiful, funny, flirty, attracted to me - we had electric chemistry and I couldn't stop thinking about her for a solid 10 days after we met. I know it sounds so dumb... perhaps even borderline creepy (but what can I say, I fell deep so suddenly). I hit her up and got a date out of her, but then she invited her friends I met before and I was just pissed off and didn't see them - never confirmed on it. 

Wrote her a message the next morning explaining I think I caught feels and I was hurt she invited other people. I want to get over her, but it's been 2 weeks since and I can't stop thinking about her for more than an hour at a time. 

I've met other girls since but no one can live up to her. It hurts and I don't know what to do now. I tried messaging her back asking for a drink but no reply. What advice would you give this idiot? Pfft, feels good to get off my chest

I asked him why he was on bumble and he said “i used back home for a casual hookup but i never did it because i was too shy” and i said “yeah same”

so then we talked about meeting up and we did. we met in a park and he bought wine for us and we talked for a bit and we actually have a bit in common. and he even talked about me seeing him in his city. Then we went somewhere and started making out. He was kissing me a lot on the cheek and making eye contact. Then we started to walk around and he was holding my hand and putting his arm around me.

Then we hooked up hooked up and after when i would’ve thought he should’ve left (like right after hooking up) he asked me if i wanted to sit down somewhere and he cuddled me and would kiss me on the cheek and being and said “we can see eachother again when i come back here if you’re down?” and i didn’t even ask

then i had to leave to catch the next bus and i kissed him bye. 

The next day he didn’t text me, which i guess is normal for a hookup but it made me sad. So i texted him and said “thanks for last night, i had a good time :)” and he said “no worries. thank you too haha, i enjoyed it as well ;)” and then i just liked the message and he texted “i hope we will meet again when i come back to town” and i told him to let me know when he’s back in town and he said sure.

So the deal with him is i live in spain and he lives in france. Which is like an hour plane ride . His immediate family lives here so he comes to visit, so i know that he will be back i just don’t know when. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him since then, i keep myself productive and it helps but like in those moments where i’m not doing anything i just think about him and get sad and i think i miss him. It was my first attempt at meaningless sex, and he said it was his first time hooking up from an app as well, and we both hadn’t had sex in a bit. But i liked him, so i can’t make it meaningless in my mind.

tldr; hooked up with guy from bumble, we got along pretty well. i liked him and even tho we both said we wanted a casual hookup i find myself missing him and wanting more and i’m sad about it a lot. he comes to my town to visit a lot because he has family here. what do i do?

For our first date we decided to go on a sunrise hike, so I picked her up at 4am and we hiked up a small mountain and just sat there talking. 


And when I mean talking, I mean we sat at the top and talked for 7 hours straight. I promise I'm not exaggerating when I say 7 hours. We saw the sunrise at the top, and if we stayed for a few more hours we would have seen the sunset. 


We clicked instantly. Our life philosophies align perfectly, she's very smart, and we even love the same not-well-known artists. We hiked back down and I took her to a burger place. Then I drove her near an airport and we just kept talking and watching the airplanes take off and land. She gets cold really easily and I'm always really hot, so we hugged a bunch of times ""warm her up"". Then we got some ice cream, and I drove her home. 


She is a country girl, and I'm a basic city boy. She said that next time I come over she will make me go offroading in her jeep, fishing, and to a shooting range (since I've never done any of those things).


When I dropped her off I got out to get her bag from of my trunk, and we hugged. She said she had a really good day with me. I hesitated a few seconds too long but then I put my fingers under her chin and pulled her in for a kiss. I don't know if we kissed for one second or ten, but we pulled apart for a few seconds and then I kissed her again.

But I can’t tell if he is just a nice guy, looking for a friend or whether he likes likes me. So please help!!

Without going into agonizing, overthinking detail…I will do a pros and cons list of sort. Semi important details - we have been talking for 2 months and we have hung out 4 times (in the last 3 weeks - two weekends Saturday and Sunday in a row).

Things that make me thinks he likes me:

1. First week of us talking he asked me out to a local brewery (but never followed thru).
2. First time we hung out he brought me a gift, a hat he bought for himself but didn’t end up liking on him.
2. I mentioned my curtain rod fell off and he offered to re-install it. Which he did the first time we hung out. He is in the process now of patching the holes.
3. He looked at an hvac leak I was dealing with on the first night and helped me clean up some pooling water.
5. He makes eye contact while talking to me. He also asks questions about me and my life regularly.
6. He offered to help repair fallen patio lights and scaled two trees to attach the lights. Shimmied up the damn tree like spider man. Ultimately “couldn’t finish” so he has to come back next weekend.
7. He seems to be a tad nervous around me…talks a lot, can’t stop smiling, a little goofy.
8. Compliments me.
9. Remembers things we have talked about and recalls them.
10. He is a computer guy and I am building a computer so he is researching parts and stuff for my build.

Friendzone reasons

1. Every time he hugs me goodbye it’s a weak ass, not catching any romantic vibes at all hug.
2. There has been no moves made on his end. There has been limited grazing of the hand or what not. However, he turned the conversation sexual for a bit which I reciprocated. 
3. He is terrible at responding to texts. However, he does acknowledge it, apologies when it’s been too long and did explained why to an extent.
4. He hasn’t talked to his best friend (my besties husband) about me at all. Maybe that’s a guy thing…idk.

I don’t want to make a move or come off too strong cuz I will see him around and I don’t want to make it awkward.

I’ve been a little suspicious bc we don’t really talk about day to day what we are doing and just kinda hang out once to twice a week. But he has a girl friend from out of town here and she is staying with him for the week. He told me about this maybe three weeks ago and I thought in the moment that it was just a girl friend so didnt think anything of it bc I trust him and was under the impression we were just on the same page. This weekend has been weird and I got more suspicious bc he hadn’t brought her up since the day we talked so I thought maybe she wasn’t coming anymore. 

She’s here this weekend and I find out by his story post. Whatever I knew she was coming I knew we haven’t talked about what it is we’re doing so I just brushed it off. Until today. 

I had tried to get days off during the week so we can go places and he tells me he can’t get weekdays off until December. Yet somehow got today a Monday off. 

I decided bc I was already overthinking everything else may as well check the dating app we met on to see if he’s still active. He is. With recent pictures he’s sent me. 

I’m trying not to overthink this since we’ve never talked about what we are doing. We have exchanged the I like you conversation but that’s about it. I blame myself bc I have never brought it up I just assumed there was a mutual respect thing going and thought I knew him better.

I'm not about to write a wall of text about everything that's happened in my dating life, but I am feeling somewhat starved for affection and unlovable, so I hope you don't mind I vent a little here.

I'm not going to make excuses about my current state or blame this on someone else, I know my own weaknesses too well. I've lived with depression for as long as I can remember. I am quite neurotic. I have very little self-esteem. I have terrible social skills alongside some mild autistic traits. I have an uninteresting and bleak personality. I don't have any real talents. I'm struggling to get a decent and stable job despite having a masters. And I still live with my parents (actually quite common at this age where I'm from, but still makes me feel terrible). There's just too much weighing me down and none of this makes me a desirable person.

As I'm nearing my 30's I feel like I'm wasting my best years. I also feel like it's just getting increasingly harder to attract someone. I've been single I was 22. I've done my fair share of online dating over these years and it all amounted to two terrible hookups. I hate online dating with a passion as it just makes me feel more miserable, but I don't see any other way I could meet someone else.

I should state I have indeed gone to therapy for quite some time, but honestly I don't think it ever helped me. In fact, it only made feel worse over the money I've wasted on it. I've come to terms that this is simply who I am and there's no changing it. Instead I'm trying to force myself to detach completely from my sexuality and focus on other stuff, but no matter how much I try to repress it it still haunts me.

Let me tell you a bit about my dating history. 

I didn’t have my first date until I was 22 and I only went on four more dates until I met a guy named “Mark” last year. That was first real relationship and it only lasted for five months.  

A few days after I broke up with Mark, I met a recovering alcoholic on Hinge named “Luke” and we became fast friends. I fell so head over heels for Luke that if he had asked me to get him a diamond ring, I would have scoured the ends earth to find one for him!!! I would have done anything for this guy as long as it was legal and safe (and a part of me still would!). But he fell in love with someone else and I nearly had a breakdown over it. And despite everything…..I still keep in touch with him because he is still an amazing friend and an absolute angel.

In August, I formed a bit of an acquitanceship with a coworker named Steve. I took a bit of a shine to him and yesterday I gave him a note that pretty much said: “Hey, you seem like a cool guy and I would like to get know you better so I was wondering if you would like to go on a date.” I even included my phone number in the note in case he wanted to reach out that way. Today is my day off and I still haven’t heard from him. So, I guess it’s safe to assume that he’s not interested. 

And also……before anyone tells me that giving him a note was cringey….please understand that asking somebody out in person is extremely anxiety inducing for me and that was the only way i felt comfortable with taking such a risky move.

I talked to Luke crying about it and asked what it is that I am lacking. He told that he doesn’t think I am lacking anything but i don’t buy it. After all, if that was the case then why did he chose someone else over me?

I am just at my wits end. I just want ti know what it’s like to love and be loved and feel wanted, needed, and whole. But maybe I should come to grips with the fact that maybe there’s no soul mate for me and that’s a bit soul crushing…….😥😥😥😥😥😥😥",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1045851,public,self,I am just venting because I realize that I am probably meant to be single forever,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1ke1t/i_am_just_venting_because_i_realize_that_i_am/,all_ads,6,,,

I was starting to realize that my feelings for her had waned. And I decided to be upfront and honest with her and told her that it was a very hot and cold experience for me.

I responded by saying, I can't return those feelings. She said she wanted us to have a talk foreclosure. Next thing I know, she started saying, she can accept that she's further along in the development of feelings that I am and that she wanted to fight for us. And that she knows that some of our experiences were real. 

I know there's constant posts about men not listening to women. But I'm going to say the single overbearing truth that is the most neglected with denial in the dating world.

MEN ARE USUALLY TELLING YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT, WHO THEY ARE, AND HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT YOU 

Through both their actions and their words. But for whatever reason, unless a guy can be so direct that it's hurtful, women refuse to listen. I don't understand this concept. 

In other instances, I have prefaced in the beginning of situationships that I was emotionally unavailable and I was looking for something casual. Meanwhile some women would always try to turn the tide toward the relationship direction. I led by saying I only wanted something casual as a disclaimer so that we can be on the same page. They agree, yet are surprised when I remind them of our arrangement in the beginning. 

Again, I literally told them what I wanted and who I was from the beginning.

Immediately my thoughts went to the fact that he wanted to cheat but didn’t want the guilt of doing it. So I told him I didn’t think we needed a break and that I thought we’d be better off actually talking about the issues we’d been having. I also asked him if he wanted the break because he wanted to cheat with a particular female coworker that he had become close with. 

He got really defensive and we ended up having a huge argument. Before I left his place I told him he could have his break but not to count on me being there at the end.

I only talked to him a few times over the summer and not at all for most of September. Then a few weeks ago I went out with a group of my girlfriends for one of their birthdays. During our her together the birthday girl’s brother (let’s call him H) showed up to say hi.

He’s a really good looking dude, funny, kind of quiet. I like him, I always have but we’ve never been single at the same time before. He had grown a beard since the last time I’d seen him and I thought it made him look really sexy. I told him so and he seemed surprised and a little embarrassed. I thought his reaction was cute so I started to flirt with him more. At first it was just to make myself feel better and to see if he would flirt back. Which he did. 

We ended up hooking up that night and again the next morning. And afterwards I immediately felt guilty. I was almost in tears and H was worried and asked what was wrong. So I broke down and told him I felt guilty because even though I was on a break I still had a boyfriend. H felt bad and apologized for everything which made me feel even worse. He didn’t have anything to feel guilty for. Both of us were totally sober when we left the bar, he didn’t know about my boyfriend and I wanted it to happen. Besides I’ve always thought he was such a sweetheart and I don’t want to hurt his feelings because I was regretting my decision.

We talked about everything for a while and H promised to keep what happened between us. He said he had always liked me he was sorry if this fucked things up for me. I wasn’t sure what I was going to tell my boyfriend. For another week afterwards I didn’t have to deal with it. Then my boyfriend showed up at my place. He said he’d decided he wanted us to be together.

So I told him I’d like to work it out but we needed to be honest about what we’d been up to while we were on the break. He immediately got really intense and asked why. He wanted to know why I said that and had I been with someone. So I broke down and admitted what happened but I didn’t tell him it was with H. I kept his name out of it.

My boyfriend freaked out yelling and accusing me of cheating on him. I was in tears because I did feel guilty but I was also getting mad because the break was his idea. I never wanted it in the first place. Plus he’d gone most of a month without even talking to me. Finally I yelled at him that the break was his fucking idea. Not mine. The I asked him what he had done over the summer.

He got red in the face and didn’t say anything for a while. All he said was “I can’t believe you did this to me.” Then he left my place and we haven’t spoken since. I do feel bad for what happened but the break was not my idea. I also still haven’t heard from him what he was up to all summer. I’m not trying to defend what I did but he did tell me that he hadn’t been with anyone.

I talked to a couple of my friends about this and they all think he’s acting ridiculous. One of the people I talked to was H’s sister. I told her honestly what had happened between me and her brother. I wanted to get it out there and be honest with her. She said me and her brother are both adults and she and I would always be friends no matter what. She must have told H what happened because he called me to make sure I was okay and to apologize for messing up my relationship. He also told me he’d be willing to take the blame. I told him that wasn’t necessary. That my boyfriend was being irrational and that I’d be ok.

I’m giving him one more day then I’m going to call him and tell him that I think we need to end this relationship unless he’s willing to talk to me. I was honest with him, I feel that he hasn’t been honest with me. I’m not going to apologize because the whole “break” was something he wanted anyway.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1045969,public,self,My (24 f) boyfriend (24 m) wanted us to take a “break”.
