(If it helps for the post she seems like the ""cute and fun"" type of girl, there isnt a huge lot of info on her profile other than horse riding which i cant relate to at all, food and fun)

So I can either do the whole friendly introduction and pop up, like *""Hey, i'm this and that, so what do u get up to in ur free time?"" -* to make urself seem nice, make them feel comfortable before potentially chatting to u

Or I can go with an interesting conversation starter like *""if u were a crisp, what type of crisp would u be and why?"" (probably the one id go with) or ""what one thing could u not live without?"" or so on (basically the interesting question type stuff that articles say about) -* to pop up with an interesting question thatll hopefully make them wanna respond

The thing is different people/sources say that each approach is better, but I want to know **which approach is actually the best way to go?** Friendly pop up or interesting ice breaker?

I had some openings to insert something more flirtatious in our latest conversations but chose to refrain myself from doing it. Example, she jokingy mentioned one day how she has a lot of tension in her shoulders and how people run away from her when she asks for help with a shoulder massage because she does it all the time and it's annoying. Then I offered myself to help with that in case she couldn't find a solution for the problem. She said she'd hold me to that.  I mean, I want to ask her out again but I already did it back then and she said that she'd check the suggested day for any commitments but never confirmed anything.

5,opjvz9,1626978472,How do i kiss her on our second hike/date?,"Hi kind stranger,
thanks for reading my struggle. TL/DR at the end!

I met a girl a few years ago and we texted once every year for a few weeks. We lost contact and I messaged her again in February. For the next 4 months we wrote very long texts once every 7 - 14 days. While texting she seemed extremely friendly and we got a nice connection. Unfortunately we couldn't meet because she is studying in another city.
I found out that she likes to hike in the mountains, which is an activity that I wanted to start for months before i messaged her. So we met each other for a hike onto a mountain (we didn't call it a date though). It was amazing! I loved the view on top of the mountain and we had some really deep and amazing conversations. In the end she obviously enjoyed the trip as much as I did.
This was about 6 weeks ago. Since then we wrote in a quicker interval than before (about 2-3 days) and sometimes she sent a picture that included a part of her body or a picture of her together with members of her family that were related to the topics we were texting about. For example she sent me a photo of her and her sister and one with her parents on a mountain when she told me about a great hike they were currently doing.
And now we are going to meet each other on Saturday to walk up the same mountain as we did the last time.

I have had a small crush on her since we started texting again which intensified when we met. On our way down she dropped a hint that let me know that she is single and when I did the same she seemed a bit different for the rest of the hike, but in a positive way. One hour after I went home she texted me and asked for the picures that I took of us.
I have only had one longtime relationship before, so I am really inexperienced with dating. I would really like to kiss her on Saturday but I'm not sure how I can achieve this.
My idea would be to make some casual body contact while walking up. When we are on the peak and enjoy the romantic view, I'm going to show her some pictures on my phone. I will need to move closer to her for doing so and my arm will find its way around her shoulders. Then I will look her deeply in the eyes and say something like ""Hey (her name), there is nothing in the world that I would enjoy more right now than kissing you  - if you allow (friendly grin)

I'm pretty confident that she is at least a bit interested in me, but besides some hints I think that I figured out there is no solid evidence. She definitely likes me and enjoys spending time with me but I'm not sure how she feels about me.
Do you have any other ideas or tipps that you can tell me?
I really want to have cartainty if I have a chance to make her my gf, or if I'm already in the friendzone.

TL/DR:
Climbed a mountain with my crush and will be doing it again on Saturday. Need advice on how to kiss her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opjvz9/how_do_i_kiss_her_on_our_second_hikedate/

11,opkeg7,1626979931,Not attracted to people around me?,"I (27f) was born and raised in one of the larger cities in my state (US). Lived here my whole life,  and only left for a few years for college.  As a kid,  I was bullied really badly which had killed my confidence,  especially when it comes to dating.  Boys used to dare each other to ask me out due to my appearance and ""weird kid"" labels. Because of this,  I find it extremely hard to trust people. I have never had a relationship and even worried something was wrong with me as a teen because I was not attracted to men (or women,  for the record). I'd hear girls gushing over attractive guys and just not be able to see what they did. 

When I went to uni out of state,  I did not have these experiences. Guys treated me normally.  For the first time,  I started to find men attractive. I got crushes,  but didn't know how to act on them and really regret not doing so.  

After graduating I moved back home,  and still live there. However, I've noticed that I do not find guys attractive here at home. I don't see guys and think ""oh he's cute"" like I did in college. Idk if it's different demographics or past experiences or what. I see guys from other states and think they are attractive,  but never people here.  I think a big factor is demographics. I'm in a city with a lot of gang violence.  Most guys are in construction or other manual labor jobs. Most also have tattoos or piercings.  I do not find myself attracted to these types. I find tattoos and piercings a huge turn off. A few small tattoos I can tolerate but that's about it. I do not know what it is about manual labor professions. But I have a hard time being attracted to someone in one of those positions. It's very hard to explain,  but it is a preference for me. I do plan on moving eventually,  but finances have been keeping me from doing that at this point in time. Since I don't know how long it'll be until I can,  I don't want to hold off dating until I move.  It could be two months from now,  it could be 5 years.  I want to have kids eventually, and feel like I am ""running out of time"" for that. 

Is there a way to get over this issue with people in my area? 

If not,  i personally do not mind a long distance relationship. I feel like I would have a much easier time finding someone I was interested in outside of my state. I wouldn't even mind someone in another country,  honestly. I just don't feel attracted to people in my area. My issue with that though,  is idk how to meet people elsewhere.  All the dating apps I've tried only search your area,  and the few that allow you to search elsewhere only show you who ""liked"" you if you pay.  I don't pay for most dating apps,  I can't expect the guy to. I basically have to hope that guys I'm interested in are also looking in MY area despite not living there.

13,opkfi3,1626980014,I asked out my crush of 2 years who left my school and she said yes. Today she asked if we could be friends,"This is (basically) a throwaway account. 

I used to be good friends with this girl and we laughed and talked a lot in class and eventually I grew to have a crush on her. I was going to ask her to the dance but she was asked by another person. 

After she left my school, I was sad but I just lived with it because what are you going to do. Last month I talked to her and said I had a crush on her. She then asked me if I wanted to go on a date. She was on vacation for a few weeks before the date but I accepted and even though that date didn’t go according to plan and I just went to her house, we still talked a lot and I really liked her. 

I recently got a job and she showed up randomly which made my day. On the job (yeah I know) we talked for an hour and it seemed like that time flew by. After about a week, I asked if we could go on another date, she said sure but said it would have to be a few weeks in the future because she was going and doing stuff.

I said that’s alright but today, I got a text from her and she asked if I could talk. I said “Yo, what’s up.” My heart was beating at this point. She said that she didn’t want to sugar coat it and said we should stay friends. My heart sunk at this point and I said something along the lines of not forcing her to do anything but said we didn’t really give it a chance because I’ve only seen her 2 times since I first asked her 4 weeks ago. She said that we vibed better as friends and she didn’t want to string me along because she cares about me.

This came as a surprise to me because she came up with a nickname she called me (like a stereotypical boyfriend nickname) and I came up with one as well and she said it sounded cute. She also said how she wanted to watch a bunch of movies with me which I was really looking forward to. 

I’m not sure what I did wrong or what was wrong. Was I too nonchalant or did I take too much of a friend role and not a dating role? I’m just bummed out at this point.

19,opl08h,1626981677,How many people do you date simultaneously and for how long?,"It’s my first time posting here, but I’ve been a long time lurker. Feel free the scroll past the backstory to get to the question.

Backstory 

So I’ve (27M) have been getting back into the dating world post lockdown. I’ve been on a few first dates and one of them I felt we clicked (we also kissed, which I always think is a good sign) so I asked her (26F) out for second date. We went to the theatre (Shakespeare’s dome as it’s the only one open atm) as she mentioned she liked it and missed it over lockdown. We then went to a nice wine bar near the Thames. Also kissed, held hands, ect 

Third date we had to do mid week after work as I was going away that weekend on holiday. I would have preferred to do something more interesting than go to a pub, but it seemed to work as we got lost in conversation for hours and I missed my train. We snogged for a bit then decided to go to a cocktail bar near the station while I waited for the next train. We didn’t drink much (both of us had maybe two glasses of wine that evening), but she wanted to snuggle in a corner and make out. After a while, I got the glaring ‘find a room’ eye from the waiter so I said something like, “I don’t want to go home tonight.” She replied that she wasn’t ready to sleep with me, which I am totally fine with. We discussed going on another date outside of London the week after and she was keen, even suggesting places to go and that she would book somewhere if I promised to drive.

I went on holiday that weekend (just a long weekend). We exchanged a few messages throughout the weekend, but it was hard to get signal where I was. On Tuesday I asked If she was still free on Friday or Saturday and after a few hours I got a standard rejection text. It said something like it’s been great, but I can’t date you because of personal reasons. I was a bit taken aback by this as everything was looking good up till then. Generally I expect a rejection text after the first or second date and usually because it didn’t go so well. I was letting my guard down because the first three dates had gone so well and she was the one who suggested the next.

Anyway, I took it on the chin and tried to move on. No point trying to change her mind after she has made a decision. But I couldn’t make the u turn make sense in my head, so a week later I buckled and texted her back. I said I was bit confused at the u turn and asked if it was anything I said. At that time I thought it was me suggesting we sleep together, and I was quite worried I screwed it up by offending her somehow with that comment. She replied saying she knows it was a sudden u turn, but there was another guy in the picture. I texted something like “ok. Thanks for cleaning that up. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.” Tbh I was pretty gutted that she chosen someone over me. 


Question 

Usually for me I will only ask a girl out on a second date if there is a good connection and something clicks. For second dates I try and do something fun that she likes and is usually the whole evening (comedy show, or theatre, ect than maybe dinner or a wine/cocktail bar) so I get a pretty good clue if we are a good match. I usually only ask someone out on a third date if I see something developing and don’t really count dates from there (the start of the dreaded grey zone). 

That usually that means by the time I’m at a fourth date I’m not seeing anyone else. I don’t intentionally do it, just happens because of the way I date. I guess she (the girl above) was dating multiple guys and chose one when things developed. Is this normal? Is there some rule that people people follow? Surely people can’t date multiple people beyond like two dates at the same time? That would be exhausting 😅

I just really want to know when I can start to relax and let my barriers down without being in eternal competition with others? I suppose for me I not very experienced at the grey zone because my last two relationships got through that without much difficulty. What is the norm here? What do you do?

22,opldb4,1626982770,My partner (F21) has been dating her EX (21M) right under my (20M) nose,"I (20M) began dating my gf, in December of 2020. We met as neighbors at University in October and immediately became more than just neighbors or friends. She came to visit, met my family, went on a family vacation, created a lot of great memories. Let it be noted that she was my first girlfriend and I was head over heels for her but had some relationship anxiety about ""doing things right.""

Fast forward to late March her ex-bf, M, from about a year prior had reached out that he had found some of her stuff and wanted to return it. No issues for me. Turns out they reconnect and agree to meet up for drinks to catch up. Still no issues with me. I hear nothing about him for 2 weeks until I am headed out of town for a few days and she tells me that she is going to invite him to her and her roommate's party while I am out of town. I am a little on the edge here but I have no reason to no trust her so I tell her I am okay with it. As we are neighbors, I tell her that if he tries anything, such as trying to sleep in her bed, she can walk across the street and sleep at my house.

You can guess it. He tried to sleep in her bed, but she didn't do anything about it. She slept with him. Tells me that nothing sexual happened but I still never looked at her bed the same, knowing that another guy had slept in it.

I find this out the next day when I return to town. I don't know how to react so I leave town again to go to a friend's GF birthday party. Me and B text interminably throughout the night. I come back into town only to be sitting outside and see B and M pull up outside. This made me so uncomfortable as she told me she was so sorry for sleeping with him, yet proceeds to continue hanging out with him.

I forgive her for hanging out but a few nights later she leaves her laptop open and I look through her texts with him. I know, very invasive and I regret it, but what I did find was texts with him from the night of the party. From what I could figure out he left the party and she texted him ""Come back. I want you here."" The other one that stuck out to me was a text with a picture of a song saying ""This song still reminds me of you.""

Now I am really uncomfortable. They hang out a few more times. Going on a hike, meeting up to grab food. Any time B and I got into a fight, she would go hang out with M. Eventually, he leaves town for the summer and it feels like a weight is lifted off my shoulders.

Then one night in early June we are laying in bed and snap chatting her friends and I notice that they have the 'red heart' on Snapchat. Meaning that they are each other's best friends for at least 2 weeks. This is immediately a red flag to me. Texting here and there and meeting up for lunch with an Ex is fine but this hurt knowing that she was in touch with him that much.

I try to be supportive of her friends and that includes M. Last week, M returned to town and asked B to go to dinner. B invited 2 friends, but not me. I spend all night freaking out. I trust her but I didn't know why it was so hard for me. Eventually, she comes home and I have a full-blown panic attack. To the point that I can't breathe. In the midst of this, I tell her it's me or him. She says she doesn't do ultimatums.

Actually, she was hot and a lot of guys in the company were trying to chase her, but at least it's not me at that time.

After one month, she starts showing hints that she likes me, or I think it is. Ex: invite me to go to have lunch with her, reaching me on the company chat tool just to says some nonchalant things, sharing a lot about her feeling, her dream, or her perspective ...

The strange thing is she was doing the same thing with another guy on the team. He is a good guy, attractive, smart and we have a really good relationship with each other, just like brothers. But bc of this, our relationship became ridiculous. I mean the ways she was being nice with both of us at the same time really confused me. And it's preventing me from making a move with her.

27,oplr5w,1626983917,Should I keep pursuing?,"A bit of background between me(28m) and her(28f). We went through school together, real good friends. There was always something there we both knew it and spoke about it. Went a bit further than friends but then she went off to uni and I went through my apprenticeship. Few years go by and the next I hear she is getting married, bought her first house with her fiance and has the job she worked so hard to get through her studies. I hand on heart honestly couldnt be happier for her. When that all fell apart though she reached out to me and I did what any good friend would do and gave her an ear to listen to and a shoulder, nothing more. At this point I was travelling around the country working long hours and had no access to my mobile until night time so couldnt be there for her as much as I wanted to, time passes and she meets somebody else and goes through another rough breakup. This time she came to me I was home though and gave her a lot of my time, I let her know too that my feelings had never changed but I was whatever she needed me to be, and at that point it was a good friend so I listened and gave advice. Since then we have talked, feelings have came back from both ends, ive had her round my family and my mother invited her out for a birthday bash alongside both my sisters and some friends. Now while this birthday bash was going on I was working away so couldn’t make it. She declared her love for me to my family and couldn’t sing my praises enough. The night was supposed to end at my mothers with her staying in the spare room. Instead she decided to go to a party with my sisters, which is fine, but she decided to sleep with one of the guys at the party, while my sister was there. Im not too fussed about her enjoying herself as we aren’t really together but to declare all her feelings for me to my sisters and then do that while she was there made my sister feel uncomfortable and I feel disrespected. I dont know If im over reacting cos it is super early days for us but the fact she had that lack of respect for my sisters and done what she did has me wanting to cut losses and stay friends.

29,oplxxp,1626984451,I had a really weird date/hookup last night and I’m not sure how to feel,"Hi! 

So I am a girl and I have been seeing this girl recently. We are in our early 20s. We met on a dating app and our first date was amazing. We went to a fancy restaurant and ended up hooking up later that night. It was great and we had so much chemistry. Anyways from the very beginning I knew that she doesn’t want anything serious because she goes to school in another state and only comes back to my town to visit family. I’m okay with nothing being serious. So I was excited to see her again so she came over to my apartment to spend the night. 

Now this is where things got kinda weird. So I had to call her a Lyft because for some reason she got banned from the app or something.  I was okay with that whatever. So I the Lyft driver is pulling up to my apartment. And I see that she was sitting in the front seat of his car. I thought that was odd and she was also holding his hand. She tells me that she almost had sex with him. And when she was in the Lyft she didn’t text me the whole ride so I feel like she did something with him. He was also an old man so weird.  When she gets out the car I noticed that she’s not sober like she’s drunk. 

And then we walked over to the elevator and there was this random guy and she starts to flirt with him. And getting really sexual with him in front of me. And then gets his number and she wanted us to go to this 
Random guys apartment like tease him or have a threesome. She was like let’s have fun we’re young. I just didn’t think it was safe to go to the guys apartment. I told her i wasn’t down for it.he seemed like a really sketchy guy and I got a bad vibe from him. The first hour we were hanging out she kept bringing him up and asking me if I want to go. But I just wanted to spend time with her. And I know this isn’t anything serious between us and again I’m fine with that. We still ended up hooking up last night and it was good. But her behavior last night just made me feel kind of bad. I’m okay with her being free and wanting to bring other partners to hookup with us. But not random strangers. I don’t know if I should keep on seeing this girl. I just thought  it it was so weird the way she started out the night. And I’m okay with her being open about her sexuality and seeing other people I’m seeing other people to. But I still think it was kind of rude to flirt with someone in front of me maybe because she was drunk?

31,opmbcz,1626985591,Is this needy behaviour?,"I've been dating my boyfriend for 7 months, we are both 30.

Typically we message a few times a day, and then hang out a couple times a week in the eveing as well as nearly every weekend. We spend good quality time together. The most important part of our communication that makes me feel secure is that we send each other a good morning and good night text. I like this because it starts my day off happy and ends my day happy and there's no pressure to keep in touch rampantly throughout the day. It works for him as well since his job is demanding. 

Lately its happened more frequently where I message him to say goodnight and he just doesn't reply. This is new behaviour and makes me feel a little bit sad. It happened again last night, we were both at our apartments watching TV. I texted him and said I was headed to bed, sweet dreams, talk tomorrow. He ignored the message and I went to bed and maybe from the foolish feeling of being ignored by my own boyfriend I started to cry and then texted him ""sometimes I really wish you'd remember to say goodnight :(""

He messaged me in the morning apologizing, but seemed kind of fed up and annoyed.

33,opmk8i,1626986339,(F18) Tinder match blocks me out of nowhere. Could someone tell me a possible reason as to why he did?,"I was talking to a guy for a couple weeks and it seemed to be going fine. 

In the beginning, he was skeptical of me being a catfish so he made me send a live selfie. I didn’t have a problem with that since he said he had been catfished before. 

The biggest highlight of our conversations was when he straight up said that he wanted to get to know me since we had similar hobbies. Never mentioned sex, hookups, or anything of that nature. 

We didn’t go a day without snapping each other and he always seemed to know what to say next after me messaging him. 

However, I’m on the autistic spectrum which can make me a bit awkward when trying to carry a conversation with a potential date. I didn’t want him to tell him that and had hoped to wing it instead. There were times in which I could tell he was weirded out by the way I talked. It made me anxious, which made me randomly apologize to him for being “bothersome.” He said “no not at all” which got my hopes back up. 

I thought what I had been doing was working, since he expressed how keen he was to meet up for tacos in order to get to know me further.

On a separate occasion, someone at work commented that I look younger than I am so I thought it was funny. Being the genius I am, I had the brilliant idea to make that a subject of a conversation with my Tinder match. Yeah, not so smart. 

On the day after, we had our usual conversations about our hobbies/what we did that day. Then the day after that, it happened. He had suddenly vanished from my snapchat list of friends and his username was no longer searchable. 

I was very upset, as I jumped to the conclusion of him rejecting me out of fear of seeing me as an embarrassment. Perhaps he also could have been suspicious of me being underage.

I feel like the world’s biggest noob at dating so I’ll appreciate anyone who’s more experienced who can clear this up for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opmk8i/f18_tinder_match_blocks_me_out_of_nowhere_could/
34,opmuz3,1626987249,Am I overreacting or should I walk?,"Hi everyone! I (28F) have been dating someone (34M) for about 3 weeks. Dates have been pretty good, and we have had sex twice at his place. Communication flows easily and freely. He seems to be candid about lots of things, and keeps sort of closed off about past relationships and relationships in general. He seems like a good guy and there’s definitely compatibility. Sex is maybe too good…it may be the only thing he’s reached out to me over (to come to his house)

Dates at his house are better than ones in public, as he seems to not be fully himself in public for whatever reason. 

Anyway, he’s never been a great texter and really doesn’t text me that much to check in. He will sometimes even ignore my texts, though that it rare. It’s more like he won’t answer for 24 hours or something. Which gives me major anxiety. I figured, it’s too early to really nag on him about it, so I just let it go, until the other day when I invited him over my aunts house for drinks. He didn’t respond, and I called him out and checked with where he’s at. He said he was hesitating because he isn’t sure he wants to be in a relationship. He asked me if a relationship is what I want to jump into. I had to say that yes that was the eventual goal but he didn’t have to commit tomorrow.  I think inviting him to my aunts house freaked him out and that’s understandable. 

He said he could eventually see it going there (a relationship) after a bit of me prodding, but I’m not super convinced. I told him he has to plan the next date (just tell Me where and when) and that we should refrain from going to each other’s houses.

I’m just wondering if I should keep wasting my time with him when communicative effort seems very minimal. Yes, it’s early stages but if a guy is excited about you shouldn’t he be a little more enthused about communications and planning dates, and seeing me even? Not texting back within a few hours seems unreasonable. It’s possible I am overreacting and asking too much of him on the onset, but I just can’t shake this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opmuz3/am_i_overreacting_or_should_i_walk/

We talked for months. Seemed great at first, we had a lot in common. He portrays himself as a good guy who doesn’t like drama and is looking for love which is HILARIOUS. Quickly realized he had a bit of a temper and liked to gaslight but I have anger issues myself so I let it go. He claims he “lives with his baby mama for his autistic son” (seems like he used him as a scapegoat a lot ). Lmaooo gave him the benefit of the doubt. He would randomly switch plans, randomly go ghost, randomly be DRY and then other times seem really into me. He would get unreasonably angry or depressed when I said anything bad about how I felt about the crap he was doing lmao

I wished him well 🖕🏽 He called me crying and sniffling about how whole he felt with me, how he missed me, how he wanted to be there for me. Check this line out: “I need you to believe you deserve this love.” LMAOOOOO. 

Next day he’s being dry again. I said f this, asked him why he would fake cry on the phone and called him insane. He then said I was lying about a rape I experienced and BLOCKED ME...so I cussed him out. Then he threatens me with DFCS and tells his baby mama I said their son should die (TF). This causes her to text me and we argued which led to her telling me they’re MARRIED, but really aren’t together.....and she said that’s because he’s a paranoid schizophrenic. an abuser with no job, car, or even a license with his mother as his legal guardian who doesn’t take care of his son 😂😂😂😂

44,opob1t,1626991588,When my world broke apart (part 2).," Follow up to ""Met a Girl in the psych ward"". More details than last time and filled in some blanks from my diary.

Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.

So we were about 10 patients and a lot of staff at a 24/7 facility. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. After maybe 2 weeks when I was a little more used to the place, one of the staff asked if I had seen this girl yet. I had to admit that I haven't seen her. The nurse,my main contact, a Latina in her 50s and pretty for her age said that it was the pretty one.  


I had no idea until a few days later when my contact introduced me to her. She was indeed pretty and seemed healthier than the other patients. She seemed like a cool girl who didnt really care too much about anything or anyone.  


She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasnt interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.

I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.

I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.  


We watched a lot of Tv shows and talked. Our favorite was catfish. I cant say exactly when we started flirting but it clicked right away. It started with her asking if I wanted a cup of coffee and our hands briefly touched.  


It became a routine. A lot of coffee and often tea. My favorite was mint and hers was vanilla. She started asking me a lot of questions eventually. Very deep and direct questions. What I would do if I had all the money in the world, if I was the only person left in the world and so on. She was an extrovert and I was more of an introvert but with her, conversations was just easy and I contributed just as much as her.

The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.  


We always sat at the same table during meals. We also had a couple other patients we usually sat with and had conversations with. Also some of the staff liked to join us.  We played Mario Cart and her laughter when I touched her arm the first time was hard to describe. I fell in love with the sound of that laughter.   


She was also a good singer so we played sing star. I wasn't the best but she enjoyed it a lot, and I appreciated her talent. And there was a painting room at the hospital. She was good at painting. And we often had group therapy sessions where we tried to paint something based on a theme.

She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasnt too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.

I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated. So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.

So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.

I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasnt ready and to be honest I wasnt really ready myself. So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.

We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps. And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.

So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors. They also became good friends. 

Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.

I started visiting my sister quite often. My sister was often out of town too so I had the keys to her apartment. So I met her more and more often over the next months. Usually Friday-Sunday was the best I could do and we could go on 10 hour long dates. We went bowling, we watched Netflix sometimes or walked for hours.

It was still somewhat dysfunctional. She could have episodes where she didn't answer my texts for 7 days while lying in her bed crying all day. Dating me was stressful for her. It was stressful for me too but over time we came to understand each others illnesses better.  


So that leads us to where we are today. I visited her city this week. She was a little ill and hard to communicate with the first two days. But it got better and better. We have known each others for 4 years now and we still haven't kissed.  


We went buying some bubble tea and she tasted mine without even asking. Then we walked for an hour or so trough a park. I have learned that I need to make her stop up every now and then and sit down or she will just get stressed and walk on forever.  


So after a little while I gave her a back massage. She asked for it since I touched her neck earlier. She got stressed out after a few minutes and wanted to walk again. So we walked a little more before sitting down under a tall tree. I laid down on the grass and asked her if she had heard this new version of the song ""Begging"".  


So we laid there for a little while listening to my Spotify. Then I asked her if I could take a personality test on her to figure out what personality she was in Lucifer (a very good show btw). The test took about 10 minutes and she turned out to be an ENFP which was the Goddess of all creation. I on the other hand scored as an INFJ or Maze, Lucifers demon bartender.  


I followed her home and she showed me around her apartment and told me it was almost done. She just needed a kitchen. We sat on her couch for half an hour or so and just relaxed. When I left, I expected that to be it for now but she told me that she needed to relax for a few hours and that maybe we could meet up later tonight.  


So 2 hours or so later at around 9pm we met up again and went for a pretty long walk. It was still hot outside despite it getting late. We eventually got to a lake and she suggested we test the temperature. So we took our shoes off and sat there talking about reincarnation for a little while. A few fish were splashing around and we were all alone.  


She asked me if I wanted to go for a swim and I hesitated at first. A little self conscious of my own body. I told her that she had to go first. She hesitated as well and contemplated it for a good 10 minutes before she stripped off her clothes and was about to jump in.  


I did the same thing but I beat her to it and jumped in first. It was the perfect moment to kiss her. I held her face and touched her lips. Behind us came a bunch of guys and she pulled away. A little ashamed we got out of the pond and we had no change so we were dripping wet before walking back.  


The walk back was around an hour and we held hands a few times. None of us were dressed for a bath really so we looked like two half drowned cats while walking back home. We were back at around midnight. It was getting dark outside and we were standing under the full moon.   


I pulled her close with my hands on her waist. That was our first kiss.

He acts like everything is fine and try’s to insist I stay with him, but he’s horrible with communication and he acts strangely delusional. He put on a nice guy act a lot.

I ended up matching with this woman, we talked back and forth for awhile and I ended up asking her out and we met and spent about four hours on our first date, walked and talked and got pho. Our second date went the same, met at a bookstore and watched the fireworks on the 4th. I was too afraid to cuddle with her and hold her hand. She said all I had to do was ask. We went to the movies on our third date and we cuddled during both movies and kissed afterwards (my first btw) we weren’t going to hang out the following next week because of personal reasons. I ended up taking some bad advice and told her I wanted to be her boyfriend, which I know was too soon but I thought maybe it would be ok. She would go on to withdraw and not text me back as much despite saying she wanted to hang out still. Now it’s been 4 days since I heard from her and it sucks. I’m going to assume that she’s simply lost interest. I really want to know why but I’ve asked her to call me with no reply and I think I’ve texted her too often in her absence.

66,opq8a2,1626998116,Unhappy,"Hi, I’m 25m and my gf is 20F. I’m just not happy in this relationship and I wish it was different but I love her and I’m scared to be alone. I like to think I’m pretty emotionally responsible. I wouldn’t say super emotionally healthy but good at not projecting it or becoming codependent. My girlfriend is quite codependent relying on me for rides and to help with other responsibilities. I suppose I am a bit too, mainly emotionally since she’s the only one I really talk at length to. I feel like she just doesn’t care about me that much and she doesn’t want to bring much to the table. We live together with my dad at his house and I do most of the cleaning, cooking and miscellaneous home making. I don’t make a lot of money but I also have income to support myself despite not currently having a job, and I was employed for two years at a position up until recently. She works and helps financially but she doesn’t do much around the house and will just lay down and watch me work. She doesn’t seem to care about much at all and some days doesn’t even bathe. I know she has depression and I’ve been there for her but at times it’s very difficult for me too and I don’t feel like I can count on her to help keep the house in order, plus she almost never cooks anything for me not even microwave food or waffles. Sexually things are not great either, she doesn’t put much effort into trying to excite me and gives up on making me orgasm sometimes. I do a lot in the bedroom honestly because I’m scared of not being good enough and also because it makes me feel good to be able to pleasure a woman. She’s had the depo shot and now her vagina has a constant bloody taste to it but I still eat her out and I’m the only one who ever tries to experiment. She recently mentioned thinking she might be asexual and says she just doesn’t think of sex as often as most people. On top of all this our relationship has a rather strange start. She was dating a shitty friend of mine and through him we started getting closer and became best friends. He was an abusive piece of shit to her and I was there for her the whole time, though simultaneously we were flirting and she was gaining feelings for me. This situation escalated into her wanting to spend time with me romantically (their relationship was technically open) him bring a jealous manipulative person throughout The process and at some point, us having a foursome then a threesome and me being her second boyfriend. Eventually she broke up with him. I know it’s a story sponsored by red flag incorporated but we’re both messed up people and she was the only person I felt this kind of connection with. I didn’t really want to have the threesome but everyone else involved did and I felt weird being the wet blanket but I didn’t enjoy it and it kind of hurt the way I looked at her. After that she cheated on me one night about a week or two into our relationship and said she forgot that I was more than just a friend. I let her move in after that partially because I was scared to lose her after everything and partially because I didn’t want to be alone in this house anymore and partially because her only option left was staying at her dads which she would like to avoid because reasons. I just don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t feel like this relationship could ever be the picturesque thing sold to us by hallmark cards and I don’t feel like I can ever really trust her or love her in the normal capacity, and she doesn’t make any effort to make it better or to thrill me. It’s hard as a man to feel like I deserve to ask for more in a relationship, popular media generally has us believing the cliche of a woman giving so much to a man who doesn’t appreciate her it makes it difficult for me to not feel like an asshole for being unhappy when I’m not sexually satisfied, made to feel emotionally important, or given much assistance with the day to day toil. I’m scared I might be missing how much she actually cares and I might be ignorant to what she does for me and/or I might come off as entitled, but I’m just unhappy and I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong and it hurts feeling like no one will ever care about pleasuring me or making me happy. Should I break up with her? Should I convince her to let me sleep with other women? Should I demand that she takes me on dates and gets dolled up for me? (I just realized that I did not mention the many dates surprises and romantic gestures big and little that I’ve done to make her feel special and loved, things she told me no one has ever done for her, I always remember the snacks she likes, the books that makes her happy, what’s stressing her out, I give her massages and make mini spa days for her, I make edibles, fancy ones like candy and cheesecakes for her, I’ve wrote her love letters, bought her new shoes that were upgraded versions of the worn out ones she loved, took her on a daycation to a hotel, and regular date nights and romance). I just don’t feel good trying to make someone care about me if they don’t want to. It makes me feel pathetic and desperate to beg someone to care about me. I know this is probably my fault for investing in something that never showed much sign of giving back, but she’s basically the only person I like and I feel like I fucking hate her, because she doesn’t care about me and hurt me.

I’m 28f, never had sex or kissed anyone for that matter, will not have sex until I’m married (want him to show me he’s committed to me before this happens), non religious but I am spiritual, I’m into tarot and astrology, vegan, huge animal lover (I feed foxes every night too), into ‘conspiracy theories’, I tend to think outside the box and come up with random ideas and on top of all this... I have low self esteem!

My person must also be vegan ( a must!), non religious (otherwise we will definitely clash at some point), preferably a virgin, good looking and 5’11 or more at least, must be my age or older, not have kids, and is somewhat reserved like me.

All these sound impossible but I wouldn’t feel comfortable with him any other way. 

I only just realised how difficult it’s for me to find someone who could genuinely understand me after I downloaded a dating app and started talking with others. I was literally talking to a handsome and sweet guy but immediately started listing my criterias and asked him a whole lot about his life all too soon. I ended up unmatching him after I noticed how different I sound from other women.

Tomorrow will mark 30 days since I have spoken to her. The past 29 days have been some of the hardest of my life. The details of our breakup are complicated. But I have to admit that I still love her. At first I was mad and bitter. I was so angry at her. But I let that go a few weeks ago, and it felt like a weight off my shoulders. I've smiled a lot over the last couple of days while I think of how I miss her. I cared about her a lot. She cared about me too. 

There was a mountain trail that she and I used to hike up when we were together. We tried to get to the top twice, but something got in our way both times. So we never made it to the peak. Both of us wanted to get to the top so we could take pictures. 

I've decided that I'm going to make the climb tomorrow. It's the perfect metaphor for the grueling hike that I went through these past several weeks. Once I'm at the top, I'm going to make a final decision about whether I want her back or not. I'll either let her go - for good. Or I'll send her pictures from the peak as a peace offering. Wish me luck!

80,oprkz1,1627002750,Sick of being seen as a sex object,"TW: Sexual Assault

I (18F) really haven’t had many guy friends, but the ones I have had only compliment me and then say they want to do sexual things with me. When I say no, they have ghosted me. At school or other places boys would usually circle me and tell me the things they would like to do to my body. The guys I have been close with, usually don’t want to talk to me, all they do is touch me. 

Usually when I meet men they always begin conversations with either finding a way to comment about my chest or just saying that I am pretty (they have been from various races and ages). It’s gotten to the point where I have been sexually harassed and assaulted more times that you can imagine. Which had led me to be terrified of men. 

Every-time I think a boy actually likes me or wants to be my boyfriend. he always says he doesn’t like me that way and only wanted to hook up (this has happened more than once). I really don’t know what to do. For this very reason I have never had a boyfriend and am terrified of intimacy. 

I wouldn’t say I have a flirty personality or is how I dress. I am very shy and introverted, and am not really a party girl. I am also not easy to get, and never post on social media. I do have a larger chest, an hourglass figure, but I don’t really dress to show off my body. 

It does suck because I do think I am a very interesting person and think my personality is way better than my body. but no guy wants to date me for that or see me as a person for that matter. I don’t even know if I should believe when they call me hot or beautiful, because it seems as though they just say it to have sex. I just feel disgusting…

Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oprkz1/sick_of_being_seen_as_a_sex_object/
81,oprnuj,1627003038,Heartbroken over a short term relationship (17 yrs old female),I met a boy about a month ago in school. He approached me and we started walking to class together and seeing each other in school a lot after that. A few weeks later we started talking and getting more serious. Unfortunately things ended a few days ago when I went over to a male friends house (which I told him about before leaving and he chose to ignore the message) that he knew of to hang out for a little. Like I said I told him about the guy numerous times and told him that I was going to see the guy too that day. While I’m hanging out with my friend he calls me and asks me where I’m at . I explain to him that I already told him that I was going over there before I left. Right after that he hangs up and texts me to never talk to him again. I call him numerous times and he ignore the calls and continues to blow up my phone with messages saying I ruined it. I ended up leaving my friends house and rushed home to continue calling the guy I was talking to. Basically in the end he said he was done with me and blocked me/unblocked me numerous times. Now I’m unblocked and he tried to text me saying what I did was was wrong. I felt like by him texting me he was giving me mixed signals like he forgave me so I said to him “what’s the point of texting me if it’s over” to see what he would say and he said “ok I won’t text you then” and I left it at that. The next day he asks me “wyd.” And I respond but also ask him why he’s playing these games texting me after he said he was done. I then proceeded to say “just say you miss me or don’t text me again” after that he basically said “I’m not gonna talk to you again.” And that was it. This was a day ago but I feel so sad and heartbroken. I don’t talk to many guys because I know I get easily attached but I need to know a way to stop that. Also did I do anything wrong in this situation? Every guy I ask for advice says I shouldn’t have had a guy friend or went over to his house but he knew the guy from when he first met me in school and he’s also my neighbor.

89,ops94i,1627005112,My ex (33M) convinced me (23F) that I was the problem.,"I went through a horrible relationship for about 1.5 years after my first child was born. He always commented on my weight, which made me feel disgusting. I lost 30 pounds in about 4 months, but that still wasn't enough for him. Whenever we fought he would call me clingy, attention-seeking, and that I asked for too much from him. This man was 100% a narcissist, and would never admit he had any flaws. The last straw is when he told me he couldn't love my daughter like his own. I was convinced I'd be alone for a long time. It took a lot to heal from this relationship. 

Then I met the sweetest man (26M) who loves me for everything that I am. We have never fought or argued about anything, because we just understand eachother and how to communicate. He respects me for everything I've gone through and will do to provide a better life for my daughter and I. He loves me regardless of my body, as long as I am moving towards a healthy life. He lets me go at my comfortable pace, and works alongside me. He is so patient and kind. The kindest man I have met in my entire life. He loves my daughter like she is his own, I can see it in his eyes. He'd do anything for her. 

This relationship has made me realize that I was not the issue. Some people just don't work out together. 

Why I am writing this:
1. Trust your instincts!
2. BELIEVE THE RED FLAGS!!!!!
3. There is someone out there that will treat you how you should be.
4. Please, please, please don't let anyone convince yourself that you are worth less.

91,opshui,1627005939,Called my FWB a dick and told him to block me. Was I in the right?,"I (20F) hooked up with a guy (20) for around 5 months. We met on tinder. I'd always drive over to his place, then we'd cuddle for a while after and I'd go home. 

We had a good thing going and the sex pretty much got better each time I saw him, so I was always keen to meet up. The most recent time I asked when I could see him again, he didn't open the message until the next morning, then when he did, he didn't respond for 2 days. I thought that was strange since he never did that before. 

I send him another message, but he doesn't even open that one. I knew that he wasn't busy since he was actively messaging other people, so he was definitely just ignoring me. I felt thrown to the side and disregarded, so I sent him a final goodbye message and unfriended him.

After mulling it over for some time, I added him back like 2 weeks later and apologized, saying that I overreacted. He said it was okay and that people block him all the time? I asked why, and he replied that he didn't know but that he probably deserves it. I told him I was sorry that happens to him. He opened the message then blocked me. I know he isn't obliged to accept my apology after I removed myself from the situation, but I thought just straight up blocking me was kind of rude. But if that's what he needed to do for himself, so be it. 

It hurt and was pretty upsetting, but I just tried moving on after that figuring that was the end of things between us. A month and a half later, I suddenly get a friend request from him. Why do they always come back right when you're on the cusp of getting over them? I added him back because I was curious about what he had to say.

The first thing he says is ""wuts good"". I was kind of taken aback by that because I figured he'd address why he blocked me first instead of being so casual like we've been talking the whole time. I respond ""not much"" and wait for him to make the next move and talk about what happened. All he sends me is a pic of himself with no text. So clearly he wasn't intending to talk about it. He was just trying to go about things like he didn't just block me in the middle of a conversation for over a month and suddenly pop back in again. I'm pretty annoyed at this point.

I straight up ask him why he unblocked me, just trying to get to the point. He says ""idk bored ig"". This really stung me. The only reason he reached out again was because he had nothing better to do. I became pretty upset. I called him a dick and told him to block me again. I know that if I was the one to block him, I'd constantly wonder if I made the right choice and if I should reach out again. If he was the one to do it, I wouldn't be able to even entertain the thought of messaging him again. He read the message, then blocked me after without a fight.

I'll accept that the dick comment may have been unnecessary, but I was just mad that he came strolling in acting like nothing ever happened and telling me to my face that the only reason he reached out again was because of his boredom.

I guess this post was mostly to vent, but I'm also looking for advice. Did I do the right thing here? I have a bad habit of overthinking so I want to know if I'm really in the right to not want to contact him again. 

TL;DR: Hooked up with a guy for 5 months. Unfriended him after he ignored me. Added him back then he blocked me. He reached out to me over a month later acting like nothing happened and said he only unblocked me because he was bored. Was I in the right to call him a dick and and not want to be in contact with him anymore?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opshui/called_my_fwb_a_dick_and_told_him_to_block_me_was/

Around a month after we started talking he left me on delivered one time for 12 days, and already then I was contemplating cutting things off (hindsight is 20/20, I definitely should’ve cut things off). He did apologize but his excuse behind it all was that he doesn’t go on his phone much, what a lie am I right?

I feel like I need to tell him I’ve never had sex soon. He’s legitimately an amazing human being and I wouldn’t mind him being my first, but the fact that he’s leaving would probably crush me if we had sex lol.

I don’t want to stop seeing him because we’ve left this open-ended until the end of august…**so what do you all think should I do?** I’m going to tell him I’m a virgin, I just don’t want to freak him out.
