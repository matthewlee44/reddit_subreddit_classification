I took him up on it yesterday and he immediately started talking about his ex his? Like how crazy they are, hownhe only dates crazy chicks, has an extra apartment to brings them to so when they break up he can hide in his house so they dont show up unannounced? And how he dated a celebrity and has a crush on a Ruby Rose, but she knows (cause she knows him üôÑ) but shes lesbian so shes not interested. Then today he started talking about how much money he has, in bit coin and how much hes gunna drop at some local bar (10k) to buy it out and celebrate a job change. 



It was just such HUGE turn offs, that sounded outlandish and gross to me. We both work at a grocery store (hes a manager) and I guess he bartends events too, but it just seems like a lot to boast about and is such a turn off regardless if hes serious or not.

So I haven‚Äôt liked anyone for all of hs (I just say I‚Äôve rly never ‚Äúliked‚Äù anyone before) , and out of the blue I suddenly *think* I may like someone, but I‚Äôm not sure. We have a LOT in common- actually more than nearly everyone else I‚Äôve met. But I‚Äôm really not sure if he‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy type‚Äù which despite not being interested in people or dating, I have a very clear idea of since I‚Äôve taken time to think and reflect upon my likes and dislikes in ppl (both alone and with my family!).

So I‚Äôm not sure what to do! He has a lot of traits and things in common w me that I like + would want in a potential bf/partner, but I feel like some aspects are missing. That aside, I really enjoy talking to him and he‚Äôs really sweet. He actually got my number this week because he heard me telling a friend of mine, and saved it and sent me a random emoji out of the blue (which I found funny)- so I feel like that could (???) show that he‚Äôs interested (not sure in what way though).

Now, we‚Äôve each initiated text convos twice, and have talked and texted every day this week. Let me put this bluntly when I say that for some reason, I don‚Äôt know if I should text him today- I left class early and wanted to ask him abt the work since we worked tgt a little and hope a convo would spear from that (but is that the right way to go?!). Would it seem clingy? This is where I‚Äôm a bit lost- but it‚Äôs likely that I‚Äôm overthinking it (I‚Äôd sent a meme yesterday and he laughed at it and I texted again, but no response. Whereas the day before he texted me out of the blue w a pic that reminded him of a convo we had).

My mom and aunt recommended just going with it and seeing how I feel and how our convos flow, and I do like that advice. But to be real, I‚Äôm a little shaky about the whole texting-and-how-much-initiative-and-interest-to-show aspect.

This is long, so TL;DR- I don‚Äôt know how I feel yet (I think I like him) and don‚Äôt know how much interest and initiative to show I‚Äôm texting and in person! and v new to all of this.

So today I was talking to a coworker about how a new employee was telling people he‚Äôs into one of the girls that‚Äôs worked there for a while. We were talking about how the guy is brave as fuck to start a new job and put himself out there like that, and when I joked that if I‚Äôm into someone I just kind of awkwardly make eye contact at them from across the room, she laughed and said ‚ÄòI‚Äôll need to watch out for you doing that so I‚Äôll know ‚Äúhe must have a crush on him‚Äù.

I didn‚Äôt even correct her because I didn‚Äôt realise what she‚Äôd said straight away, and after it felt too awkward and insecure to be like ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not gay‚Äô afterwards, as if it even matters lmfao, although it‚Äôs gonna be weird if she‚Äôs been telling other coworkers she thinks I am. I just thought it was interesting more than anything. I‚Äôve never been attracted to any dudes in my life, but I‚Äôm very much not overly masculine. I‚Äôll openly admit liking songs or movies women tend to like, I‚Äôm not overly forward when I‚Äôm into someone (see the conversation I had above lmfao), I don‚Äôt date that much, I‚Äôm quite shy and don‚Äôt talk about my personal life a lot, I‚Äôm polite and a bit of a people pleaser and always fooling around, never really being too serious.

This isn‚Äôt an isolated incident either. My guy friends joke about how I must be gay because I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend (but that just seems like typical stupid male ball busting), my dad once asked me earnestly when I was younger if I was gay and that I didn‚Äôt have to be ashamed if I was, a couple of girls in bars I‚Äôve talked to have thought it before, etc. It tends to be women that think it for the most part; it‚Äôs like in Friends where all women seem to think Chandler is gay, but none of the guys do, which is funny because I actually act a lot like Chandler does too generally now that I think about it.

Anyway is there a way I can kind of stop putting out this vibe? It doesn‚Äôt bother me too much, but my romantic life is empty enough already and I could probably do without people‚Äôs guesses about me before they know me well ruining my chances even more before I‚Äôve even done anything.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxwu0q/ive_noticed_a_lot_of_women_seem_to_assume_that_im/

15,qxwunp,1637379314,Is the average woman interested in the average man?,"There is an interesting study from 2019 which argues that:

LACK OF ‚ÄòECONOMICALLY-ATTRACTIVE‚Äô MEN TO BLAME FOR DECLINE IN MARRIAGE RATES, STUDY SUGGESTS.

The average man makes 58% less than required by the average woman. At the same time the average wage gap is just 21%.

Therefore, the average man makes 58-21=37% less than what is needed for the average woman to be interested.

If there were absolutely no income inequality at all, the marriage rate would drop to nothing. There would be marriages at all.

The only reason why society still manages to have some level of marriages (and births) going, is because of the existence of some stubborn, residual income inequality.

However, the politicians are currently working overtime on stamping out this very last bit of income inequality. It is obvious that this will solve all problems.

Is dating still meaningful?

No, on average it is not.

It still works for statistical exceptions, but not for the average person. Hence, if you are too close to the average, you are wasting your time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxwunp/is_the_average_woman_interested_in_the_average_man/

A couple times with online dating now where I've reached the 4th-5th date, and then my date slowly fades over text, until I shrug and move on which slowly eats me up.

She used to text me back within half an hour (much quicker than me), to texting me a day later without saying much to radio silence the past 2 days.

21,qxxkdm,1637381816,Guide to improve your game with women,"Alot of guys wonder how to improve their game with women, so today I have a few tips on how you can improve your game without any of that fake scripted bs. 

1. Be Happy- If you're not happy this can affect your game a lot. Your game will sound forced and scripted. You have to truly be happy and enthusiastic with what you're doing. Give latin grins and give happy vibes. This way, you'll say the right things. 

2. Be High Energy- You can't be low energy and have good game. You should be the loud and very energetic. You do not wanna be depressing. You wanna exert energy in a boss way. Mike The Situation from Jersey Shore is an expert at this. If you're at a party, dance and be very sociable. Low energy makes you look tired and your game will be wack. 

3. Look Good- I'm not referring to facial features when I say this. You must get your swag up. Get a nice haircut and look swagged out. If you look good you feel good and will have more confidence with women. Your swag and vibes will attrack these women and you can get them in the bag with your game and wordplay. 

4. Love Rejections- You must actively seek rejection from women. This will take away the fear to approach them. You must seek it like a fearless warrior. Rejection gives great experience to improve your game. If you've never approached women and fear rejection, I implore you to get rejected 10 times so that you get experience and see that rejection isn't anything. Me personally I love getting rejection by women because it helps my game and acts like a warmup. For every 1 rejection is 5 more kisses from different girls in the club! 

5. Have An Abundance Mentality- There are 4.5 billion women on this planet. If just 1% like you, that would be 45 MILLION women on earth who like you. That's an insane amount of options and if even only 1% in the world like you you'd never be able to meet all of them. No reason to fear rejection or get hung up on a girl with that many options. 

6. Be In The Present &amp; Do NOT Be In Your Head- You must be in the present when spitting game to women. If you're up in your head, you might get anxious and become awkward with her. Just take a deep breath and converse with her. Do not think about the future or the past. Just think about talking with her. 

7. Be Yourself- That's literally it. Be yourself. Dont try to act a certain way to impress her or any of that. Forget all of those guys telling you you must act like this guy or that guy. When you try to be someone else you develop multiple personality disorder. Just be yourself. As I said, if even 1% of women like you for you, you'd never be able to meet all of them and being yourself is the easiest for natural game. 

With these steps, you'll be able to develop natural authentic godly game in no time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxxkdm/guide_to_improve_your_game_with_women/

In the past I tought that these women like dark skin black me because of what I saw on TV or my  childhood(and even near me one of my uncle has married a mixed race woman , so my aunt ) . 
But since I have started to use reddit  and Tiktok , not a single time I have ever saw a mixed race woman claiming a love,a preference, an interest for men of my  complexion .

27,qxy5em,1637383991,I went out on a date with a long lost crush (long story),"A little back story before I begin...

I am a 27M in the Army and have been serving since getting out of high school. My first assignment was to fort bliss in el paso Texas where I met my crush. She was also in the Army but in no way resembled the average soldier. She is sweet, beautiful, and just an all around great person. We would have long conversations on a daily basis where we would laugh, joke, smile, and just chat. It never got farther than that though, because at the time, she was married and has a son. Morally, I would never allow myself to interfere with a marriage, nor would I feel right being someone to break a marriage up. They were unhappy together though and she often expressed her frustrations. Eventually they would get a divorce, but this would not be until I left fort bliss.

 I go overseas for 3 years, get an international phone number, get rid of all social media (just because it is a waste of time to me), and continue just focusing on me. I thought of her often and always wondered to myself how she was doing. 

Fast forward to this week... I have finally returned from being out of country, I've deployed, gone to a new assignment on the east coast, and am very focused on my career. I get sent to a training to help advance my career and have to spend 6 weeks in a new base. I run into some old friends I knew from fort bliss, and we reminisce about people from the past, and I happen to mention my crush. I hadn't thought about her for a while at this point because I have been so focused on my career and doing my own thing. 

While in this temporary location, I cross paths with her, totally out of nowhere! My stomach dropped and she smiled at me and I smiled at her, incredibly excited. Unfortunately, I could only see her en passing so I didn't have a chance to have a talk with her. About 10 minutes pass, and I get a text.. its her! I still had her number saved, and evidently she still had mine. Like I said, I had an international number while I was gone, and I decided to get my number back when I returned. She invited me out with her friend and sister, as she was only staying for that one night. 

Eagerly, I said yes. And I met up with the trio and went on a fun filled adventure with them. Good food, good conversation, good people. I talked with her all night, we drank, we joked, we laughed, and then conversations got serious when I told her about my crush on her from bliss.... she didn't know about it at the time, but after I said it, a lot clicked to her. 

Mind you, she is now divorced and is single, totally crazy how all the stars were aligning for me. We talked very very deeply about a lot of different things. Her sister and friend were constantly telling me every time she walked away that she was totally into me.... 

We kissed. We had been drinking so driving wasn't an option. We ended up sharing a hotel room nearby so we slept in the same bed together (nothing sexual occurred as much as we both wanted it, no good decisions are made while drinking). Since that night I have been constantly thinking about her, messaging her and just catching up with her. 

I have no idea how long it will be before I see her again, as she is going overseas for a year very soon and I return to my actual duty station in a few weeks....

I guess what I am trying to say is I'm terrified that I may be overthinking and suffocating her with all my attention towards her. I'm genuinely terrified I might lose a great opportunity to be with someone I have held these deep feelings for, for a long time... what should I do in order to try and build this opportunity into a healthy relationship? 

TL;DR ran into a long time crush and hit it off. I don't want to miss an opportunity to develop a relationship with her and need help.

28,qxy62b,1637384059,"How do I (29f) deal with this guy (32m), who things me not being seduced by him is a cultural thing","I met this guy on tinder about two weeks ago.

He's very good looking, has a great body, does a lot of sports, outdoor activities, loves traveling, smart, etc


But for some reason, I'm just not into him.
The thing is, it seems like he's really into me.
He's always planning for the next time we'll see each other. Always texting me, sending me pictures etc


He's looking for something serious, which I have trouble finding on the app.
So I've been telling myself to wait and give it some time, and maybe I'll develop something for him. Because for once, I met someone with all these criteria and who's into me.


We met twice, and at the end of the last date, we kissed, and I really didn't enjoy it. It felt like the guy was eating my entire face, and the noises he was making were a real turn off.


I still asked him if he wanted to come up to my apartment, to which he said no and that he'd rather savor each thing on its time.


I was relieved when he said that, I don't know why I asked him, but I already feel like I won't enjoy having sex at all with him.


He wanted to meet again this weekend, he suggested we go hiking and said that he'd love to stop by my place before the hike (probably for sex), I lied saying that a friend is coming over, just so I don't meet with him.
At this point I feel like I'm just buying some time, but at the same time I feel like I'm forcing myself to spend time with him.


Yesterday, he sent me a video of him, doing a mini strip tease and saying ""I thought about you this morning, here's something so you don't forget me this weekend"".


I texted him that I can't watch the video because I was at work, to which he replied ""ofc you can"".
I didn't, and saw it once I got home, then texted him that it wasn't appropriate for me to watch this kind of stuff at work.


And to be honest, I found it cringy.


He went on saying that it was supposed to be exciting and to turn me on, that that was another failure from him, that he was sorry he finds it difficult to be on the same page and that he'll need time to understand me.
An hour later he said something that kind of pissed me off: ""I think it's a cultural thing, we don't play the game of seduction the same way"".


I moved to this country 8 years ago, but this really has absolutely nothing to do with culture.
If it came from someone I was into, and if it was done a little smoother than that, I would have enjoyed it. But not in his case.


I don't know if I should try to end things with him or give it some more time.

29,qxy7mb,1637384227,Talking to girl who recently rejected me,"I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party and slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. I haven‚Äôt talked to her since then except saying hi when passing by, but my roommate is having a birthday party on Saturday and she‚Äôs coming and I don‚Äôt know what to do or think. Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Do I ignore her at the party or talk to her? Do I bring up the rejection and talk to her to get a better understanding of why she rejected me? Do I flirt with her and act like nothing happened? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxy7mb/talking_to_girl_who_recently_rejected_me/

32,qxy9y7,1637384452,Honestly Speaking all most women care about is a guys looks,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù, Very well built with broad shoulders and a V-Shaped body, have a great job(Mechanical Engineer), have lots of friends and I‚Äôm very confident and charismatic yet all I face is rejection from women because of my face.


For context: I have an eye condition and I have been using eye drops to keep it in line since I was a baby, one of the side effects of those drops is depletion of fat in your eye area, giving you a hollow/sunken eyed look. To add to that, my glasses prescription is quite high so they distort my appearance even more. Btw despite all that I still look decent-good facially on my good days because I‚Äôve been lucky enough to be blessed with good features at least(square jaw, prominent cheek bones, good lips etc).

All I ever get is rejection no matter the woman. They often come up with some stupid excuse why they don‚Äôt want anything but I know the reason deep down.



The only thing that matters to women is if you have a good looking face honestly. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think being short is all that bad, yeah I‚Äôm tall but I‚Äôd much rather be shorter with a good face than what I am now. I‚Äôve seen time and time again how they prioritise facial beauty over any other thing in men.

On the other hand you can be busted up as a woman but if your body is good even the highest value men will still find you attractive(seen this millions of times in person).

Honestly isn‚Äôt fair. Only thing that can make up for it is to be proper wealthy which most people will never be. 

Even unattractive women prioritise facial beauty

Back to my session I told my therapist and she said I can do whatever I want but keep an open mind. She told me that I‚Äôm 28 as you get older you‚Äôll meet a lot of women who had kids, if you ignore them that can limit your options.

37,qxyqhk,1637386202,Do I still have a chance? We both wanted a relationship but she recently changed her mind bc of other people's experiences.,"So I'm 21(M) and she's 18(F) and we started talking about 2 months ago after matching on a dating app and we've only seen each other once for a date over a month ago since she has an inconsistent work schedule, strict parents, and needed to recover from Covid vaccinations. Also neither of us have dating experience.

Despite not being able to see each other for so long, we would watch movies (we've seen over 30 and I was putting her on the MCU movies) almost every night till like 3 in the morning while on Discord. She even made a playlist that was almost 4 hours long for me to put me on a new music genre.

We would talk through text with a lot of interest in each other everyday and we both wanted to eventually end up in a serious relationship so for the time being since we weren't able to meet each other but still liked each other a lot, we agreed to be exclusive to each other and not talk/see to anyone else. I wasn't gonna ask her out until we met at least 3-4 times. We would reschedule a date every time it got postponed due to her excuses which I always found valid and genuine.

About 2 months in, she asks me ""what if I don't want to date you?"". And I replied saying that I would ask why since we agreed to be exclusive to each other and she put so much interest and effort into me but I would understand and respect her decision. She then told me how she wants to date me because she likes me but also doesn't want to date. I thought she was just afraid to commit but her reasoning for why was that growing up she noticed multiple people's experience who are close to her get really mistreated in their relationships, recently her sister getting cheated on, and knowing how a relationship will end all really bothered her and so she didn't wanna lead me on so she changed her mind on wanting to date. I told her that other people's experiences shouldn't stop her from dating but she said that she can't seem to convince herself enough to try so she just doesn't want to date but wants to stay friends with me. I felt like she wasn't expanding her thinking and was thinking kinda immaturely but I just said that I was glad that we could at least stay friends.

Now this was a few days ago and we still talk everyday. She still asks a lot of questions with interest in what I do, how my day was, etc. and I reciprocate by asking the same back. Now I said I would respect her decision to not date me, but I feel like she'll change her mind again sooner or later. It's just that I would have to make some kind of moves to convince her to consider dating since she still does like me and talk to me with a lot of interest. I am keeping my options open since we're technically not exclusive anymore. I kinda wanna give her till the end of this year to see if she changes her mind and if I end up seeing someone else by then, then that's that. 

So I feel like I still have a chance. What do you guys think? If I still have a chance, what do you think I can do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxyqhk/do_i_still_have_a_chance_we_both_wanted_a/

40,qxyxze,1637387011,Are some people better off being single?,"For context, I am a 23 F who is rather average looking. I spent most of my life thinking I was above average, but after hanging out with a really pretty friend who consistently got attention and compliments from men around my presence, I started to understand what above average really meant, and it was quite a shattering realization for me.

I was hurt pretty bad by one person in the past, my first and only love, and despite many years passing, I still remember the pain vividly whenever I hear of anything slightly related to cheating.

I honestly think some people process things differently, and Im happy some people can find the confidence to bounce back quickly, but even if I moved on from this man, it still impacted my view of things a lot. Now, whenever I‚Äôm talking to a guy, I for some reason imagine a scenario of what would happen if he would meet my above average friend, and I don‚Äôt believe at all that he wouldn‚Äôt fall for her charming smile, beautifully shaped lips and curves.

I just feel like its all vain, like I could make a lot of efforts to find the perfect match, but theres always going to be someone prettier, more charistmatic, more intelligent than me, who could charm the man I am talking to. My intention with this post is not to complain but honestly, I just genuinely want to know: considering that my past history really affected me as a person, and that Im overall a pretty sensitive person when it comes to relationships, would it be best if I stay at peace and single? I remember when I was hurt it affected me professionally too and really took a toll on my mental health for many years, Im only just now more at peace with myself and I dont want anyone to shake my world again.

I then send her a text the next day as a casual invite to a school soccer game if she wants to take a 30 min break, no response for two days, then an apology since she was busy studying and a how r u. My phone broke right after the game so I cant reply for two days. I apologize and ask how her tests(discussion during the date) went, again no response.

I was the very shy depressed kid. I took awful care of my self and was overweight with awful posture.

Start of 2020 I started to make allot of changes. Since then I have lifted and got buff. A little tummy fat is left but barely much. I fixed my posture and walk straight now. I started rock climbing as well for fun and socially to meet people and hopefully friends or even a date if it came to that. Keyword I did it for myself and for fun firstly.
I am still shy and introverted but if I‚Äôm comfy I am great socially I think? I can be awkward but can have deep conversation. VERY FUNNY and making people laugh and feel
Good about themselves. I feel like my personality is good. 

I also wanted to volunteer at my animal
Shelter and have a fresh start in college but due to covid I can‚Äôt attend either. IMPORTANT: I think honestly I will be really happy once I can do both of these. For the social aspect and for fun enjoyment. Making friends and possibly finding a date.

I also started using hinge bumble
And badoo since I am looking STRICTLY for something serious. I am not looking or wanting to be a player or fuck 100 supermodels a year. I LITERALLY only want one relationship. Someone I can fall in love with and eventually marry.

I know dating apps are garbage for most men but fuck what else am I supposed to do with Covid and masks mandate. I will admit my bio is straightforward  but my pictures are garbage. I don‚Äôt take pics of myself and it‚Äôs so hard finding a good pic or places to take fun natural pictures. 

The apps make me so fucking depressed barely a match a week if I‚Äôm lucky. And they either don‚Äôt respond or give a one word answer. I matched with a girl and got her number two days ago. I suggested an arcade date and she agreed. After finding out the distance was far for her I suggested a new place we can both meet halfway. Of course this ended with her ghosting me. Guess I was just a free date/dessert ticket lol.

I write detailed thorough messages and try to be engaged and not one women seems to have any interest. I am starting to grow bitter tbh.

Not once in my fucking life has any women looked at said yea he is good enough. Or I want him or wow he is cute. Not fucking once have I been wanted. 

Of course I have female colleagues and people I interact with who complain about having so many options and choices. I started to lose empathy and growing resentful. I know it‚Äôs not healthy but my god I‚Äôm not asking for a million dollars or to rule the world. Guess finding love is so fucking unnatural I‚Äôm not supposed to ever get it.

For this final part I wanna address some points that I am expecting to here. Please don‚Äôt say it will happen eventually. Those are empty words and no guarantees. I also hear dating gets way better when you are in your 30‚Äôs. Yea I‚Äôm supposed to be happy about a good dating life when I am 30 and already a third of my life is gone if I‚Äôm lucky.

Also forget to mention! Most traumatic or horrible experiences I have had in life was due to women. Most women in my family have mental issues and are very rude. Two female teachers embarrassed me so bad I still remember it to this day.

So I am simply a young black guy and I like women of all ethnicities . But if I have to pick which type of women who is my biggest weakness , I would say mixed race women(half white,half black generally. For me Rihanna Beyonce and Jasmine Sanders are the most beautiful women of this world ). 
In the past I tought that these women like dark skin black me because of what I saw on TV or my  childhood(and even near me one of my uncle has married a mixed race woman , so my aunt ) . 
But since I have started to use reddit  and Tiktok , not a single time I have ever saw a mixed race woman claiming a love,a preference, an interest for men of my  complexion . Wether they claim strong attraction for white men or latino, asian and even arab/ north african guys . But guys like me... I have even hear some complaining about attracting black men or finding them unattractive.  I mean , to each person their preferences and I respect that . And loving them means wishing their happiness too even if it means with other race of men , but I would lie if I say it doesn't hurt.

I didn't see once a mixed race woman say :"" I prefer black men "" or "" I love black men"" . At best what I hear is I don't have a type .

63,qy13sx,1637396108,I'm bad at dating because I hate myself.,"26y/o male here. It's taken a long time for me to be able to admit this and I need to vent.

From the outside I look like my life is great. I come from a rural farming family on a small island, and now I have an awesome career where I could prettymuch live anywhere. I love my job and career, I make good money, I live in my dream city, I have a lot of friends, and I assume I'm not bad looking since I match frequently with attractive women on apps.

But even when I convince someone to take me seriously and go for a real relationship, I can't keep them around for more than a month or two. Dating is the only aspect of my life where I just can't seem to get anywhere.

And it's beginning to dawn on me why. No matter how much ""success"" I do, I just fundamentally hate myself. It's not a feeling of ""I'm bad because xxx"" but...I just don't think I deserve anything. In fact, I'm starting to realize that my work is actually a coping mechanism because I keep looking for a reason to be valued.

But it's not working. It comes out in the way I speak and carry myself, and women pick up on that stuff easily.

Obviously the answer is therapy. I'm working on finding one. I just fear its not going to be enough.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy13sx/im_bad_at_dating_because_i_hate_myself/

Hell, she‚Äôs so affectionate that I feel her jump and hug at me (last night) was a new thing (because none of the exs has ever done that to me), she kissed me first and willingly when I hadn‚Äôt made a move. Originally, she was the one who texted first after she read one of my fanfiction for Genshin Impact. 

It‚Äôs been fifteen minutes yet my heart keeps jump up and down. But the thing is I drank a cup of Americano before that (I‚Äôm a heavy-weight coffe drinker) so I could not figure it out if the heart is pounding for the thought of her or it‚Äôs due to the caffeine‚Äôs influence. 

Another thing, I‚Äôm built like a big bear that has a personality of a puppy, can become quite smitten to S.O real fast after a short time.

Like he encouraged me to be better without trying. 

We became really close and now things are much not intimate between us.

But recently, he hasn't been sharing important stuff or even things like how was your day
Ans- it was good. Met frend or busy day with work. That's all and nothing else. 

He will go meet his nephew and he will not mention it at all.  Or any celebration of joyous activity he did and he won't mention it at all. 

This is making me feel like I'm sharing too much or like he's suddenly closed off with his personal activities. 

We have discussed and have had mature conversation. He says that he has always been closed off and that I please please ask him if I want to know anythingn (his exact words) 

It seems like He really tries. And he does take interest in me the same.

But he was not like this to me. Otherwise we wouldn't have gotten close in the first place. 

I'm not sure I want to bring this up again and again. But it's causing me a lot of worry and I'm scared I'm messing this up. He is also worried that I'm worried.

I have always told him that be open even if he hates me because in that way I'll know.

94,qy4agb,1637410003,Judging based on dating experience,"I have heard a few times (and I promise not directed at me, though I suppose it could be applied to me) that no dating experience or recent dating experience is or can be a red flag. (Yes I can imagine the jokes of ""well if they haven't dated that must mean none one wanted them therefore there must be something wrong with them""). Thing is I last heard this on Sexy Beast on netflix, the guy said it wasn't really a red flag but kinda that the girl had not been on a date in the last couple years. Another example, a few years back I read about a career military man who said he didn't really date til recently and the issue women were having was that he had not dated much in his life previously. That got me wondering the why is it an issue? I can see being worried that a person might not know how to act or handle being with someone else, but that kinda seems weak to me.

95,qy4dl2,1637410357,Dating Chinese girl 30+,"Hello friends,

I wanted some advice from Chinese males and female. 

Background: I met this amazing girl on a dating app called Hinge. She is aged 31, we live fairly close to each other and we have been on 8 dates over the course of 6 weeks. 

Our dates have been going to dinner, meeting some of my friends, playing couples badminton, KTV. We have. It been to each others houses and we have not kissed yet. We have hugged and I was holding her/her resting in my arms during KTV. 

Indicators of interest: she is a very kind hearted and thoughtful girl. She messages to check I get home ok, asks me to confirm when I get home and she bought me a cake after she went out with some friends (I didn‚Äôt ask or suggest this, did it on her own accord) after KTV I booked us a cab home and she voluntarily hugged me as we parted ways and thanked me for a great night out. 

We don‚Äôt text everyday, she is very busy at work and I think texting too much is a bit annoying for me. We mainly use texting for arranging dates with some chit chat but nothing extensive like what have you eaten etc. I have sometimes used some hidden flirting and jokes which I think get lost in translation. She came to the Uk when she was about 16 and by the messages she sends. I can tell she is not as well versed in British sarcasm/wit as me (I am a British Chinese, she is from mainland China but has been here since 16. 

I would say that she is very sweet, conservative and dresses very feminine ie not showing basically all her skin. 

Advice sought: I‚Äôve not included all details so feel free to asl anything that I may have missed - Since we have not held hands yet or kissed yet I wanted you guys to assess whether I am in a good position to ask her to be my girlfriend. Is it normal for early stage dating in China to be slower. I am at an age where I am looking to settle down and I think she may be the one ‚òùüèª. 

It would also be useful on what people from/experience of dating in China see as an average dating timeline from date 1 to marriage. I am personally comfortable with her level of interest and happy to take out time. I am 33 and she is 31. 

It sounds silly but I have also looked at out love compatibility (dragon and horse) and it looks promising. 

I am also not sure how to bring up the topic of asking her to be my girlfriend. I don‚Äôt believe in this: let‚Äôs go exclusive thing, after date 2 I basically stopped going out on dates to focus on her and cut off all other contact with other girls. 

Also feel free to ask me questions on how I feel and anything she may factor in for considering me as a husband.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy4dl2/dating_chinese_girl_30/
96,qy4l4u,1637411206,I would love to hear your dating experience,"I have never been to any dates and often wondered how they look like..

97,qy4m2j,1637411300,Should I pour my heart out or give him time?,"So, I've been going out with this guy for a bit over a month now. The last two weeks he started to get a bit distant but we'd still talk everyday. On Thursday i decided to ask him and he told me his ex came back to his life two weeks ago and he's confused because he loved her so much and he didn't see the breakup coming. I said i like him but i also didn't want to show how much so i acted cool when he said he likes me too but he's  confused about what he wants and asked me what i want. Instead of just telling him that he was the first one who made me feel anything in a long time and that we seem to be so alike in so many ways and if he just gave us a chance he would see it too. I just didn't want to get hurt so i just said i will give gim time, move on because i can't wait on him and i don't want to get hurt. Now i keep wondering if i should have said those things, if it will make a difference on his decision? But i also don't want to pressure him :/",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy4m2j/should_i_pour_my_heart_out_or_give_him_time/
98,qy4o59,1637411510,Partner said I irritate them? Am I being senestive? M/23 F24,"I was spending time with my partner and sibling. And he had playfully ask me if he ever gets on my nerves I beat around the bush etc (but yes at times he does get on my nerves) and his sibling was like aw she's being nice cuz you sure do get on my nerves. And he admitted that I irritate him at times. It stung but his siblings explained it and was like he gets irritate when people don't understand what he is trying to say etc (has a hard time expressing himself) and he agreed. Later on when we were in the car. I had the warranty company on speaker phone, about my car. He was like just say okay/coaching me what questions to say/ask (because they were explaining something me i didn't quite understand but 
he did. At the end I was still a little confused and just wanted to verify with them he got upset . He yelled and said that's stuff that makes him agitated. Basically feeling like I didn't trust him. Saying that he wouldn't lead me astray that he has my back. That when roles are reverse he complies and trust me. I was just quiet and they were like no need to be sad i'm not mad at you. And i said i'm not sad. I was internally frusterated because I felt no need to yell and get frusterated. I just wanted to make sure I understood everything correctly. (Which  I told him later when we talked later and he was calmly just asking if I understood and listened to what he was saying &amp; feeling).

I just feel it poor communication and kinda hurt. Idk if i'm being too senestive on the first part, maybe its normal for partners to irritate/get annoyed with them.

99,qy4vdd,1637412288,Is there a chance of reunion?,"I was dating this guy casually for maybe 3 weeks. Things were going fine, but a month ago, unfortunately, I got blackout drunk and hooked up with a random guy from a party, who practically used me in that state and  later turned out to be a friend from a guy I was dating. We both weren't aware of that. I was mortified that that happened, especially since I liked the guy I was dating.

He reached out a few days later with a passive aggresive text to let me know he knows everything. I apologized and he acted like everything is fine and like he isn't hurt at all. I was a mess after that for a whole month but decided that its best to just let it go and move on from that messy situation. 

A month later, last Friday, I ran into a guy I was dating while out. He said hi first and hugged me. We talked for a bit and I apologized to him about everything and explained my side of the story. At first he was kinda mad about everything but eventually accepted my apology and said he doesn't want ti listen about it anymore. An hour later we started kissing and said we missed eachother. Eventually he ended up at my place and spent the night. It was very passionate and romantic.

It's been a week and we haven't talked since. Im aware I fucked everything up when I hooked up with his friend, but I think this guy really liked me before that. Do you think there is a chance he forgives me and should I wait for him to reach out first and give him space?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy4vdd/is_there_a_chance_of_reunion/
