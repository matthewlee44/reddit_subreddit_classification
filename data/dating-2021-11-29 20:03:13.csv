I never had a girlfriend though had a couple of girls I have done stuff with. But I am more mature now and looking for a girlfriend and having trouble finding girls without using a dating app. I live in a small town less than 18k people. Our mall is dead and there is really no place to go meet people besides the bar. But the girls I meet there only want one night stands and stuff like that. I feel like I'm going crazy but I can not find anyone. Sometimes out in the stores I notice some girls looking me and what not. But I am afraid and do not want to come off as being weird. So what do I do to meet girls and should I approach some I notice and look at me and maybe say hi or something?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5c63s/how_to_meet_girls_in_my_town/

4,r5cmyr,1638240132,Couldnt muster up courage to approach girl at bar,"
Im (M27) on vacation visiting family in the dominican republic and last weekend i was in a resort with my cousin (M28) in punta cana. I had never been to a resort and had always wanted to experience one in Punta Cana. I had alot of fun as we tried it all and did some gambling. One issue i had was at night we would spend a few hours in a bar. Im not much of a drinker, i barely ever drink, and we‚Äôd just hang out and talk. Im also drinking anxiety medication that ive been told by my nurse does not mix well with alcohol. I didnt really drink at the resort. There wasnt alot of people at the bar and everyone was in their own groups and almost everyone was coupled up the 2 nights we went there. The last night though i noticed a girl across the bar i thought was cute. She didnt seem coupled up. She was just hanging out with another girl drinking and dancing with her. It wasnt any type of sexual dancing just regular dancing between friends (at least thats what it looked like). 

I kept thinking about approaching her to make some type of conversation with her, but something kept holding me back. Id think stupid thoughts like ‚Äúyou suck at dancing‚Äù or ‚Äúyou dont drink so what are you going to even do‚Äù. It was basically an hour of me trying to muster up something to talk to her and she left with her friend. I dont get much dates and im not saying that something wouldve happened but i feel like it couldve been a missed opportunity and it may be some time before i get one again, even if nothing wouldve happened. Sometimes i feel like i should just start drinking to fit in, even if i dont like drinking but i feel like not drinking has avoided me having fun or making as mcih friends. Like maybe itll give me the balls to do things i struggle to do sober, like approaching strangers or make me seem more fun (i know it sounds stupid but ive been on medication for a few months and am still struggling). Ive been kind of beating myself up for not even trying to talk to that girl.

I always hear drinking helps you not give a fuck and im considering maybe start trying it in group gatherings to have more fun.

5,r5cohb,1638240257,Weird question,"I have a weird thing that happened to me recently and I don‚Äôt know what to think about it. Just wondering if anyone had something similar happen to them or has any ideas.

I am in grad school and there is this super cute girl in my class. We have briefly flirted back and forth a few times and she has given me a ton of green flags every time I see her in class and at parties. 

I don‚Äôt use social media very much at all. She does. I have an insta account, but I never post on it and I don‚Äôt follow anyone in our class, I try to keep it private and just use it when I am bored to watch funny videos in waiting rooms and stuff.

Anyways, she must have searched for me because out of the blue she sent me a follow request and she is the only person in the entire school to do so this year. I accepted her follow and gave her a follow back. 

Its been 5 days though and she isn‚Äôt accepting my follow back. I can see she is accepting other requests but I am stuck on requested. She has a lot of followers too. 

I am just a little annoyed because I wanna see her bikini pics or something and she is wasting my time.

And yes, as soon as exams are over I am gonna aggressively approach her in person and make my intentions clear, rejection or not. But in the meantime I have no way to in person approach and this is just teasing me so bad.

Why would she follow first and then not accept back? Weird rightv? Or am I misinterpreting something?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5cohb/weird_question/

8,r5cv6n,1638240819,"Be patient, don't go looking! And maybe avoid dating apps...?"," I felt the need to write this story down as it's apparently ‚Äúvery cute‚Äù according to those I‚Äôve told. This recently happened after I'd been on a slew of horrible dates with people from various dating apps.

\--------------

So I was out having drinks with some friends one night. We went to a fancy bar where the drinks were basically desserts in a cup. I was enjoying a lovely, sweet drink and then BOOM! I was drunk AF. I eventually sobered up so I could drive myself home. I parted ways with my friends but on the way something didn‚Äôt feel right.

As I walked back to my car, I‚Äôm sure some creep was following me. Like from a movie, I turned down a random block or two and this fucking creep followed. So I quickly ducked into another bar, even though it was really late/early and it looked like Bartender, an adorable gangly dude, was closing up. I walked up to him and told him what was up.

Bartender responded in the best way - he said I could hang out until I felt safe to leave. He made me a drink on the house, continued closing up, and chatted with me about every topic one could imagine. I got those butterflies in my stomach, the ones everyone always talks about. I also got hammered again...and more or less held poor Bartender hostage at work. I made a few sly passes at him - I probably should‚Äôve called my friends to come get me.

But Bartender didn‚Äôt bite, but he also didn‚Äôt seem to mind. We talked for HOURS. He waited for me to sober up and then walked me to my car where he gave me his number and asked me to text him to make sure I got home okay.

I texted him when I got home. The next day he texted back and said he was glad I made it home safe. Once I was truly sober I solidified some actual date plans with him.

A week later - we met up at a bar that wasn‚Äôt his place of work, got tossed together, and made out in a photo booth. It was the date of dates, with photos to prove it. And for the first time in years, I‚Äôm excited to date again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5cv6n/be_patient_dont_go_looking_and_maybe_avoid_dating/

As we're leaving, she mentions she heard I was leaving and wouldn't be there on my last day. 

We had only talked a couple times and neither of us know each other super well, but she asked if maybe we wanted to stay in touch? I offered to give her my number, she said yes, and we texted really briefly the other night.

 Obviously I get the feeling she's a bit interested in me and I want to ask her out and see where this goes, since we won't be coworkers anymore. What's the best way to do it and when?

12,r5d2ld,1638241441,Is she attracted to me? Do I have a chance in the future or should I move on?,"I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I‚Äôm finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

Idk I've been told before that im way too innocent and i really suck at all that dating life games and manipulations about how to behave to keep them interested and coming back for more.

But the rules of dating are just so hard for me like idk how to behave? And im sick of being alone.

Please don't give me any of that learn to be happy alone  and if someone is interested they'll come by themselves type of advice . because i am happy alone i just prefer not to be anymore and im pretty sure im doing something wrong because i noticed the pattern and i know there are things i cant control, but i want to learn how to change the things that i can control in krder to get the type of guys im interested in.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5d8at/im_worried_that_i_might_not_know_how_to_date/

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that crowd (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5dwvi/i_have_no_idea_how_to_start_dating/

29,r5e08u,1638244295,Is he interested or is he just being friendly?,"Met this guy through a work project, and we have quite a lot of mutual friends so we kicked it off quite well at the beginning. I thought he was cute but wasn't going to act on it. I went to uni in another state so we didn't see each other after that internship but from time to time he would message me on Instagram, sending me random pictures of his day or would always reply to my Instagram stories. As an introvert and someone who really only makes the effort to text people regularly who I want in my life, I thought he was interested so got super emotionally invested, but after a long time of just messaging like that and him not really initiating anything I assumed that he was just one of those people that are super friendly to everyone. Our conversation slowly fizzled out, and we basically stopped talking. 

Fast forward to now and we're back in the same state again. He messaged me on my birthday to wish me, and asked to catch up (in a group chat that we have with all the other people we interned with). Dinner with everyone went well nothing special, and we all agreed to meet up again. He didn't talk to me especially during that meet up, but after he started doing the same thing as before (sending me messages from time to time, sending me random pics of his day etc) and for the past week or so we've been talking everyday this way. 

Initially when we started messaging again I really classified him as a friend in my head, but the longer that its gone on the more that I feel like I've caught feelings again. He would reply super quick to all my messages (within 5-10 minutes throughout the day even though he's working), and of course all my feelings come back. Then all of a sudden he stopped replying with as much frequency (he seen'd my last message to me) and now I'm left confused. I don't want to bother him if he's not interested, but I don't even know if he is interested? Or am I just overthinking this and is he just being a friendly guy. (Also aside from the group meet up stemming from my birthday wishes, he's never initiated any meetup, let alone any with just me and him)

I saw her tonight. I was doing doing navy seal burpees (100 a day until the end of the year or so I hope) and she walked in the same room I was in. She did her streches near me. She had her headphones on the whole time. It was just her and me in there so I thought maybe it was a good sign.

 Anyways I saw she stood up so I took the opportunity to talk to her. She just looked at me and kept on doing her stretching. So I repeated myself and she just got up and walked out the room.

FAIL. 

She also literally left the gym as in walked out to her car after that interaction. I don't know if I creeped her out or what?

36,r5eth6,1638246810,Something that keeps me staying confident and a non-jealous person while dating.,"Early thirties man here and I think one of the biggest problems a lot of men have always faced is becoming/staying confident. 

When you ask for any dating advice ever weather it be YouTube, Reddit, friends etc they‚Äôll all tell you that women love a confident man and how well he will carries himself; what does this mean exactly? 

Being confident essentially just means being happy with yourself and comfortable with every aspect of who you are; it‚Äôs the energy you give off, it‚Äôs the attitude you present to her. Someone who is depressed, shy or had a bad day problem isn‚Äôt going to give off the same energy or attitude of a man who just got a promotion at work, reached a new personal goal at the gym or bought a new nice outfit. In short, stay positive and upbeat. 

Some men will fall into this terrible mindset that they‚Äôre never going to be good enough for someone or they‚Äôre just ugly which isn‚Äôt true. 

LISTEN TO ME

Every single person on this earth brings something unique to the table and what‚Äôs what even makes dating possible, we‚Äôre all different. There 8 billion people on this planet so yes, of course there are always going to be better looking guys than you, taller, more successful blah blah blah. The way to stay confident is by appreciating the fact that you are your own person and bring a unique look, personality and mindset to the table for women. Not every woman wants the same guy just like not every man wants the same woman. 

For the ladies who may be reading this the same goes for you too. Yes, of course there are more beautiful women out there, bigger boobs, bigger butt whatever blah blah. I promise you that men love all different kinds of women. The way you set yourself apart from other women is by being and appreciating yourself. 

This mindset is also gives the byproduct of not being jealous. Why be jealous of someone of something you have no control over? You want to know what you do have control over‚Ä¶yourself! 

Become the best possible version of yourself! Hit the gym, eat right, pick up an instrument, learn a new sport like skiing or volleyball, buy a new outfit or two. Do the things you enjoy because eventually you‚Äôll meet the person who will bring you even more joy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5eth6/something_that_keeps_me_staying_confident_and_a/
37,r5ewaq,1638247058,I am officially a Bachelor; I date 6 - 7 women a week.,"I started dating back when I was 15. That's also when I lost my virginity. It's funny; I have had people when I say that immediately be appalled, they think that's disgusting. Too young or whatever. Where I live, in one of the poorest states of the country, it's normal for women to get pregnant that young. At least, that's what the statistics say.

I remember when I lost my virginity nobody on the school-bus believed me. Just that sentence alone is disturbing. It was one summer in high school and the sex was some of the worst sex I ever had. It lasted for seconds; I had no idea what I was doing; all I remember was anxiety. I do remember that girls name, Sabri. She had brown hair that was twirly and pink lipstick, and was small and cute.

Anyway, why am I going back to the beginning?

It's interesting as you age. I am 30 years old now. I do remember that girls name but I don't really remember many girls‚Äô names as I age. I have dated hundreds of women at this point; maybe more. I have slept with 40-50 women if I remember correctly, but honestly, I have no damn idea. I have so many insane stories about hook ups and debauchery it is disgusting.

Why did I choose becoming a Bachelor?

I was an alcoholic for years. I had a lot of issues, grew up with a horrible and abusive family and it took me a long time to find my own path. I have been sober for almost 6 years from alcoholism. My alcoholism made me obviously unfit to be a boyfriend, let alone a husband, so for the first two decades of my life my dating life was straight awful.

Most the women I slept with it was in my early twenties. And guess what? I only remember three or four of their names. You might think, oh, he's a player. Well. There are men I've talked to who have slept with hundreds of girls they claim, so I'm not some insane player I'd say.

I have noticed when I say these things to some men, they get very judgy and jealous. They think I am lying or whatever. That is fine.

Anyway, since I was an alcoholic for several years (I was an addict from 16- 24), I couldn't find a wife. Plenty of hook ups though. One-month relationships. All over the place, I don't even like to think about it.

I have had 3 relationships that actually meant something since then, that's it.

THREE.

Quantity over quality as they say. I am proof. Out of a hundred girlfriends I have only loved or really liked three women. And when you enter Bachelorism, things change.

Starting at the age 30, the entire dating field is different. I have around 6 - 7 women I talk to on a daily basis, most are friends or more. I get around 10 - 15 likes a week across the dating apps. My girlfriends come and go, I was engaged recently (that was one of the THREE if you paid attention!) but not for long.

Dating is so casual now and people love the success and the pad I have. So, I have fun. I do want a wife maybe, but she will have to somehow take over this lifestyle- it seems like quite the difficult task.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5ewaq/i_am_officially_a_bachelor_i_date_6_7_women_a_week/

40,r5f081,1638247412,is sex and dating better as a teenager than as an adult?,"there are schools near me and whenever i go outside on monday-fridays i see teenagers holding hands and kissing and it fills me with envy and anger.

I turn 19 years old in January and i never even kissed a girl before.

recently I went out to run some errands and had a conversation with this attractive older woman. She was wearing a business suit and had a beautiful body and face. My interest and sexual desires towards the opposite gender has declined so i was less nervous than usual and had a funny and interesting conversation with her. She gave me her number and told me to text/call her. i was happy at first but didnt think much of it afterwards honestly.

I feel so bitter that i graduated highschool as a virgin. i never dated or had sex with anyone. Sex and dating seems so much more fun and exciting as a teenager in middle/highschool and I cant shake off this intense desire to go back to school and try again. I yearn to experience what most other teenagers went through. Having sex at a much younger age also seems much more fulfilling and pleasurable and even accomplishing. you have raging hormones and you're ready to go often unlike adult men. 

I just cant stand the fact that younger boys than me are already having sex and dating.

I hate being a ""late bloomer"". I dont even want anything to do with women or dating anymore and just forget about it all. even if i had sex with a hundred attractive women I would still have a yearning to experience young teenage love and sex.

He had tickets to a show last Friday that he invited me to so we went and had a great time (I thought). We both had too much to drink and we ended up at his place having ""attempted"" sex (he couldn't get it up). It was still fun and playful and not a big deal at all. Fast forward a day or two and he texted me a couple times but his texting habits have changed (i.e. taking a lot longer to respond, not asking as many questions back although still asking about my day and seeming sort of interested). Hasn't mentioned going out again.

In the past whenever someone's texting patterns have changed it's been bad news so I'm making the assumption that he's not as interested anymore, if at all. I hate this phase though where I'm not 100% sure so I'm still responding, waiting for him to text back throughout the day, etc. But I think there's also a chance he's just embarrassed about what happened or something. Anyway, I want to say something but since we've only been on two dates I don't know if it's too soon. Would a text along these lines be appropriate?

I don‚Äôt understand what aspect of my life is preventing me from getting girls. 

Everyone always says I‚Äôm the best dressed person they have ever seen I get so many compliments on my clothes on the daily even from strangers, I even had a stranger come up to me and say I‚Äôm in my own lane for clothing. I won‚Äôt lie my clothes are reps and fakes but nobody can tell the difference because none of the girls I talk to are even into fashion plus they pretty much look identical even I can‚Äôt tell the difference between the fake and real. 

Secondly some of the girls and guys I hung out with they always call me one of the funniest person they know. I even had this one interaction where this girl(my closest female friend) kept laughing at me for 5 mins straight and I wasn‚Äôt even doing anything and she kept saying I just can‚Äôt take you serious everything you do is funny. On top of that people say my personality is amazing and I‚Äôm cool guy. 


Thirdly, I‚Äôm a really goal driven person and always aim for the top. I‚Äôm a scholarship student for getting the highest marks in electrical engineering. I work out regularly at the gym although recently I‚Äôve lost motivation as it just seems like whatever I do it won‚Äôt ever work out for me I will never get girls. I also submitted an idea for a graphic novel for a publication company which got accepted but I now need over 5k to fund it for the illustrations which I don‚Äôt have the funds for but what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I‚Äôm on my purpose and have goals and everyone always tells me girls like a guy on their purpose a guy who has there own life outside the girl etc.  I‚Äôm even looking at making a song with one of my friends, I want to go for a juice wrld style. 


Recently, there was this girl that I had the biggest crush on and  I meet her in the library and really wanted to start dating her. It  looked like things were going great she would whisper on my ear that this song could describe us in the future (it was a romantic song) or make comments like I‚Äôm the only girl that can make you listen to juice wrld because what we have is special. And she wasn‚Äôt out my league, she had so many insecurities about herself that she didn‚Äôt even look at herself the way I looked at her she thought she was like a 6 and needed constant reassurance. She choose another guy over me despite saying all that stuff which hurt me so badly cuz she basically lead me on and I liked this girl a lot. I keep thinking what does this other guy have over me. Additionally, he‚Äôs kind of mean to her (jokes about her insecurities) and ignores her at times which just makes me think girls chase after the bad guy. He even denied her a relationship and told her ignore me in a public setting because I don‚Äôt want people thinking we together yet she‚Äôs still stuck on him like glue. I obviously have cut her off. 


After all this I went to club with my friends to try and get over her. There was this fine girl and I got her snap but she never opened my message and left me on 5 weeks delivered. 


What‚Äôs annoying is I just can‚Äôt get the girl that choose the other guy out my mind I was literally head over heels for her. I‚Äôm struggling to move on. Plus we spent a lot of time together even though we never went on a date. 


I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôm ugly. You can dress the best but if you‚Äôre ugly you‚Äôre still ugly. You can be one of the funniest guys or be on you‚Äôre purpose but if you‚Äôre ugly you‚Äôre just ugly. I even set up a tinder, hinge and bumble for the last month  and I literally can‚Äôt get any matches. I only have like 5 matches in a month and I just get ghosted. 

I think I‚Äôve just accepted that I will never be able to pull girls and will probably die alone. 


If any girl is reading this, I need you‚Äôre honest opinions about my looks do I look ugly or average or what‚Äôs my rating from a scale to 1 to 10 where 1 is ugly.

I (33) been see this guy (39) for two months.
We haven‚Äôt established yet what we are but that‚Äôs not the point . We don‚Äôt see each other as often . Appx once a week.
He lives around 35-40 min drive from me and he has a car . I don‚Äôt drive.
We made arrangements I will come over  and stay with him overnight this Friday .

So he didn‚Äôt offer me a ride or anything.
First he said I‚Äôll pick you up in the evening around eight after traffic is gone I said ok . And then he started to say that I should take a subway and he‚Äôll pick me up from the station .

It will take me around 45 min to get from where I live to the station that he wants to pick me up from (station close to his house, like 20 min drive )
I said that is a very long ride for me especially I‚Äôll be coming after work and I‚Äôd prefer not to spend almost an hour in the subway after work .

It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs always driving me around or picking me up so that he‚Äôs asking me to take the train for once .
I don‚Äôt mind but I felt like he‚Äôs not even making any effort , not even offered to order me Uber . He said he‚Äôll have to drive to me and then drive all the way back etc . Like it‚Äôs not even that far .

Then I said if at least he can pick  me up half way so that I won‚Äôt have to do the long ride and he didn‚Äôt really said anything. He said it‚Äôs not that bad etc etc.
So I‚Äôm kinda upset tbh. It‚Äôs all about the effort and being a gentleman. No?

63,r5gne3,1638253042,Is my mindset for a relationship unhealthy?,"Hello, I am curious about my mindset when it comes to dating. I have never found anyone romantically attractive that I know of, but I have had moments of absurd devotion in my imagination.

For example, I find myself somewhat attracted to a fictional character. Not even an actor, just a character in a book. I believe this is due to the notion that I find their personality admirable. However, when I think of what a relationship would look like between me and the fictional character, it goes along the following lines:

I would do anything to make the other person happy. It is as if they became the most important thing in the world, and nothing else was even close to as prominent. It is like I become obsessed with the idea of making the other person as happy as possible.

Now to me, that did not sound too bad when I reflected on my initial reaction to the fictional relationship at first. However, I have seen a lot of people discuss relationships. I have seen movies, t.v. shows and books that portray relationships, and none of them have a relationship quite like how I thought it should go. This led me to question if what I felt for the fictional character, and this relationship, was even love. It started to seem more like obsession and devotion.

The strangest part was that I did not get sad or jealous imagining them with another partner. As long as they were happy, I was content.

I started to question my mindset as a whole when I thought about the fact that I did not want anything from the other person in the relationship except for their happiness. It seemed completely one sided, that I was giving but never taking. Metaphorically, I was a power generator giving the   
lightbulb (fictional character) energy, and as long as the bulb was on (they were happy) I was content. 

However, even though it seems like I would be fine with this arrangement, something feels off about it. My gut gives me a bad feeling about my mindset in this regard, but I do not know why. Is this even romantic attraction? What is this obsession? Why haven't I found this obsession in real people?

84,r5iobm,1638260812,24(M) need advice on confessing feelings.,"So I recently moved cities to try and just grow the fuck up and live my best life, and I quickly got a job that I enjoyed, but didn‚Äôt pay that much money, but it was something. I met this girl at work and we hit it off, just me telling stupid jokes that she laughed at and me laughing at her ranting about shit. It was fun, and she quickly became my first and best friend down here. I always thought she was cute and we had a lot in common, but she was in a long term relationship so I wanted to respect that. I asked her to hang out once, and we got together and hung out at work one night. This is the night she told me she was thinking about breaking up with her boyfriend and moving in with her aunt. This is the night I started catching feelings for her and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve handled it great since then. At first it was fine, she would talk to me when I saw her after our shift changes, and tell me about why she was considering breaking up with him, what she was hoping to gain from moving on in life, and still we‚Äôd just talk about random shit. I always avoided telling her what I thought she should do because I didn‚Äôt want me having feelings to get in the way of any opinion I could have. We started texting more but after a while it wasn‚Äôt as frequent, then it would pick back up again. This is when I started getting bad anxiety about all this. My longest relationship is 2 months, and that was 4 years ago, so I have no experience. That‚Äôs why I moved though, to just grow up and start my adult life, and I stress cause I don‚Äôt want to fuck it up all with this girl, but I realize me worrying about this isn‚Äôt helping at all. I want to start respecting the fact that she just got out of something long and very personal, and quite frankly I need to get some of my shit together as well so that I can actually be something down here. Mutual work friends have said good things about the way I‚Äôm trying to go about this, and have frequently encouraged me to try and go with the flow and connect with her. I think right now, she needs that time to be alone and work through some things, and I just want to be there for her. 

That‚Äôs the backstory. Long story short, I‚Äôm thinking that in order to be a genuine friend to her, I want to be 100% honest about how I feel. I want to let her know that yeah I do like her and at some point I‚Äôd love to see where this could go, but I know she needs time, and honestly, I‚Äôm not ready either. I figure the worst that could happen is she just want to stay friends, and if that happens so be it. I just want to be sure this is the mature thing to do cause deep down I feel like it is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5iobm/24m_need_advice_on_confessing_feelings/

On one hand I feel like everything needs to go right with this girl because if it doesn't then who knows if I'll be lucky enough to get another chance. I'm also worried about me ending up committing to her out of desperation and missing out on something better with someone else.

I never had a girlfriend or went on a date, but I would love to have one. However I am not really an outgoing person. I do team sports twice in the week, but all the people there are males. Also I do things with friends (all males), but we are kind of nerdy and not outgoing. We play videogames together for example. We rarely go out and they are not even interested in a girlfriend now. And if we go out we do not go to these crazy places like a discotheke or a crazy party the entire night were people get relationships. We rather go to a restaurant or an amusement park and spend the day. Or just go for a simple walk or hike. 

You can give advices like join clubs etc. and go to libraries. I don't want to forge myself into these things, because then I know I am not going to like it. I tried dating apps, but that was just a disaster. 

I finished school and imo that was the best period to ever get a girlfriend. You could get to know so many people of your age during that time. I wasted it by just having fun, but making no progres getting a romantic relationship.

We both love each other and never thought about marriage before until we saw each other.

I was drunk and he was sober, I was frightened. I wish I‚Äôd got out and found another way to get home, or even just got pneumonia, but I didn‚Äôt.

I had ptsd afterwards and put myself in some risky situations with men for a few years after until something happened that made me realise I needed therapy.

I am much more healed now, though I wouldn‚Äôt say cured. I‚Äôm dating again and want to find someone to settle down with. But this part of my past makes me anxious about intimacy. I can‚Äôt afford therapy atm.
