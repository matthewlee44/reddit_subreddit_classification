0,pnne6q,1631563966,Blindsided that he never told me he still had feelings for his ex,I had been seeing a guy for a month we got super close went on dates often were intimate with eachother and I felt like we were both developing deep feelings. When I mentioned if we were going to turn this into a relationship soon he kept saying he does want that but he’s not sure when. That was a bit of a red flag for me because I already felt like I didn’t want to be with anyone else. I expressed this to him and he told me he likes me a lot but he then told me he feels like he’s not over his ex and he doesn’t know if she were to reach out to him if he would talk with her or not. I felt super blindsided by this because he told me from the beginning how horrible she was to him and how he was over her. We both expressed from the beginning that the goal was to find a relationship and then he randomly tells me this out of nowhere and that he’s confused and feels like he wants something causal so he doesn’t hurt me etc. I just feel very hurt and shocked.

I went on tho cheat on her never physically  neither emotionally but i was constantly disrespecting by commenting on girls pics and texting a few but it never lead to anything else. I think i did this because i felt i could not ever trust her and that she was probably doing the same or worse. Time passes and Ive decided i didn't want to be that person anymore. I wanted to be good regardless whatever i thought the outcome was going to be because i loved her so much. And i know if i loved her so much why do all that to her i was younger at the time and let my negative emotions get a strong hold of me. But as im in the middle of truly changing myself for the better of me and our relationship. I decide its time to really let her know what ive been doing to better myself and let her know that i am taking this relation 10000% serious and that i have been for a little while now ( 3 months ). But as i go to talk to her about this in our conversation things got a little heated and she said "" you better start acting right because i got somebody who will treat me right "". When she said this i was trying my hardest not to lose it  ( not anger but sadness ). The person she was referring to is a fellow coworker of hers. After she said that i proceeded to ask the obvious questions like what all did you guys do if anything etc. She told me that they did not do anything and i believed  her. But i am a very skeptical person so the following weeks i had been asking her everyday those same question and her answers were always the same until one day she finally told a truth and said that they had kissed. Another two weeks go by and she finally tells another truth and told me that she gripped his dick. 

I am typing all this out because i am confused on what to do with this relationship. I love this women to death i swear and i know ive done wrong to her and i am truly sorry for that and have been doing everthing in my power to change and show that. She says this is all my fault and they she cheated because of me but i know they probably did more then she said . This is the person i would like to see myself with in the coming years. but the ways its looking it might not happen. Ive been acting like things are fine but i feel like a piece of us is gone inside me i dont feel right talking to her sometimes almost like im disgusted sometimes but i love her so much so im trying. But i used to know that she loved me so much how i always did and i know that she would not have cheated if she still loved me that way because thats who she is a strong and loyal women ( thats why i worked so hard for her ) but after this she still says she loves me and all but i truly dont feel it .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnngys/confused_and_need_insight/

11,pnnsx9,1631565225,When Does The Awkward Phase End,"So, during new year's I (F/31) slept with a friend (M/23). Or rather, he slept with me after I got blackout drunk and he took me to his room. All is well, I found him cute enough and had sobered up enough to properly consent once things got to that point-- I just want to be clear that he was the one who went out of his way to get us in bed together in the first place. My issue is it's September now and the guy is still treating me worse than a stranger.

As far as I remember, the sex was pretty typical for drunk sex (i.e. more about the vibe than prowess for either of us). I made sure not to overstay my welcome in his bed, and moved to suffer my hangover on the couch once I was able to walk that far in the morning. And we didn't know each other well, but we were on friendly terms before we slept together. I figured his cold/distant thing was due to him not wanting to deal with attachments or the like, which, fair enough.

But this far into the new year with him being avoidant/ignoring me and I'm kind of getting annoyed. We have an overlap in social circles and so have hung out in multiple times since then. And the switch in his attitude towards me is still there-- he's fine and nice with everyone else, so it's noticeable. I thought it would get easier, and hell I honestly thought \*I\* would remain the awkward one about it.

Anyway, at this point, I feel like talking it out will make it worse since he's pretty adamant about not wanting to be near me at all.

So I'm diabetic and have something called peyronie's disease. I am 39, and things downstairs aren't working so much anymore.  


I am scheduled to get a penile implant soon. This is devastating and humiliating to me. It's permanent, I'll never get a natural one again (I currently get, well, useless ones.) This has been a major blow to my confidence, especially since it used to be a part of myself that I was kind of proud of. I am still single and this is making me pretty terrified that it's yet one more hurdle towards finding a partner.   


I've done a lot of research and apparently the partner satisfaction rate is very high, but that's mostly with older married couples who are having sex again for the first time in a while. It apparently feels and looks exactly the same, and I can still have an orgasm. There's no refractory period so that's a plus, and apparently it increases girth.  


On the other hand I have to manually pump it through a device hidden in my scrotal sac. I am afraid women will be hugely turned off by this. I am good at oral and even enjoy doing it. Would this be a deal breaker? Would it be too weird? It feels like a deformity and one might miss seeing me get actually aroused. I will never have a natural erection ever again.  


I am hugely depressed, anxious, devastated, humiliated, furious, and more about this. I know it might sound shallow and dumb to some people but it feels like I'm just losing such an intimate part of my body forever. Please be honest because I am looking at other options like maybe stem cell treatment which costs a ton of money, or other things that will take more time.

This girl played with my feelings. I was an emotionally stable man, and she came into my life and wrecked it all. I became submissive. I disrespected my feelings and needs in hopes of pleasing her. And now she is going to break up with me tomorrow and still I don't want that... how is this possible? 

I just want to cry, we had something amazing, I had never experienced such a level of attraction before. Her smell, her hugs... just looking at her makes me want to tell her I love her, but she will probably just look at me in disgust.

Nothing wrong happened, I was never a bad partner. We spent an amazing night together, and the next few days she started pushing me away

36,pnq5b8,1631572714,Good place to date online that is NOT POF?,"(Kind of a long read? Idk its 3 paragraphs haha)

Long story short, I don't have enough free time to feel like I want to go out and date physically. I decided to try online dating and wow, what a crap shoot. I've been on this website plenty of fish, it's got to be the cesspool of humanity. Hookers, scammers, transexuals constantly hitting on me and showing me their junk (I'm 23 year old male by the way). Is there a better place to go?

I did try Match but that place was also a waste of time. Entire month went by with like 4 likes and no messages, one of my ""likes"" even blocked me for saying hello. Bumble and Okcupid doesn't even LET you message first! Is there anywhere that men can go to get a fair chance? lol

POF seems like the only valid free option but you can't even message half the people due to this stupid mechanic, ""xxxx has disabled messaging for now"". Basically it means you didn't 100% match their criteria and so you are automatically disabled from messaging. Excuse me, website bot, let THEM or I decide if we should message or not. Literally every woman that I thought we'd get along well, won't even let me message them.

38,pnqf9b,1631573679,Dating in other countries/ Height,"Hi, this may sound odd.
So im a 5ft2 guy in the US, 25 yrs old. Im also a minority. 

In the past I only had one relationship but there was a lack of mutual attraction in the relationship. I had to completely get rid of all or most my standards physically. We both settled to a degree and the relationship ended up breaking apart. Now I must admit I havent really tried very hard to get in another relationship since then cause Ive been busy otherwise but based off my minimal past experiences and my observations, things look really bad. I am looking at my options now. I realize that my height is a significant hinderance to getting in a quality relationship. According to stats only 2% of women would date a guy my height in the US barring any other preferences on my end.

That being said, the way I see it, I only have three solutions to get a relationship with mutual attraction:

-Find that 2% and somehow get extremely lucky, put in immense effort for a tiny maybe. Sacrifice all other aspects of my life: Work, goals, career

-Save up for a couple years and get limb lengthening to become 5'6 (still short) and have a slightly better chance of getting what I want with a large chance of me not. Leaving job for a while.

-Look overseas to shorter countries and find someone conpatible overseas. (Mail order). Maybe ill find mutual attraction in a shorter country? Bring them back to the US. Risk getting extorted. And im still short so id have to face requirements in other countries as well. Time off work . etc

Given all these options, I feel like the third option is truly the best route. I wont have to maim myself or waste exorbiont amounts of time being rejected for little gain. Has anyone else been in this predicament? Whats the best option in this case other than dying alone or settling for someone youre not attracted to?

48,pnr4pg,1631576198,Falling in love with your partner's flaws,"So recently, I had the opportunity to do some light reading from an excellent book - the central them for the book was about communication. So it is said that the secret to a long-lasting, happy relationship is to ""fall in love with your partner's flaws."" What is more, the author shares of this book shares the idea that acceptance should override tolerance (that is, into the context of loving your partner's flaws). I define acceptance as loving the whole person (not only what you like about your partner, but also what you dislike about them), and tolerance meaning ""putting up with your partner even when you know they are wrong.""

50,pnrehk,1631577183,My girlfriend acts like a baby/toddler,"So to start with the positive; My (33f) GF (27f) is very thoughtful,  very giving and kind, and has an even temperament which is huge for me as I have been in a few abusive relationships in the past.  I have been in and am still in therapy and plan to ask my therapist about this eventually but we're working on other things right now and I'd just like some input.

My GF acts like a 5 year old, and it really turns me off. Like I can go from wanting to do a marathon in the bedroom to not wanting her to touch me at all. It grosses me out when she whines like a baby because she had a bad dream, whines like a baby because there was something gory on TV, whines like a baby if she gets a cramp. But in front of others she's never like this. She is mature and bubbly and passionate and powerful like a grown woman usually is (and that's who I am attracted to.) But home alone she talks like a baby sometimes like ""oh hehe I know I'm being weird sorry!"" But like, how you would imagine a 5 year old saying it.

I have tried over and over to talk to her about it and every time she completely agrees that I  am not her mother, I am not responsible for her emotions or her behavior and while I am here to support her, I am not here to baby her. I even asked her ""are you a little? Because I'm not into that "" and she very much insisted that she is not.

I get the impression that she thinks girls are supposed to be like this with their partners but it's not practical at all and it's killing our relationship. 

It also makes its way into the bedroom.  She has on more than one occasion completely killed the mood by acting sort of child like,  it's hard to explain.  When I talked to her about it, specifically about how she is totally into me pleasing her but acts like pleasing me is extremely uncomfortable for her or she has no idea what she's doing even though she's been with several other people, she said she had some mental blocks, and that she was willing to work through them. But when she finally did make love to me for the first time, she acted traumatized after and now I never want to do it again. 

She also is in therapy but I don't think she even knows just HOW much she acts like a child because she ONLY does it when she's with me, and never with anyone else so she probably doesn't consider it to be a personality thing. 

I think this is a trauma response known as regression but she insists that's not the case and I'm at a loss because I don't think this can work until she sees it is a problem.  

How can I more effectively show her that she's pushing me away with this behavior without seemingly being an AH?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnrehk/my_girlfriend_acts_like_a_babytoddler/

So I had a fwb with a girl, we got along and everything like that. We agreed to only sleep with each other at the start met up a couple of times and I’ve slept over. I invited her to a party and we went shopping to get me an outfit. 

So recently, tinder was downloaded on her phone to see how women do on the app. Since then it felt like she was rubbing it in my face saying “aww are you jealous I have tinder” are you jealous are you jealous. But I didn’t say anything and just went silent. “I was a little jealous with how much attention she gets” her having tinder isn’t s problem it’s how she gone about everything. She said she isn’t going to use it she’s just curious, the next day she’s kept asking me if I wanted her to delete it. I told her it’s her choice. 

She told me she wasn’t interested in meeting anyone or lads. And said she wasn’t messaging anyone on the app. Then she was but nothing serious. And now today she’s apparently meeting someone next week. 

I had a meh reaction as I thought why didn’t you just say that’s why you wanted to use it in the first place? Instead of making a big deal and asking if I’m jealous. So we got into an argument after I explained that I’m pissed at how she’s gone about this situation and she’s instantly thrown the jealous card and she can do what she likes she’s single. Said she thought her saying to me are you jealous was a joke but yet she asked me what was up and I explained. So In this argument she’s been petty and said  things to piss me off and hurt me. While I’m just trying to explain how it made me feel? Apparently it’s controlling behaviour and she can do what she likes it’s her choice.

59,pnrxzm,1631579091,Just a rant about my post breakup feelings :),"It's been a month after I broke up with my boyfriend and I think I'm just now processing everything.

The breakup wasn't clean. After I told him we were over, we continued texting as friends and because I knew he'd take it bad if I cut him off completely. I thought over time it'd become easier, but he used it as a way to get me back. It backfired and I became fed up with the whole situation. We had another argument and after that I haven't opened his chat. 

But now, after the storm has passed and I'm finally calmed down, I find myself missing him from time to time. I find myself missing our casual convos and playful discussions. Despite our problems, we still had some good times and sometimes when I remember them my eyes well up.
Yesterday, I came across a post I knew he'd like and for a moment I forgot everything and almost sent it to him. Few days before that, something good happened to me and I wanted to tell him so bad but I couldn't. 

It's weird, you know. You spend a year with someone, learn what they like, how they experience things, what brings a smile on their face, you learn their flaws and imperfections, you even love them, and after the breakup you're left with a hole that will heal but in the meantime you have to deal with the empty, disgusting feeling of having to relearn how to be without them. They were a part of the daily routine for months and all of a sudden they're not and it hurts. It doesn't mean breaking up was wrong or that just because you miss them you should forgive all their mistakes, but it's just...frustrating to go through all that to feel at peace again.

I know I will never get back with him—the problems we had in the relationship weren't small things—but I'm just sad because I lost someone who was loyal and, even though didn't know how to properly express his emotions or talk things through like an adult, someone who seemed to really love me in his own weird way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnrxzm/just_a_rant_about_my_post_breakup_feelings/

63,pns7y9,1631580108,Opinions on a fishy situation?,"Origination Story:
I met this girl on Bumble a couple of weeks ago who I really clicked with. We ended up going on a date to the mall labor day weekend. We kissed a couple times in the mall and ended up making out in the car for a couple hours after we got out. She came over to hang out after making a pitstop for PJs at her place, and we just fell asleep together. It's also worth noting that she was ending her period when we hung out the first time.

Backstory:
For the past week, she has been very consistent at texting me when she wakes up around 5:30am and telling me goodnight when she goes to bed around 8pm. In between, we'll usually text pretty consistently throughout the day.

We were supposed to hang out last Thursday, but she ended up needing to stay late at her work since her coworker had to go attend to their kid. She expressed how much she hates bailing on plans, but that she was really tired and it would be better to hang out on Friday. I agreed, because a Friday movie night sounded pretty killer.

Friday comes, and I get sent home from work with Covid symptoms -- so I tell her this and end up cancelling the date. (I've had the virus and the vaccine, so low likelihood that I would get it yet again)

On Saturday, I was pretty confident that I didn't have covid because only my sore throat was sticking around -- but I went to get tested anyways. She has been wanting me to go on a walk with her, so I asked if she wanted me to go with her. She agreed. We left our houses about the same time, but I live 40 minutes away from the destination so I wasn't even close. She calls me after like 10 minutes and says she's not going walking today because a screwdriver was in her tire. She sent me a red snap of a screwdriver in her tire, so that's definitely true.

On Sunday, she didn't talk much for most of the afternoon, but gave me a call in the evening to talk about her day. Everything seemed good, and she sent me a sweet goodnight text that also thanked me for video chatting with her for a while. I also got my negative covid test on Sunday.

The Situation:
While on the phone Sunday, we said we were going to hang out this (Monday) evening. She doesn't text me in the morning like she usually does, so I send her one when I get up at 7am. She still hadn't answered by 11, which is really uncommon, so I ask ""Is u alive?"". She said ""Sorta"". I asked ""What happened?"" And she just said ""Just been super busy"" -- also pretty uncommon. She didn't send anything after that. The time comes when we were supposed to hang out, and she still hasn't answered my next message. I give her a call, and she says that shes at home laying in bed and feels awful -- with stomach pains, a migraine, and something else. The call lasts about 90 seconds because she sounds awful.

The Question:
What's y'alls take on the situation? It seems pretty fishy to me that she would take a sharp turn like this. I'm kind of thinking that there could be something working in the background that I don't know about yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pns7y9/opinions_on_a_fishy_situation/

She is super closed off and let’s no one inside her head and her heart. I understand completely too. She wasn’t dealt the best hand in life and has a laundry list of scumbag men who’ve used and abused her. I just want to be there for her but I know she has a past that she’s not proud of. She’s young, and hard headed, and a single mother. I’m often in the road because if my job and have to leave her for weeks at a time. I’ve done Google searches and the basics and have found nothing on her. I’m not a creep and I’m not controlling or obsessed, I’m worried. I just want to make sure that the past is actually the past and that she’s not doing anything stupid or desperate especially when all I want to do is be there for her. I just want to show her that good men exist and that there is a better life for her and her baby but I can’t get past the suspicion that there’s something she is hiding. Something big.

68,pnskty,1631581433,A long confession from 24M Toronto,"So I haven't had a chance to date a woman after arriving in Toronto. Everyone seemed so focused on his/her career, including the uni I'm attending. Moreover, Covid prevented me go to pubs or cafes to interact with others.
Whenever walking around the streets, i could see many attractive girls. I dress well, I fit well. As I identify myself as a shy introvert, I always have a courage to ask them out, but I'm always afraid of being rejected. This was originated from one the past memories that I had. Getting detailed, I liked one of my friends a lot but turned out she had a boyfriend and my mind shattered. She realized I liked her, then she left from my friendzone. After that, I couldn't eat about a week and couln't sleep properly. I had this memory from my home country(S.korea) and I don't care about it anymore anyways.



 Of course i cannot ask them straightly like ""Are you single"" etc on the streets. I mean I should do some efforts to interact with other torontonians, and I still am doing. But I still haven't had a chance to get to know other women, and craving some intimacy which could build the future together.
I've been trying tinder, meanwhile, the match results were unsatisfying

This is my long description posted on several reddit websites. Hopefully I can get some dating advices.



After the longevity of covid, I'm looking to get out of my tedious life and try new things. Got out from helicopter parents and living in DT toronto, I regard this moment as an appropriate timing for this. 

I'm 24, 5'11"", Asian(Korean) int'l student, Double vaxxed, currently sparing my time from school. I've been spending my time preparing school, and currently taking summer courses. Been shy, but I really like meeting other people. 
I love grabbing cold fizzy drinks and wandering around the city with trams, watching theatres. I don't really go to parties or pubs but I go to parks or campus to relieve myself from the heatwave. I'm listening to instrumental pop musics with earphones nowadays cuz it's hard to allow myself to go to heavily crowded places.

I also enjoy skiing, walking along the beach and trailing around the city. If allowed to, I'd pack my luggages and planned my details for the trip. 

As always, I've been thinking it would be great to share the adventures such as delicious fun🔥😏 and try something new. I'm also down to have a romantical style partner to go on fun dates with and enjoy a deep convo at cafes and get to know each other. 

Hope we could be together. Unless, no hard feelings :) Maybe we could start our convo and move on to the next stage.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnskty/a_long_confession_from_24m_toronto/

So I think I like my best friend. I don’t feel the feelings that I usually feel when I like someone but around her it’s different.

This is a thing I don’t think she’d stop talking to me for. Idk if I actually like her or if it’s a nonsexual fantasy that I have. I mean sometimes I just want to kiss the fire out of her if that’s not too bold to say (not that I would just randomly do so). Today I kind’ve wanted to get her flustered so I told her “has anyone ever told you how INCREDIBLY (I emphasized that) beautiful, I am. Because I’m just awesome”. It wasn’t awkward or anything but she just didn’t say anything. Kind’ve worried that my mind glossed over how bad that was but usually I know when somethings that awkward.

I matched with this guy about 2 months ago and we started talking on the app which led to him asking for my number and then asking me out. We went on a pretty good first date, conversation was good and I was attracted to him. We then met up a few days later at a bar with some of our friends. We’ve been texting every single day for the past month but haven’t been able to get together for a 2nd date over the past couple weeks because I was on vacation with my family for a week and then when I got back he was busy with work. He took a few days longer to text me back last week and I was scared he was ghosting me but then he I texted him and he responded right away. We had a date planned this Wednesday but I could tell over the past few days he had been a little distant. To my surprise he texted me tonight saying he’s sorry he’s been distant and he doesn’t see this going any further. I’m so crushed. Idk what I did wrong. I feel like he wasted my time for the past month texting me every day and getting to know me. Idk what I could’ve said or did wrong. 

How do I cope? Being rejected is the reason I hate dating and don’t put myself out there much. I hate getting my hopes up and then being absolutely crushed and not knowing what I did wrong.

77,pntl2z,1631585095,Dating In Vancouver.,"Hi M25 here, just came onto to say that i’ve been reading a lot on this topic and i can say that dating in Vancouver is beyond impossible! Don’t take this post as a dig at this beautiful city and amazing people that come from here. It’s just incredibly hard to find a decent partner in such a lonely place. 

I originally moved abroad to seek a better life both for a better career and i guess a better love life, in which the career side has gone great considering that this is all anyone does here is work, eat &amp; sleep (which there is absolutely noting wrong with), but trying to put yourself out there to better you love life is an lottery. It’s sad that you have to result to dating apps just so you could get a conversation from someone new let alone trying to find a partner. 

Also by not having a sports car or being Mr.flashy being up to date with the latest crap ppl are attracted is worrying. Can anyway relate to this? even if you’re not from Vancouver? maybe if your own city or town? i liked to here what people have to say!

78,pntmfb,1631585228,relationship advice - tell partner?,"Hi all,

In my first relationship (M) for the past 5 months or so. Hung out with another work colleague recently; we have a lot in common, value-wise and interest-wise. I'm not very good at picking up flirting cues, so I went into the day thinking that it was just as a regular hang out. In the back of my mind, I told myself that if things were to turn in a romantic sense, I would have to let her know and set the boundaries. I would like to get to know her better as friends given our similar values. Anyways, we end up hanging out for the whole day. She invites me back to her place and we are chatting on her couch. I'm starting to realize that she is probably thinking this day was more of a date rather than ""get to know each other as friends"" situation. Anyways, we drive back to my apartment and in the car I end up directly asking her whether she liked me in that romantic sense. She ended up saying yes, and I let her know I was in a relationship but that I would love to still get to know her as friends. She ended up asking if I liked her at all in a romantic way. Throughout the day, I had developed some attraction to her, so I let her know that yes, I had some romantic interest but that wasn't going to go anywhere at the present moment. We left it off as - sure, we can still hang out, but with the friend boundaries.

Anyways, two questions for a newbie at dating/relationships:

1) Can I simply be friend with someone of an opposite sex while I'm in a relationship, even when both of us have at least some romantic interest in one another? I know I can set boundaries and that it would never be crossed.

2) Should I tell my current partner about what happened (not that anything actually happened, we just hung out). My gut says I should, but at the same time I realize my current partner is very anxious about everything and has low confidence; she has also been cheated on before. So I'm thinking that if I tell her, she would make it more than it actually was. If I were her, I'd actually appreciate it and trust my partner more for telling me, but I'm not sure in this case.

Any advice appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pntmfb/relationship_advice_tell_partner/

80,pntof8,1631585442,Finally had a good date…,"It’s been maybe two or three years since I’ve had a good date. I almost didn’t go because I’m tired of back to back disaster dates. 

He had all the green flags—I won’t list them because I’m not trying to start a debate. But I will say he made me genuinely laugh when it feels like so many guys are so busy trying to get sex they hardly have a personality. We had so much in common and he kept fawning over it. We even have the same tattoo in the same spot. He asked me to hang out again the very next day. Told me he liked me and was very genuine. Even admitted he paid money to rematch because I missed the time window. Like it is very rare for me but I was so genuinely attracted to him even tho he didn’t check all my physically boxes. (He was super cute by short for instance) 

Then today when we’re lowkey discussing sex I inform him that I don’t have casual sex. It wasn’t like “IM NOT FUCKING YOU” it was a very covert convo about our intentions and such. So, he drops the bomb that he got divorced after a TEN YEAR relationship that started when he was 16. Not sure when exactly. 

Basically he says while he had a fantastic time and absolutely is interested in me, he wants to have a ho phase instead. 

And I’m just honestly shocked how someone could shut down such a great connection for the streets. Especially with how savage they are these days. Every day I wish I could take back my home days because they honestly traumatized me. 

But I guess it’s different for men?

I feel sympathy but I can’t get over the nagging feeling that he was just trying to get sex from me and doesnt have the game to finesse it like most app veterans. 

Needless to say, I deleted all my dating apps immediately. I honestly cannot suffer through another second of the disappointment online dating brings. 

At this point im reevaluating if I could ever even see myself having a long term partner because at this point it feels like everyone esp on apps is rebounding or just being a ho (even in their mid thirties) and no one wants anything substantial.

So I actually hit it off with someone on POF, of all things, similar interests, mutually attracted, etc.  So I gave him my number and he texted me this morning.  I was at work, I tried to send but it wouldn't go, and work was so busy I didn't have time to troubleshoot it.  Also my day was extra long and I didn't get home until almost 7.  I try to call him to say sorry, and explain, but find out my service was disconnected all day!!  So I send a message explaining, with a photo, and say sorry (no response), then I go to POF to see what his last message was and its gone, his profile is missing from my inbox.  

Now if it was ME and I texted someone in the morning, and they didn't text me ALL DAY I would be pissy and delete them too.  But if they explained later like I did, that my service was off, and left a voice message and sent a photo - I would respond, if just to give them the benefit of the doubt.  But nothing...

I know any further texting and explaining, or even pictures  (sexy ones) would be akin to stalking \[okay, so I tried one more time just now\], so I'll lay off it now.  But I guess i'm not even asking advice, unless you have some, I just wanted to vent about it.  I don't find people I 'click' with that often, and I know if its meant to be it will be.

I've had only ever had one legit long-term gf who ended up cheating on me and said some real messed up stuff to me when we broke up.

Yet, I always am put in the friendzone or watch the girls I'm interested in go for the typical ""fuckboy"". On the outside I hold my composure, but on the inside I'm fed up and exhausted. I go home to an empty house everyday and honestly, I've become content with it at this point. As much as I would love to have a find and grow with someone, it seems like more work than my full-time job. 

So, that's it. I'm done. The worst part is, I know no girls will truly care whether I'm available or not.

I was seeing this girl that I matched with online but had met from a mutual friend prior for a few months. After the second date told me she was not ready for anything serious yet but wanted to still get to know me, which I agreed to as I didn't think it had been that long yet.

We'd talk every day and go out for hours and we really enjoyed each others company. I wanted to know if anything had progressed. So I kept lurking here searching for old posts until I realized I just had to be honest and open.

So I decided to be clear about how I felt and my expectations (being okay with going slow, but still interested romantically). And after a bit of back and forth, it was clear that she was still not ready, but also just wanted to be friends.

I have to be honest it hurt a lot to hear it. It was also hard to say that I wanted to move on and not cling on to any false hope. I know I will be glad eventually that I brought it up rather than just continuing not really knowing how she felt.

I have never been on a date, or even held hands with a girl. Why am I never even given a chance to date? Why am I automatically seen as lesser than?

I know what this sounds like; it sounds like I feel that I’m entitled. And that girls should just throw themselves at me because I’m such a rare gift, right?

We’ve both admitted we miss talking to each other and I said he can call me. But he hasn’t. This situation is just sad and painful. I just want to talk to him again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnv0l9/i_miss_him/
96,pnvbtg,1631591775,I'm 20 (M) and attracted to a woman in her 40s.,"I've never had much luck in romance with people my age. In high school, it was easy to meet and talk to people. Problem was, I rarely had feelings for anyone, and when I did, they were rarely reciprocated. I dated, sure, but I never felt a real and genuine connection to anyone. Looking back, it was my loneliness that drove me to be with those people, despite the fact that I didn't want to admit that at the time. 

Fast forward to now. I'm a college student and have a much better understanding of what romance means to me and what I want out of a partner. A few months back, I became involved with a local group in my city that plays Pokemon Go. We meet up downtown every Wednesday and occasionally on the weekends to play the game together. Most of them are likeable enough, but I've really clicked with one woman in particular. She's beautiful and more or less the ""leader"" of the group, the one that everyone kind of gravitates around. I feel so comfortable around her and I can really and truly be myself around her, and I can't say that about a lot of people. I'm traditionally very shy, partly due to my autism, but all of that goes away when I'm with her. We've been spending a considerable amount of time with each other lately, sometimes with the group, other times just the two of us. We've had a lot of deep conversations and I really think something is developing between us, at least on my end. We're both single. Butttt....she's twice my age.

I'm not really someone who's against age gaps for the most part; I see nothing morally wrong here. I wouldn't normally go for someone her age, but I truly believe that she and I are kindred spirits and I seriously want to ask her out. More than anything, though, I don't want to ruin our friendship, because I consider her a valuable friend and I know that she reciprocates that much. I just cannot see a doctor in her 40s wanting to be with an angsty college kid who's barely out of his teens and is still trying to figure himself out. I would totally be content with staying as we are, and that's probably the best thing that we could do. We are at different points in life and we probably both want different things. But it's getting to the point where I can't get her out of my head, and I know that something is going to have to give soon. Either I get over this attraction, or I'll have to fess up. I really don't know what to do, and I certainly don't want to ask my parents for advice. They think it's weird that a woman her age hangs around people like me and they're already skeptical of her, and honestly, I don't blame them. I know I'll have to deal with that if things actually do progress, but for now, I can't see anything good coming out of them knowing. 

So, I turn to you, strangers of reddit: what should I do here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnvbtg/im_20_m_and_attracted_to_a_woman_in_her_40s/
97,pnvjl4,1631592609,Give this dude another chance or not? Basically ghosted me two years and texted me out of the blue,"We met on an app two years and spent a fair amount of time together. Things got awkward when I (23) attempted to make plans on what would have been Valentine’s Day, which wasn’t intentional but a coincidence. Anyways, shortly afterwards he (27) took that as an opportunity to clarify my expectations in regards to “getting something for v-day” then hit me with the infamous: I’m NoT lOoKiNg FoR a ReLaTioNsHiP. We hung out once or twice more then out of the blue I never heard from him again. I’m pretty sure he sent me a message on an anonymous Instagram account saying he knew he F’d up and made a mistake. Ever since then he’s tried to contact me on apps and recently texted me (don’t know why he has my number) stating he “want to see me again” ..... thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnvjl4/give_this_dude_another_chance_or_not_basically/
