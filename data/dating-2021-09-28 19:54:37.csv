It felt like he was really interested in me. He literally asked me so many questions about myself and philosophy (it‚Äôs what I studied in school). It got to the point where I felt like I was talking so much and had to change the conversation so that I could get to know him better. 

But he was genuinely engaging with me and I think he was just really interested in philosophy and literature. We have read a lot of the same books and have a lot in common.

As the title says, matched with a guy on tinder couple weeks back. Both of us have kids around the same age. Since we live far from each other, I thought we will not meet any time soon, and exchanged phone numbers

Chatted daily about all kinds of stuff and he told me he was in a toxic marriage previously

Yesterday, I had this itch to google him, and with the first name on Tinder, city, and area of work, it was easy. Found his facebook and pictures with his wife, and them together on his wife‚Äôs profile a week before he started taking to me, clearly still together

So last night over text I went into the specifics of when exactly he was divorced. Said its been more than a year and a half
He said he is on good terms with his ex and sees his son on alternate weekends and did/always does what‚Äôs best for his kid

This morning I asked him if he was on any social media, and he said only on some fitness app. I did not respond

In less than an hour all his fb posts were deleted and his pictures changed from the couple to just his kid‚Äôs

I replied in the evening saying I found him when I looked him up earlier today. I did not say when exactly, his original or modified profile, to give him a chance and see what he says

I can see he read my message. No reply. Checked on tinder and he unmatched me

I have tinder profile and message screenshots that I took yesterday after seeing him on fb. And the texts obviously

I can contact the wife based on a tagged picture.

I haven't even had my first kiss. As a teenager and into my early 20s, I made attempts at asking girls out in my classes, but every single time I tried, I wound up back-pedaling by telling them that I know they don't feel the same way about me. Now, in my late 20s, I don't even express attraction towards women I like. I avoid making eye contact with or even looking at women I find attractive unless I'm in conversation with them. If I lock eyes, I quickly look away and avoid getting caught a second time. I never say or do anything flirty. I approach them with the intent to pursue a platonic friendship because it feels disrespectful to express an interest in anything more if I haven't received signals that such overtures would be reciprocated. I keep my feelings bottled up inside, and I do my best to avoid revealing them to anyone.

I just want to ask somebody out. I want to express my feelings, and potentially have them reciprocated. But every time I want to shoot my shot, I always try to imagine how it would go, and I keep envisioning scenarios in my head where I give it a try and wind up making her feel extremely uncomfortable because some aspect about my approach was inappropriate. Maybe it was the wrong place and time, or maybe I had misinterpreted her signals and made a move when it was unwanted. Sometimes I even imagine there being repercussions for me as a result, like getting kicked out of whatever venue I'm at for harassing behavior. And so, to avoid all of this from happening, I refrain from asking anybody out.

Are my anxieties justified? What do you need to know before asking a woman out on a date?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxnsie/dating_romance_and_attractionin_my_late_20s_and/

37,pxoalv,1632891479,Dating Apps,"Hi all,

23M here. I want to ask a few questions about your thoughts on dating apps.

1. Do you feel as if there‚Äôs TOO MUCH choice on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge? Personally, I find an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù amount of people per day leads to endless swiping or matching, which in turn, makes each one feel less important or interesting. This reinforces casual dating and hookup culture too IMO ‚Äî people just swipe because there‚Äôs no reason not to. Aside from them wanting our money via endless engagement, feel like 3-5 curated profiles per day would be optimal. Far more ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and realistic IMO. 

2. Is there a better way to shoot your shot? Why couldn‚Äôt people send intro videos like Snapchat to each other to show personality? I feel like this could help show personality behind a few prompts and pics. Actually see someone‚Äôs ‚Äúvibe‚Äù that you originally may not have shown interest in. No more low effort matches (or catfishes lol), I think this could separate desperate hookups from relationships as people make more effort.  (Assuming it‚Äôs not full of NSFW content videos lmfao). I get you can video chat with people, but that‚Äôs after the superficial match was made üòÇ

Hinge is my favorite, but at the end of the day, the dynamic is nearly the same. Guess that‚Äôs what happens when 1 business owns ALL of them. Lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxoalv/dating_apps/

48,pxovrf,1632893941,I love tall women!,"So first I will give a little context. 

I am in my early 20s and a male in the US, and I am 5'9 or around 176cm. I have always had a thing for taller ladies! I think it might be some childhood related events that got me to this point. For example I was always a very overweight child and I was made fun of for it. In fact I can still wear some of my clothes from when I was 10. You can imagine the bullying I experienced and on top of that I was in a minority racially so that also didn't help. One of the closest friends I had in elementary school was a girl that was much taller than me. I never cared and she was always there to help me with my bullies. I never made fun of her because I didn't care, she would always play jokes on me of course like taking something of mine and holding it where I could reach or something silly like that. But she had my back when it counted and I think maybe through the countless experiences I had when I was younger with girls, especially taller girls has lead me to the feelings I have now.

Fast forward to the present I have a friend she is 6'5 amazingly tall but again I don't care and in fact if university hadn't set us to opposite sides of the country I definitely would have tried to ask her out. I personally think she looked even better with 4 inch/10cm heels!! I love when tall girls wear heels! But with that being said comes my question. WOULD A WOMEN GIVE A GUY SHORTER THAN THEM THE CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW THEM BETTER? I am talking about innocent dating here with no sex involved because I am a virgin and plan to stay that way until marriage. The reason I bring this up is because I have experience with young women my age in europe, and not a single one I met cared about height as a primary requirement. I met with young ladies that were from 5'10 to 6'2 I actually just matched with one on tinder and she is 6'2 and out conversations have been great so far. Based on my little experience it seems that the ladies in central and eastern Europe specifically the Baltic region don't make height a priority it seems to take a back seat to other qualities. Where as in the US height is taken more seriously. So I ask again, DO WOMEN GIVER SHORTER GUYS A CHANGE TO GET TO KNOW THEM BETTER OVER DATING, OR DO YOU OVERLOOK THEM?

TLDR: I love tall women and love it more when they wear heels, do women give men the chance to get to know them better in an innocent dating scenario, or is that a hard pass?

49,pxovub,1632893949,Feeling torn. What to do next?,"I (33F) went out for a date (36M) after a very long time. Them and I had been exchanging texts for a while (2months) before actually meeting each other in person. We couldn't meet in person prior to the day since they had some engagement and then I had some of mine. Anyhoo, the day arrives and we meet over drinks and are the last ones to leave the place after having chatted for a good 4 hours. We had some good conversations/discussions with some teasing sprinkled here and there to make it more fun.
As they are dropping me back home that night, and we stop near my apartment building, they mention that they wanted to kiss me. At this point I am about to get out of the car and am kind of buzzed due to the drinks and all that I manage to say is ""sorry, not today"" which is what I thought was a polite way to turn them down. And I shut the car door behind and get out and get into my apartment building and as I turn around one last time I see that they are waiting to see if I got in okay. 

I couldn't sleep that night, I felt I should have kissed them or at least said something more than just a lame 'no, sorry'. All night I was feeling torn between turning them down after a good date (they were thoughtful, and attentive and paid for the drinks) and not being comfortable kissing someone I barely knew. Or rather I wasn't comfortable kissing someone just after the first meeting and thought that they barely knew me. I would prefer for them to pay attention to the simpler things (just how I talk, think, respond to them with questions, gestures, expressions etc) for the first meet than making it complicated with a goodbye kiss really. I am a chronic people pleaser but this was something I just couldn't have done for them and then felt shitty later for it or given them false hopes. I wish for them to get to know me better and allow me to know them better before getting into anything physical. 

I left them a message just a casual text 4 days ago about how my weekend went and haven't heard back from them yet. 
I would like to see them again and have a candid talk about this, but at the same time I do think that I am right where I stand but also dont want to keep on rejecting them like this.

So I belong to a friend group that has several men and women. One of those men (who I'll call Matt) asked me out around 2 months ago. Initially I wasn't super attracted to him and I was also sorta seeing someone, so I turned him down. Then a few weeks ago I went out with some of the women and he were chatting and Matt was brought up and throughout the conversation, I basically said that I turned Matt down because I was seeing someone but it didn't pan out so now we're just FWB and not dating, and they asked if I would be interested in going on a date with Matt and I said yes, that I enjoy being around him and thought he was a great guy with a good personality. 

Fast forward to last week and he asks me out again because he'd heard that I might be interested and I said yes. We went on a date and planned a second one. It's camping, which he knows I love (I try to go once a month just for short overnight trips) and I thought it was a sweet gesture as he decidedly doesn't camp. The problem is that after a day of reflection I realized that I'm just not interested in him romantically or sexually. He's such a good guy with a great personality but I see him as a friend.

I know he's super excited to go camping and he keeps bringing it up, and I feel trapped because I also know he's been talking to our mutual friends about wanting to date me and I feel like a jerk for saying yes then changing my mind. I know I had a right to not be interested, etc, but it is kinda a blow to be turned down, go on a date, then be turned down again but the same person. To top it off, he just mentioned tonight that he had purchased some stuff for camping.

I'm mostly worried about our mutual friends being upset in me, because he is a tad bit closer to some of them and I wouldn't want to make things awkward for any/all of us. Advice and tips? Should I go camping just to see if my mind changes? Tips for turning him down without making it awkward and me seeming like a super big jerk?

70,pxqxk4,1632903554,Should I make a move or should I ignore my feelings and move on?,"So....I've recently developed a crush on my college classmate. (I'm a woman). Let's call him E. E and I got close during the pandemic and this summer we hung out a couple of times. It started with him asking me out for lunch, which sadly I couldn't attend. Then we played mini golf, went out for drinks and pool, and walks during the summer. I met some of his friends as well once when he invited me to come and join them to watch soccer. None of these occasions were labeled dates or anything so I went in with the understanding that we are just good friends that like to hang out.

During the summer we stayed in touch and texted a lot. He would occasionally send Snapchats when he was out of town. One time he asked me for advice regarding which selfie of his to put on social media so he sent me like 10 selfies which was hilarious.

Most recently, E started working at a college bar and last week he texted me friday afternoon, asking me if I could come. I arrived and saw him in the bar and we chatted for like half an hour, laughing and joking around. I then went to a table with two guys and introduced myself  and had a nice chat(I didn't have any of my friends there). E texted me, asking if I left. I answered nope, sitting at a table. I would then see him occasionally close to my table, serving other guests and sometimes I would catch his eyes.

The next day, late at around 11 PM, he texted me again saying he wanted me to come to the bar so that we can have revenge on the winners of a music quiz the night before. Sadly I couldn't attend that time. When I went home that friday night, and the following week, I realized that I'm absolutely smitten with him, cannot get him out of my mind-level. 

Yesterday I wrote to him, saying that I'm going to the student bar again. He was like oh nice, whats happening there? And I said not much, probably going there with a friend for some drinks. If you want to join you're welcome  and he was like yeah sure if I'm available, most likely. So we're scheduled for next week and I still have no idea if this is a date or just a friendly hang out between us.

However I realize that my perception is kind of off considering I have a crush on him, and maybe he is just being friendly and this is all platonic to a T.

Tldr: have a crush on my friend. Not sure if he is into me or if this is all just friendly.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxqxk4/should_i_make_a_move_or_should_i_ignore_my/

72,pxqz8v,1632903792,Was stood up twice by a girl I met on Tinder... : ( I'm just so humiliated.,"Long story short. Met this girl on Tinder (yikes I know... but I have no other ways to meet women around me at least at the moment.) she was pretty much my type (goth) and I was delighted to finally meet someone with similar tastes and interests so we happily matched and I was optimistic. We set up a date and I'm so nervous, I park and anxiously text her apologizing for being a few minutes late and that I just parked outside the ice cream parlor (where we planned to go) and that I was walking up. No reply. I sit down and wait. 20 minutes go by and I start to worry.... 40 minutes go by and the cute couple in front of me on a date start to leave..... an hour goes by and I'm humiliated and depressed. I msg her that I felt stood up and she finally decides to text me ""Omg I'm so sorry I thought I had a ride my bad (crying emoji)"" ....    I was pretty upset. Clearly she didn't really care, and not enough to tell me that before hand. I am so lonely though I decided to give her another chance and I picked her up. We seemed to mesh pretty well it was awkward at first since I was upset she stood me up but we had a good time and I thought we had a lot in common. I will say 2 things. 1... she reeked, I mean REEKED of weed... it was so bad I had to spray my car with Febreeze. I'm not anti-weed but I don't really support it or do that myself so I let her know to please next time turn it down a notch because the smell gives me head aches bad. Just my standard and I didn't want to hurt her feelings but I needed to be upfront.

I also found out secondly, she does strong dangerous drugs like LSD. And although she told me she doesn't do it often, often or not is enough for me to be uncomfortable dating someone doing it. I told her I liked her enough to want to have a second date, but I did not feel comfortable with that lifestyle.. surprisingly she told me she wouldn't do it anymore if I kept seeing her... so that made me have hope maybe I could help her.

So second date comes along, we made plans to go to the mall, arcade and movies at 5pm. I text her the next day at 4 letting her know Id be on the way soon, how was she, etc. no reply... I start worrying again.... I text her I'm on the way.... no reply... 30 minutes later I arrive.... and I tell her I'm there... nothing.... I call... no answer.... I wait another 20 minutes.... it's 6:20 .... and I say to myself... ""I don't deserve this."" .... so I drive off.

Later on she texts me telling me ""I'm so sorry. I was asleep"" .... are you kidding me? : ( I told her I was looking for something serious and that it hurt to be treated like that and she says she's not looking for anything serious... and it all makes sense to me now.... just... wow.... : ( decided to not text her again...

We've been getting to know each other for 6-7 weeks and he confessed his feeling for me that he is in love with me, and that I'm his dream woman. He has always been so caring, understanding, thoughtful, and always be there for me. Since I extremely dislike ghosting, it is very important for me to find someone who is the same. This man is mature, never hides anything, and has no problem with being vulnerable and upfront with his feelings and thoughts. And he never ever ghosts me. His love for me is always passionate and deep. Overall, he is a perfect man for me. He makes me feel like I've never felt so desirable like that in my life.   


The only problem is that I don't love him. It's funny how he seems like the most wonderful man I've ever met, yet, there isn't a single piece of feeling in me for him. He has so much love for me, and I have so little for him. I thought that if I try to force myself to have feelings for him, maybe I'll fall in love with him. But it's all in vain. His love for me keeps growing and my feeling for him still hasn't grow. Is it because of our age gap? My boundary of the maximum age gap is 10 years. Is it because I'm not physically attracted to him enough? I care about physical appearance a lot. Physically, he is not my type. Mentally and emotionally, he has the qualities of a man that I've always been looking for. But somehow, I don't have any deep feelings for him. I just don't understand why I don't love such a perfect man. I desperately want to love him as much as he loves me, but I don't want to lie to my feelings.

82,pxrq7e,1632907431,In my late 20s and still have yet to experience romantic love. I'm scared of making women feel uncomfortable.,"I have never actually asked a woman out on an *actual* date. I have not had sex. I haven't even had my first kiss. As a teenager and into my early 20s, I made attempts at asking girls out at school, but every single time I tried, I wound up back-pedaling by telling them that I know they don't feel the same way about me. Now, in my late 20s, I don't even express attraction towards women I like. I avoid making eye contact with or even looking at women I find attractive unless I'm in conversation with them. If I lock eyes, I quickly look away and avoid getting caught a second time. I never say or do anything flirty. I approach them with the intent to pursue a platonic friendship because it feels disrespectful to express an interest in anything more if I haven't received signals that such overtures would be reciprocated. And the irony is, I tend to assume any such ""signal"" is just her being friendly.

It isn't even so much that I'm afraid of being rejected. Moreso, I'm scared that I'll inadvertently make a woman feel uncomfortable by asking her out in an inappropriate way‚Äîfor instance, in the wrong place at the wrong time, or by misinterpreting her friendliness for attraction. I'm worried that I might even face repercussions for doing so, such as getting kicked out of a venue for making unwanted advances. The safest option is to simply not ask anyone out in the first place.

Are these fears reasonable? Is there anything I should know before asking a woman out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxrq7e/in_my_late_20s_and_still_have_yet_to_experience/

We sent messages back and forth and he would attempt to keep the conversation flowing (asking me how my day was and feeding me with compliments). But because I wasn‚Äôt interested I would leave him on delivered for hours. He took me on a few dates and eventually I started to develop feelings for him.

From then on I would sleep at his house constantly because he has bad sleeping anxiety and he would beg for me to stay cause it helped his sleeping. He took me to the mountains for the weekend and paid for everything. He brought me to a wedding. We went to church together. I met his entire family and all of his friends. He would constantly praise about me to everyone. He posted me everywhere and didn‚Äôt keep it secretive at all. He would always give me reassurance and remind me of how thankful he was to have me in his life. We‚Äôre both fairly religious people and he‚Äôs told me it‚Äôs like god placed me in his life because I‚Äôm the girl he‚Äôs forever prayed for. I could get into detail about everything but at this point I really felt like his girlfriend as we were doing relationship things. 

We never made anything official. We had a conversation in the very beginning of this how we wanted to take things slow. He‚Äôs been applying at places outside of where we live and even outside our province too. So there is a high chance of him moving. He told me he wants me to come with him and have me by his side. 

Everything was great it didn‚Äôt seem like anything was wrong. I noticed that he didn‚Äôt message me all day and it was very unusual and questionable to me ( as he would be constantly messaging me and stay in contact 24/7 ). I eventually reached out and noticed that he was giving me short responses. I asked him if everything was okay, and he told me that he thinks i should grab my stuff from his house and we needed to stop seeing eachother. He told me he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me. I was super shocked about that because everything seemed to go extremely well (I was at his house the night before and there was no change in his attitude whatsoever). 

It‚Äôs super sudden and im just overall confused as to why that happened. I don‚Äôt want to sound stubborn, but I‚Äôm well convinced that he actually does have feelings for me but he‚Äôs scared ( potentially because he‚Äôs moving quite soon or he‚Äôs scared of relationships cause his last one was so bad ). I‚Äôm a strong believer that actions speaks louder than words, and I don‚Äôt think any guy would do all of those things for a girl he doesn‚Äôt like.

As a man I 've heard that it's better not to text after the first date, especially if it was a good one, and let the girl text you. If she doesn't text, you call after 4-5 days say you want to see her again and make a date for next week. This builds anticipation and makes the woman wonder about you which raises her interest level.

But I have heard others say that girls love a text maybe the next day just to say you had a nice evening with her.

I am asking because I was out with a girl and I believed went well in general and saw many indications of high interest, but she didn't text and when I called her after 3 days I got the impression that she was annoyed. I don't know why. I said I would like to see her again and when she is free to meet again, but she said she needs to work on a presentation and she would call me after a week when it's over.

I am M20 and matched a girl (19) on lovoo, we chatted and met a few times since then. After the first date I didn't really know if i wanted to give it go or not, but as I came home she wrote me and asked me if I came home safely. After that we chatted a few days more and I decided to ask her once more out, so we went into the second date and after that on the third date. Until the third date all dates were within 2 weeks. But then she went on holiday and then I did. We didn't see eathother for like one month, nevertheless we kept contact per WhatsApp/Instagram. As I came back I asked her out (for the fourth date) and on this date I kissed her for the first time.  
The day after the fourth date, also after kiss, she was ""normal"" but then she startet to act very strange, as it seems like she didn't want met/chat anymore.

I think to be a very romatic guy and I don't really have experience with girls and her actions just confuse me. As we first met I could cognize than she was shy. It was not really a problem, because I really like to talk and chat. During these two months I notice she did things I didn't like for example:

1) she don't ask if I want to go to a date with her (Or when I asked she didn't have time, she never gave a counter-proposal, but still kept in touch). This happend between the third and fourth date.

2) At the beginnig we sent eachother memes to keep in touch, but I also asked her about her... She always answered, but never asked me things on her one. Only in person (About the GFs i had, etc..).

After a few days she acted strange I asked her what happend and told her that I like to communicate and explained the two points above (I didn't want to end whatever we had without to know what happend). She told me that she was hurt by guys (she once told me briefly the history) and she needs time to trust someone and that she likes me, but I went to fast (kissing her. What was strange for me, because why would she give me a goodbye kiss after that?). I told her I understand that and I was okay with that (i would give her time to ""trust"" me).

Soo, after that I understand she just needs more time, but she still don't want to communicate with me. But I don't understand/know what I should do.... 

I like to think I have the ""rule"" that says when I realize I am the only one who carries alone the (relationship or conversation), I just give it up.

At the one side I could write her and ask her out again and go slow, but then I would break this ""rule"".  
At the other side I like her and want not to give her up....

So I keep repeating the same pattern with the people I date.   
For the past 3 relationsships I've been in the other person have always have had some kind of substance abuse. Even though I do not do drugs myself (weed occasionally nothing crazy) and I do tend to like surround myself in genereal with people who don't do drugs and just in genereal got their shit together.   


For myself I have a pretty structured life. I'm a medicine student and I also work quite a lot so i need to have my shit kinda together.   
But then i always end up in relationsships with men who got serious substance abuse (like mostly snow and ecsy).   


The relationsships then last for maybe like 1-2 years and they break mostly due to me not wanting to deal with their shit anymore.   


Why do i keep repeating this pattern??  


I have not dated for over 1 year now (been some dates but haven't seen anyone more than twice), and then 1 month ago i meet this dude and we have been seeing each other almost everyday since. And yes the dude takes a lot of shit.   


I do try to like be really hard on myself and stay away from those kinda a people but it seems like i end up at the same place every damn time. Like i have no interest in people who have a stable life and everytime i go out with ""normal &amp; healthy"" people im simply just not interested in anything or seeing them again.
