1,s2l2qg,1642032380,How do I talk to girls on Tinder?,"Hello, Im new to this sub and need guidance. Ive not dated many people and my last relationship was horrible. Anything you can think of she had it. She was nuts and it has taken me 3-4 years to recover my happiness from the blackhole she was to me. Depression, anorexia, fear of large groups, fear of leaving the house, always sick, nasty fucking periods and her hygiene was a massive issue(there is more, but I cant remember cause Ive wanted to forget).  She was someone I loved but after living with her I was broken over time. I tried to fix her, but Im now aware you cant fix broken. She needed to fix herself. 

My vision of love was not anything like this. It shattered my brain and I spiraled. Im just glad I am whole again. 

Im my old self again, but I tend to be lost on where to go, what to do and how to talk to girls. I match with people on Tinder, but either they never respond or just un match me. Is this normal for others? 

I try to say hello and have had a few talk back, but the conversation will just die and they never talk back or even say ‚ÄúI was busy‚Äù. 

Its a nightmare and idk how to engage people other than talking about themselves or about truthful things. Im not slick not suave, but I want to be. 

Ive been through hell and need to learn how to get past this hurdle, but idk who to ask or talk to. So I am asking strangers for help.  

Im to a point where I might just start asking random girls if they want coffee just to get a date. Idk what to do. :/

Thank you,
MS

Ps: Im not a bad looking guy eitherüòè

2,s2l3qw,1642032463,Did I give off mixed signals?,"I (25F) have had a crush on a friend (39M) for ages. He was in a relationship for years, but it ended about 6 months ago and he's now single. We don't see each other super often, but have been in contact more often recently. 

I hung out with him last weekend at his apartment and we talked for nearly 6 hours straight about everything and nothing. we both seemed to have a great time. while we were talking, he said ""I'm not hitting on you, but you're attractive"" (it was sort of relevant to the conversation) and mentioned something positive about my looks at least 1 or 2 other times. his body language also seemed to indicate that he's attracted to me, he always sat quite close with his whole body facing towards me, we mirrored each other's body language a lot and he'd often either touch my arm or leg while talking. he also seemed interested in hearing about my love life/sexuality. 

At first I left feeling unsure whether he's interested in me or not but now I'm thinking it likely that he is. the signs were all there i think he didn't want to come on too strong because there's an age difference and because of a couple other factors. he's also just very respectful. 

Unfortunately I think I might have gave some mixed signals just because I've liked him for ages and was a bit nervous.  I've always tried to hide the fact that I like him so it feels a bit weird to change my behaviour. I didn't say I found him attractive back or tried to touch him (besides hugging him bye when I was leaving), and there was a couple times our thighs were touching while we were sitting on the couch and I ended up moving so they weren't (out of nerves). 

The next day I texted him ""By the way, I realized I didn't say this back to you yesterday, but I also think you're attractive. I think I was just too nervous to say it to your face lol. But thank you for telling me, it made me happy"" and he answered ""Aww, thanks! And I'm glad it made you happy. That's what compliments are for!"" I was hoping this would be enough to make my intentions clear, but I showed a friend and she said my text could still be taken in a platonic way and may not have been clear enough.

We texted a bit more about something unrelated, but it's been a few days and he hasn't responded to my last text (I'm trying not to take it personally--he's a very busy guy and not the best texter in the first place, so I think he just forgot). We did make vague plans to hang out again sometime but I don't think I'll see him again for a while because he's gone abroad for work for a few weeks.

Do you think the text I sent him was clear enough/enough to make up for my nervous behaviour while we were hanging out? If not, what do you think I should do? I am pretty afraid of rejection since I like him so much, but it seems like I actually may have a chance and I don't want to blow it.

3,s2l3zz,1642032483,I want to get married and have children with a guy who tried to take advantage of me,"Over a year ago, I went to a bar and met some people my age. One of the guys was very heavily flirting with me. After bringing me a drink of water (which I'm 85% sure he roofied), he put his hand around my waist and my head on his chest. I had to get carried back to my room, and he tried staying in the room with me before another guy told him to lay off.

With all the information I know now, I'm pretty sure that he would've taken advantage of me. And given how confident he was with me, there's no doubt that he hasn't done it to other girls before. I should be disgusted, and I should want to get away from him, but I don't. I still keep in contact with him, and another piece of info you should know is that at the same time that he tried to take advantage of me, a guy that I really liked led me on, when he was in a relationship. My crush cut off all contact with me, and I was really upset, but the guy that tried to take advantage of me actually asked me how I was doing after the rejection.

I know it's sick that I want to be with a guy who tried to rape me, and has probably done it to many other girls, but if anything, I'm happy for what he did. I've never had a guy be so overt about his attraction towards me, and he even said to a friend of ours that I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever seen"". If he had taken advantage of me that night, I wouldn't have been upset with him. I was also ovulating that day, so I likely would've gotten pregnant. I've always wanted to be a mother, so I'd be grateful for him giving me a child. There's no other guys that like me the way he does.

Frequently, I fantasize about our life together. He lives on the other side of the country, but I'd move over there and marry him in a heartbeat. I want to wake up next to him every morning, and I want a lot of children from him. In fact, the other day, I was making an Excel spreadsheet with how many children we'd have (at least 7), our children's names, personality, and physical appearances. I know I should be running away in fear, or just have it as a fantasy, but I want a life with him. I know that realistically, I'd likely end up dead, and only have a couple of kids. Even if he hurts me, he thinks I'm beautiful, and I'm eternally grateful for that. Do I just have a kink?

6,s2l5j7,1642032608,Struggling to communicate a desire to spend more time with a guy (26M) I (25F) am seeing,"So I met this guy on Bumble maybe 5 weeks ago now. We've gone on two dates - the first one we planned on bumble, and then the second one about two weeks later. I kind of had to twist his arm to get the last one planned - after our first date I texted him saying I had a good time and would love to see him again and he said he felt the same, so I'm assuming he's interested too but whenever I tried to set something up he was always busy and never suggested an alternative day/time so it's back to being up to me to try and plan something later on. 

So we're at about 1 date ever 2-3 weeks, and honestly even though it's difficult to plan things with him I do really like him and enjoy the time we do spend together, and want to see him more and get to know him better and all. But since we're still just in the casual dating not defined relationship territory I don't know how to really address this. I want to be respectful of the fact that he has a busy life and that he doesn't owe me his time, but I at least want to make sure I'm clearly communicating that I would really like to see him a bit more frequently than we do now. If he can't do that he can't do that but I at least want to make sure I communicate how I'm feeling clearly, but not in a way that will scare him off if that makes sense. Does anyone have suggestions for ways to phrase that? I can come off as somewhat intense so I'm a bit hesitant to use anything I word myself for fear of drifting into that scare-him-off territory",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2l5j7/struggling_to_communicate_a_desire_to_spend_more/

11,s2lkjb,1642033830,is it time to break up with him? (22F and 26M),"Hi, I've been dating this guy for 2 yrs.

I've always doubted this relationship, from the beginning. I met him on Tinder, we went to the same university, he was in engineering and I'm in science. I didn't ever really think that he is dating me because it's me, you know what I mean? I feel like it could have been any other person. 

What I like about him:

1. he's very calm unlike me
2. he's smart
3. his family is very nice to me
4. he's somewhat funny

What I don't like about him:

1. he's not a romanticist. he forgot about our anniversaries and even my bday one year
2. blunt and lacks compassion sometimes
3. he's done suspicious activities before (he's been on Tinder while we were dating, and for the first 4 months, he was still talking to his ex, calling and video calling which I got to know recently)
4. he doesn't contact me very often and I've fought with him many times about this

He did get better in texting and calling, he tries to talk to me more during the day, and he has gotten sweeter since the beginning of the relationship. So I'd say he has been trying but I think the fundamental problem is that he doesn't love me. I'm just always wondering why he's dating me? When I ask him, he'd say that he loves me. He doesn't talk about our future either. I'm only 22. I'm not saying that we have to be picturing and planning our future together for the next 10 yrs. But don't you just think about it sometimes? Just one time he asked ""are we ever gonna get married and have babies?"" Oh another thing is, we have been meeting up 3 times a week consistently for the last 2 yrs. Which makes me confused again. If he didn't love me, it'd be like wasting so much of his time... Or is it just that dating me is better than nothing?

Despite what he's done to me, I very much love him. Obviously the only reason why I'm still with him is because I just love him so much. But I've been doubtful for the last 2 yrs.

That is a good sign at least, but it's ambiguous‚Äîwe had a weird conversation in the middle of said date. I am willing to be patient for the next couple of dates or so to feel it out. I like her so far, I'm just confused.

For now I am in quarantine due to covid exposure. We had a date planned for tomorrow, but I postponed it. Is minimal contact best in a situation like this? I feel mixed about giving her space. Neither of us likes to text much. We get along very well in person, but don't talk much outside of dates at this stage because she wants to move slow. We are only talking to each other, we have had that conversation.

I guess the question is if me calling her might be seen as unattractive based on the info I gave. I want to talk more with her but am worried that is pushing her to move faster than she feels cool with. Any questions or comments. are alright by my. I feel like I'm playing games and like my head is in the wrong place. I'm probably overthinking it.

We have got on great, spent a lot of time together and are always in constant communication. As soon as I met him I instantly felt safe with him and knew I could trust him.

 A few weeks ago I noticed little things like he wasn‚Äôt contacting me as much even though we still spoke everyday. I did get insecure and wondered if he did just want me for sex, as I noticed a change in behaviour since then. We spoke about it and he opened up to me on how he has been on anti depressants for the past six months and was slowly coming off them but was having down days too.

I supported him and have been really relaxed and patient with him since knowing he has been struggling. I went to see him last weekend and he was anxious which I noticed straight away as he was extremely restless and fidgeting. The weekend was great though and we had a great time together.

Since that weekend again I noticed he had gone quiet on me but was online on his phone but chose not to read my messages, he knows I‚Äôve had this before with guys and it can make me feel insecure. I told him that maybe we need a bit of space as he is now affecting my mental health and making me anxious. 

He replied with ‚ÄòI know with how I am at the moment I‚Äôm not giving you the attention you need which isn‚Äôt fair maybe a little bit of space would do me some good to work through my issues, I am seeing a counsellor next week and I am determined to get back to myself ASAP and I hope we can pick up where we left off and I can treat you how you deserve to be treated‚Äô

To give more context, I've been single my entire life due to social anxiety/speech issues. I matched with a girl online awhile back &amp; got her number. About a week ago we had set up our first date for tomorrow at noon at a cafe.

I'm desperate as hell. I am emotionally/sexually starved from a lifetime of loneliness. 
(Of course I know not to act desperate).
I'm not nervous because she's a girl, I'm nervous because I don't want to screw this up for anything.

She seems SUPER into me....as if she wants a relationship/boyfriend pretty badly.
While communicating she has been nothing but overly flirty/enthusiastic. Like she isn't even remotely subtle about her interest in me. 
I'm fairly attractive and very muscular, women are naturally drawn to me but my lack of life experience has made me pretty lame and shy.

The real question I'm asking is....what on earth am I going to talk about? I have a few generalized questions to ask her like ""what's your family like?"" And ""what are your future dreams/goals?"" 
But I don't know how to just spontaneously create new topics to discuss. I don't know how to keep things rolling. 
I know I should listen to her and try to expand on things she says, like engaging in conversation on basically any topic she brings up....but awkward silence is a killer.

I don't want to ask her super boring dry questions either. I don't want to ask questions which are not open-ended. If she can simply respond with yes/no, it'll kill the convo.

Also nervous cuz we hadn't spoken on the phone, so she doesn't know I have a mild speech problem (trouble with R's). It's only a matter of time before she notices it, I hope she doesn't get put off by it.

I spent 7 days using every single dating app to find her, it feels unlikely that I'll find anyone else if things go sour.

I wasn't sure if the date would lead to sex, I was planning on letting myself go with the flow of the evening and decide based on how I feel about it in the moment. Now it is certainly not happening. He seems like a genuine guy who's not only interested in that, but I still feel like maybe I should give a heads up lol

35,s2otr7,1642043244,I'm [20M] a virgin and would like help.,"I'm in college and feel severe jealousy/angst/pain because of being a virgin. I don't hate others, just myself. I'm already trying to improve myself in a variety of ways but ultimately I feel terrible inside. I have a lot of issues: I feel ugly, I have ADHD (medicated), I'm not confident, I'm depressed, I'm horny, I'm bad at talking to girls, I have no female friends, I have poor/awkward body language. Being a virgin and never having had a girlfriend before makes me feel hopeless and sad and ashamed and worthless. I've longed for sex/a girlfriend for years with no success, I feel like worthless dogshit compared to everyone else.

The worst issue is that I feel like I'm permanently damaged and permanently a loser who can never make up for what I've missed out on. I feel too old and like I've missed out on critical years of experience. I feel like I can improve my life but it'll be disappointing by the time I'm done, because I would have already missed out on young love and doomed to be not be genuinely desired sexually. I feel like even after I improve, the specter of having been a virgin loser for so long will still haunt me, and that the sex/relationships won't be as pleasurable or fulfilling as they would be while young. I feel depressed that I most likely won't experience losing my virginity to another virgin, and that most of the girls my age aren't virgins. I feel jealous of the superior guys my age who took their virginities.

I want to get to work fixing my mindset and life but it's difficult. I especially can't kick the feelings of inferiority and having permanently missed out. I was feeling very depressed/suicidal in the past few weeks, but now I'm looking forward to putting some effort in to achieve some sexual/romantic success.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2otr7/im_20m_a_virgin_and_would_like_help/

But this thought just occurred to me but I think I have figured out what kind of woman I would like to be with, since the biggest hurdle in me getting a gf so far is I wasn't much sure of what I wanted in the first place.

So this random epiphany came to me, I want a girl who can appreciate all my worst aspects and I could do the same with her.

Like everyone has good aspects as well as bad. I am a good orator, good at math, witty, confident, savvy, strong, fiercely loyal towards those close etc and most people love these parts of me. But I have other aspects too, I am greedy, overly ambitious, boastful, a tad bit cruel, though rarely angry if pushed can have a nasty rage, extremely cold and calculating.

Though I keep these parts of me in check not showing them to anyone(except boastfulness), but you get the idea. But well these are parts of me not a lot of people would like a whole lot, but if I can find a girl who likes these parts of me, that would be the perfect girl for me.

I asked him why lucky and he said because he entered the room. I suggested he not start a conversation by saying a woman is lucky to match with him. 

Told him it comes across as arrogant and that I have several other matches. Mentioned he can unmatch, but suggested to change his opening line. 

He accepted that feedback, but people in general are in for a rude awakening if they lead with arrogance..whether it‚Äôs looks, body, a job title, or money, the reality is you‚Äôre not special to some of us or most. 

He doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm talking to a CFO and have dated CEOs. He doesn‚Äôt know that his arrogance was laughable. No one is lucky to match with someone. Have a normal fucking opener/conversation. 

Many people aren‚Äôt desperate, ugly, or poor. Being arrogant towards someone you find attractive, wanna date, or fuck is very ugly.

I waited a few days and sent a message to her friend on Instagram and I explained to her that I felt more of a connection with her, and I asked her out to coffee. She told me that she and her ex-boyfriend were actually trying to work things out. No problem. Best of luck.

This ending was very vanilla.

I ask where they're meeting people and the answer is always the same...online dating.

I'm sorry but 90% of communication is non-verbal, right? I'm convinced online dating apps are just money-making schemes that convince people they can find someone sitting on their ass in their own home when in reality meeting someone requires *actual* effort, aka going out alone to activities you enjoy &amp; talking to random people, male or female.

A wide social circle is the best way to meet people. And I say that as an introvert who doesn't naturally enjoy that process. I met my boyfriend at an art museum after years of going there alone hoping to meet a fellow person into art.

Online dating promises you'll meet someone easily; real life teaches you everything takes long-term effort.

And yes, some people find their partners on OLD, but most people on OLD aren't super invested in it or want validation, so you're wasting your time yet so lazy or deluded you don't put the real work into meeting people irl, and then whine you've been on OLD for years yet had zero success.

Because of this, he can only allot Saturday evening quality time with me (32F) and he will leave on Sunday morning. However, I am a morning person because of work so my bedtime is between 9:30-10:30 pm. I told him it‚Äôs not a good time for me because, on his allotted time, I will probably be asleep most of the time and by the time we get up, he will already leave. To me, it sounds like he only wants to come over, have sex, sleep and leave in the morning. He denies this. 

I am a health care worker and I get every other weekend off so I told him that maybe on my weekend off he can choose even just one day to spend time with me and work on the other day plus the weekend that I am working, he can do his research project. He didn‚Äôt like this idea because he needs both Saturday and Sunday to work on his project. And since I expressed that I didn‚Äôt like the Saturday evening to Sunday morning idea, he asked me if I am okay if we switch the time to Sunday 1-5 pm to spend quality time then he will leave to continue on this project. 

The thing is, I don‚Äôt like this time block idea because it makes me feel like I am begging for him to include me in his time so I told him to choose what is important to him. He said I am important too but he just doesn‚Äôt know where to squeeze me in his time since he is doing a very important project. 

We decided to think about it and will make a final decision on Monday. I like this guy and I support him in his future plans but I don‚Äôt want that this will lead me to resent him because of how little he thinks about me.

One night we went to dinner, he paid, we stayed for 4 hrs talking and laughing and could‚Äôve kept going except the place closed. At the end of the night I got very nervous and ended up bro hugging him (yes I know that was very dumb, but it just happened lol.)

About a week later I asked him if that was a friendly thing or a date and he said it was just friends. It sucked, but I tried to believe him and tried to create some space between us so I could move on.

We continue to talk at work and, through conversation we kept getting closer. 
We went from talking about surface level stuff to him sharing very deep, personal things about his childhood and things he‚Äôs gone through- even down to sexual abuse he‚Äôs experienced. 
Because we drive around for our job quite a bit, we drive together and have the best conversations. Sometimes we just sit in silence and it feels so comfortable that it‚Äôs almost scary.

63,s2qwtx,1642049484,Should I (21F) block my highschool friend (21M)?,"I (21F) received a message from my close friend(21M) around 6-7 am in the morning. It was about his feelings for me, which I already know it was about based on the way he typed his first message of saying he is telling me something important. I didn't told him this throughout our years of friendship but I already am aware of his feelings for me. He wasn't super good at masking his advances if he was trying to, and I mostly ignore it(acting oblivious at times). We have a good friendly relationship that we're even gaming buddies at times but I just want to keep it at that cause I can even go far as see him as an older brother.

 2020 I decided to enter the dating scene and by 2021, I'm now in my first romantic relationship (current boyfriend). Around 12 pm almost 1 pm, I told my boyfriend (23M) about his confession. I did it because I don't want to hide anything from him and I don't want the risk of him seeing the message months later or hearing it from someone instead of from me. He got angry (understandably) cause I already told all my close friends and family that I'm in a relationship and despite knowing this he still confessed. He wants me to block this friend despite me assuring him that I won't cheat cause I value loyalty above most values(I barely even cheat on quizzes and definitely not on exams). In fact both of them are aware of this. The reason I'm hesitant on blocking my friend, despite my love for my boyfriend, is because we've been friends for 9-10 years and I know he is just confuse and want to clear his mind and sort his feelings.

In summary, my(21F) close friend of 9-10 years(21M) who I only see as my bro confessed to me and my boyfriend (23M) wants me to block him cause he thinks it's rude that he confessed to someone already in a relationship and I need advice if I should block him or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2qwtx/should_i_21f_block_my_highschool_friend_21m/

I didn‚Äôt get to have a college experience like theirs at 18 because before I could escape to the US I was born and lived in an oppressive islamic country ruled by shariaa law where unmarried relationships are illegal and punishable both legally and socially and I did not want to marry someone I did not know and risk ending up a 4th wife (since that is allowed in my country even without the permission of the wives).

Before our relationship, I never thought anything of him until he confessed to me and eventually asked me out.

96,s2v8ux,1642065049,I (37m) am worried that I'm not good enough for the girl I'm dating (33F) after reading the Female Dating Strategies. What can I do?,"TL;DR: I'm worried that I'm not good enough for the girl I'm dating after reading posts on the sub about what constitutes a low-value man. We have been dating for about a month.

I am well-educated and am able to support myself, but I don't have the means to support her. I am a low-value man according to the sub, and now I'm worried that she deserves better.

Unfortunately, I chose a career as a mental health therapist working with low-income individuals with severe mental illness, and it doesn't pay much.

I stumbled across the Female Dating Strategies sub-reddit, and unfortunately, I'd be classified as a low-value male due to my inability to provide for her and the fact that she makes significantly more than I do. We are also equitable with expenditures, and I have never truly pampered her or taken care of her financially. We are about even on who pays for food, etc., and I haven't planned any extravagant dates for her.

I feel that I must be a low-value male also because while I cook for her and say/do nice things for her, I am not truly courting her, and we were intimate early on. A low-value man does this. A high-value man waits for intimacy.

I'm not sure what I can do because I can't just magically make more money, and I can't really take risks (stock market, etc.) because I need the money I have for myself and my daughter (I'm also divorced with a kid which makes me more of a low-value man).

97,s2vam9,1642065240,"There are no perfect relationships, but there are healthy ones.","* CODEPENDENCY vs AUTHENTIC INTIMACY *

Codependency: I need you to feel OK or else I'm not ok. 

- Authentic Intimacy: I allow you to experience whatever you are experiencing, without needing to change or fix it. You are your own person.

Codependency: I need you to support me and I will guilt you in subtle and not so subtle ways if you don't.

- Authentic Intimacy: I ask for support when I need it from others, not just my partner, and I don't lash out if it's not available in the way I need it.

Codependency: I will blame and shame you for not doing what I want you to do.

- Authentic Intimacy: I accept you as you are while having clear standards around how I will be treated and spoken to.

Codependency: You should know what I need. It's not the same if I have to explain it to you.

- Authentic Intimacy: I communicate openly, and I will never blame you for my lack of courage to share what I want and need.

Codependency: True love is about being loyal no matter what.

- Authentic Intimacy: I have standards and boundaries about how I will be spoken to and treated, and I will clearly express those to you with love.

Codependency: You have a lot of issues, and I'm going to help you. That's where I get my value and worth and sense of being needed. 

- Authentic Intimacy: I'm already valuable and worthy. I'm not here to be my partner's therapist, fixer or caretaker.

Codependency: I need you, and you need me.

- Authentic Intimacy: I choose to be with you every day, and you choose to be with me.

Codependency: I can't be without you.

- Authentic Intimacy: I love my alone time. And I love being with you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2vam9/there_are_no_perfect_relationships_but_there_are/
98,s2vch9,1642065438,"Why do men compliment my outfits so much when I am out, if they do not care about women's fashion? Is it a form of flirting or usually not?","I am a very feminine woman and I wear vintage clothing I collect (always dresses and skirt-suits). Often, I get men approach me in the street to compliment me on my outfit, and they say 'I like your style'. This has led to them asking my name/number and so forth on various occasions.

I am not asking for a significantly deep meaning (because there is none), but rather, is it normally a form of flirting? I often hear men say they don't care about what women wear or women's fashion, so when this started happening to me a few years ago I was surprised.

99,s2ve14,1642065608,How is it possible for a FWB situation into a romantic relationship?,"Yes, I'm aware that sometimes FWB married each other. We don't know their whole stories. I still can't see how FWB can become a couple. Yes, I know one or both FWB always caught feelings in end, so they usually had to end all the sexual ties.

I mean I can see sometimes people married their one night stands because there is still a lot of ""getting to know you"" with an one-nighter while with FWB, this is more of an ""I know you, I've slept with you, and I guess now I have to awkwardly fill this in with romance"" type of situation. You've already skipped ahead a few levels, so how will it work if you're getting into a romantic relationship with your FWB? Please explain. Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2ve14/how_is_it_possible_for_a_fwb_situation_into_a/
