She is obviously completely lost and overwhelmed right now.  She isn't comfortable having me around her family so seeing in her person doesn't seem to be an option. She seems to have a really strong support system of family and friends so I don't think she needs me for emotional support. 

I'm wondering how I fit into this now. I feel like I am potentially an obstacle to her recovery and should give her some space and let her heal with her family. It's the last thing I want to do because she an amazing woman and talking to her makes me really happy but if that is not in her best interests then it's just selfish of me.

I hope I'm not breaking rules.

So at the start of the week I got some news that I would have a week off at work and didn't have anything to do that week coming, so I decided to post an ad on some craigslist type of site but for finding sexual partners. I posted an ad in men looking for couples, so far so good the same night I get a single email from lets call her Lonely\_Lover and her husband Cuck. the first few email she tells me that her Cuck never ever fucks her anymore and that she's looking for a Horny\_Guy (me) to hit it off with her while Cuck would be watching a part of it (preliminary) and talk about life. Lonely\_Lover wants it to be a regular thing (like a few times a week maybe more, stay the weekends, maybe even 3some with a friend of hers (F35)) without necessarily let her Cuck know.

We have sent about 150 emails back and forth in a few days and pretty much have a perfect chemistry already, but idk I feel like there is something missing, might just be the fact we haven't been on a coffee date and have her Cuck be the thirdwheel lol.

Lonely\_Lover also doesn't know I don't have loads of experience sexually, should I tell her or keep it between me and me?

Does any Women or men in a similar situation have any advice for me? like should I threat her like she's my age and kinda my lover, like get her flowers and all ? (her cuck would be mad but we don't care)

any advice would be 100% appreciated

What’s bad is he hurt my daughter because she called him “dad” and he encouraged it.  He’s the only “dad” she’s ever known, her dad lost visitation when she was 3. 
Anyways, I haven’t heard from him at all, I just see he reads over and over emails I sent him prior to realizing he relationship ghosted me.  I mean he reads them everyday…then this week he started sending me blank emails.  They aren’t spam I checked the email address in the header and it’s correct and nothing looks off or suspicious.  After a few times I responded because I thought it was an error just telling him this was happening as an FYI (stupid me).  They’ve continued to arrive and just seeing them is bothersome to me.  Why: I feel like it’s either a mind game and he never cared about me at all so everything he said and did was total bs and why anyone would do that to a mom and little girl (she was 3 when we started dating) and involve his own two kids is so sick. Or 2. He doesn’t know what to say and it’s a way of letting me know he’s there 
Today I finally sent him an email saying to stop sending them unless he was trying for positive communication leading to something healthy and good and if it was for an ego boost or to play with a toy, he needed a little girl, not a woman…I also said words don’t mean anything and I look at actions….if he was testing the waters with me they were warm and friendly as always  I’ve know him 20 years and he’s my best friend and I’m always here and while dating I never had a grass is always greener on someone else’s lawn  I was incredibly happy and felt lucky to be with him  I’m not responsible for his need for a self esteem boost 
In closing I said whoever he left me for to pursue or chase that she was providing the satisfaction and fulfillment and happiness he was seeking and I meant that because everyone deserves to be loved. 
He read that email 30 times today 
My question is why would he do this all week ? I was just finally feeling good, I won’t take him back unless he does the right thing which won’t happen….

I (42f) have been on a few dates with someone (53m) with a fair amount of time (two weeks on average) between each one. We’re both single parents, and hIs job requires frequent (like every other week) travel. It’s a balance that’s so far so good working for us. We have a great time when we’re together. The time flies. 

It’s the time in between our dates that feels awkward to me. Usually we don’t see each other for two weeks. Initially (prior to the first time we met), we were communicating on the dating app. Then we switched to texting trying to figure out when to see each other again. After our last date, he texted me before I even got home, and we exchanged a few more messages that night and the next day. He called me that weekend, and we talked late into the night. 

Since then, he’s traveled for work and the communication has been lagging. I get that he’s busy with his work travel. But I’m nonetheless disappointed that I didn’t hear from him for five days. I should mention that he is recently divorced, and I suspect I am the first woman he has dated. 

He tried to call me a few nights ago wanting to plan our next date. Due to the difference in time zones, it was very late for me and I missed his call. I sent him a text the following morning that I’d love to talk later in the day to figure out a date. He replied that he was traveling and would “try to connect” with me the following day. I told him that waiting to talk to him meant I could miss out on finding a sitter but if we could tentatively just name an evening, I could get a head start on my childcare. We ended up picking an evening at the end of next week. The following day (yesterday) was the day he’d said he would call. He didn’t. Now I’m feeling slightly annoyed. I haven’t talked to him in a week aside from the few texts about trying to get a date on the calendar and needing to find a sitter. 

In my past experience, too much texting is bad. I can’t get a sense of how interested a man is if I keep texting him asking him about his day or whatever. So I’ve tried not to repeat my past mistakes and have only texted in response to his messages to me. Also I feel like it’s been ingrained in my head that women shouldn’t pursue men (I know that could be an unpopular thing to say).

Today I finally caved and sent him a text asking him how his weekend was going. I know I want to hear from him and I thought (hoped?) he also wanted to hear from me. Communication feels important when you’re only seeing someone once every two weeks. Since I sent the text, there has been radio silence from him. I can see he’s been on the app/site where we met. I guess my question is a rhetorical one. This is a red flag, isn’t it?

I thank everyone for taking the time to comment, even the ones I didn’t love reading. I needed to hear it all.  

He told the ex wife a day or two after I posted this, and she outwardly did not seem to care, which is what I think the appropriate reaction should have been. I didn’t ask the details of the conversation but he said her only concern was is he dating someone she knows (the answer is no). That’s it. He is currently in his home state visiting for a few days, his family and friends anyway. He may run into her in those circles and this does not bother me at all. I don’t believe he wants to reconcile with her but if he did, I would wish him well. I would be sad but I would absolutely be happy for them both. 

We spent a happy and quiet little Thanksgiving together. I hope the same for Christmas. 

I had and have zero interest in forcing  people to meet who are not ready.  Seven months is enough for some and not for others, and as I said the truth came out which is that it wasn’t family related at all but that he was nervous to tell his ex. What his reasons were I don’t fully understand, but I do love that he is sensitive and cares. I don’t love that he lied to me and I was clear that is a boundary that crossing won’t be tolerated again. Some of you intuited that he was used to dealing with a high conflict partner, which I am not, and I think that was a contributing factor to not wanting to tell her and in being dishonest with me. 

A lot of you were so up in arms about him being legally married when we started dating. I came to the internet to ask so I have to take all the commentary I asked for but I still don’t feel bad about it. A marriage is a legal contract at its core. The emotion and commitment had fled long before we were together and physical and legal separation combined with really having deep conversations and knowing my partner were enough for me. There is no one size fits all answer, but I was having the best time dating around and sure wasn’t so desperate to settle with a man that I would accept a married one. I fell in love with a great guy who still had paperwork to do.

I used to be and my ex husband subtly drilled my confidence and light down to nearly the pit of hell before he left me.

TLDR I am consciously working on my thinking and approach. Fake it til you make it right? So what are some things you see women do that make you wonder or notice she is dealing with self image problems? 

I’m healthy, I’m average. Technically I’m 3” taller than the “average” American woman (67” vs 64”) and 20lbs less than the “average” woman (155# vs 176#) but am the average size 10, more soft than toned, average looks, etc. etc. I’m fine with all of this and don’t even consider it really in any other area of my life but now thinking of dating, of someone kissing me at the end of a date and feeling my love handles or notices the spider veins I have (not horrible ones) or stretch marks. One reason for this (of many) was when my ex and I first started dating, I mentioned I was struggling with my body and he said “it was no big deal but when I was holding you I did notice the little squish (roll) on your side”…. I was 135# at the time and no kids. 

I’ve had a few abdominal surgeries and have scars there and on my breasts (didn’t get implants, was another procedure.) Do I warn a guy before he sees? I’m not Frankenstein there but it’s obvious I’ve had some surgeries. I also have diastases recti which is where the ab muscles are separated from pregnancy and leave that pooch/skin above the pubic bone and am having to get that repaired along with a breast reduction (three pregnancies was not kind to my body and yes I exercise and eat healthy).

We get along, but just aren't good together as spouses. I've recently joined a couple of the popular dating apps and just want some advice on what's normal and what's not. 

I've matched with quite a few women, probably because I'm 45 and have a full head of hair, no shirtless selfies, and think I'm still pretty handsome, but not cocky about it. Most of these conversations have ended with the other person just ghosting or never responding even though they initiated the conversation with a Like or invitation to start the chat. Is this normal? Some of them I've found attractive and would like to continue a conversation, but don't want to seem lonely or desperate by continuing to try and contact them. 

2nd question is about meeting/exchanging information. I've been chatting back and forth with a lady that I'm very interested in and finally have a date set for Monday night. She's been hard to pin down, sometimes goes a day or two without replying to a message, but has responded quickly and with good conversation over the past week or so. It's been 3 weeks since our first contact and we still have not exchanged numbers and our conversation is still only on the app. Do people usually exchange numbers and text or move off the app in a certain time frame? She's said that she thinks it's weird that guys will want to exchange numbers or Social Media(Snapchat) so quickly. Am I wrong to think that 3 weeks isn't quickly?

I ruminate too much about what was my fault about our demise and what I could have done better in the relationship(s). 

I recognize that the relationship I’m looking for should feel more effortless, and that probably fought with my exes because there were too many fundamental mismatches. I am trying to tell myself that finding the right person is a journey, and just because the first, second, or tenth stop doesn’t work out doesn’t mean any or all of the players were toxic or bad people. 

But I am that person who married the first guy who didn’t leave me. Divorcing him felt nearly impossible, and since then have accumulated two other exes who I loved very much. Being out there dating and starting/ending relationships for a period of several years now, I worry that my overall sense of loss is compounding.

So, I’m looking for tips and encouragement for moving on in my heart as well as my head. I’ve got a very full life with work, kids, friends, and hobbies. I really don’t NEED a man. But I sure do miss my ex boyfriends, and I wish I could just stop thinking about them so much.

I am just reading and getting myself educated after yrs that I was in a marriage and starting to feel there are too many rules out there. I want to be myself, a good human, be kind , be responsive, treat others like the way I want to be treated, not be superficial, not be judgmental, be a good listener, empathize, not be afraid of rejection and consider it part of growing up, have a good sense of humor.

I was quickly smitten with her. She added to my born-again happiness.  

One night we were talking, and she mentioned a previous fling. She described in great detail about how she arranged this sexy encounter and how it all played out. I listened and took some mental notes for later reference. When she finished her story, she said, ""I don't know why I just told you that.""

I responded, ""No worries. I don't want there to be any secrets between us."" I appreciated her openness. What happened in her past is past.

A couple of months into the relationship, I asked her for a relationship health check - how are we doing, anything on your mind, etc. She said, ""You make me feel so safe. No one has ever treated me this good. I can't get enough of you."" She suggested that we become exclusive. I agreed as I felt we were headed somewhere together.

Fast forward a couple of months. I've traveled across country to handle some family drama. It weighed on me and put me in a not-so-good space. It was also the night before my birthday. I'm big on birthdays, and this is the first one that we shared. She worked a 12-hour, second shift and went in at 1100. She usually called me on her break, and I had not heard from her all day. The phone rang at 2100. It was her. I was excited to hear from her, plus I needed to vent about this family drama.

I answered, ""Hey, Babe.""

She replied, ""Hey.""

I asked, ""How's your night?"" It must have busy because her break came very late.

She said, ""OMG, there's this guy that's beein hitting on me all... night... long..."" Right out of the gate. She drew out the all night long part.

I joked, ""Did he do a good job?"" Come on?! I can't be the only guy in the world who thinks she's hot.

She proceeded to go and on about this guy and how, ""He said this, and he said that, and he did this, and he did that, like all night long."" She went on for a couple of minutes talking about him. It was too far and too much...

I asked, ""Did you tell him you weren't interested?""

""No.""

""Did you tell him you had a boyfriend?""

""No.""

""When I hit on woman who is not interested, she'll make it known. She might casually mention a 'we', or sometimes she'll just get right to the point. Either way, I'll back off.""

She responded, ""I don't know what world you're living in.""

She had to go back to work, and we ended the call. So I thought to myself, if this guy approached her repeatedly, why didn't she shut him down? Why is this nobody even worth a mention? Why did she hide our relationship, lying by omission? Does she not have any boundaries? Who else does she hide our relationship from? Am I a secret?

Well, ladies? What's the point here?

Guys? What are your thoughts?

For a variety of reasons, the divorce is only just now about to be finalized. During that time I've made the mistake of getting emotionally attached to a friend that is not available. Our friendship started to really blossom in the early stages of the pandemic, as we both were looking to make sure our respective mental health situations didn't deteriorate. This friend has also been struggling with their marriage, and it became a subject that was really cathartic to talk through with them. Together we've discussed a lot of what makes relationships work, what our needs and preferences are, and generally just came to understand that we have so much in common in a wide variety of ways. We spend a fair amount of time together meeting up for coffee, lunch, a hike, bike rides, drinks, etc. We communicate with each other more than anyone other than the people we live with. Our spouses know this, and since my marriage is over anyway, it never really dawned on me until recently that we might be having an emotional affair. We've bought each other small gifts, are always texting when something reminds us of the other person, and generally share some of the most vulnerable parts of ourselves with each other. I realized the other day that I've made the mistake of letting myself fall in love with this person. I don't fault them at all, but I do think we've both crossed the line a few times in the ways we talk about how important we are to each other. I want to maintain the friendship that has become so important to me, but also I'm heartbroken at the realization that this person is not available. Of course I'm not going to share these feelings with them, I think I just needed to get this out there to anyone that would be willing to read it. I also know that the best course of action is to just try and let it go, but how? If anyone that has been in a similar situation has any advice to share, I'm certainly willing to listen - but I'm also very happy to just hear a bunch of validating statements letting me know that everything will be fine one way or another. :)",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,63396,public,self,,,How to move on from someone that is unavailable?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/reymvo/how_to_move_on_from_someone_that_is_unavailable/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,

We both are free souls, have life plans and are not looking for anything serious/ committed relationships, but I'm experiencing a sort of sadness after leaving him for some reason and I don't know what to do about or deal with my emotions. I never did this before, connecting physically and personally this much with someone in a very short period of time then leaving. It hurts a little.


I'd like to stay in touch with him and meet again but I felt he was a bit distant/ detached emotionally thorough the weekend. Maybe to protect himself? I don't know. Maybe it's healthy. I'm just getting a bit crazy about the fact that  he's distant. Maybe it was just a sort of ONS and I don't need to think too much a about it but it hurts a little.


Some background: I only had one previous sexual partner in a committed long term relationship before. So basically he's the second guy I ever had sex with. I haven't been physically intimate with anyone since my former relationship ended 2years ago. I have no tangible experience in dating/ONS etc and how to deal with emotions move forward or not afterwards? I'm also a recovering codependent and a highly sensitive person.



My questions is how how to deal with my emotions and the sadnesses I'm experiencing ? And how to move forward in a healthy way with this guy without us commiting to a relationship or anything?

One thing that strikes me is that whomsoever I chat or talk to or even meet in real life, all stay with their parents. Somehow that scares me a bit as I stay all alone with my two daughters and I am very reluctant to even initiate any conversation which may take things beyond casual lunches, because soon I may have to start dealing with her family. For example if tomorrow we do decide to spend a night together I am sure she would have to take permission from her family and maybe want me to meet hers and I am just not ready to do that.

So its a question for you folks in general who have dated or are dating; if it is worthwhile pursuing a meaningful relationship with someone who still stays with their parents. Also, is staying with parents only Indian thing or is it that pandemic has made many of us move in with their parents globally.

I’m so conflicted because I don’t want to get married anytime soon, alimony or not, but sometimes I think it would be nice to have a partner again. I’m not interested in simply dating around. It’s exhausting and I still have a teen at home. Not my cup of tea.

I dated some after my divorce but in hindsight it was too soon. Now it’s been almost 2 years since the divorce was final and I’m toying with the idea again. (Wow… I had to double check my math there. Time flies.)

Knowing marriage isn’t in my foreseeable future, am I being selfish if I date with the intent of commitment? I’ve had men over 40 (and younger) tell me they aren’t going to wait around on a woman forever when marriage is what they want to gravitate towards. Makes sense and doesn’t… because how long is too long? Isn’t that individualized?

How would you address this on a dating profile so as to not waste anyone’s time, but also let them know you aren’t into casual dating or looking for marriage?

I've still new to OLD (43M) and had only two dates from being on the app, and they were both with women who responded fairly promptly (ie, we chatted at least once or twice every 24 hours, usually back-forth conversations in evenings). All good! Things went from chatting to me asking them out quite smoothly.

But more numerous are women who say something once every 24 hours, and do this for several days. What I want to know is whether this signifies plain old disinterest? Do women have a long queue of men they are working their way through, and I should be patient? Or is it just a common communication style on the part of both genders in this age of OLD? 

I end of asking these women out more out of impatience than anything else. Sometimes I cheerfully give them my number and say hit me up if you're interested, though by this point I'm annoyed to the point that I don't really want to see them anymore. 

I get the line of thinking that says no harm in conforming to whatever communication style the woman offers up. A male friend of mine once waited three weeks before a woman followed up and they made a date. He just accepts all styles, and this has nothing to do with being desperate- it's a style thing. But this style doesn't really sit well with me. This is such a departure from normal human interaction and it has a psychic toll I don't like. 

I'm leaning towards simply unmatching with the minimal communicators, because hey- whatever their reason it, they probably just aren't what I'm looking for anyway, right? Nothing personal. 

But I want to make sure I'm not eliminating women that would be a good match for me in real life simply because I don't understand some non-intuitive dynamic of online dating communication, particularly as experienced by women. I am totally willing to adjust my expectations if need be. Interested in hearing all perspectives on this.

Meanwhile, over the previous two years, I have given him so much to make his a better life - not only with material things, but also praise, encouragement, my time at early hours to drive him to work, to run errands, a couple local weekend trips, my love and my attention. But when I asked for commitment, it was too much for him.

I hadn't been in a relationship for nearly 9 years at the time we met. I wasn't seeking a boy friend. I had chosen not to date. He entered my life after hooking up with me, via one of the gay apps. I asked me to go out with him and I agreed. Then after the occasional dinner date here and there, we morphed into his spending several nights a week at my condo.

I soon fell in love. We both developed a liking for hiking, biking, dining, cooking together. We never fought. I just could not believe how nice we developed, organically - not pushing to a goal. But when I asked for more, to elevate our being together to the next level, he drops that bomb on me. He said ""you are not what I'm looking for. I have other criteria.""
