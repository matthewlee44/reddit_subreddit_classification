I then check her social media and think about all the things I could have done to make her like me. 

How do I stop this thinking, because surely it‚Äòs not healthy?! 

In August I went out with a girl [F24] who I had a crush on from my old work and after the date she said she just wanted to be friends. I accepted that she wasn‚Äôt into me and thanked her for being honest. But for the next 3 months I pretty much kept checking her instagram compulsively and thinking about dating her. 

Fast forward to a week ago. I met a girl [F22] on a dating app and we hit it off. We went on 2 dates but after that, she said she felt no chemistry and called it off. Again, I accepted that and told her it was nice meeting her. But now I keep thinking about how nice it would‚Äôve been if she liked me, and I keep searching her name on facebook to look at her profile. 

I try NOT to look at their socials and not to think about them all day, but it‚Äôs so tough. I know dating more would help, but I don‚Äôt get too many matches on dating apps, so Im looking for alternative ways until then. 

Note: It doesn‚Äôt happen with every girl. I went out with another girl who ghosted me but I wasn‚Äôt into her, so I haven‚Äôt thought about her.

I've honestly had some nights where Im very depressed. All the dates I've been on and nothing. The rejections make me numb after awhile. I stop trusting that anyone really is interested no matter how nice they seem. I've wondered if Im just not going to find someone. Its really a shot to the ego to get turned down over and over again. Actively trying to maintain confidence and stay positive.

9,r5me24,1638275911,Would growing a beard help with dating prospects? I really don't like facial hair.,"Right now I live in a rural area and most of the women seem to go for the men with beards. Hunting, fishing, quading, and drinking are popular in my area. I've been clean shaven my entire life and the longest I've gone without shaving was 2 weeks. I got a little more female attention and some said I looked better with a beard while others said it didn't fit my personality.

A little about myself: I don't like guns, I could never harm an animal unless I was starving and needed a food source, I don't have fun fishing, I don't like getting dirty in a side by side or mudding. I also can't drink anymore due to 3 gastrointestinal comorbidities. I have nothing in common with a lot of people in this area.

I'm passionate about Technology, my family, watching movies, taking naps, taking walks, listening to music, occasional video gamer, NFL football, CFB, entrepreneurship, investing, and business.

I also am big into being generous to other people and being able to approach and converse with people I feel like introducing myself to who feel like positive, happy, upbeat people. I feel that being clean shaven makes me more approachable. I just feel like an outcast in my area.

My haircut is a little longer on top and a 1 guard on the sides and back. I like looking professional. I like to wear t shirts and sweatpants when I'm home but I like wearing blazers, sweaters, leather jackets, turtlenecks, Chelsea boots, loafers, etc. I dress pretty conservatively and think before I speak. While I have some conservative views and consider myself a moderate politically I lean democratic. Almost everyone in my town is conservative which I don't agree with a lot of their social viewpoints.

I just had shaven tonight and my face has broken out like crazy and is bumpy. The itchiness was so intolerable and I itched so much I drew blood. I freaking hate beards and facial hair. I don't like the aesthetic which I find sloppy, and it feels terrible. My productivity probably dropped 75% the last two weeks. I couldn't think of anything else but how much I wanted to shave it off.

To sum it up: is not having a beard a dealbreaker? Would women in cities be more tolerable of my style?

I hate being in a rural area. I apologize for the punctuation and grammatical errors. I also go on tangents due to my ADHD. My mind is all over the place.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5me24/would_growing_a_beard_help_with_dating_prospects/

11,r5mi4u,1638276319,I'm just gonna shout into the ether here: how do y'all handle the manipulation and gaslighting post getting dumped?,"She dumped me. after 2.5 years and longer being casual. Supposedly because she wanted to explore her sexuality untethered to me, no longer found me attractive and questioned whether she ever loved me. We supposedly didn't communicate well enough for her. But she still wants to be best friends. And do everything we did while dating still.

2 weeks later she suddenly never said she didn't love me, and now finds me attractive but hadn't changed her mind. Now she doesn't like that I valued her and put her on a pedestal. But also she can't deny we won't get back together in the future. It's up to fate she says.

A few days later, she suddenly loves me, but needs to be alone to go through her 'second puberty.' And was sorry I got caught up in it. She loves me, she finds me attractive, but hasn't changed her mind. I wanted months of no contact, she started quietly crying and asked for shorter. She wanted to keep texting me, I said no. Then she asked if I could text her then she'd know it'd be okay to speak. I agreed to that. All of it felt romantic like she wasn't sure about breaking up with me. But now I see she just didn't respect me or my boundaries.

We were managing well with low contact, just texting. I never should've texted her. She asks me for advice, she asks me for emotional support for an insecurity of hers. She started dming me on twitter a lot which I tried to interact with as little as possible. I use twitter for work and the 'why hasn't she responded its been a day, she's always on here' anxiety was getting to be a lot.

Then on Thanksgiving she sends me a late happy Thanksgiving text, apologizing for being sick. Then a couple minutes later she sends ""I really miss talking to you myname""

Verbatim. No context beyond that text.

*Am I crazy for taking that romantically???*

Then I say I miss talking to her too, I miss a lot about her but she broke up with me and keeps sending such mixed signals. That she knows I'm still in love with her because I've said so. I've been clear that I'm hoping we can get back together. She says she finds it so odd she doesn't know what's going on with me anymore, and her parents were driving her crazy and I'm the only one she wanted to talk to about it.

I say I'm trying to move to a place where we can be friends. But all the ambiguity is killing me.

She says she has been 100% clear and does not owe me clarity.

I ask her to hop on a call so we can talk since she threw yet another curveball. I want to talk about this confusion and want to talk about life because I really miss her and it sounded like her parents were being really terrible. She dodges it for days, saying she's confused why I would want to talk on the phone with her since I sounded so unsure about it. I say I need for us to talk about these new things she keeps saying.

Now she's overwhelmed by having to have another breakup conversation because she's been clear about how she feels and does not owe me clarity. But is willing to do it, and wants to talk about life with me as well.

We hop on a call. She says she said she was sorry I felt like I couldn't set boundaries with her on how much space I needed. She said it was my responsibility to set boundaries for myself and her wanting less time was her negotiating. Apparently she had forgotten she asked me to text her in the first place and thought I as doing it because I wanted to unprompted.

I said I felt like she doesn't respect me. No response.

I asked her when have I ever pushed back against her when she pushes against me? Relationships are partnerships and they are about compromise. She said that was the problem with me and our relationship. I never pushed back against her and stood up for myself which was a lie. I told her I stood up for myself all the time and the two times that I really pushed against her she threatened to break up with me. She went silent, I apologized because I didn't mean to get catty, she said no I'm just thinking and changed the subject.

She said the problem was I've never had a lot of best friends and the things she's said to me she would say to any of her close friends. She sees now how I would take ""I miss you"" as romantic but didn't think that it was when she sent it, and it is not her responsibility to manage my feelings or my anxiety. Which is weird because I have plenty of friends, they just don't live in our new town, but she's *met* my best friend and I talk to them all the time.

I said if she wanted to be my friend then she needed to consider me as an actual person who has real feelings that she knows intimately. She can't just say stuff without knowing how I would take it.

Not her responsibility apparently.

I ask her if she even meant that we ever might get back together, she says she wishes she never told me but yes she meant it still. I ask her if she even still feels like a lesbian and if it was even about that. I mean we opened our relationship earlier so she could explore. She said she didn't know what she wants.

We ended with her agreeing not to message me until I messaged her. With me saying I'll see her next year sometime. She asked me how my family was doing, I was honest and said bad but didn't really want to elaborate. She asked me how work was going and I said bad because its client facing and I've been incredibly depressed lately. Her last words were that if I ever needed to talk she would be there for me always. And asked me not hurt myself which I have NEVER even implied or even imagined before or since. I honestly was emotional and insulted. And now I feel worse because I don't think her thinking I would hurt myself over her helps our chances of reconciling.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5mi4u/im_just_gonna_shout_into_the_ether_here_how_do/

15,r5n2e7,1638278159,"For those worried about being awkward, please read this","Are awkward moments going to happen? Yes. They are inevitable. But it is *okay*. Most people are fine if the conversation isn‚Äôt perfect the whole time. That‚Äôs unrealistic. Just understand basic manners and decency and it‚Äôs not too bad.

So where‚Äôs this coming from? My work. I‚Äôm a security guard and every night I wave them goodbye and goodnight, stay the night, and greet everyone the following morning. And let me tell you, these people are either tired (that‚Äôs what my bet is) or do not understand human interaction. Even if they are tired, this is a great example. 

Quite often, when I say a simple ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù, they will ignore me. They will actively look all around to avoid looking me in the eye. If I ask them to slow down, they often fight back saying they were going the speed limit. Even after I explain I don‚Äôt know their exact speed, but am gauging it. And that it‚Äôs a warning, anyways. They‚Äôre not in trouble

Understanding the basic cognitive functions of a human makes you far more attractive and appealing. If someone corrects something on you, take it and continue on. Someone wishes you a good day, say thank you and wish it back. If you can open and close a conversation smoothly with these small things, you‚Äôll be quite a bit more attractive

* I meet the person, we eat food, spend time doing some fun activity (for example bowling) and that's it.
* I don't desire anything sexual.

19,r5nxu9,1638280973,Veiled opportunity or miscommunication?,"Howdy folks! So, I'm (19M) writing this on my way to a meetup with a girl. Short story: I was at a volunteering event 2 months ago with some friends and one of them told me a few female friends of his would come say hi. Among them, I knew 2, but the 3rd one was a new colleague from their faculty. Anyhow, we chatted for about 50-60 minutes and then they left. We exchanged Instagrams and that was it.
Yesterday, my town Christmas tree was lit up and I posted a story on my profile about it. A couple minutes later, this 3rd girl wrote to me asking some questions about the tree. Okay, a bit random, but I enganged her in conversation.
All of a sudden, she mentions she would like to go see it as well, either the following day, or on Thursday (2 days from now). Now, this was, to me at least, a pretty explicit opportunity for me to self-invite along. Which I did. She accepted. 16.30 in the town's square.

So here is my question. What the hell just happened? Did I read too much into it, did I read just enough, or is she genuinely interested even just in meeting up, after talking for 30 minutes or so 2 months ago?

20,r5nz1z,1638281074,Wondering whether to keep seeing this girl,"Met this pretty girl on the tube a couple of months ago and since then been on about 5 dates. We have not been intimate once. I've made moves but she keeps rejecting me.  The best that we've done is cuddle, when I try talk to her about it she just says she isn't ready to be intimate yet. 

AT the end of our last date we were talking in my car when I was dropping her off. I told her I'd like to kiss her now if that's okay and she didn't say anything or pull away so I thought she wanted me to. I went for it and she slapped my arms and chest a couple of times and then left without saying anything. 

She recently hit me up inquiring about date no 6, I wasn't gonna reply and did not plan on doing so at all (I know how you all feel about ghosting but I think it was pretty warranted in this case) but she sent me this message about how she's been a victim of assault in the past has intimacy issues stemming from that and she's seeing a therapist but she does like me and doesn't want us to stop seeing each other. 

Now I'm torn, on one hand I now understand her behaviour, I do think that she likes me and isn't just using me for dates (We've either split or she's paid for everything since our first date) but this does seem like a lot of baggage and I don't know if I want to get invested with a girl who may never feel comfortable getting intimate.

I feel like my entire life just ended out of nowhere. I don‚Äôt even know what to do. And now I have to survive the holidays alone. I feel cheated‚Ä¶.my whole life all I‚Äôve wanted is a family and kids and now I might not get that. 

Instead I‚Äôll spend Christmas moving out of our home and starting over alone at 30. The worst part will be telling my mom, who had been expecting an engagement and kids in the near future. So sad.

I don't have actively negative feelings about any of the decisions, I want my partner to do whatever makes the home feel like home to them. I just don't think I care as much about aesthetic (or more specifically my aesthetic is more minimalist), but that ends up coming off as offensive to them.

39,r5qcoa,1638287863,How do I gain confidence to speak to women?,"A bit of my background- 27 M from India.
I well educated, have a decent job, might not be the fittest guy around buy when a person looks at me, they cn easily say that I workout regularly. I'm 5'6 and I believe I'm slightly above average in terms of looks.
When it comes to my hobbies, I play a guitar, I read, I sketch, I read and I love singing though I admit that I'm not even close in being decent at it. I enjoy working out and have started playing squash recently.
I'm an introvert with a handful of friends and I don't like sharing or ranting about my life due to their judgemental nature.

I've had body image issues since my teens and I was an obese person till the age of 25. To make matters worse, I had severe hairfall. These factors affected my self esteem and hence didn't have any guts to talk to women. 

I worked on myself, lost 20 KG of weight and have regained my hairline- thanks to the hair regrowth treatment. I look decent now and I get a few looks from women in my gym. Had hopes that I get a chance to meet someone in my workspace and hopefully turn the gears of my life and voila! Covid made an entry in this world

Tried dating apps and I don't know how to have conversations with women. I bring out my nerdy side and the conversations become dry. The closest I've come across in having a date is I exchanged my IG handle with a match. That's it! Most of the conversations feel like flogging a dead horse. I'm neither looking for a hookup nor a casual relationship. I'm genuinely seeking a life partner.

I joined pottery classes as I was not only interested in it but also with a hope of meeting and speaking with someone over there. I just can't get into a conversation. I just can't! I don't feel confident to open my mouth. I've always been a quiet person but this is backfiring me. While all my friends are getting married to their respective girlfriends, I find it so intimidating to make an  eye contact with women. I usually don't like the idea of even glancing women as I think it makes them uncomfortable but I realised that maintaining eye contact with women is a sign of confidence.
It's not that I don't have anything to talk. I don't know how to initiate a conversation. I don't socialise much as I have less friends and now even the ones I had are married. 

I want to go out and speak to women. I want to talk to them. I don't fear rejection. The very act of initiating the conversation dreads me. I'm a shy guy who always likes to mind his own business and I'm not usually the one who initiates the conversation.

44,r5r1gs,1638289686,(F22) Pregnant while he (M25) doesn't want labels,"I have known this guy for like 6 weeks... any advice is appreciated .. can't talk about it to my friends. I also have never been in a real relationship before.

&amp;#x200B;

* I met him from a dating app for the first time in mid-october 
* I felt comfortable and semi attracted (and a little drunk) so we had sex after the first date
* We met up like 2 or 3 days a week for dinner or short activity and I sleep over every time. But I felt it was a good balance of sex / cuddling / pillow talk / romantic gestures / etc.
* Physical attraction and sexual compatibility matters more to me relationship, but not at the expense of real romance and affection.
* After 4 dates he starts introducing me to his friends, so I feel like we're going in a good direction (toward bf/gf)
* I feel compelled to DTR - 1 month since knowing him. He says he isn't seeing anyone else, he's been really thinking about it, acknowledge we see each other a lot, but it's too soon for a label. Which hurts me... it felt like I was already his girlfriend and we just had to make it official. 
* I decide that I can give him 1 or 2 more months max to decide whether he likes me with the condition that I don't want to meet his friends and we really get to know each other better, I don't want to play pretend girlfriend.
* We meet up 3 or so times after that and every time friends are either at his place, or spontaneously show up. At this point I start to get upset because I already communicated that while I like his friends, I don't think it's appropriate for me to meet him unless he can hold my hand in front of them or confidently call me his girlfriend. He invited me, but neglects me when they're around. It makes me feel insignificant since obviously he knows them better and he just pulls me aside to his room for bedroom time after he's done entertaining them.
* He appeases me by saying sorry, romantic affectionate touch, agreeing to my frustration.. but doesn't change. I know he is busier than me (70 hr work week) and has more friends than me, comes across as a people pleaser. But I don't want to fit myself into his schedule and give him everything he wants, if he can't even affirm he likes me enough to be official.

lol and the cherry on top.... \*\*drumroll\*\* I'm pregnant... I know exactly which time the condom broke (2 weeks ago) and *I knew* I would get pregnant, since it was my ovulation day. Had my panic attack on the same night itself and he did okay comforting me. Haven't talked about it since/yet. I'm pro-choice and it's my first time actually dating someone, nevermind going through all of this ... very overwhelmed...

I plan to tell him later this week, in person. The soonest appointment I can get the medication is 2 weeks from now (puts me at 6 weeks pregnant) and plan to take a break from sex until my next period and can start birth control. I am not scared to dump him if he has an adverse reaction to this, but I really do like being with him and just want to get this abortion and go back to the original issue at hand.

I can't tell if I'm being friend zoned/whether he is keeping me around for sex or he is actually was just trying to integrate me into his friend circle to see if it meshes. He mentions his ex from time to time which makes me a little insecure since he could be comparing me to her, or using me to get over her... who knows.

The majority of people go onto these apps to attempt to meet likeminded people, and I can not for the life of me fathom why dating apps have not used this knowledge to make their apps more successful which in turn will attract more users onto the platform.

Rather than having to list things like which University you went to, or what your star sign is  (which is actually kind of useless as you can't even filter people by these options), apps should offer users a set of personality types or interests that you could then filter users by. Things like raver/clubhoger, gamer, musician, artist, painter, sporty, parent, traveller and so on. You'd choose one that best fits yourself and then could select which you'd like to be shown (or have a premium version where you are only shown the types you want).

That's obviously a rough version of the idea and could be expanded upon or improved, but being able to immediately bypass people you have nothing in common with and actually be shown people you live a similar lifestyle to makes way more sense to me as a creative person who wishes he could meet more introverted artists and only ever sees party animals on these apps.

I'm not saying this would make the apps fool-proof and instantly way better, but it may lead to more matches and conversations which in turn leads to more people wanting to use the platform as it gets results.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5rlzd/i_wish_online_dating_apps_did_this_instead/

I‚Äôm not trying to sound bitter and pessimistic but I‚Äôm so confused. I have to ask every person in a 5 mile radius yet somehow at the same time not be desperate and even then it‚Äôs just a date.

Sorry, but I'm not interested in boinking someone I don't know. 

I enjoy getting to know people to determine if we share similar ideals. 

I don't see the sense in sleeping with someone simply because society says it's cool, only to discover the next day that they're a flat earther or can't clean their teeth (I've seen a lot of posts here of ladies tolerating males who can't even wipe their own arse....come on, acquire some standards).

63,r5sw27,1638294445,I (28M) have been dating a girl (22F) for 6 months. She won't stop asking me to be her boyfriend. How do I tell her I'm not ready?,"I get that it's been 6 months, but we've only seen each other once every 2 weeks because she lives 2 hours away. I'm going to make a decision like this based on seeing her 12 times. Yeah, she stays for the weekend when she comes (she lives with her parents), but I just don't want to stop dating other women when I barely see her.

I told her this, and she got upset and started crying because she said that she hasn't seen anyone else since we started dating.

Anyway, since 3 months in, she has been always dropping hints or asking me straight up.

She finishes school in December and lives with her parents (they're both professors at the same university) in a small college town. I know she wants to move to where I live (a big city) when she graduates, so I suggested that she stay with me until she finds a job and some roommates. I told her that will give us a good amount of time to spend together, and then we can move toward a relationship if everything works out.

I thought that was a nice gesture. I even told her I would be exclusive during that time (I mostly just have FWBs and am not really dating). At first, she misunderstood me and thought I was asking her to move in with me and got very excited. I reiterated that it would be a temporary situation, and we wouldn't automatically be BF/GF upon her moving in, and she lost it. She got very upset and cried and told me that me loves me, and why don't I feel the same. I told her I've only seen her 12 times. She said that shouldn't matter because we spend 3 days together every time, and we talk every night for hours on the phone.

I agree that she is amazing, and we have a great connection, but I just need more time. She said she's not moving in with a guy who's not her boyfriend. I said that's ok, but it's not moving in. Then she left early and hasn't spoken to me since.

I don't know what more I can do.

Should I just break up with her and suggest that we try again when she moves to the city?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5sw27/i_28m_have_been_dating_a_girl_22f_for_6_months/

Both dates she seemed playful and smiled lots and played with her hair and joked around, so I felt like she was having a good time and liked me. I did not hear from her after our first date, I think I waited a day, and then I texted her to tell her I had a good time. We texted for another day or two and then I asked her out again, so my intentions and interest in her should have been clear. Like I said earlier, second date went well, we joked and had very stimulating conversation, she smiled and laughed and played with her hair a few times. That second date was 3 days ago now. Neither of us has texted. Since I texted after date 1 I was waiting for her to text after date 2.

At this point I feel like she is either not into me (I thought she was), she is too busy for a relationship or is playing it too cool (hard to get).

Basically I've never really had a lot of success while dating (or experience, really! Because of shyness, school, the whole nine yards).

I'm taking to this dude who's really taken the reins when it comes to our dates (I'm super *pleasently* surprised by this). My past dating felt a lot more even (I had to help plan things, etc.)

I got the vibe from date 3 that he was maybe being polite and wasn't interested anymore. Our date was a bit tiring so at the end when I got home I messaged to say thanks, but he didn't really get back until the next day (he's not a *huge* texter to begin with). Anyway, we've been texting a *bit* and I'm responding but neither of us are really asking questions anymore. This sounds stupid but I don't want to sound overeager which is why I haven't (I feel like I made some social moves on the date that he didn't pick up on?).

I am now feeling how girls I was attracted to who couldn't reciprocate feel. 
I used to think "" how can she not like me even after I've done all these nice things for her "" but now I get it, I really do. 
This girl is ultra available, always treats me nice,  responds to my messages instantly, we are in a school project and she's doing everything I want.
She's the first to offer to help me, even when I slack off sometimes, checks on me via text daily, very considerate and helpful all the time. 

I've been thinking about this situation and it just hit me that this might be the same situation as the nice guy described in every literature lol.

And honestly I will never like her the way she wants me to, I will never even consider her as  partner. Now I can relate to girls that can never date nice guys, before I never got why but now I do.

I called him out on it and he came at me with saying he was actually having second thoughts about us because he thought we were ""too different"". The trip we just got back from was great and the texting seemed very normal until I called him out for being on Tinder. We talked on the phone and he ended it. 

The next day he sends me a very long message saying all of these things that I apparently did wrong and he ended it with saying how people become ""infatuated"" with him and he leads them on. He basically said in so many words that the whole time he was leading me on. It's such a strange and upsetting thing to hear because he texted me constantly and told me multiple times how much he liked me. 

After he ended things with me he said he wanted to be friends and continued to text me and ask me about an interview I had.

Old friend from work who had casually mentioned him and his gf are open. but he hasn't really properly propositioned me for anything, so I'm playing aloof. He had been trying to get me to meet his gf, we met and all went to the movies and food after. At some point he invited me to hangout at this not so casual spot and it really sounded like a date, I declined because I don't want to third wheel what sounds like a romantic date. It was all going well until I invited them to my place for a social gathering. At some point during the party he mentioned us all going out again but in a kind of suggestive way....drinking, I didn't know what to say so I didn't say anything. And very shortly after his gf walked up to him and kinda started giving him shit. So I snuck off as she was quietly chewing him out, they possibly they didn't discuss it before hand. Whatever. 
But now he keeps texting me and it's like he won't take the hint. I think his causal ""I'm not trying but it's obvious I'm trying"" persistence is a turn off. Now, I'll go out of my way to text her sometimes but I pretty much ignore his stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend (M45) and I (F43) met in 2020.  Our sex life was very hot and heavy in the first year and it slowed down which I am aware is typical when comfort sets in.  Then five months ago, he stopped touching me.  He stopped flirting with me and when I would flirt with him, he'd play it off and tell me to stop.  He would never initiate sex and if I initiated it ended with me pleasing him and then we were done.  I did ask him to help me out a few times.  He did, but it didn't arouse him and he seemed to be very robotic about it.  So I asked him what was going on and asked if he still found me attractive.  He told me I was just looking for problems to fix and that I was being neurotic.  I was upset that I felt like he blew me off and we fought but got through that.  But nothing changed with the sex life.

Last night, I asked to talk and asked him if he was happy and stated again why I thought things were off.  He did the same.....but I kept pushing.  He admitted that he loves me so much, he doesn't want to lose me, but he is repulsed by the odor of my vagina.  As much of an ego hit as that was I asked him for a description of the odor and he said that it is a healthy, normal odor but that he just prefers women who aren't musky.  That when I get aroused I get musky.  He told me he's had dreams about giving woman oral sex the whole time we've been together and he misses it and that he misses all the fun stuff he could do to a vagina, but he can't do it to mine.  He said he's never been aroused by my lady and thought that he could get past it since the rest of me is so great.

I am healthy, clean, trimmed and maintained.  I go to the OBGYN every year and take a Womens Daily Probiotic with Prebiotic to maintain my balance and keep from getting yeast infections/UTIS, etc.  I am STI free, I was tested earlier this year.  I am currently not experiencing any issues and have had men perform oral sex on me many times and go back for more.

I get it, he's not attracted to my hormones.  Wouldn't it have been better for him to just stop moving forward when he figured this out?  But wow the gaslighting.  The lies and hurt of hearing this after so long hearing how much he loves me and thinks I'm sexy and desired.  I don't think he does love me or he wouldn't have pursued me (he pursued me, I even tried to just be friends) knowing he couldn't give me everything a woman needs.  Knowing that this is an issue for him, and then when I felt something was off, he let me believe it was me and he watched me as I self-criticized.  I will fully admit I feel disgusting now.  I asked if scrubbing myself will help (even though I know that throwing off the pH of my lady parts would happen), I asked about flavored lube but it is a smell thing apparently.  He said he has a sensitive sniffer....which is true.  He can't stand perfume, etc.  I get aroused and produce a substance that carries that ""musk""  Am I wrong about that?

We broke up.  I'm just so sad and scarred now.  I don't know if I can feel comfortable with anyone now.  I just had to vent I didn't know what to do and I had to get it out.

I told him that I am moving on and he cried saying that he couldn't stand me falling in love with another man.  Am I wrong for breaking it off with him?  I know I should be more confident at my age, but I'm not.  I'm working on it, but I'm not there yet.

88,r5vlrm,1638301517,"If a person doesn't want to engage with you anymore, just know that the responsibility falls on their shoulders, not yours","*Ever been on dates where you had amazing chemistry with the other person, yet they text you the day after to say that they don't want to see you anymore?*

*Ever had amazing conversations on dating apps only for the person to ghost you when it came to set an actual meet up?*

Yeah same. 

The dating world is rough. It kind of sucks to navigate through a field where most people treat us as their best option until they are no longer entertained by who we are and/or found someone better to cater to their preferences.

But you know what? The people who ghosts us, or those who no longer wants to see us are *the ones who chooses to severe the connection*. Not us. Cutting the possibility of blossoming those connections into something meaningful *falls entirely on their shoulders*. Yes, we may get into our own heads sometimes, we may blow a first impression, we may not be their most compatible fit, but ultimately, if someone initiates such a departure our of our lives, they have willingly chosen not to appreciate the beauty behind each one of us.

It's unfortunate, yet not our fault.

So the next time someone either ghosts you or doesn't want to see you? There's nothing we can change, nothing we should've/could've done better. We've truthfully navigated this situation to the best of our abilities, and it's a shame they couldn't appreciate that. 

*On the path to bettering yourself and share your gifts with the world, and they don't want to be part of it? Too bad.*

*On the path to your highest form of creative expression, and they don't want to be part of it? Too bad.*

*Or simply rocking a girthy 10-inch rocket and they don't want to be part of it? Too bad.*

It has been liberating for me to conclude so far that all the moments that ""could-have-been"" shared together is simply something they didn't want us to share with them. It's a cope, yet a powerful one. Just wanted to share this with you all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5vlrm/if_a_person_doesnt_want_to_engage_with_you/

94,r5w18a,1638302647,Is Ambition Limited to Professional Achievement?,"Hello friends.    


So I (27M) have been struggling entering the dating game in a new city, and some repeat issues have me questioning whether my scope on life is having a negative impact on my romantic ventures.    


Quick backstory -- I was in the Army and got hurt.  The Army retired me (Full pension, healthcare for me and my dependents for the rest of my life, with a bunch of rad benefits that I am fortunate to receive) at 24.  I've spent the last few years dealing with my health and have finally gotten to a point that I feel like I can participate in a healthy and fulfilling relationship.   


I am legally able to work on top of the pension income, and honestly if I had to, I could!  I got a degree in business while working on myself and have the capacity to be able to work, but here is where I have begun questioning myself.    


I just purchased my first home, and my pension is more than adequate to afford me a modest lifestyle.  I own a 2019 Honda Accord with no payments, i have no debt whatsoever and while i'm not going out to eat every night I have plenty of room for entertainment and dating.  I have no need to work right now.  I wake up every morning when I feel like it.  No stress to be anywhere (unless i have an appointment)  everything is on my time.  That being said, I dedicate a lot of time to self improvement.  I go to the gym every morning, and i spend my days working on an endless list of hobbies.  I have recently been working on calligraphy, basic woodworking, guitar, coding, photography and exploring my new city.  I've made it my mission to try something new every few months and i've learned SO much doing so.  It's surprising how many people you can relate to and bond with when you know a little bit about so many things.   


I've been on a few dates, but so far 4 out of the 5 women i've met have said they weren't interested because I don't work.  Last night, I got a text saying that I was nice, but I wasn't ambitious and that was a red flag.  It hit me pretty hard because she's right, I have pretty much zero ambition to grow professionally.  All my needs are met with excess, and living a stress free lifestyle is far more attractive than having more money at the expense of losing time that I could be spending doing things i actually want to do.  I feel like my ambition to better myself doesn't matter, and ""ambition"" only refers to professional achievements or money.    


I guess i'm just looking for validation that the time I'm spending making myself happy is more valuable than giving away that time for more money.  It feels like i'm going to need to work and be unhappy in order to attract someone and that feels wrong on so many levels.

95,r5w7r4,1638303121,Girl I think might be cute accidentally liked a picture of me from three years ago‚Ä¶,"Okay, in a normal world, this would be simple.

Call me weird, but I find a pretty face to be more important than other physical features. 

Long and short a girl who sits across from me who is probably (see above) attractive accidentally liked (and rapidly unliked) an ancient photo of me this morning. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs mortified, but do I take that as a sign that there is some interest and at least ask for a number?

99,r5wiaf,1638303904,Haven't been on a date before,"I'm a 22 [M], 
First I understand that this post isn't that important, so it's understandable if skip it and move onto  a more important one. But If you read/reply to it that would be awsome.

I also want to point out that is is a throw away account. I'm also Heterosexual if that matters. 

With that out of the way, unlike most people my age I haven't actually been on a date before. Unlike what most people think, I do want to go on one and experience what most people do. It's just kinda hard because I have social anxiety. For me at least it makes it hard to approach people and have a conversation with someone I haven't met before, but when push comes to shove I can do one. 

For reference I have recently started doing exposure therapy on my own in hopes of lessening the anxiety, but I'm probably going to experience SA for most of my life and don't even then I don't know when I'll be better enough to aproch someone. Plus at the moment I don't speak to a lot of people as well, so there that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5wiaf/havent_been_on_a_date_before/
