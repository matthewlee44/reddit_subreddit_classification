Even after all the counseling, we will never go back to where we were. There was a 13% chance we'd get back together. I worked effortlessly to be a better husband, but there didn't seem any chance of my family coming home. 
We seem to be doing fine, but I still want to ask a coworker out to dinner that I had planned on asking before my wife and kids showed back up. I can't get her out of my mind. I just want to see if there's a chance because I never took it. Does that make me a horrible person?

2,pihh9y,1630863405,"From India, widower, 2 daughters, options please","Well I am over 41, been a widower for over a year now. I have two daughters 1 year and 6 years. I don't know if I ready to date or get into a relationship or not but I sometimes feel a need for a companion. Someone to just talk to, hey how was your day, this was may day!! Also secretly I feel my daughters would be much happier to have some female presence around.

Is there any hope for me? My psychologist diagnosed me of being a loner, I don't have any family to speak of, just couple of friends and now it looks like I had a very tolerant wife who put up with me all along. All this just scares me a bit, I don't mind being with myself, but since for past 11 years I had one person who was my entire world, so sometimes I feel would it be so bad if I find another such a person.

Let me know if anyone in same boat as me, how did you tread water. Are online dating sites any good from Indian perspective, as I read and hear they are full of fake profile and scammers? Since I live alone with my 2 daughters I just cannot make myself leave them for more than couple of hours. So I cannot go for any meetups or gatherings.

5,pijy5y,1630871350,Does it mean something or am I overthinking (wishful thinking)?,"I (45f) have a casual friend (4?m) I met at work about 8 yrs ago. We hit it off from the very beginning. Always laughing, making work fun, great chemistry, even rumors starting to spread. But we’re just friends. He’s always been very clear to to everyone that he keeps his personal like separate from work so he’ll go to happy hours and hang with work friends but not mix it up.  

But, over the years, we started hanging out by ourselves (still not mixing with his personal life) and we’ve built a personal friendship. We don’t see or even talk to each other often anymore since over the years we’ve been moved to different parts of the building then eventually started remote working several years ago. But, every few months or so, we’ll either chat via text all night or we’ll meet up for a drink. We’ve shared stories and learned about each other and his friends and family too. 

Now, I never made it a secret that I’ve always liked him since I first met him and he knows but I value his friendship and privacy and so I don’t make a big deal about it or bring up.  But he knows. Lol. I’ve had a couple LTR over the years and as far I know he hasn’t dated anyone since before I met him, when he had a breakup that hurt him very deeply. I don’t bring that up ask about his dating life though. 

Anyway, we met for drinks at a bar back in May and talked all night (like we always do), a few months ago, I ended a LTR. Then, I met my friend at his house for drinks a few weeks ago and had mentioned that the relationship had ended months before and we just spent the whole night just laughing and talking like we do. It caught my attention a couple of times when he said “I was telling X about you…, (work related then again he said to a friend). I didn’t think anything of it at the time.  
As usual, it always feels like an awkward date when it’s time to go - lots of lingering and saying goodby then keep talking, etc. I’d had a little much so was just tipsy enough to winks and tell him again that I’m still into him if he’s ever interested. He smiled, said he knew, then hugs and I left.

Haven’t spoken to him since then out of the blue last weekend he sends me an invite to an annual even he has where his oldest, closest friends come from all over, as well as his family. All of us at work over the years have known and teased about an invite but none have gotten one because of his boundary rule.  

So I freaked out! Why did he invite me? We’re not close friends by any means, and yet this year he’s inviting to come and meet/mingle with his closest friends and parent? Obviously I’m excited. My mind got blown and I though, wow, I’m an actual friend now and not just a coworker who meets up once in a blue moon. 

Then someone says to me have I considered the fact that maybe he thought about what I said and he is interested, and now I’m actually available and he’s bringing me to meet the people most important to him because he has been hurt and wants their insight before he make any move?

Now I’m completely obsessed and I’m trying to calm the shit down because I don’t want to get fixated and then get disappointed.

Any insight? Men, how do you think and consider when to bring someone into your life?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pijy5y/does_it_mean_something_or_am_i_overthinking/

I always had a little crush on him despite being in other longtime relationships over the years but haven't crossed paths with him since right before the pandemic two years ago.   

Years ago when we worked more closely together there was a mutual attraction where he seemed interested but I had a partner at the time and had to discourage his flirting.  For all I know maybe he was just flirting for fun and I was just being overly protective of my own relationship.  Either way, when I caught up with him two years ago (after 6 years of being layed off and coming back part-time) I thought the old spark came back that day. But then we both went remote because of Covid.  I had this hope we would work together soon because clients were coming back.  Then  he understandably accepted a better job offer. 

I first emailed two weeks ago, ""I really enjoyed working with you all these years so it's sad to see you go. I know I haven't worked with you much in recent years, but you were one of the first people I met at XYZ when I started as a CM way back in 2008.

From his response and the circumstances does it seem like it would be too weird to suggest getting coffee sometime?  Like its just too out of nowhere when it's been so long?

Ok I know this is going to come across as a total rant but will ask it anyway. 
I have been activity dating for about 9 months after a dB situation.  Had my fill of casual so really looking for something more serious.  

I am finding the following
1. Loads of matches who are cool for the first few days then it goes into the 'D can you send me photos of yourself blah blah blah' and then degrade into sex like super quick. This is on ANY forum. And any age match. 
2. Matches who are really cool and on the first face to face date just complain about their exes etc. So I don't go out again. 
3. Hundreds of pen pals and enough 'Hey' in my inbox to start my own arable enterprise. 

I am seriously struggling to just find normal. You know laughing,  flirting, good conversation etc. 

I figure the common denominator is me. Right? 

So here are my questions

1. Is it normal for guys to want tonnes of photos?  Why? 
2. Am I from another planet wanting to meet before talking about sex ffs? 
3. Is this just the wrong time to date? Ie everyone is not seriously looking because of the pandemic and I should take up basket weaving or something till the stuff blows over?!

I have tried being flirty, smart, intellectual, deep, fun ie me!!

Ok off to do some retail therapy and get into the sun.

Problem is, I am very comfortable with my lifestyle and don’t want to get into a relationship just because of what I fear. 

Either way, I let myself go to avoid attracting male attention so that’s a huge impediment for me right now. I gained a lot of weight, especially during Covid.

Maybe I expect too much at this point, but wanted to ask the lucky girls here, how do they meet guys? What should I do if I want to try? I am introverted too which prevents me from going to bars and stuff to meet guys. I live alone and have no friends. I used to have a friend that always made fun of me and asked me if I expected guys to arrive at my door looking for me. That’s pretty much how I feel.

I had only seen the birthday girl before in the past at other family events.  My boy puts a good word in with her before he leaves the party. I go talk to her for a while. I can tell she was tipsy from the drinks. When the party is over she invites me back to her house. Her girlfriend drives her home. I follow in my car.

As I walk up to her house as she opens the door she says “we are not having sex tonight!” I wasn’t expecting that. Her girlfriend is there with us and we are just talking around her table. She goes over to her couch and I follow. We are still talking but we begin kissing.  Eventually she says to come up her bedroom and she tells her friend she can leave.

We get started but I only give her oral sex. No penetration. As I was giving her oral sex I only removed her underwear but left her sundress on. I was still dressed while giving her oral sex. When she fell asleep I completely undressed and got in the bed next to her and went to sleep. I’m the morning when we woke up we talked for a while in bed. She is now hungover. She even laid on my chest. I leave and state I would like to see her again. 

Later on she text me and said she was curious why I was naked in the morning when she recalls me having clothes on when she fell asleep. I replied I felt comfortable and I normally sleep naked. I apologized to her via text. I said I apologize if that made her uncomfortable. She replied it did make her comfortable. She asked what made me decide to completely undress if I only performed oral sex on her? I just said I felt comfortable. 

I understand now that my actions were wrong. I had misinterpreted the situation. She did not know me so why would I remove all my clothes. I was wrong for taking off my clothes. Even though nothing happened while we slept but I can understand why she would be concerned and wonder what happened. 

I truly enjoyed the conversation we had. She is my type. She is beautiful. I do want to get to know her. However now I feel she is uncomfortable about me.

I was thinking maybe in a week to give her a call. Do you think she is willing to give me a second chance? Should I call her? Should I chalk it up as a learning experience and move on? If she now feels uncomfortable around me is there anyway to make her feel comfortable again?

I stopped believing in that in my 20s, unfortunately I wasn’t very successful in dating. I ended gaining an enormous amount of weight and became socially isolated. 

Since then I’ve made a lot of improvements in my life. I’ve lost a bunch of weight, have a pretty decent job, and, maybe I’m being overconfident, but I think I’m a pretty good catch. Losing the weight and gaining some muscle has definitely helped my self-esteem, especially since I didn’t even think i could gain muscle at my age.

50,pjqnwo,1631032593,An Ode To Dating After 40/50 and To Dating 40/50-somethings,"When I (52M) married my ex when I was 25, I didn't know the type of parent she'd be, earner she'd be, how well she'd age, what type of midlife crisis she'd have, what kind of health or mental issues she'd have. And she didn't know these things about me either. There were hints early on, both pro and con, of what she might be and what I would be. But the reality is I had no idea and she had no idea. In essence, it was all an educated guess/crapshoot for both of us.

Fast forward 25 years, and I unexpectedly hit the dating circuit again. How much fun it was to meet with 40s/50s people (women) my own age who'd raised (or not raised) kids, had careers, saved or spent or earned or not earned money, had health issues or not, and made all kinds of choices. We'd spend our dates talking about our past and our current, and not only was this a lot of fun and very interesting, but I felt like I could really get a sense of who my dates were based on how they'd lived their lives up until that point, since in essence we are what we do and have consistently done, and all of us have patterns to our lives by the time we are 50-something. There were some amazing people, and a few who I thought could benefit from therapy, but mostly I felt like I was able to get a sense if the person I was with on a date was an LTR match for me, in no small part because I know myself better now than I did at age 25, too. 

If I could go back in time, I myself would not have married at 25. There was too much I didn't know about my STBXW, and more importantly about myself, things that would only be revealed through the benefit of time. In retrospect, my STBXW and I were matches for a short period of time in our mid-20s, but not in our 30s and beyond -- she wanted independence and money (provided by an earner) and respect/admiration (from her peers) and kids that someone else (me) raised, wherein I just wanted money in a savings account and romance and sex and camaraderie with a woman I loved. In the end, we made the most of it but both of us were unfilled in our own ways in those last 10-15 years, and I was not honest with myself in my 30s and 40s but I made the most of what was in retrospect a pretty miserable situation/marriage for me back then.

Anyway, so I am grateful that I brought all this to dating in my 50s, and for this reason would not have considered dating someone younger than their 40s before I met my SO (53F). And I wish our schools/parents/teachers invested more in teaching us about matching with the right people so I was better prepared at age 25, and less about geometry which I never used again after high school :)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pjqnwo/an_ode_to_dating_after_4050_and_to_dating/

TLTR: yeah, he likes me lol

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to the many people who commented on my original post, I relaxed and decided to let it play out. We went on two more dates where I hug him and kiss him on the cheek both as hello and goodbye. I also continued to touch his arm, place my hand on his knee, touch his shoulder, touch his back. He doesn't kiss me nor does he reciprocate the physical contact - the tip of his finger on my forearm is as much as I get. Sweet Lord!

But, I meet his friends for board game night a couple times and by the second time it becomes apparent that he (1) has talked about me with them, (2) has quite possibly showed them my OLD profile, and (3) has introduced me to them as someone he is dating. 

So I'm like, uhm OK. We both have the day off yesterday because of the holiday, so I invite myself over to his place. And, just to leave nothing on the table, I also text him something in the tune of: you know, if you want to make a move, today would be a great day to do it!

We proceed to have a lovely time together as always. We chat, we laugh, we play some games. At one point we end up on the couch under the guise of watching a movie, but we keep chatting instead. Finally, he is like: so I know you said something about making a move, but I'm shy and I'm not super sure what to do. So I kissed him. And we then proceed to have an hour long hot and steamy make out session in which we definitely batted a triple lol.

 So far so good. Thank you all for the advice :)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pjuivz/update_is_this_guy_interested_or_does_he_just/

65,pk9eek,1631103703,Marriage is a partnership and mutual respect is necessary,"Your spouse can ask about your whereabouts, check your phones, and ask who you were speaking to on the phone. They can visit your workplace too. If you have a problem with these questions, do not get married. You will end up frustrating yourself and your spouse.

If you don’t like people touching your phones, or your things in general, marriage is not for you. Before you come to argue that it can be discussed, nope. If you give your partner the impression that you’re hiding something, they will pull away emotionally from you.

If you don’t like people asking you how much you have in the bank or how much you earn as a salary, don’t bother about marriage. You are expected to lay it bare. If you both are going to combine income, you will need to tell each other how much you earn.

Yes, you cannot just go and buy whatever you want because you have the money. You are no longer single, you are sharing your life with your partner, therefore, buying certain expensive items needs to be discussed. Before you charge in to say, “my money is blah bla…”

Stay away from marriage if you can’t learn to say We or Our.
It’s no longer about you; it’s about everyone in the family. Buying a new house, car, furniture, or even inviting a guest over? Tell your spouse. You are not seeking their permission, you are letting them know of your plans, not after you’ve purchased. It’s a sign of respect.

Lastly, stay away from people who disrespect your partner or encourage you to disrespect your partner. 

Avoid telling everyone about your marriage. How you run your home is your business. If you are in danger, seek help. Otherwise, avoid petty gossips that can ruin lives. 

You might not like this one, but, your partner can stop you from seeing a certain friend if they don’t like them, or they can stop them from visiting your home or calling your phone.

I said no because that would cause my department to be short help. I told him he needs to ask my supervisor if he needs me to work in his department. He said the other supervisor never asks for permission. When I saw the supervisor for my department I let her know what happened. She got upset and went off on him. Now he is blaming me saying he never thought I would do something like this to him, I ruined his working relationship with my supervisor and I also ruined his day. I told him I had no idea that my supervisor would react like that. So I apologized for that part. He told me he was only joking about pulling me from my dept. He would have figured out a way to get his job done. I told him it didn’t seem like he was joking to me considering he didn’t have any help. I explained to him that 2 other supervisors used to constantly pull me out of my dept causing it to be short help. I said I did nothing wrong and I did not stab him in the back. He said yes I did.

81,pkroz9,1631166114,Managing expectations- not sure what to think,"Hi all, about 5 weeks ago I did reach out to a guy in my neighborhood that I'd had a connection to last year but I'd gotten back with my (now ex) boyfriend. Here is the post:

 [(18) Update on a post from a couple months ago and a question : datingoverforty (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p59szn/update_on_a_post_from_a_couple_months_ago_and_a/) 

Anyway, here I am again reaching out to the wisdom of the 'datingover40' crowd on Reddit for some perspective.

We had our weekend away, which did NOT go as planned for a number of reasons (such as wildfires), and there was some awkwardness with the physical intimacy one of the times.  

We talked about it and realized that we'd jumped in REALLY fast  from ""hey, haven't seen you in 6 months"" to ""let's go on a weekend getaway"" after having one hour together alone and a passionate kissing session plus a few hours hanging out with our kids together (They know each other from when we met).

We decided to keep dating but no pressure.   The talk we had about it was wonderful b/c it was honest and grounded and kind and I felt closer to him after talking.  He admitted that he'd kind of given up on meeting someone so his mind has been on just doing life for himself, and then I popped back in, and that he's got a huge business endeavor coming up that is taking a lot of his attention (He owns his own biz, expanding in a big way).  He said he was really excited to continue dating and let things go where their natural course takes.

However, now it's been about a month and I'm feeling really, really confused.  I am almost always the one to reach out.  He's not a great communicator in terms of frequency, and yet when we are together we have a wonderful time, lots of good conversation, hand holding, snuggling, and kissing at the end of the night. No sex again yet (which is fine with me b/c it was too rushed. I'm kind of a slow mover).

We spent time together every day of last weekend, including a fun date night of dinner and a concert and lots of those great snuggles and kisses. 

But he rarely texts or reaches out to ask how I am doing (he does in person) and his response are super short and no substance. He will reach out to sometimes tell me about his day or vent about a stressor. I don't mind, but it feels one-sided.  This is really different than when we met last year when he was very engaged on text and initiated time together (granted it was COVID times and he wasn't that busy).

He invited me to a concert in October, and had invited me to go diving with him in Belize in Nov (I can't go), and we've talked a bit about the idea of a trip to Croatia next year.  WE both love travel.

I am confused b/c we have fun together but it seems like between visits there is nothing, and I am the one who initiates most of our activities together, aside from the concert invite.

The reason I'm posting is that I'm trying to manage my expectations b/c I have only dated 2 guys since I was 25, and both of them were long term relationships kind of out of the gate.  My last bf, for all of his challenges, texted or called daily the first year or so, we talked a TON.  Granted, he's a big talker in general, as am I.

Of course I know that if this doesn't work for me I can walk away, I guess I'm just wondering if I have distorted expectations or am over-thinking things.

Last night we had a brief text exchange and I said that I look forward to the next time I get to rest my head on his chest and feel his warmth (he's way taller than me and our snuggles feel really good). I got NO reply. 

PS: I don't suspect another woman, unless it's all online/virtual. Plus he has his kids most nights (and we spend time with together w/the kids too as our kids are also friends),so not a lot of time for that.

I don't want to F this up by over-thinking but I also don't want to be a stupid fool either - maybe we are just buds who occasionally kiss?  It all feels very PG, which is fine, but also not what I'm used to. He is a 'recovering Mormon' (his term) and left the church for good about 5 years ago, I can't help but wonder if that is playing in somehow in terms of physical intimacy stuff (like him not making more moves, although he totally made the first move when we were physically intimate) and his dating approach in general. He has indicated that he finds me attractive, and definitely snuggles in a way that would indicate as such.

83,pkrzcq,1631167458,Un-match or explain then un-match,"TLDR - is it ok to just un-match after a first date or is it better to give a reason and then un-match

So I (43m) went on a first date a few days ago. Really casual, no pressure, just a walk in a local park. You know the drill check they are who they say they are, look the same as photos, act the same in real life, hold a conversation. 

We spent around an hour and a half together and seemed to get on. However I got home and slept on it without messaging after - knackered after the day at work and then rushing around to make the date on time. 

I checked the dating app and she had messaged twice first message saying ""how was tonight"" then 2 hours later saying ""I'll take that as a no"" 

I messaged back explaining why I hadn't checked for messages and that I like to take a bit of time to think things through before I arrange second dates. 

She hasn't messaged back - so my question may not need answering 🤣 in my situation but in general what's the views on etiquette when your not feeling it after a first date? 

Should you just un-match and not explain or explain then un-match?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pkrzcq/unmatch_or_explain_then_unmatch/

89,pkze3k,1631199312,Can you maintain a friendship with your ex when you begin to get serious with someone else?,"I've been separated for about a year and we decided to call it quits many months before that.  Going through the divorce process right now but we had no kids together and everything was amicable.  We were in total agreement that the marriage was not working for a number of reasons and we ended up getting along very well as just friends.  We would occasionally hang out with some mutual friends together, I'd go with her to her kids sporting events, get dinner or drinks, take bike rides, things like that.  

A couple months ago I met someone who I really hit it off with, and the past few weeks we've been spending more and more time together. So I'm extremely happy with how things are going but obviously now things are getting pretty weird with the ex.  I'd still like to be friends and somehow be involved with the stepkids lives, I'm just not sure to what extent is appropriate.  I also don't want to make the new gf uneasy, and she's been pretty cool about it though we haven't discussed it much and I'm not really sure how to approach the subject.  

So I guess my question is if you were seeing someone and things started to get more serious, at what point would their relationship with their ex make you uncomfortable?  I'm really just trying to figure out how to redefine our friendship without making it weird for anyone.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pkze3k/can_you_maintain_a_friendship_with_your_ex_when/

Not sure I’m 100% ready but it’s the only thing I really haven’t tried in trying to make the final “moving on” step. 

Set up profile. Set age range from 35 to 55 but didn’t put it as a deal breaker. Been getting a LOT of likes / comments from guys in 25-30 age range. My girlfriends tell me to go for it, have some fun, I’m just dipping my toe. 

But it feels a bit icky to me. I have upstairs neighbours who are in their mid-late 20s - very nice lads, always have a nice chat with them, but not sure I would date any of them! Seems like the age gap is too much. 

Ultimately I would like to find a partner but in the interim, it’s more to dip my toe into the dating pool again, and to flex that small talk muscle. Not really looking for FWB or anything super casual, so don’t want to give wrong impression.

99,pl5wjt,1631219240,Are Background Checks Sneaky or OK to do?,"So I saw the post about deep dives/background checks. A friend recently told me that it’s none of my business to do background checks and 3 dates in I don’t have any rights to check into personal backgrounds. So are background checks ethically ok to do for safety?



Take for instance this man I met on a dating app. First of all lied about his name and age. Said he was 40. He gave me his cell number into the dating app message so I plugged it into Fast People Search. Which gave me his correct name and age. Dude was 53 and had a bday coming up in a week. When I asked his real age he lied again and said he will be 53 but was honest about his bday date. 👀  



He sent me photos where the day and time stamp were months before meeting me and told me he took them for me. 



He was handsome as F so here we go- would you do a background check based on little lies?? Or does the need to do a background check mean run as fast as you can? Or background check everyone because- strangers online. Or is a Fast People Search to verify name, age and location enough?
