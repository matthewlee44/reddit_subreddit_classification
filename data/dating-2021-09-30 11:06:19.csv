It's a fact that 75% of the population has an IQ of 110 or below. Despite matching with a few people who explicitly stated that they 'value intelligence' I find that when there is a difference in cognitive ability it's both noticeable, and sometimes interactions are a major turn off. While I don't mind repeating myself I don't want to stress out my partner by trying to lead them through an idea that simply cannot be conceptualized by them.

Has anyone else encountered and overcome differences in cognitive ability? Do these women truly value intelligence when they are seemingly uninterested in elegant ideas themselves? Perhaps they really meant to say that they are simply looking for someone that is just not an idiot?

I have never done a paid test but a couple years ago the free online ones put me in the 97.5 percentile (or 99th percentile if I did it twice) and my brother has done a paid written one which put him in in the 99th percentile. For anyone unfamiliar with these terms the 97.5 percentile is 126-130 IQ or the top 2.5% of the distribution (1 in 40) whereas 99 percentile is 130-135 IQ or the top 1% (1 in 100).

6,pynofj,1633020228,She said he was selfish for not changing his mind after they had sex,"My roomate (He just got out of a very serious  2 year relationship about 4 or 5 months ago. )

Yesterday he had a girl over. When they conversed about expectations, she expressed wanting a relationship. 

He expressed that he wasn't ready for a relationship because he is still making sure he heals from his last one. No she's interested in is something casual. 

Expectations were said out loud. 

Him and his lady friend wound up sleeping together. 

Apparently the next day she had a talk with him about wanting to move forward into a full fledged relationship. He reiterated what he said early on. 

She got angry, and claim that he was selfish for not wanting to pursue the relationship after they had sex. ----even though he stated from the beginning that a relationship wasn't an option for him right now. 

Here's the way I see it, two consenting adults decided to have sex. Two consenting adults gave and took sex. I'm so tired of the concept that some women try to push.... Which is: women give sex to men. That is simply not true and it places women in a disadvantageous position. When two people have sex, it is give and take on both parts. She's getting just as much pleasure and value out of it as he is. 

It is a better sign of empowerment to stated this way than to say it as if the man is some sort of Predator who takes sex while the woman is the gatekeeper that just so happens to give sex conditionally. 

I would also say it is manipulation for her think that because they had sex now he owes her something (a relationship). 

Now it would be a whole another thing if he had lied to her and let her have expectation under false pretense. But that's not what happened here. He was truthful. And she's still chose to move forward with the sexual experience. 

He literally called me after his shift to tell me, that she's mad now in a venting kind of way. I had to clarify to him that he doesn't owe her anything and that they're both adults who made a decision. Because it seemed that her brand of manipulation was starting to get very aggressive.

7,pynrd2,1633020482,I (m25) a huge crush on my colleague (f22) but she has a boyfriend!,"throwaway account, hence the 1st post!

Hey guys!

So before you jump down my throat I have to say from the off - nothings happened between us and I would never jeopardise someone else’s relationship.

I wanted to come to you, because my gut is going off the charts and I wanted to see what others peoples takes were.

Right - so basically. Very friendly with this girl at work. She’s super cute, and just really really friendly and lovely.

As soon as she started the job we kinda just bonded/meshed straight away. She came out with me and a few pals of mine at the office a couple Friday’s in a row. Of course to ingratiate herself and to socialise a bit. She hung around me mainly.

Just friendly chatter. She asked me about my dating situation - told her I was dating. She said she had a bf. We shared a plate of nachos at this place and it was just cute. Female friend vibes. I got us a couple drinks that night.

It was my birthday recently so I took the day off but came into town to go out with some colleagues and she was there. I notice her angled towards me with her girl mates just staring from a distance (you know when you feel eyes on you) and she comes over and says ‘heyyyy! I owe you a drink!’

I asked her if she was free one lunch time over chat and she literally blew my inbox up saying she was busy that day but gave me loads of suggestions of where we should go with a day she was free. Bumped into her in the elevator with another female friend (lesbian) of mine later at lunch and she sees me, blushes, looks down at the ground in the elevator ‘hey’

And finally - we had a belated summer party. Same thing, kinda staring at me from afar. Comes over. And then I leave after a while telling her I had a date. I do the continental thing, give her a hug and kiss her on either cheek and she says...

‘Aren’t we kissing on the lips?’

Cue huge pause between us and tension and then she says ‘I’m kidding!’

I obviously really like her, but yes, like I say wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise her relationship (even though she hardly talks about this guy). What’s your take given everything I’ve said...?

I’m starting to get flustered around her and butterflyish",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pynrd2/i_m25_a_huge_crush_on_my_colleague_f22_but_she/
8,pyo0ki,1633021232,My bf (33M) ended things with me (33F). Do i have a chance to it or should I move on?,"My bf and I were together for 3 months. Since our first date, we spent almost every day together, talk on the phone for hours and hours, go on weekend trips, and we were just so integrated in each others lives. I was excited  because this was the first healthy relationship I was in since i got a divorce from ex (who mentally and emotionally abused me).

The last week, I’ve noticed a shift in my boyfriends energy towards me. When i asked him about it, he said that he was going through something personal (nothing to do with me)and he didn’t want to talk about it with me because talking about it just triggers him. 

He completely shut down. I tried to give him space but i was also hurting because it felt like he pushed me away. When i talked to him about it, he said that he likes me a lot, but he has a lot going on and can’t do this. I asked if we’re done and he said that he can’t do this. He asked me if he should contact me once he gets over whatever he’s going through. I said yes, i would be here.

He’s coming over on Saturday to drop something off. My friends are telling me to give him space and if he wants to come back he will.

I’m not sure if i should try to salvage this or move on.

Any advice would be appreciated,

10,pyo2dv,1633021372,Does this girl possibly like me?,"So this all started a few weeks ago. I was having a really bad day. School not going well. A lot of problems with my friends. Just generally bad, until a few good things happen to brighten up my say. One being her.

I was in my calculus class getting down notes, but class was ending soon and our professor was going to put down the smart board, blocking the notes. So I asked if I could take a picture of the notes quickly before she does so, which I try to do, except there's a problem that I forgot about. My phone was dead, so I couldn't. I realized this when I took it out and said ""Oh I guess I can't, my phones dead."" and the professor said okay and put down the smart board, and class was over.

I leave class, only to bump into her and she tells me she has the picture, which confuses me, but she clarifies it's for the notes from class because my phone was dead. I immediately thank her and we exchanged numbers so she could send me it. I thanked her again and told her she was amazing.

Soon after she asks me if we can study together, so we meet up on campus that weekend to go over the material. On my way there, she asks me if I want anything because she's getting coffee, which I decline but she insisted so I eventually told her the usual coffee I get and asked if she wanted me to pay her back, but she didn't want me to. I thanked her again for the coffee. We talked for a while initially before we got work done, but we got work done nonetheless.

We agree to meet up again the next weekend to work on homework together for a good few hours. When we're done she tells me to text her when I get home.

Yesterday, after class she ran up to me after I left to leave and we talked for a bit. She questioned me on why I couldn't go to the study group that day (the class made a study group because the material is getting difficult, and I told her I couldn't go that day). She told me she wouldn't go if I wasn't, which I questioned why, which she just responded that she prefers 1 on 1 or with tutors. I was also surprised to find she even remembered things I told her two weeks ago that I didn't even remember that I told her until she explained what it was. She asked me what I was doing for the weekend and said to let her know if I was free after I walked with her to her car.

So, with all that, I don't think she does and I don't want to jump to assumptions already. Does she like me, or is she just being really friendly?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyo2dv/does_this_girl_possibly_like_me/

Im M17

Last year of High School

I screwed up my days in lockdown. I never did any of my assignments in class during that time properly. I only did very little like 25%.

I started concentrating on my studies last month as entrance exams are approaching in the next 5 months.

When school reopened, I saw this girl in class. OMFG, she is sexy as hell. I wanna ask her out.   
However, since entrance exams are approaching, I decided to focus on the entrance exams as I had destroyed most of the course when it was happening online. I think the right thing to do is ask her out after the course ends. Even if she says yes, I won’t be able to concentrate on my grades if we are dating. Especially in my tight situation.

But, she keeps living rent free in my mind.

16,pyox8t,1633023909,My neighbor's new relationship habits have me wondering: How often weekly would you want to be around your partner?,"I've a newer neighbor who lives upstairs in my two-family house. He's in his late 20s, and at the end of August, he began seeing someone. How do I know this? Because, unfortunately, the ceilings are thin, and I can hear him and his gf doing everything from talking, walking around, to getting busy in the bedroom whenever she is over. 

I'm a bit older than them and work from home, so I've gotten a pretty good insight into how their relationship has progressed over the past month, and where it has ultimately landed is that one month into it, she's basically here all of the time and staying over at least 3-4 nights a week. If she isn't here, he's staying over there (If I can rant for a sec, I'll be honest that it sucks for me because having to deal with one neighbor's noise upstairs is plenty, but now it feels like I have two neighbors up there stirring around at all time, and she doesn't even technically live here. I had to let my landlord know because I was not able to sleep, and he was not happy. /rant.) 

It has gotten to the point where after staying overnight at his place, I am pretty sure he called out of work today from his job as a teacher, because he rolled back in around 9:30am, and then around noontime, she came over here. It's like they always need to be in each other's company, which to me seems like A LOT. Like, maybe unhealthily too attached this early on? But what do I know...

Out of curiosity, how often weekly would you expect to want to be around your partner, especially early on into a relationship? As someone with a job and adult responsibilities, I'd be cool with hanging out on weekends and doing something during the week. I wouldn't expect my partner to stay overnight on work nights either until things got further along.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyox8t/my_neighbors_new_relationship_habits_have_me/
17,pyoyy8,1633024052,Priorities...,"Okay so I’m (31m) not going to lie, dating has been pretty simple for me growing up so I never had the “scarcity” mindset when it comes to women. Now I KNOW women can be HIGHLY enticing. I personally have noticed in my own life how I have let myself get distracted by women. I mean even when I don’t try these women are aggressive. It’s because they see me as a hard worker a provider, a leader and I make OKAY money not even 6 figures yet🤦🏾‍♂️...I put my hand in my face because if I had really prioritized my resources and my drive to succeed instead of letting beauty and sex distract me, I would be way past 6 figures by now. And that’s a fact. And that in itself would put me in even better place for leading a household. Raising productive members of society. I see so many guys on here trying to figure out confidence. I have woken up in a hospital from a suicide attempt. Feeling like I’m the lowest of the low. But you know how that’s defeated? By actually achieving things! Even when I feel like I haven’t achieved enough. That makes me want to achieve more. The smallest things to you are gigantic to someone else. Volunteer, become a vital member of community. Get a skill and put it to work to become a provider. Mentor someone become a leader. Be men. Push forward. Find purpose.

The women will flock. But even then you don’t want to get distracted. Because it’s really levels to this if you haven’t noticed already. Maybe you gamers can understand if I put it in rpg terms....your can only fight the monsters (women) on lvl 5, lvl 1&amp;2 is just just the intro, 3&amp;4 training. Now you can go all the way up to lvl 8 with just training and you might slay a monster or 2 up the way🤷🏾‍♂️. But on each level there’s a Boss lvl monster with a mystery box. You don’t know what’s in it but the boss will tell you the world is in it. Everything you want! But the boss knows that if you take this box your going to be stuck on that level with them OR take them to the level they believe you are going!

Some of y’all want a monster on your side👀 especially those boss ones

Now don’t get me wrong I LOVE women so the monster thing is supposed to be funny ok...joke not a...well you know

I use this analogy because really think about the women we consider making bad decisions out here. Picking men that aren’t family ready...but how can y’all say you all are family ready?? If you haven’t learned how to lead a woman of mutual interest into a date? And if you don’t have mutual interest...why?

He's exactly my type, is an excellent planner and communicator, is intelligent and really understands my unique situation (late bloomer). We're also the same age and we're looking for the same things at this point. Our conversations are fun and flow really well too. 

Before him, I was dating a guy who was not my type, but objectively attractive, was three years younger than me, not that smart or emotionally intelligent, and who I could literally not even have a comfortable conversation with. We did get physically intimate pretty fast however (my depression/loneliness got the best of me), which is probably why I got attached. I thought he ghosted me which is why I started dating this other guy, but he just sent me this rejection text which has really shattered me. 

I'm not used to rejection since I just started dating a couple years ago and most guys will be optimistic about things growing/developing in my experience so they'll give it time. The thing is, I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere. I knew we weren't compatible, but seeing it written out was very painful, I'm ngl. 

Now I'm so afraid of ruining things with this new guy. He's totally different, but I'm afraid of getting physically intimate with him because I fear he'll leave. I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing.

19,pyp1iy,1633024268,I (28 F) completely by chance ran into a guy (30’s? M) I met last year but hadn’t seen since.,"My friend Christine from college got married last year. I went to her wedding by myself since right before she got married my ex and I had broken up. At her wedding she brought her brother Henry over to meet me. I think she was playing matchmaker. 

He was very nice and really handsome. Really he seemed like a great guy. We had a good time that night. He and I really vibed. It felt nice to have a guy who was so great be interested in me. But there was a problem. It was only a month since I had broken up with my ex. We’d been together for almost five years. That evening I actually laughed for the first time in a month.

So at the end of the night he asked me for my phone number. I told him that I was still getting over my breakup and I wasn’t looking to date but we could be friends. So he gave me his number and said to call him sometime. Well I never did call him.

My ex and I tried to reconcile. That only lasted about a month before we both realized it wasn’t going to work out. So I decided to basically give up dating for a while and just try to get over the end of my relationship.

But I would think about Henry from time to time. I really did have a nice time with him and he did seem like a really great guy. The timing of meeting him was just really bad. As the time passed though I figured he had forgotten about me and I thought it would be weird to call him suddenly. 

I remembered that he had told me he was a mail carrier. That plays into this because I swear I saw him yesterday. I was at work. I’m a veterinary technician. I was coming out of the back where our exam rooms are to ask get a file for a patient that was coming in and I saw the mailman walking out the front door.

I swear it was him! His back was to me but I caught a glimpse of his face as he turned to go out the door. He has a beard now but I’m sure it was him. I think the girl at the front desk caught me looking because she said “He’s really cute, isn’t he?” I said yeah he looked pretty good. I got my file and went back to work.

As I was leaving for the day I went back out front and asked the girl who works the front desk if she knew our mailman’s name. She said she didn’t because he had just started delivering to our clinic a couple weeks ago. She asked if I was going to ask him out and I told her no it’s just that I thought I recognized him from somewhere.

So today I asked my boss if she happened to know our mailman’s name. She said he said his name was Hank. So I figured it had to be him! Of course by then all the people at work knew what was up. There are three vets and three techs plus the girl who works the front desk. So they were all joking with me all morning about what mail man.

When the girl up front saw the mail truck come In the driveway she called me up front and I came out. It was him! He did a double take when he saw me and smiled right away so he definitely remembered me!

We talked real briefly and as he wakes out to his truck I walked with him and asked if he’d like to get a cup of coffee or some lunch sometime. He said sure he’d like to. He asked if I still had his number and I said yes and I gave him mine.

20,pyp66l,1633024669,How to date without the apps?,"I'm a 26F and I have been on online dating for YEARS. I had one good LTR from it, but overall it's just been a relatively disappointing experience. Most of the people on the apps I found are ethically non-monogamous, looking for a unicorn, or just don't really seem my type. I don't want to spend my life swiping away at people and putting them in a box hoping it works out. I hate the idea of making quick judgements, but that's kinda how the approach seems to be. Hinge wasn't too bad, but I just am tired of being on my phone so often. I used to take breaks a lot and had a time limit, but I just don't think online dating is working for me. 

Off online dating, I feel like the only way to really meet people is to go out socially with other friends. This is restrictive in some ways because what if my friends are busy? I'm not going to go to a bar alone hoping to find someone. That seems really unsafe to me. Eating out alone is something I'm comfortable with, and I still go to the movies alone a lot. It's definitely harder during the pandemic. I thankfully live in a city filled with mid 20 somethings, so there's plenty of single folx around. The only problem seems to be how to even achieve those interactions, especially when I am navigating this alone. I realized though that I rather be single out there doing things than going on a bunch of online dates. It's just challenging to find the fun things to do and ways to interact when you're by yourself. I think this sometimes works in my favor as it can show a lot of confidence, but I'm not sure how to even meet those people.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyp66l/how_to_date_without_the_apps/

She started asking me where I was from and my age (which was all on my dating profile to begin with, first red flag) and then she asked if i LIVED WITH MY PARENTS???. We both live in different countries THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. WHY WOULD YOU CARE ABOUT THAT? 
So i questioned her about that asking her why did she care about that if she lives in the UK 
And she pretty much instantly blocked me 
Lmao 
I feel like if i would have kept going she would have asked for my credit card info or shit. Besides, it felt more like an interview, she didn't seem friendly at all. She kept bombarding me with questions and no real conversation. 
Be wary people, don't just trust every single profile. I already blocked her as well, from WhatsApp and from the dating app. So let's just hope it stays like that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pypite/update_should_i_share_my_phone_number_with_a/

24,pypl7y,1633025899,(26F) here wondering what is going through this guys (30M) mind….,"(26F) I was talking to this guy (30M) for a couple months. He was pretty traditional and took me out on nice dates quite often. I hung out at his place a few times as well. He never tried to initiate even a kiss, but would compliment me. I never initiated, because honestly I was not there. It was weird, because I found him attractive and vice versa and we had amazing conversation. But it was almost like we were seeing how the friendship would go before we moved forward romantically. 

After a couple months I noticed he had no idea how to talk about his needs/how he is feeling. This is a deal breaker for me. Emotional intelligence is very important. So I ended it.

A month later he reaches back out and asks for us to try again. I told him we need to communicate better. He agreed. 

The first couple weeks were so fun, healthy and we ended up kissing. Then it went downhill immediately as he again was lacking communication and I am not going to act like your mother. So we mutually ended things again.

Now he is reaching back out. Why??? Our communication styles are clearly polar opposite. All we have shared is one kiss. And I’m way too high maintenance for it to just be a hookup. What does he want? Lol so confused by him!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pypl7y/26f_here_wondering_what_is_going_through_this/

Women are going to college at a significantly higher rate than men and are on track to become the top earners. This is a problem because women by and large refuse to mate with men who earn less than them. The already low birth rate is expected to plummet. Women want the best of both worlds. They want to earn more many than men but also date a man with more money than them. They are entitled and have set an unrealistic standard. There is now a huge crisis of angry, lonely, broke men who are going to lash out. Much of that anger will be taken out on the selfish evil animals we refer to as women. I feel nothing but apathy towards women who take their own lives, complain about loneliness, or have depression or struggle with dating.

Unfortunately, I can tell she’s already infatuated with me.  She’s very affectionate, and I find her touch intoxicating.

Should I message him first?","So, this guy I work with invited me to go to the club with him and the other coworkers. Primarily I went out bc of him, I grew an interested in him since the first few days of work and now just have a full-on crush. 

Anyways, he would come talk to me and what not and it was karaoke night and me and him and a few other people sang bohemian rhapsody. It was amazing. Also it was amazing bc I was drunk. 

Anyways, we go to an after party at a fellow coworkers house and in the car he puts his arm around me and asks if this is okay. I tell him that yes it is, as long as he knows I don’t sleep around like that. He said that wasn’t his goal and that he was just comfortable with me.

After the after party, we go back to one of the guy’s house and I tell him that I’m very interested in him but I want to take things slow. He said he’s totally fine with that because I am worth the wait. He wanted to kiss but I really can’t kiss somebody like that I need to be falling in love with them to haha. He then tells me he will ride an Uber with me home since he also drank a lot and he wants to make sure I get home safe. 

In the car we had amazing conversations and he told me that he had his eye on me since day 1 but wasn’t sure I would be into him and that’s why he didn’t make an advances until tonight bc I came out. He asked for my number since he had my snap but wanted to make it personal and told me he wanted to take me out on a date. Since we were both off tomorrow I suggested it but then apologized if that’s too fast and it wasn’t fast at all. But when he walked me to my door he said he will see me in 2 days when we work the same shift again. So I was kinda confused then. But he sent me a message after he left that he had a great time with me.

Fast forward to now, I haven’t got a message from him at all. I’m starting to think the high of the alcohol got to him and maybe he doesn’t feel what he said last night or if he feels that way about me and is waiting for a message of confirmation.

53,pyrgy8,1633031605,She called him selfish after they slept together,"My roomate (He just got out of a very serious  2 year relationship about 4 or 5 months ago. )

Yesterday he had a girl over. When they conversed about expectations, she expressed wanting a relationship. 

He expressed that he wasn't ready for a relationship because he is still making sure he heals from his last one. No she's interested in is something casual. 

Expectations were said out loud. 

Him and his lady friend wound up sleeping together. 

Apparently the next day she had a talk with him about wanting to move forward into a full fledged relationship. He reiterated what he said early on. 

She got angry, and claim that he was selfish for not wanting to pursue the relationship after they had sex. ----even though he stated from the beginning that a relationship wasn't an option for him right now. 

Here's the way I see it, two consenting adults decided to have sex. Two consenting adults gave and took sex. I'm so tired of the concept that some women try to push.... Which is: women give sex to men. That is simply not true and it places women in a disadvantageous position. When two people have sex, it is give and take on both parts. She's getting just as much pleasure and value out of it as he is. 

It is a better sign of empowerment to stated this way than to say it as if the man is some sort of Predator who takes sex while the woman is the gatekeeper that just so happens to give sex conditionally. 

I would also say it is manipulation for her think that because they had sex now he owes her something (a relationship). 

Now it would be a whole another thing if he had lied to her and let her have expectation under false pretense. But that's not what happened here. He was truthful. And she's still chose to move forward with the sexual experience. 

He literally called me after his shift to tell me, that she's mad now in a venting kind of way. I had to clarify to him that he doesn't owe her anything and that they're both adults who made a decision. Because it seemed that her brand of manipulation was starting to get very aggressive.

I always feel silly saying this, but I am one of the most honest people I know. No, I'm not a ""tell it like it is"" person who says stuff regardless of people's feelings. I just think there are very few situations where lying is worth it, even if it might benefit me. That being said, my massive deal breaker is lying. I just don't like liars, at all. 

Twice now I've caught people in white lies. One was a person I was attempting to set up a date with, but we had schedules that were literally opposites of eachother so I was going to suggest an early morning coffee date in-between classes (college). He then confesses he hasn't been in college for two years, despite his first message talking about what his major used to be but phrasing it as though he was actively in classes. He was the very first person I chatted with after my breakup, and I quit online dating for about a month after that. 

Second time was a guy who said he had only been on tinder for a week and it was his first time using it, but I know for a fact I matched with him previously but we never talked. It was such a silly, pointless lie. 

This is probably going to turn into a vent but literally what is the point of lying when trying to date?

67,pysngt,1633035202,I believe I have sexually assaulted my partner. What do I do now?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So, earlier this month, my partner and I (we had been seeing each other ""officially"" for a couple of weeks prior) were in bed doing what we usually do. I won't get into details, but on that day I took things a step further and motioned to start going down on them. They seemed fairly open to it, but the problem lies in the fact that I did not explicitly ask ""is this ok?"" or made any and all efforts to get verbal consent from them. After doing a lot of research after I realized what I did was wrong, I see that I was acting under the impression of ""implied consent,"" or assuming the presence of ""yes"" in the absence of ""no,"" which is not correct. They eventually outright asked me to stop and I did. Before then, they were saying things about being late to a concert that we went to later that day and I, unfortunately, took this extremely literally. I didn't realize this was a way for them to tell me that they were uncomfortable with the position I was putting them in, and so I continued because they were also saying things like ""that feels really good,"" and after all, that was the goal and reason why I initiated what I was doing. I took that as a form of ""yes,"" and in retrospect just because their body was saying yes it does not mean that they were necessarily comfortable mentally. If I ever had a shred of doubt that they were comfortable in the moment I would have stopped immediately, but I didn't when they were uncomfortable without my knowledge. So that means I was continuing my sexual advances despite the fact that they were not consenting, which I believe is the definition of sexual assault.

Another thing to mention is that we had discussions about boundaries regarding sex beforehand- they specifically said they didn't enjoy that particular thing when they tried it. Those were clear boundaries that I violated. While it was happening, that literally escaped my mind. I don't know why it happened and it's concerning that it did. I think I had been doing well to respect said boundaries the other times we were doing things of that nature, but that day was different and I still don't know why.

Things between us had been relatively okay until last week- we were still talking every day and hanging out all the time. Then, last week, I asked them if they wanted space and they said they'd like that. After talking to a friend it seems that they want nothing to do with me, including seeing me around at all. I've been writing a lot down and researching what it means to truly consent to a sexual act and I've recorded myself talking about my faults on quite a few occasions. I know this isn't enough and there likely isn't anything I can do to help heal the wounds I've created, but do you guys think there's anything else I should do? Should I avoid them right now or forever? The last thing I want to do is cause them any more pain.

TL;DR: I was initiating a sexual act without knowing that my partner was not consenting. Not sure how I can repair my relationship with them or if I can at all.

74,pytclh,1633037336,Missing contact,"
I'm struggling to not miss the messaging/f2f contact I had in a relationship. I think about them a lot. The last hard break up I had I was busy with work, there was a lockdown and we had no social media connection so was a bit easier. 

I miss our text chats which were more frequent at evening so I've tried leaving my phone in another room, concentrating on tv/reading but when I go to bed I can't stop seeing his face when I close my eyes and I end up upset.  I mostly wfh and I'm not particularly busy so I don't have people around me to distract or a lot to concentrate on as priority. 

I would normally go to the gym and I've signed up with a PT but I'm currently not well and have been told to avoid major activity for a week or so while I find out what's going on! And I've seen some craft classes and sports clubs to join. However as these are only potentially temporary, I don't want to feel empty again when they end. I try to avoid going on my social media because it seems everytime I go on he's online too, in a far higher amount than he ever was (trying not to overthink that as he talks to a female colleague on there and she's looking to end her relationship) and I've tried to mute all interactions. I miss making plans with him and I feel I'm trying extra hard to see friends even more to fill weekends. We agreed to try and be friends so I'm reluctant to do the full delete which is why I've tried to hide him on there. 

So basically does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this 'lonely' feeling, I don't have chats with friends that constantly have messages going on and I know I always get attached to a partner's communication (I avoided constant chats with this person to avoid this but I'm still at a loss). I know time is a great healer but should I just take on the limited time activities and hope by the end of them I don't even notice I haven't got someone to talk to? I am someone who has a lot going for them, I know that but ultimately I am one of those people who enjoys having a partner and would love someone to eventually think I offer enough to them so I do feel the loneliness more, daft I know!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pytclh/missing_contact/
75,pytcxf,1633037364,Should I continue talking to this guy?,"I, (21 F) matched with a guy (23 M) on hinge last Tuesday. We exchanged a few messages on the app and then he asked me for my phone number. I thought “why not?”, and gave it to him. About an hour after, he called me and left me a minute long voice mail since I did not answer. Basically he said he wanted to meet up for coffee and asked what my schedule looked like. We then played phone tag before finally speaking to each other and planning a date for Saturday. 

Saturday rolls around and I end up going to his house and we walk to get coffee. I thought it went really well, I could tell that he liked me right away and he called me absolutely beautiful. On the way back he said he wanted to get dinner this week and I said that would be fun. He showed me around his house and I stayed for about 30 minutes before heading out. Nothing happened, he just hugged me before I left and told me to send him my Snapchat. 

Once I got home he sent me a really nice text saying he had a great time, and we exchanged a few Snapchats that night before he sent me a goodnight text. The next day (Sunday) he called me twice, once during the day and once before bed to say goodnight. At this point I thought things were going really well, it seemed like he was fairly interested in me and we were talking a lot. 

Monday we didn’t get much of a chance to talk since we were both busy. Tuesday we didn’t talk at all. Wednesday we exchanged a few snapchat’s and that was about it. 

Now it’s Thursday and I was starting to think the problem might be on my end. Maybe he didn’t think I liked him? I decided to make it clear that I did, so I texted him this morning and said “Hey I just woke up, good morning! I wanted to say that I hope you have a great day at work and whatever else you have planned today. I hope I get to see you soon. :)”

I've been somewhat insecure in my life, though its getting much better, and the thought of dating or having relationships just havent been on my radar. Growing older I guess you learn to accept yourself and not care as much about your flaws, but I still get low sometimes when I get that familiar feeling of not managing to fully connect with people; whether it be telling inspiring stories or keeping up conversations confidently.

I matched with this girl a couple of weeks ago and did my best to come across funny and worth to meet.  She came across down to earth and easy going so eventually we planned a wine and dine date...which I just got home from.

To be honest, I'm just happy I did it. Every fiber of my being wanted to stay home and call it off because I didnt think I could keep her interested for 2 hours. Super nervous. I overcame this feeling under the knowledge that stepping out of your comfort zone is important.

I think it went good. She smiled and laughed a lot (very cute smile) but I wished I would have known what questions to ask which would have deepend the conversation about some topics, but that might be me being too hard on myself.

At the end of it I gave her a quick but intimate hug where we touched cheeks and I told her I enjoyed it and would be pleased to meet her again if she thinks the same, to which she replied gladly with ""I'm down"".

I think I'll send a little thankful and ""funny"" remark tomorrow and ask if shes free sometime soon in the future.

I made sure to give her atleast one flirty comment during the date aswell to make sure to stay away from any potential friend zone, lol.

So I currently TA for a course at a local college. Last semester was just like any other semester with the exception of this one girl, we'll call her Alicia. 

I've never developed feelings for my students albeit we're all around the same age (she's a year younger) and I try to bring a fun but professional demeanor to my stations. I'm a super talkative person and we're all usually chatty at my stations. Well, Alicia is also a really talkative person and we'd get to talking a lot about school stuff, personal things etc. Long story short, I fell for her and I fell HARD and it felt like that energy was reciprocated. After the semester was up, she was unable to finish and there was a possibility that she was coming back to finish up the final in the next semester, aka this one. I'm pretty much head over heels about her and I really, really regret not having asked her on the last day. 

She isn't my student at the moment so I thought I'd try to get in contact with her. No instagram, no facebook. She has a pretty unique name so her snapchat wasn't difficult to come across, I basically typed in the first 4 letters and it came up. I was gonna go for it but after some thinking I realized that if she were to come back it would certainly make things awkward if I was receiving signals she wasn't even giving,  so I didn't. Now I don't know where I stand. I Feel like waiting until the end of this semester is far too long but also doing it right now might put her in an uncomfortable position. This isn't a core class for her major or anything so there's no guarantee she will be back. For context I haven't seen her in about 3 - 4 weeks.

86,pyu5f3,1633039843,Self improvement only works if you are a woman or a man born with certain physical traits. Otherwise just do it because you want to and because you want a better life outside of dating.,"For the majority of women, if you get your body fat down to &lt;30% and BMI to 19-22, you are almost guaranteed an avalanche of men trying to date you. You can tell me how much you hate that, but it's really the truth. It's a simple proven way to get more interest on average (and likely be more physically healthy in the process if you do it properly).

For men, there is no similar guaranteed pathway to getting matches or improvement with women. 

Unless you have exceptional genetics or use steroids, you won't look like Thor or a Men's Health magazine cover model even if you work out a lot. I've gotten down to my top 4 abs and there is no change in my results.

Plastic surgery can only change your face so much. I've had it and still no change in results.

Photos can only do so much. I've got a $3K camera and have spent days of my life taking photos. I've got exotic photos from trips all over the world doing exciting things. No benefit.

Bio doesn't matter in scientific dating studies, and I've had other people write my bio completely with no change.

Everyone told me when I was wealthy or successful things would change. I'm making above top 1% income though for years now and it makes no difference.

People say if you learn pickup or social skills it will change everything, but I spent years studying those and while it helps me in my day to day life and job, it doesn't change a woman's reaction to your appearance. I have lots of friends of both genders and have always been popular but can't get any matches online or conversations in bars/clubs.

The bottom line is if you want to self improve, then do it. But if you're a man who wasn't born with the right genetic physical traits, don't do it because you're expecting anything to change with women. Do it because you want to.

As an example, when I was a teenager, video games were still ""just for nerds."" Everyone told me to quit playing video games if I wanted women to like me and pick up cooler hobbies. So I did. I don't regret it really, but I think about it a lot. All the other hobbies I picked up allowed me to do neat things and I enjoyed them. But none of them have ever mattered in the slightest to any woman I've met. That advice changed who I was fundamentally and my entire adult pathway, but it didn't change anything with women because they didn't care about my hobbies either way.

My point is changing yourself for a goal is worthwhile if it will work. Otherwise, if it won't make any difference, then just be you and forget about the goal. Or if you want to change, just do it for yourself. Women likely won't care about any of these things.

The concept of ""self improving to get women"" is just going to undermine or alter your sense of self and identity and it likely won't make any difference to women in the end. So either be true to yourself as you are, or change because you want to. That's all there is to it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyu5f3/self_improvement_only_works_if_you_are_a_woman_or/
