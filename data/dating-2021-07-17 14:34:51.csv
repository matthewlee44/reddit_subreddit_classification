0,omb4xy,1626550752,Got jock itch on my penis from a girl with a yeast infection. Was starting to date a new girl but now I don't know what to do.,"I had sex a week ago and the next day she told me she thinks she has a yeast infection. That she gets them kind of easily and she got some medicine and was already feeling better. A couple days later I did notice a slight red rash on my penis shift. Not the head or any kind of discharge associated with it. The rash doesn't have any kind of pustules like herpes would. Went and got tested and to have a doc check it. He was confident it wasn't herpes, just that I got jock itch from her. Now though, I randomly hooked up with this other woman. She is a fucking unicorn, I don't know what to do, don't want to blow this. I'm praying to the gods this rash fades and I just don't have to deal with it but she is very sexual and I think she might notice it tomorrow when we see eachother. Should I cancel our date?

She told me 4 times on the date that modern women give their bodies very easily to men and she doesn't like doing that. She also told me desperate men make moves on women  when women aren't yet comfortable with them. It was going very well. We went for a walk and had dinner.. We ended the date at midnight and I walked her to her car. She told me that she had to pee. I told her that my place is really close and would be better to go there instead of looking for places with open washrooms (we still have a covid related lockdown). She agreed.  
She came to my place and we ended up talking for a couple of hours.  I touched her a little on her hands, put my arm around her and held her hand..  I didn't make any move because of what she said - other than just putting my arms around her shoulder..  I was enjoying her company and didn't want  to mess things up...  


She then heads back home and replies that it won't work out because I didn't make a move on her. I mean WTF?.. I mean, I would have understood if she had told me that I should not have put my arm around her and that's why she didn't want to continue dating me...

18,omdk2c,1626558626,I said “hello” as a first message to her and now we’re planning a date/meetup,"So I’m 23M and I’ve been on and off apps for about 3 years now after I had my heartbroken by someone who I thought I was going to marry. Throughout all that time, I’ve tried my hardest to send first messages the way women’s prompts ask me to. It almost always ends with them ignoring me or giving me 1-3 word replies to the point where I can’t carry a conversation.

I’ve also been subject to male scammers attempting to scam money out of me by pretending to be girls. And then there’s been people who have just wanted to sell me nudes or get me to follow their insta.

This accumulating for years has made me really tired and honestly giving up on OLD and just dating in general. So I’ve just started messaging people with 1-3 word messages for the hell of it. Well, this woman (early 30s) responded to my hello and took control of the first part of the conversation. She started off by complimenting *me* which caught me completely off guard and started talking about things *i like* which also caught me really off guard in a good way.

Anyways after a few days of talking, we’ve been discussing when would be a good time to meet up between our schedules and it makes me happy about this meetup. She’s made it clear that she really only wants to hook up because she has no time for dating and honestly I’m fine with that. I’m just happy to have met someone like her.

So I guess the 3 reasons why I’m posting this to a bunch of strangers is this:

1) Shy girls or girls who don’t think they can do anything with some opening message, don’t be afraid to look over his profile and try to take over the beginning of the conversation there and see if he’s worth talking to. *Sometimes* guys start off with short first messages because they’re unsure if they’ll get a response and they’ve probably dealt with rejection for years and just have ran out of hope/energy to keep putting in the same effort at first.

2) Guys, if the aforementioned has happened to you, keep trying. I know you’re tired and hopeless but you might find someone who’s just as understanding. Also, don’t be rude or salty to women. You just have to pick yourself up and keep moving.

3) I’ve really got no one to talk about this to so I just wanted to get this off my chest that I’m feeling pretty happy right now.

I thought from the start we were on the same page, she initiated the what are you looking for chat and we both said a relationship, even though she was going back to university in september for her final year. After the third date she mentioned she was going on holiday with her friends for a month. This worried me bcos of the length at search an early stage, so I asked what she thinks happens between us then. She was happy to continue things, and even mentioned me maybe meeting up towards the end of her travels. After this date she even brought up us being exclusive, to which I happily agreed.

We have gone on multiple dates since and they were all great. Our last date just gone was also good, but i sensed underlying tension of something on her mind. So at the end of the date I said I'd like to see her a few more times before she goes away in a week. Then I asked what happens when she goes away again, she didn't really answer, which I then responded with, 'do you want to leave things here then?'. I said I really like her and would be happy to give things a shot, to which she said she needed to think about things. 

I have since messaged her the day later restating my position on us, and that despite distance, I really like her and want to give things a shot.

We got together just before COVID started and met through a friendship group when we were both 17/18. Due to lockdown restrictions we decided to stay together at her house with her family. Now that restrictions are easing, it has become apparent that she suffers from severe separation anxiety when I’m apart from her (which is very little). This also isn’t helped by the fact she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression early in the relationship.

I’ve been very patient and caring towards helping her go through this rough journey (I’ve been told by her parents that I’ve helped a lot) but after a year it gets overwhelming. There are times when she’s going through a panic attack where she says she wants to break up or doesn’t love me which really hurt me. As she goes through this I feel less of an equal in the relationship and just a helper so my feelings are pushed aside.

But when she’s not in that state she can be really kind, caring and I really do love her. It’s just hard to deal with, especially when you can barley get anytime to yourself (due to her separation anxiety)

The worst part about if I was to break up with her is that she’s said on multiple times “You’re the only thing I care about” or “she doesn’t know what she’d do without me” and stuff basically saying if we broke she’d kill herself (I’m 99% she would). This puts a lot of pressure on me and causes the relationship to become toxic.

30,omf71a,1626564755,Am I crazy?,"I’ll start off by admitting that I’m quite insecure and shy at times. So, I’m curious to see how you all dissect this recent interaction. Am I hopeless? Should I just give up and get used to being alone? 

So, there’s this really attractive girl who works at a store that I frequent every so often; we would often lock eyes and I can certainly feel the connection….Before you roast me, I’m not an absolute psychopath— I’m well aware that not every girl you lock eyes with wants to date you… lol but THIS… This was real! Lol I can feel the tension and I’m almost certain that my perception of this scenario was 100% valid. Either way, being lame and awkward, I never really built up the courage to continue conversation outside of her work. 

Anyway, today was the first time I’ve been to the store in about a year. When I went back in, I was coming down the aisle and bumped into her. She didn’t say anything and was giving me that same “vibe”. So, I said “hey”. She said “hello”, but didn’t give any indication that she remembered me…. I don’t believe that I’m a memorable guy and can safely assume that she’s seen thousands of men since the last time I saw her… 

So, my question is— based on what I described, do you believe that she just puts herself out there a lot? Or am I “special” and she remembers me? Lol the reason I ask is because if she casually “eye-bones” every dude who goes in the store, then I don’t want to pursue her. In the unlikely scenario that I’m special, then I want her to be my wife. 🤣 

Since this interaction today, I can’t get her out of my head…. So, I just want to know your thoughts on this? Am I a jerk for thinking this way? Am I crazy?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omf71a/am_i_crazy/

32,omf8kp,1626564916,Constantly failing is really tiring,"I swear I've tried to get myself out there. I'm meeting people, I use dating apps, I go to social events

But fuck, man, it's just constant failure.

One girl I've had a pretty good thing going until she started calling me friend and basically ""friend zoning"" me, as much as I hate that word. I had been pretty clear about my attraction to her so this was just her nice way of rejecting me. No hard feelings

Then another girl I talked with and asked out. She said no because she was out of a relationship, but maybe she'd come back in a few months with a changed mind. She probably won't

Then there is another one that I matched with. I don't get a lot of matches, and I try to avoid putting too much stock into them, but this one in particular was a girl that is 100% my type, and a person I actually know (through mutual acquaintances) is very cool. Since the match was on Bumble, she had to message first. She didn't. She had her Instagram on her bio so I tried there. No response

Another one asked ME out after we had some very nice conversations and then just stopped responding. When I asked her what was up a week later she told me she was talking with her ex girlfriend again. Hasn't said anything since

This was just in the last 3 months

Another girl I matched with, we were both in the same place for a day, and conversation was going well. I asked her to go for a beach walk (middle of the day, very public beach) and she said she couldn't because her parents would mock her (???). She's 21 years old by the way

It's not really about the rejection. I've learned to handle the rejection part and don't hold it against them. But to just keep trying and failing is incredibly demoralizing. It's come to a point where I feel more dread than excitement when I meet someone new. I'm usually just waiting to see what bullshit is about to happen

And of course, I could take a break from dating, but I already have. I've been single for about 18 months after a really shitty and borderline abusive  relationship, and I did all the work to pull myself together

It's been an up and down journey with dating so far for me, I'd say there have been more lows than highs. But the one thing is that I have done is rely too much on dating apps. This week, I deleted them all and will do my best to stay off them for good.

The truth is, I have been rejecting myself this whole time. I have not taken any time to step back, look at myself and ask: ""Would I want to date me?"" 

I've never been told I'm horrible, but that's not my point. I guess I never asked myself how I come off to other people and it dawned on me recently. Right now I am probably one of the least confident people anyone would know. That has to change. 

The idea of a hookup has 0 interest to me and I will always maintain that. I don't judge the concept, it simply is just not for me. I am a very emotional man and that would not be suitable for me. 

I have hung onto the fact that I'm still a virgin and just want to have someone there, when you see your mates with partners around you, it really makes everything seem so lonely. 

What matters is me finding the ability to be happy with me, myself. For a while, dating needs to take a backseat in my life. 

When the time comes, I want to meet the right woman in person and have a truly romantic story-like experience. 

To my fellow people in the same position as me, our time will come but let's work to be better people and see the results :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omfcbe/ive_rejected_myself_for_too_long_so_its_time_to/
35,omfctp,1626565366,"I have a crush on my best friend, I'm not sure what to do next","Me (17F) and my best friend (17M) have known each other since 7th grade. We both have now graduated high school, and are both turning 18 soon. We've been really good friends the whole time (over 5 1/2 years), but over this past year and especially the past few months, I have developed a crush on him.

The problem is, I have never had a real crush before, and never dated anyone. I have no idea how to move forward with these feelings, or if I even should. I can't tell if he likes me in the same way, as I'm unable to pick up the difference between platonic or romantic cues unless they're really obvious.

The main thing I'm completely unsure of is sharing how I feel. Do I explain my feelings? Ask him out? Is it something I should just bring up with no pretext, or should I try to steer the conversation a certain way beforehand? I know if I want to move forward with this, it's a conversation I need to have- I'm just very lost on how to do it. Showing my emotions has always been hard for me, and with the added uncertainty of everything, it's been even harder to figure out.

I’m really frustrated because there have been five friendships with guys I’ve had over the past few years that ended up in the dissolution of our friendship. In some of these instances, I didn’t even hang out with the guy 1:1 but rather with mutual friends, and made it clear that I wasn’t ever going to date.

Looking at the list I was wondering how common the “requirements” it contains are and decided to share it here. If you wish  read through it and leave your thoughts on this list or your version of it in the comments. 
The items are in the order in which they came to my mind, so kinda in order of importance but not necessarily. Here is the list:

* Smart (ideally like me or more), not necessarily academically speaking but rather in a more general sense
* Not afraid to speak her mind
* Honest
* Trustworthy 
* Strong character, challenging at times
* Able to open up and share stuff
* Wanting to have a close relationship and work for it (e.g., making sacrifices, being there when needed), but also not clingy
* Idealist but realist at the same time (willing to follow her core beliefs while keeping her feet on the ground
* Capable and eager to get into deep conversations on a wide array of topics (news, existential issues, …)
* With common interests (e.g., snowboarding, mountains, music)
* Other interests to introduce to me and in part share
* Able to deal with my “dark” parts and help me become a better person, and stimulate me constantly
* Cute (duh)
* Similar view of the world but not exactly the same
* Able to handle arguments, misunderstandings or the like in a mature way
* Communicative
* No toxic behaviours
* Aligned values
* Kind other people and ready to help them, able to put herself in their shoes, but not a fool/naive 
* Willing to be physical 
* Funny and able to tease in a clever way, have great comebacks and so",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omfwj0/i_made_a_checklist_with_the_things_id_like_in_a/

She texted me the next day and from there she called me and we started talking. Once we started talking we went into a video chat. When I asked her what she likes on a first date she said to get to know the person then I asked what she likes in the scenary on the first date and possibly after the date and winked then she cut the video chat. I tried to reach her but it appears she blocked my number. So I tried to reach her on our family phone and it went through but she didn’t pick.

I was kinda confused cus the date was amazing and both of them seemed to had a good time, yet the person got rejected cus there’s no “spark”? The concept of “the spark” seems to be something really sketchy to me.

As a dating novice I’m gonna throw out my questions: What exactly is “the spark”? How do you know there’s a spark going on? I’m guessing it’s the chemistry between two person, but I thought that’s something that takes time to build up?

50,omgwyv,1626571448,My situation with “giving them space.” What does it really mean?,"Met this girl last fall, we were roommates and nothing ever happened when we lived together. Not once. But i can whole heartedly say we have always felt an attraction between us. However, she did have a boyfriend that entire school year. And he was clearly not a good guy for her, it didn’t work out at all but they did manage to get 10 months out of the relationship before it was over. 

After their breakup, we talked and spent a lot of time getting to know each other. It turns out that we click. Completely. She ended up telling her family and friends about me, and it looked like maybe something might happen. I was extremely excited for this girl.

But then, it just stopped. She said we needed to slow down, it felt like TOO MUCH of a relationship to her. We never really did anything over the top. We kissed a few times and held hands. That was it. 

And then she said she wanted space. She didn’t know what she wanted. I said okay, and since then i have given her what she’s wanted. Since i didn’t know how she was feeling or what i should be doing, i just asked her… “are we still this thing for now?”

She replied, 

“If I’m just being honest, i think we should just be friends from here on out. We’re just not on the same level and i just realized i JUST got out of a relationship and I’m now realizing where my heads at with that. I just want us to be friends.”

Clearly this isn’t about me but she’s not over her ex. And i know for a fact they aren’t seeing each other. So what the hell should i be doing? I’d love to wait on her because she’s only been out of this relationship she had for only a couple of months. But she said friends from here on out? I don’t get it. She was really into me. But it seems she’s still more into her ex.

Have you guys ever been in a weird situation like this?

We met through a mutual friend ( not a close one ) I knew from high school. I was looking for place to live and he needed a roommate. My friend gave me his information and we begin texting. Right way we click but keep it friendly with some light flirting. So a couple weeks go by of hour long Face-times about nothing and everything. We decided after a week I’d move in after my job transfer went through. At the end of three weeks I pack up and move 2 hours from my friends and family. I was excited and ready to be on my own again. I had moved out when I was 18 I had a 2 year lease that I just gotten out of I know longer wanted to stay in that area, so I moved back in with my parents waiting to find a new one. So fast forward two weeks in we eat dinner together play video games go get dinner ect. I genuinely enjoy my time with him. At this point I could tell that I was starting to actually like this guy. So I told him I don’t know what to do because I actually think I kind of like you and I’m interested in you. He responded saying he felt the same way and wanted to talk. So we are now being more upfront and flirting constantly. A few kisses and hugs. Then a couple weeks after that we have seggs . I’m comfortable around him and with him. However, The first couple weeks we were talking before we did the do he still had tinder and had gotten a notification in front of me. Yes I looked over. sue me. When I asked why he still had tinder he said he just had forgotten to delete it and he didn’t touch it. I let that go but his behaviors on his phone are SUSPICIOUS.  If I walk up while he’s on it he will immediately turn off his screen. He does not open Snapchat Facebook messenger or Twitter in front of me. I’ve told him I think it looks weird when he does stuff like that, and he said it’s just to show me his full attention. And as for him not getting on those apps “I just don’t look when he’s on them. “ I feel like asking to go through his phone is a breach of privacy and I want to trust him it just makes me question I suppose. He doesn’t show affection I’m not talking PDA I’m talking behind closed doors. Aside from the first time we had sex he has yet to initiate it again. Every time we’ve had it after it’s been me. There’s been quite a few times that he said he doesn’t want to for various reasons and I can’t help but feel rejected. He doesn’t call me beautiful pretty or complement me really at all and it just makes me feel like he doesn’t really have physical interest in me as a person. I’m not trying to be conceited but I’m not exactly unattractive. Ive never had a partner so such little interest in me. Am I overthinking or is he just not into me ?

We talk to each other a lot about personal stuff, she trust me and I trust her. She had a boyfriend so i never asked her out on a date or let her know I have a crush on her due to respect for her relationship.
She and her boyfriend broke up last year December due to him cheating on her, which she told me. So I asked her when she will start back dating again and she told me she needs time.
So now we are in July and I decided to ask her out on a date and let her know that I have a crush on her via text (because am shy in asking girls out on dates). She replied me back saying that she don't mind going out with me but it wouldn't be a date.  
Even though she rejected going on a date, I will still remain friends with her and she will to me as well.

I only asked because we meet on the physics deadline which was the hardest deadline ever, I will never forgot the 20th of March and we were also doing the final phsycis exam seemed like an appropriate question. And she said I don’t remember because we have never been on a first date, and the way she said it, it seemed like she wanted me to ask her to one. She said it so softly as well and didn’t even give any dirty looks. Then I told her that wasn’t what I meant. I don’t understand how you misunderstand that question that badly it felt like she forced it to go in that direction. I was even shocked and went silence for like 5 seconds. I was speechless. Also I wanted to ask her out as a follow up  question but we were in the middle of another  exam it wasn’t the appropriate place to do that. 

I’m going to ask her out after summer break anyway  I’m just wondering if you guys think she took the conversation there  on purpose or if it was a general misunderstanding?

He’s supposed to stay in my city until the next semester starts, but he gotta go back to his city which is 3 hours away from mine, for his shadowing. When we saw each other for the first time after he went back, i was really happy and excited. I thought he was gonna ask me to be his gf since we had talked about this a few days before. However i waited and waited and grew impatient. After our first passionate kiss, i stupidly asked him when he’s gonna ask me to be his gf. He then proceeded to ask me to be his gf and i said yes. As time flew by, i felt kinda off. I felt like i was forcing him into a relationship with me and was scared that he’d leave me (due to past traumas from my previous relationship). I told him maybe we should slow it down but ensured him my feeling for him has never changed. I told him to ask me when he’s ready in which he agreed. As more time went by we tried to communicate as much as possible. We fell asleep while on call. We both called and texted each other when we’re drunk. One day while on call, he asked me to be his gf again. This time since he initiated the question, i thought he’s ready to be in a relationship with me so i happily said yes. Strangely some more time went by, we texted and called each other less. I tried to spend as much time with him as possible but he’s busy with his friends and exams. I felt neglected but didn’t want to come off as clingy so I asked how much communication/how often should we contact each other is comfortable for him. But oh boi he had something else for me, he apologized to me and said we should become friends again. “The problem isnt you, it’s me.” “Im not in a right place to love you right now.” Those words he sent that made me paralyzed and numb. I wanted to cry but no tear was able to come out. He suggested to stay friends and we could see where it would go. This time i wasn’t ensured if there is even a future for us. I agreed to start over as friends but i doubt he’d put in the effort in maintaining our friendship and everything has become so awkward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omib05/the_problem_isnt_you_its_me/
71,omie4a,1626577451,My crush words contradicted her actions,"I remember one day we meet up, she said she was going to come dressed up buggy  tomorrow because she won’t have much sleep so she won’t have any time to fix her self in the morning and I told her it was fine and she said why are you saying it’s fine I don’t dress up to impress you.  This hurt me bad not because it’s my crush saying it it was because of the look she give me she looked at me in disgust like I’m someone not worth dressing up for. She looked at me like I was trash. It hurt me so bad on the inside not because it’s my crush if any girl said that to me it would still hurt the same. 


A few weeks later it was just me and her in my accommodation working on an exam together and she was constantly fixing her self makeup, eyelashes and even said she’s going to the toilet to find a mirror to fix her hair. It seems like such a contradiction I thought you didn’t dress for me so why are you fixing yourself so much when it’s just me and you? 

She always gets overly excited over my complaints I even had her blushing one time just from saying a simple I miss you, she even said she don’t know to response at times to my compliments. She always plays with her hair around me and fixes her makeup. She looks at the ground after I compliment her.

Every single person I'm ever interested in, I find out they're already taken, and every single person I ever ask out is just ""not interested in dating atm"". While I get that, it kinda gets pretty frustrating (hence the reason I'm venting).

It almost feels like I set myself up for failure by somehow picking the people who for one reason or another will not date me. Added to that, all of my best friends are getting into relationships. While I'm happy for them, it basically just means they'll spend less and less time with me, and I've just felt really lonely coz of that recently.

As a sidenote, I'm extremely social, and I thrive on social interaction, so when my friends spend less time with me, it kinda leaves me with less energy in a way.

73,omisby,1626579047,Scared of my inexperience,"I'm 26m, and fairly attractive and charasmatic person I think. As a teenager till I was about 22 I had an extreme fear of people and touching, and steered well away from relationships. I met a girl who was here for a visiting my country for a few months and made friends with her and texted her afterwards when she left. I fell in love with her and she was always trying to get me to visit her but I let my anxiety control me and always found ways to avoid it, cause I was scared of sex, and the possibility of a relationship. Anyways she moved on from me and now has a boyfriend. 

I want to move past my anxiety and now a part of it is that I'm afraid of my inexperience without any good reason like being very religious or something. I managed to go on my first in person date this week set up via bumble but I think instinctually I steered it towards being more friendly and less flirty. 

I sortof feel like I need to get over my fear and lose my virginity and kiss someone but even with this girl I was in love with I basically sabatoged every opportunity for this. I have tinder and bumble downloaded and many have asked me on dates but idk if this is the best way. Maybe I should go to a club and use alcohol as a helper? Generally I hate drinking cause I get terrible hangovers that last several days.

Part of it I guess is I'm afraid of revealing my inexperience to other people cause then I feel like I have to talk about my mental health problems.

I (19F) live with my parents, so he’ll be meeting them but this doesn’t seem to bother him at all (which is great, I really enjoy his company and would love him to meet them). He also says he really wants to see the renovations to our house (we had an addition put on). 

We haven’t been intimate/had the exclusivity talk yet but I plan on bringing the latter up when he’s over, as he’s leaving for school up north in September and will be over 800 miles away from our area (it’s his last year).

77,omj786,1626580802,"Flirt, date, meet someone new, repeat (until you finally end up with the right ‘one’)","In my own fucking opinion and for the majority of the time, it’s always the girls who ended up being anxious and worried sick if the guy does not respond or turned out not liking her after the first date. And this is completely normal! 

Women tend to be more emotional and romantically attached (even if we don’t want to admit it bluntly) especially after long conversations and flirting with that single person. And I’ve been the same before. 

But then I asked myself, why do I have to feel bad, or overthink when I am not even involved with the person, nor in love in the very first place? Sometimes, it’s just the attention and the ‘getting used to’ that we are afraid to lose, but not the person itself. For most part, (again, in my opinion), the feeling of being ‘not too beautiful enough’ or ‘am I not girlfriend material’ usually lingers in our head, resulting to self doubt and insecurities. 

So with that, I really think that girls should avoid focusing on one person alone. Continue to date and flirt even if you have that one constant person. Don’t box yourself, but rather look for other possibilities. If the time comes that both person finally decide to take it more seriously, then that’s the time to stop. Otherwise, select and select until you finally land that right one.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omj786/flirt_date_meet_someone_new_repeat_until_you/

81,omjijw,1626582126,Blowing off Bittersweet Steam,"I’ve (28F) been seeing this guy (28) for the past 2 months until now. 

He’s been an extremely kind and considerate boyfriend. Very funny and responsible. Very simple and practical as well. He got notice of a promotion that would have required him to move across the country. Eventually, he asked me to move with him, and eventually, I said yes.

My reasoning: I have a full time job that i love. I love my state/area. But if someone as reliable as him wants me this much and is serious about me, then I’m willing to take the chance with them. I value relationships very much, and although I love my job, there are a lot more opportunities for another…and if it didn’t work out between us, at least I won’t be married and can move forward as I please.

So i resigned from my job and let my landlord know that I’ll be moving soon. (A very nice space for much less than everything else out here, in other words, in high demand). However, miscommunication got the best of us, and right now he’s finally admitting that it was because of his stubborness and pride. All this caused me to feel unsafe in our relationship (he ignored me alot due to his conflict avoidant nature). I became fearful of being dependent on him until i was able to get myself a solid job. 

Usually a reliable person, until he was ignoring me the day i needed to move out my place and move into his (at the end of the month, so that i didn’t have to pay another month of rent). We were upset with each other from the day before, and the way he handled it was far out of proportion to the situation: Me becoming insecure and triggered by some unfunny jokes he believed was funny, and me deciding to spend the rest of the evening alone in my place. Btw, i sent him a text an hour later explaining that i was sorry for how i handled it and left it at that cause i knew he wouldnt respond anyway.

So the day after the incident, i needed to move out the place, and he never picked up my calls or answered my messages. Blatantly ignoring me and this is someone who always has their phone in their hand. I refused to remind him or tell him via text that i need to move out now and to respond to me, because i refuse to believe that I’ll only get his attention if he knows im in a desparate situation. This is somebody im going to have to be dependent on for a while and i dont ever plan on begging or convincing them to put the shit aside for a minute and be present. In his defense, he didn’t know that I would have been moving out that exact day because of my landlord’s quick change of plans which i agreed to, but he would have known if he wasn’t ignoring me.

I called my landlord and begged to stay…(he was gonna collect the new tenant’s security deposit the same day). I don’t know how, but he agreed to let me continue my tenancy. A miracle to me in the moment. I ended up asking my boss if i can rescind my resignation but it was too late. But miraculously a week later, they opened up a new full time position in my department and a raise. The word blessing is an understatement.

I have these things back and i told him im not going with him anymore. I let him know what his neglect caused me to do. He’s terribly sorry and promises to work on his faults. Before all of this, he had bought me a ring without my knowledge until now. He always said he wanted to marry me. He told me today that doesn’t want me to pay rent and struggle with bills. He just got cold feet when he saw how aggressive I can become…(when I’m TRYINGGG to talk to him but he can’t stick to the issue or he’s clearly taking the issue or concern for a joke…i raise my voice, even slammed my phone on the table once). But i actively and intentionally minded my patience and tone after that, which is more than i can say for him who has never even acknowledged his faults til now.

I know I’m doing the right thing for myself by staying where I am and keeping my job, but I’m so sad that things happened the way they did between us and now it’s too late for him to redeem himself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omjijw/blowing_off_bittersweet_steam/

83,omjqpr,1626583095,I need advice: I (35f) am not very sure what his (34M) feelings to me are,"We dated a couple of months and were a couple three years ago, and then he went on a company vacation abroad for two weeks without contacting me. After he came back, I broke up with him. He was quite upset. Later we lost connection. I never forgot about him because I really liked him. We were both very shy at that time though. Weeks ago, I got his number again and contacted him. We are both single, so we agreed to get back together, although he will be away again for almost four months in the fall and winter for his travelling and vacation stuff. We’ve seen each other twice so far and I stayed in his place for two nights and one day every time. Like before, he took care of me very well. He prepared foods, cooked, did all the cleaning up while I just sat down and relaxed, bought me snacks, washed fruits for me now and then, dressed me in his clothes when he thought that I was cold, and when we went shopping for groceries or walked in the neighbourhood or go shopping groceries, he often teases me or squeezes me off to the grass like a kid. One thing that surprised me is he very naturally picked some food I leftover on my plate and ate it (that food is buried in a bunch of bones). At that time, I felt that he is really comfortable with me. Not to mention, cuddling and sex were very good. He was very affectionate and passionate. Three years ago, we didn’t have so much time to be together, so in my impression, he wasn’t that relaxed before. But the same thing is that he is still a very reserved person. He doesn’t express that how he feels or how much he likes me. When I asked him how he thought about us, he said that he wanted to do it step by step. He showed me his younger photos but didn’t want to send them to me now. He told me that he would do it eventually at one point. Also, he told me that he would only share his early life experiences at some point and he never shared those things with anybody (I understand it could be a sensitive issue for someone, but I don’t expect he is so concerned with people’s judgement). He said because I spied on him so I knew it, but nobody else ever knew that except his boss; however, what I did was that I just googled him three years ago, which made him upset at me. Also, he told me that he has some friends but no best friends, no female friends because he doesn’t believe men and women can be real friends, also he doesn’t date anyone from work or his client. Also, when we separate, he doesn't text much. One or two messages before bedtime. When I stayed with him, he rarely looked at his cellphone. He has no social medias. I always know he is a very private person and sometimes a loner, but I’m very attracted to him lol. I have the patience to wait for him while he is away if he really likes me. I just don’t know how much he really likes me, and it’s a question that I don’t have the courage to ask him yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omjqpr/i_need_advice_i_35f_am_not_very_sure_what_his_34m/

We’ve never even hung out in person one on one before).

95,omkow9,1626587409,Should I feel bad about this situation?,"I matched with this guy on a dating app and we mostly did dirty talk for 2 weeks, arranged to have sex, but I backed out and he got mad. Instead of saying we could do something else, since the pressure of sex after 2 weeks is what made me back away, he said he was going to a event and didn't invite me to go. I rolled over put all the blame on myself and didn't criticize him for how he made me feel. Talked for like a week after that and he asked in a round about way if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I said I would say yes. But the next day when I asked for clarification he said he was super drunk that night and didn't re-ask me when he was sober. He didnt text or call for 3 days after that is when I started talking more to a more compatible guy from the dating app and this time I could get a better start on a relationship. 

He called late at night on the third day but I just texted hey how u been like 2 days later. He texts a day letter saying good u. 

Well the new guy asked me to be exclusive (while he was sober) so I said yes. The first guy and I hadn't talked for 10 days at that point and the first guy is mad. But like we weren't in a committed relationship is went from casual to FWB to friends to maybe casual?

Am I in the wrong? I don't think.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omkow9/should_i_feel_bad_about_this_situation/
96,omkp5g,1626587444,"Bad communicator, or just not that into me?","I met this girl on a dating app about two weeks ago. Her profile checked all the boxes of what I think I want, and so I sent her a message. 

Initial conversation was a bit slow - I was definitely steering the conversation, but again, she seemed to be just what I'm looking for and was responding positively, if not very quickly. I didn't think too much about it - I was still a stranger after all, and she has a good career that is notorious for long hours and stress. 

I asked her out the following Saturday night to a place that I knew we would both like that had only just reopened. She said yes, and sounded enthusiastic about it. I got there early and she got there about 10 minutes late. Not ideal, but like half my dates are late to meet, so again I didn't read into it too much.

We go inside, and it seems like she wants me to lead the date, so I suggest we start by getting drinks. ""First round is on me"". I continued to lead, based on her verbal and non-verbal queues, and eventually we get more drinks (she reciprocates), and find a quieter place to chat after having played a couple rounds of pool. Things seem to be going really well - there's a lot of laughing and playful contact, and we have a lot in common, so I ask if she'd like to go somewhere else for a late dinner. We find a restaurant a few doors down, that goes well, and upon discovering that we're practically neighbors, decide to split a cab back. 

I get out of the cab with her, because my place is just a few blocks away, and she asks me to kiss her! So we kiss a little, agree to go on another date, and I head home from there. 

In my mind, that 5 hour first date was a resounding success. 

The next day (Sunday), I decide to be a bit bold and text her to tell her I had a good time and make a joke that referenced something from the night before. It's several hours before I get a response, but again it seems positive. She had a good time too. I follow up with another light joke, no response, but it wasn't exactly something that required a response, so I sigh to myself and move on with my day.

By Wednesday, I haven't heard anything from her, so I decide to just go for it, and ask if she wants to go out again. She responds enthusiastically, and says that she had a draft message written to me, and that she's just been overwhelmed with work. I propose Saturday again to give us time to decompress from the week. Her mother is having a party that afternoon, and she isn't sure how long she's expected to be there, so tentatively 7 PM. Sounds good. 

Another few days pass with no communication, and Saturday (today) rolls around. I ask her if we're still on for the evening and she tells me that she had been involved in a car accident on Friday. She's ok, but is feeling sore today and wants to cancel so she can go to urgent care. I respond that I understand and that I'm glad that she's ok, and that's basically where things are now.

At this point I can't help but wonder about where I stand. I'm willing to accept that the cancellation was for a legitimate reason, but if so, why wait for me to ask? I may be reading into it too much, but she said ""cancel"" rather than ask to reschedule. I don't think I said anything in the week between to change her opinion of me, so I'm at a bit of a loss. 

Should I chalk this up to bad communication (a bit ironic, given her profession) and follow up with her in a few days, or do I just move on and hope that I can find someone else who catches my attention in the same way?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omkp5g/bad_communicator_or_just_not_that_into_me/
97,omkrxu,1626587807,You cannot get what you want by doing the same thing you have been doing.,"(M23) After a few months of wishing for a relationship, I got honest with myself…

I don’t drink and used that as an excuse… ie “all the girls are at the bar and that’s why I can’t get a girlfriend”

In reality, that was clearly a way for me to justify not getting out of my comfort zone.

3 weeks ago I did my first cold approach… I locked eyes with this girl at the store and went for it… no pickup line or smooth talk… simply “I’m sorry to disrupt your peaceful shopping trip… You caught my eye and I wanted to introduce myself.”

Walked away with her number and now approach once a day. 

I sat down and asked myself “where would the girl I want in my life hangout?” That gave me the starting point of places to visit more frequently.

I have yet to get a date from  approaching but averaging getting the number 90% of the time.

Now, I know I need to work on texting as that’s where the conversation falters…

You can’t get where you want to go by doing the same thing you were doing… Be honest with yourself, find your weaknesses, learn, reiterate and continue to test.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omkrxu/you_cannot_get_what_you_want_by_doing_the_same/
