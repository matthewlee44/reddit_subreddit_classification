This doesn‚Äôt happen to me very often and I could feel that it was mutual. I was so excited about him. 
 
Then, after about an hour he drops it on me that the reason his marriage ended is because he cheated. Now, people say things like ‚Äòonce a cheater always a cheater‚Äô and I think that‚Äôs BS.

He said he was telling me on the first date because he knows it‚Äôs a big deal and he wanted to get it out upfront. I can respect all of that. 
 
What bothers me is there seems to be no ownership of his mistake. Like, he discussed it as, she told me to go get a girlfriend so I did- as if it was just some sort of big miscommunication. When I asked him how he ended up with whoever the girlfriend was, he said ‚Äòit just kind of happened.‚Äô Which, I think it‚Äôs about the lamest answer possible. People have agency and make their own choices. 
 
Anyway, if all he said was that he had made a huge mistake, had an affair that ended his already dead marriage, and that he had regrets about that, I think I would really respect that. What‚Äôs bothering me here is the abdication of responsibility in his description and the language he used.

Our incomes are wildly different, I make easily 10 times what he does. Several times he has told me that it's not a problem for him, but then he turns around and says things that are definitely indicating that it is a problem.

For example, a couple weeks ago I got a very large unexpected bonus. I was very happy about this especially since this has been a very hard year for me, and I was happy to share this with him. I was expecting some sort of praise or whatever I'm not sure, which I got, sort of almost begrudgingly I could tell that he was trying hard but a happy face on it. But then we went into several hours discussion on he wished he could make that kind of money and he works just as hard as I do and he should have taken the corporate path. And I'm just kind of bewildered by all this, I understand where he's coming from but at the same time it's getting kind of tiresome. It's getting to the point where I feel like I cannot share anything with him because it's going to set him off into feeling insecure and then I'm going to have to talk him down from that ledge and it's just getting old.

Right now I'm on vacation with my adult son, we have not taken vacation together for over 2 years. I'm sending him pictures and he's telling me that he's having a hard time seeing pictures because he's jealous. And then he immediately corrects himself I just want to be with you. But honestly the vibe I get is that he is jealous.

I worked very hard to get myself where I'm at career wise and finance wise. I lived hand to mouth for many years, I worked my ass off to put myself through graduate school.

We hit it off from the very beginning. Always laughing, making work fun, great chemistry, even rumors starting to spread. But we‚Äôre just friends. He‚Äôs always been very clear to to everyone that he keeps his personal like separate from work so he‚Äôll go to happy hours and hang with work friends but not mix it up.  

But, over the years, we started hanging out by ourselves (still not mixing with his personal life) and we‚Äôve built a personal friendship. We don‚Äôt see or even talk to each other often anymore since over the years we‚Äôve been moved to different parts of the building then eventually started remote working several years ago. But, every few months or so, we‚Äôll either chat via text all night or we‚Äôll meet up for a drink. We‚Äôve shared stories and learned about each other and his friends and family too. 

Now, I never made it a secret that I‚Äôve always liked him since I first met him and he knows but I value his friendship and privacy and so I don‚Äôt make a big deal about it or bring up.  But he knows. Lol. I‚Äôve had a couple LTR over the years and as far I know he hasn‚Äôt dated anyone since before I met him, when he had a breakup that hurt him very deeply. I don‚Äôt bring that up ask about his dating life though. 

Anyway, we met for drinks at a bar back in May and talked all night (like we always do), a few months ago, I ended a LTR. Then, I met my friend at his house for drinks a few weeks ago and had mentioned that the relationship had ended months before and we just spent the whole night just laughing and talking like we do. It caught my attention a couple of times when he said ‚ÄúI was telling X about you‚Ä¶, (work related then again he said to a friend). I didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time.  
As usual, it always feels like an awkward date when it‚Äôs time to go - lots of lingering and saying goodby then keep talking, etc. I‚Äôd had a little much so was just tipsy enough to winks and tell him again that I‚Äôm still into him if he‚Äôs ever interested. He smiled, said he knew, then hugs and I left.

Haven‚Äôt spoken to him since then out of the blue last weekend he sends me an invite to an annual even he has where his oldest, closest friends come from all over, as well as his family. All of us at work over the years have known and teased about an invite but none have gotten one because of his boundary rule.  

So I freaked out! Why did he invite me? We‚Äôre not close friends by any means, and yet this year he‚Äôs inviting to come and meet/mingle with his closest friends and parent? Obviously I‚Äôm excited. My mind got blown and I though, wow, I‚Äôm an actual friend now and not just a coworker who meets up once in a blue moon. 

Then someone says to me have I considered the fact that maybe he thought about what I said and he is interested, and now I‚Äôm actually available and he‚Äôs bringing me to meet the people most important to him because he has been hurt and wants their insight before he make any move?

Now I‚Äôm completely obsessed and I‚Äôm trying to calm the shit down because I don‚Äôt want to get fixated and then get disappointed.

Years ago when we worked more closely together there was a mutual attraction where he seemed interested but I had a partner at the time and had to discourage his flirting.  For all I know maybe he was just flirting for fun and I was just being overly protective of my own relationship.  Either way, when I caught up with him two years ago (after 6 years of being layed off and coming back part-time) I thought the old spark came back that day. But then we both went remote because of Covid.  I had this hope we would work together soon because clients were coming back.  Then  he understandably accepted a better job offer. 

I first emailed two weeks ago, ""I really enjoyed working with you all these years so it's sad to see you go. I know I haven't worked with you much in recent years, but you were one of the first people I met at XYZ when I started as a CM way back in 2008.

Greetings.

It was so lovely to hear from you and thanks for the kind words. I remember meeting you and our early conversations as I was impressed with your intelligence and understanding of the work we do. I am working a lot for CBA along with Arise, LMN, RSHM, and RST so our paths may (hopefully) cross again.

Ok I know this is going to come across as a total rant but will ask it anyway. 
I have been activity dating for about 9 months after a dB situation.  Had my fill of casual so really looking for something more serious.  

I am finding the following
1. Loads of matches who are cool for the first few days then it goes into the 'D can you send me photos of yourself blah blah blah' and then degrade into sex like super quick. This is on ANY forum. And any age match. 
2. Matches who are really cool and on the first face to face date just complain about their exes etc. So I don't go out again. 
3. Hundreds of pen pals and enough 'Hey' in my inbox to start my own arable enterprise. 

I am seriously struggling to just find normal. You know laughing,  flirting, good conversation etc. 

I figure the common denominator is me. Right? 

So here are my questions

1. Is it normal for guys to want tonnes of photos?  Why? 
2. Am I from another planet wanting to meet before talking about sex ffs? 
3. Is this just the wrong time to date? Ie everyone is not seriously looking because of the pandemic and I should take up basket weaving or something till the stuff blows over?!

I have tried being flirty, smart, intellectual, deep, fun ie me!!

Ok off to do some retail therapy and get into the sun.

My birthday is approaching and I lost my mother unexpectedly. These factors have me thinking about my mortality and how I don‚Äôt want to die alone. Problem is, I am very comfortable with my lifestyle and don‚Äôt want to get into a relationship just because of what I fear. 

Either way, I let myself go to avoid attracting male attention so that‚Äôs a huge impediment for me right now. I gained a lot of weight, especially during Covid. I am working on that but I also think nobody wants a fat 43 yr old who has had limited experience with dating? I see girls bigger than me who look happy and I wonder how they do it. Self confidence is key i understand, but how do they find the guys who look at the whole person just not the body? 

Maybe I expect too much at this point, but wanted to ask the lucky girls here, how do they meet guys? What should I do if I want to try? I am introverted too which prevents me from going to bars and stuff to meet guys. I live alone and have no friends. I used to have a friend that always made fun of me and asked me if I expected guys to arrive at my door looking for me. That‚Äôs pretty much how I feel. I am afraid of everything about meeting a guy: from background to health, to past relationships, etc. It‚Äôs too much to worry about. So I gave up trying.

I had only seen the birthday girl before in the past at other family events.  My boy puts a good word in with her before he leaves the party. I go talk to her for a while. I can tell she was tipsy from the drinks. When the party is over she invites me back to her house. Her girlfriend drives her home. I follow in my car.

As I walk up to her house as she opens the door she says ‚Äúwe are not having sex tonight!‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. Her girlfriend is there with us and we are just talking around her table. She goes over to her couch and I follow. We are still talking but we begin kissing.  Eventually she says to come up her bedroom and she tells her friend she can leave.

We get started but I only give her oral sex. No penetration. As I was giving her oral sex I only removed her underwear but left her sundress on. I was still dressed while giving her oral sex. When she fell asleep I completely undressed and got in the bed next to her and went to sleep. I‚Äôm the morning when we woke up we talked for a while in bed. She is now hungover. She even laid on my chest. I leave and state I would like to see her again. 

Later on she text me and said she was curious why I was naked in the morning when she recalls me having clothes on when she fell asleep. I replied I felt comfortable and I normally sleep naked. I apologized to her via text. I said I apologize if that made her uncomfortable. She replied it did make her comfortable. She asked what made me decide to completely undress if I only performed oral sex on her? I just said I felt comfortable. 

I understand now that my actions were wrong. I had misinterpreted the situation. She did not know me so why would I remove all my clothes. I was wrong for taking off my clothes. Even though nothing happened while we slept but I can understand why she would be concerned and wonder what happened. 

I truly enjoyed the conversation we had. She is my type. She is beautiful. I do want to get to know her. However now I feel she is uncomfortable about me.

I was thinking maybe in a week to give her a call. Do you think she is willing to give me a second chance? Should I call her? Should I chalk it up as a learning experience and move on? If she now feels uncomfortable around me is there anyway to make her feel comfortable again?

And she didn't know these things about me either. There were hints early on, both pro and con, of what she might be and what I would be. But the reality is I had no idea and she had no idea. In essence, it was all an educated guess/crapshoot for both of us.

Fast forward 25 years, and I unexpectedly hit the dating circuit again. How much fun it was to meet with 40s/50s people (women) my own age who'd raised (or not raised) kids, had careers, saved or spent or earned or not earned money, had health issues or not, and made all kinds of choices. We'd spend our dates talking about our past and our current, and not only was this a lot of fun and very interesting, but I felt like I could really get a sense of who my dates were based on how they'd lived their lives up until that point, since in essence we are what we do and have consistently done, and all of us have patterns to our lives by the time we are 50-something. There were some amazing people, and a few who I thought could benefit from therapy, but mostly I felt like I was able to get a sense if the person I was with on a date was an LTR match for me, in no small part because I know myself better now than I did at age 25, too. 

If I could go back in time, I myself would not have married at 25. There was too much I didn't know about my STBXW, and more importantly about myself, things that would only be revealed through the benefit of time. In retrospect, my STBXW and I were matches for a short period of time in our mid-20s, but not in our 30s and beyond -- she wanted independence and money (provided by an earner) and respect/admiration (from her peers) and kids that someone else (me) raised, wherein I just wanted money in a savings account and romance and sex and camaraderie with a woman I loved. In the end, we made the most of it but both of us were unfilled in our own ways in those last 10-15 years, and I was not honest with myself in my 30s and 40s but I made the most of what was in retrospect a pretty miserable situation/marriage for me back then.

Anyway, so I am grateful that I brought all this to dating in my 50s, and for this reason would not have considered dating someone younger than their 40s before I met my SO (53F). And I wish our schools/parents/teachers invested more in teaching us about matching with the right people so I was better prepared at age 25, and less about geometry which I never used again after high school :)",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,56974,public,self,An Ode To Dating After 40/50 and To Dating 40/50-somethings,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pjqnwo/an_ode_to_dating_after_4050_and_to_dating/,some_ads,7,,,,,,

He doesn't kiss me nor does he reciprocate the physical contact - the tip of his finger on my forearm is as much as I get. Sweet Lord!

But, I meet his friends for board game night a couple times and by the second time it becomes apparent that he (1) has talked about me with them, (2) has quite possibly showed them my OLD profile, and (3) has introduced me to them as someone he is dating. 

So I'm like, uhm OK. We both have the day off yesterday because of the holiday, so I invite myself over to his place. And, just to leave nothing on the table, I also text him something in the tune of: you know, if you want to make a move, today would be a great day to do it!

We proceed to have a lovely time together as always. We chat, we laugh, we play some games. At one point we end up on the couch under the guise of watching a movie, but we keep chatting instead. Finally, he is like: so I know you said something about making a move, but I'm shy and I'm not super sure what to do. So I kissed him. And we then proceed to have an hour long hot and steamy make out session in which we definitely batted a triple lol.

 So far so good.

They can visit your workplace too. If you have a problem with these questions, do not get married. You will end up frustrating yourself and your spouse.

If you don‚Äôt like people touching your phones, or your things in general, marriage is not for you. Before you come to argue that it can be discussed, nope. If you give your partner the impression that you‚Äôre hiding something, they will pull away emotionally from you.

If you don‚Äôt like people asking you how much you have in the bank or how much you earn as a salary, don‚Äôt bother about marriage. You are expected to lay it bare. If you both are going to combine income, you will need to tell each other how much you earn.

Yes, you cannot just go and buy whatever you want because you have the money. You are no longer single, you are sharing your life with your partner, therefore, buying certain expensive items needs to be discussed. Before you charge in to say, ‚Äúmy money is blah bla‚Ä¶‚Äù

Stay away from marriage if you can‚Äôt learn to say We or Our.
It‚Äôs no longer about you; it‚Äôs about everyone in the family. Buying a new house, car, furniture, or even inviting a guest over? Tell your spouse. You are not seeking their permission, you are letting them know of your plans, not after you‚Äôve purchased. It‚Äôs a sign of respect.

Lastly, stay away from people who disrespect your partner or encourage you to disrespect your partner. 

Avoid telling everyone about your marriage. How you run your home is your business. If you are in danger, seek help. Otherwise, avoid petty gossips that can ruin lives.
