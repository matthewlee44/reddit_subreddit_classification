Had a great time enjoying the scenery, mentioned I was in town on vacation and how my mom lives right up the street. I couldn't really see her but after I mentioned I was in town for vacation she started asking me a few questions that, on retrospect when I got home, kinda seemed like hints to me.

'How long are you in town? When are you coming back?'

'Do you have any kids?'

'Where are you staying?' *answer* 'oh cool I'm on xxxxx street too but on the east side!'

These didn't strike me as flirtatious until I thought about it when I got home, but dang I kinda feel like a dummy for not at least giving her my number so she could get a hold of me later.

so my issue lies with the fact that, even though we have been talking for months and we have sex and stuff he still has not asked me to be his girlfriend. this is starting to make me feel super insecure like i’m only useful for my body. he doesn’t really speak to me in real life either like the only reason we hang out is for sex.

i just think i’m not sure if it’s worth me trying to break through to him and tell him like this kinda is hurting me or if i should just break things off because i definitely do not wanna ignore it and go on as we are. i feel used and unimportant.

I constantly see them around the campus and of course some guys do stand out and look more appealing to you. One day I had a PE class and we had to go out to the track to walk laps. In the middle is the area where the football players have practice like 24/7. So the guys were kinda chuncked into groups and passing the football to each other. When we came to the track, I straight away went to the rest room which was right next to it. When I came out I decided to wait for my friends who were about to finish the first lap. As I was standing I saw a group of football players chatting and looking towards my way.. it felt awkward to make eye contact so I looked once or twice and kept looking away.. as my friends were about to exit the track, one of the guys from the group exited before my class went out and as he was exiting he stopped by the door and tried to get an eye contact with me. Once I've noticed him there , he gave me a smirk so I smirked back although I was kinda surprised. Didn't know if he looked at me or someone else or did I just look funny. It felt weird to be noticed by one of the football players. So after he exited and as my class started to exit too, couple steps further I was walking and I saw him walking towards me so I stopped and he asked if we met before to which I answered I saw him on insta couple times. He shook my hand too and asked for my name~ so when we parted, I saw him follow me back. The next week I got sick so I didn't go to school. And the week after I saw him unexpectedly thought the crowd and we were right next go each other.. so I saw him smirk when he saw me there. Not gonna lie.. It's so hard.. most of the time I had in mind that I don't really have much chances or they wouldn't be interested so I never had any expectations. But that one time I understood that I do and couldn't stop thinking about him since then. Saw him just a couple more times too but faked it like I didn't see him but tries to walk close to him. Today we by accident met each other again and he said hi for the first time which I didn't expect from him. It was sort of a shy hi since he wanted to see how I'd respond. The other time I saw him today was when my class ended and he showed up there too and took his seat as people started to leave which was exactly a row over from my seat and I said hi to him and this time he was like excited to see me when he said hi. I don't want to be straightforward with him but I want to look approachable and give him an understanding that I'm interested in getting to know him.

The whole basis of our relationship started off good but things went to fast and eventually backfired 4 weeks later. We haven’t talked in 8 days, I’ve left two text messages. 

At this point I just want the shit I have back from his house, I want the shit I have of his at my house OUT. He broke my Tv and owes me a replacement. He still has my house key. I texted him that we just need to exchange things and be done with it and still no response. (Sent within the last hour). 
It’s a learning experience, it hurts, it sucks. But now I just want to move forward and heal. I want his stuff gone, my stuff back. That’s it. If he doesn’t respond within a day, what should I do?

I kinda has taken me this long because I can’t trust anyone easily and I am new to the dating world. She has this guy friend who I happened know he is interested in her. I met him first then her. We kinda both got attracted to her the same time at work. She gave me chance. I am pretty sure she knows I don’t like the fact that they are friends but I don’t want to over step my boundaries especially if she is not my girlfriend yet. The other day I found out that he confessed his feelings towards her from a friend. I got really jealous and a day before she was leaving on a trip at night, I showed up and I confronted her about it. of course I didn’t showed up uninvited I texted her “l want to talk” she didn’t believed me but never said no besides she didn’t think I had it in me to go. I did go, I confronted her about it. She told me, that it did happened but before we started going out. I told her that it was weird to have a relationship like that and even told her that I know he still has actual feelings for her (he is also my friend) she told me it her only friend and that it is a platonic relationship and that she cares for me deeply. I didn’t reciprocate. But I did kissed her before I left. Shortly after she texted to never do that again. I told her that she never said no, then she says that we aren’t even anything and that she want so space and that is better being friends. I Told her I would never do it again. After an hour I apologize. She hasn’t responded. Two days ago I texted her a paragraph apologizing for my faults and that she should take as much space needed. Now I am troubled I don’t know if I should still try with her, she hangout with someone who has feelings for her and btw they hangout by themselves and I don’t like how I feel about that. I know I overstepped especially not being my girlfriend but honestly I can’t forget the fact that he likes her and I am having second opinions

I completely disagree with this, especially if we are not in a long term serious relationship. 

I was raised by a gentleman who taught me to NEVER offer. That a real gentleman would detest the fact that a woman would even consider devaluing herself and her femininity to offer a split. Ofcourse, things are different in this day and age but i still agree 100%.

Through years we kind of drifted apart but we do have conversations here and there when we meet. We follow each other on Instagram but he never texted me there.(we have followed each other on Instagram since forever). 
but during a gathering (in 2017-2018) with his family and mine and a couple other families, my childhood friend and I had a very fun moment with my sister included, we three of us were just hanging out (kinda like old times) so after that event weeks later he sent me a meme that was relateble with the conversation we three of us had. And I responded. And after a couple days he sent me a meme related to a conversation he had with my sister and little with me. he follows my sister too but he texted me about it which I found weird. 
But yeah, I wanted to share some memes too because he did and I didn't want to seem rude. Then we did a couple back and forth (all memes were very relatable to me and him but random) but then I forgot to send him memes and after that I just got lazy. so it's been almost 2-ish years and he's the only one sharing memes and I just respond to them. He sends me these memes every other week or after a month (usually at midnight, also he's 2ish years younger than me Idk If that matters I'm just throwing in random infos). 
I'm just saying that he's friends with my sister too and all three of us were pretty close, I assumed. and I was just curious as to why he doesn't talk/share memes with my sister but only with me since all three of us were close. Maybe I'm overthinking it but I just find it a bit weird that he sends me memes soo randomly but that relate with me and us. I wouldn't have felt weird if he was sending memes to my sister as well but yeah. 

Oh there was this incident that happened with us when we were growing. Because of puberty and stuff he was getting taller than me and he usually calls me with respect kinda like an older sister (like in Asian cultures you use unni, oppa etc kinda like that. Since he is younger than me) but my dad jokingly told him not to call me that anymore because my childhood friend was getting taller than me. I got mad saying no I'm still taller, then my dad measured us and yeah he was taller then me ;-;. Then the next time we hung out he was being all casual with me and calling me just by my nickname which I found so hurtful that Idk why, and without realizing it I started ignoring him and not listening to him when he called me that. After couple days he got the hint and started calling me as usual.
 ( just wanted to share that, Idk if that matters it's just he keeps sending me memes here and there and I can't seem to get it out of my head and I overthink too much) 

What do ya'll think am I overthinking it? Probably, but I want to hear it out loud

She texted me and we said we had fun briefly, and she added me on Snapchat. A few days later, I hit her up, and we made plans to hang out on Thursday the week after. She came over, I cooked her dinner, we cuddled as we watched A Nightmare Before Christmas, I said let's take a walk to settle our stomachs, and we walked outside of my place as we held hands, (she kept bumping her waist/stomach and body into me,) and we talked about our childhood, and how our parents divorced at a young age. We came back had sex, she orgasmed a lot, and we cuddled, and had morning sex.

The next time I invited her over to my place to hang out, I asked her when her availability was and she said she was free Wednesday, and Thursday, but something came up so we hung out Friday, (first time I've actually spent time with her on the weekends.) I told her come over at 10PM, and she texted that she could definitely do that! We had the craziest sex ever, and looked deep into each other's eyes, plenty of deep passionate kissing.

I'm a very selfless lover, I enjoy doing a lot of foreplay, kissing all her body, with plenty of dirty talking and pillow talking/cuddling after. She always tells me how she finds me so cute and how she was happy that I was a nice guy and not a jerk. She told me she didn't expect me to call or hit her up when we first hooked up.

Thing is whenever I set up plans with her, she always replies back like late at night after 9PM. She doesn't text or call me, and I initially have to do most of the planning. I did ask her how her day was and she replied within a few hrs, but I'd assume she has a busy schedule due to her medical job\*. She tells me she's not good at texting due to ADHD, which I guess is fair. I've met a few women like that. But even then, it makes me feel like I'm really nothing but a piece of meat.

This is the serious problem though. I never established what this was, nor did we have the talk or express boundaries. At this point, I really don't want to risk the amazing sex, but I'm also becoming attached to her because I have a good time with her.

I don't know what to do at this point,because I could keep smashing, but I think I'll eventually want more.

I used to assume that it was just implied that I would sleep over after and if a guy didn't want me to then he either wasn't that into me or just wanted me for sex. However, I've had a couple situations recently that have made me second guess this. Once where a guy I thought was into me asked me not to stay after we hooked up which turned me off from him. Another where I stayed over without explicitly talking about it (just fell asleep pretty quickly) and got ghosted after.

I checked his social media and he had this beautiful blonde girl in all his photos, going back 2 years. I suspected they were dating and silently crushed on him. I didn't make any moves.

But out of the blue one day this guy (my hot roommate) asked me to get drinks. While we were getting drinks, the blonde girl Facetimed him and he hung up on her to go out with me. It felt awesome. I thought this was finally my CHANCE.

The guy cuddled with me ALL night and it was the most romantic experience of my life. He even tried to have sex but I wasn't ready, though I regret not doing so.

Unfortunately a week later the blonde girl was back with him, and I heard her next door in the room with him. I gave up for a little while.

Then a few weeks later after she had been coming over regularly, he told me his GF was in the hospital. Meaning he was home alone. He invited me into his room to watch a movie. When I laid in his bed, he asked to cuddle and although I wanted to, I declined with a firm NO this time telling him he had a girlfriend!

Ever since I declined to cuddle, he's now completely stopped talking to me and has been totally focusing on his girlfriend. She was over our house 3 times this week and I have just been hiding in my room.

Although this guy only took me out for drinks/spent a couple nights cuddling with me, I really miss him/our few cuddling sessions. I feel like an abandoned toy!

It is BEYOND painful to hear him next door having sex with this girl. She also posted a photo of them together looking happy and beautiful on social media today :(

I really miss the nights cuddling with my roommate. I am realizing that sooner or later one of us will move out and I will never see him again. Should I tell him how I feel? I know he has a girlfriend but the fact that he cuddled with me a couple nights must mean something...right?

Would things have been better if I had just had sex with him while I had the chance? How can I get him back??

So! A lil bit of backstory... I've really thought this through a LOT!


I 20F have never been in a relationship! 

Lately though, I've been going out with this dude 21 for a while that made it clear on our first 'date', (At first I honestly thought that day was just for us to get to know each other as we had just briefly spoken the last and first time we met) very cutely at the end when we were about to part ways, that he was REALLY into me. Quite honestly I wasn't expecting that kind of thing from the first day and it was also the first time someone had told me something like this so I was mega-flustered but I am glad he told me so I know how to deal with my feelings. 
I like him too, I told him I need some more time with him to figure things out and it has been great, we talk a lot as we walk, a lot, and I find myself thinking about him more and more.

On our last date, I took the initiative to hold his arm, then lock our fingers together :o such a girboss move I know but in reality I am so full of anxiety.

The truth is the last time a had something similar to a confession happen to me I was younger and the guy was a lot older, I didn't even know his age. At the time I felt as if I owed him something just because he liked me so I didn't stop him trying to kiss and hold me. However soon after I realised I didn't really want that and cut him off. But that experience has pretty much sadly to say scarred me and now anything involving skinship makes me anxious af.

On our last date, the same one with the hand holding, we sat really close together in something close to an embrace just talking, looking at each other and honestly I felt he really wanted to kiss me and because I got heart palpatations I gently let him go and led the conversation to a different subject and turned the mood around. But I am very anxious about how things will happen in the future. He sure is a gentleman, but I understand he will want to kiss me eventually and honestly so do I. Don't even wanna think about anything more intimate right now and I think that's ok!

I understand that the best way to deal with this is probably talking to him about it, but so early on I am not sure I am yet ready to talk to him so so so vulnerably about it. Also I doubt I can have that talk with him in public and so far that's the only places we go to fortunately lol.

**I'm just wondering how other men (or women?) thrive in a relationship if they get overwhelmed by their own feelings?** Is this even a thing or is it just me? I guess it happens at other times as well, but is the strongest when dating, so no amount of CBT seems to help! 🤣

We are already honest about our feelings (she's shared some past hurts &amp; things she considers weaknesses) so I plan on bringing it up with her...I already indicated to her that I get overwhelmed easily so I think she'd understand. (I just want to say it in such a way that it doesn't make it sound like I'm trying to distance myself from her).

I guess there is the lingering question about whether this is love bombing.
