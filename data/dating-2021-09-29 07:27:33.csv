0,pxuegl,1632918753,How to break the cycle of dating people with substance abuse,"Hello, (F22)

So I keep repeating the same pattern with the people I date.
For the past 3 relationsships I've been in the other person have always have had some kind of substance abuse. Even though I do not do drugs myself (weed occasionally nothing crazy) and I do tend to like surround myself in genereal with people who don't do drugs and just in genereal got their shit together.

For myself I have a pretty structured life. I'm a medicine student and I also work quite a lot so i need to have my shit kinda together.
But then i always end up in relationsships with men who got serious substance abuse (like mostly snow and ecsy).

The relationsships then last for maybe like 1-2 years and they break mostly due to me not wanting to deal with their shit anymore.

Why do i keep repeating this pattern??

I have not dated for over 1 year now (been some dates but haven't seen anyone more than twice), and then 1 month ago i meet this dude and we have been seeing each other almost everyday since. And yes the dude takes a lot of shit.

I do try to like be really hard on myself and stay away from those kinda a people but it seems like i end up at the same place every damn time. Like i have no interest in people who have a stable life and everytime i go out with ""normal &amp; healthy"" people im simply just not interested in anything or seeing them again.

Pls do some psycho analysis haha, i really need to break the circle.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxuegl/how_to_break_the_cycle_of_dating_people_with/

2,pxumba,1632919543,If you start doubting something it’s because something is up,"It took me a while to realise this. I’d post on here asking for advice whenever I felt like something was off, trying to get reassurance and different perspectives from strangers. When you start doubting something in your relationship that’s because deep down you know something’s wrong and it’s your intuition trying to protect you. 

You don’t get anxious just like that and past relationship trauma isn’t always to blame. For example- if you never think about your SO’s ex partner and you don’t worry about them at all that’s because you know you have nothing to worry about. If you worry your partner will cheat on you and feel like you can’t trust them it’s because they somehow showed you they aren’t reliable. Whenever I felt anxious about some things in relationship, I compared it so some other situations and realized what I am anxious about and what I’m not anxious about. 

I’m not talking about people who are constantly anxious or who don’t trust people in general right from the start, but about people who get that feeling of anxiety randomly one day and it starts repeating itself. I know that a lot of people can’t tell a difference between anxiety and intuition. For me, if a feeling comes and goes it’s usually just a fear (anxiety). But if it’s persistent and something that your SO did triggered it then it’s your intuition telling you something’s wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxumba/if_you_start_doubting_something_its_because/

Ive updated a lot of my pictures this year too, hiking pics, smiling pics with a friend, pic with my cat haha. Recently I can hardly get a reply on hinge, I’ve tried plenty of different opening styles, nothing is really working too well. I even mentioned the issue with online dating to a girl I spent the night with recently and she admitted to swiping left when I came up on tinder. Needless to say this isn’t great for the ol self esteem. It’s so easy to lose motivation with OLD but finding someone I really like is kind of my main focus right now. 

However when it comes to in person interactions I’m receiving a fair amount compliments on my looks. I don’t want to sound like a douche but probably the last 3 or 4 times I’ve been out in a group one of the girls has taken a real liking to me (sadly none of them have been my type at all), girls at the pub and a couple neighbours have also made comments. I really don’t see it myself but I’m happy to take the compliment! It sounds like a good problem to have but at 28 with most friends already settled with families or are just a little boring these days you kind of have to reply on OLD to find a suitable match. It’s not ideal going to nightclubs at this ages dancing with girls 10 years younger than I am.. 

Perhaps my profile is just boring or my openers just aren’t popping off. I just don’t understand why girls I’m not too into IRL are liking something about me but I can’t even get a reply on hinge, even the less attractive ones.

8,pxvboh,1632921873,Stay together or not?,"So my bf and I have been dating for one year. We got into a big argument and I moved out a few days ago. The main issue was he told me he wanted to be ""alone"" very abruptly and that he wasn't happy in the relationship. He has said he wants me to be more engaging, like for example when we watch tv he has to decide what we watch, or if we go out to eat he has to pick where we go and so forth. The issue has been brought up before and I know he feels strongly about it. The other side of that is that I was taking 2 mood stabilizers because I am bi polar type 2 and they really affected my personality. They make me more passive and prevent mood swings. I believe that is a lot of the reason I was not more outgoing at times with him. We have taken a few days away from each other and are going to meet up tonight and talk. From my understanding we are going to decide if we are going to break up. My question to you is, is it going to be possible for me to ""be more engaging"" or does he expect too much from me?

So we meet up at this park and have some wine. (i’m in europe) Then we go and lay down in the grass somewhere and end up making out and going to second base.  But there’s people around so we walk around for a bit and we’re like holding hands and stopping to make out them we go back to the park to a more secluded area. Things happen (if yk what i mean) and he was very unselfish xD. 

Then we get spooked and leave and he didn’t get to finish but then we sat somewhere and cuddled some and he mentioned that we can see eachother again when he comes back to visit or if i go to his city (a major city that i want to visit in the near future.) if i was down to do so. and I said “yeah if i have an apartment”

so then i left and we kissed bye and went our separate ways, it was like 4 am. it’s the next day and no one has texted (it’s my first hookup so i’m not sure the etiquette) and i’m wondering if i should text him something like “hey i had fun last night and i’d definitely be down to chill again when you come back or vice versa” or should i just wait for him to message or leave it alone?

I asked him if he was just interested in sex, because I made it clear that I don't have sex with someone that I'm not in a relationship with. He said that he wasn't.

16,pxwe1n,1632925260,Flakes. My perspective on it.,"Obviously everyone has their own way to go about this but here is my general way of doing things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now context means everything when it comes to flakes. So if a girl flakes on you the day off then to me that is an automatic move on and don't even respond back to her type deal. It's a level of disrespect. You set aside your time to chill with this person and they just gonna wait last minute to cancel on you. 

  
If she cancels on you the day before then alright you can try to set something up for another time and see if things work out then. This way she at least gave you a day notice to like re-plan your own thing. But if she cancels again then she is done. Move on and look for other prospects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I would have the viewpoint of be relentless and pursue a girl until she flat out says listen im not interested then move on. But why are you gonna go after a girl who is luke warm about you. I think at this point if you don't have like interest in me im not gonna try to convince you otherwise. There are so many girls out here you should be lowering yourself or letting her try to have such an upperhand in the situation just to get a girl. I think the reason people think its cool to flake or ghost is because as guys we need to hold each other to a higher standard and have more self-respect for each other. Getting a girl isn't the end all be all here.

17,pxwmay,1632925965,Its ok to be single,"I have been single for around a year and a half now. My last relationship was a mutual break up so it was fairly easy to move on from it. 

But recently, whenever my mom mentions how I should have a friend set me up with someone or mentions anything about my dating life, I kind of recoil.

As of this past year and a half, I haven't had a drive to start dating anyone or really try to. The idea of going on dating apps or always trying to pursue a relationship seems like a pain in the ass. More so than it ever has before.

I think part of this is because I've found I really enjoy being single in my young years. I'm 22f. The fact I don't have to make decisions with someone else and can just choose where I want to go and what I want to do without having to worry about upholding a romantic relationship is very freeing for me. 

I have found a lot of contentment in just hanging out with friends and working towards bettering myself for just me and me only. I can take little vacations by myself and do all the things I want to do just for me. In a way being single allows you some much needed selfishness (which isn't always bad as long as you don't hurt anyone :) )

A relationship should add to your life, not take away/feel like a necessity to happiness. I think people can really find themselves being single, which when the time comes when you really want a relationship, it will be so much more healthy and worthwhile. I see folks who quickly go through relationship to relationship and I don't think that's necessarily healthy at times. There is a healthy balance of independence/dependence that i think people would benefit on if the worked on it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxwmay/its_ok_to_be_single/

I could pick up on that and I found it attractive. It’s not something he told me but I noticed it. I’m similar but the difference is I don’t feel attracted unless I’m pursued. 

We’ve been playing games and teasing each other for such a long time. He’s asked me out a few times but only after rejecting my advances. If I say anything that suggests we’re not friends, he’s put me in my place. Only then would he ask me out. Naturally I would turn him down and put him in his place, the place being my friend.

We just had a sort of “argument”, it was more so passive aggressive. He didn’t snap, or crumble. I’m not going to fold either. It wasn’t really an argument but I can tell this can’t go on. 

He’s told me he really likes me before and find me beautiful. I believe him but I’m not sure if he can be my boyfriend. I’m so used to joking around with him, I don’t think I can be affectionate around him.

Does anyone have any reasonable advice, considering everything I said? I’m not asking about the correct thing to do just how do I get what I want without lowering myself. I’m so close to moving on.

My friends are telling me to force myself to move on but I really like him. I could easily move on and be happy with someone else. There are plenty of guy I’m attracted to that are trying to ask me out on a date. The problem is I want him because we have a connection.

It was a pretty quick evening since I was about to leave on a trip, but we agreed to go out again when I got back.

We texted back and forth a bit and then she said that she'd love to see me again but she wasn't sure that I was very interested in her because I didn't really ask questions about her, even when she offered information. Then she wished me ask the best. I responded by saying that we were connecting so well that I was finding things out about her without asking a lot of questions but she hasn't messaged me since.

I'm sharing this because nobody's ever told me that before so needless to say it was a bit of a surprise. It's been the better part of a year since I've been on a date with someone I seemed to connect with as well as her so it's a bit frustrating.

25,pxxuaj,1632929501,Some harsh reality,"Im sick and tired of the “advice” people give in this sub because a good 90% of it is complete bullshit and completely false so I’m going to give everyone the advice or what I really want to call the truth for the dating world. Looks matter In trying to find someone, being confident matter when trying to find someone, being unattractive plays a major role in trying to find someone. If you are confident but unattractive you will probably not find the exact person you are trying to find and do not listen to people who say “if you’re confident you can do anything” as that statement is completely false. There are some people who are unattractive who can land very gorgeous women but at the end of the day that scenario happens less than 2% of the time. If trying to get into a relationship and find a romantic partner constantly plague your mind then leave this sub as the people who “try” to help you don’t know what they are talking about or won’t tell you the truth. The harsh reality of what you need to do is to get into shape, no big gut or flabby skin, you need to be be toned. You don’t need to have a six pack or anything but you need to be toned. I know achieving this is hard work but you need to do it. The next thing you need to do is get a job and work your ass off at it if you aren’t doing so already or go to college and get a good degree that will result in a high paying job or better yet go to trade school. The next thing you need to do is live on your own and not with roommates. The next couple of things you need to do are to be confident. This is the hardest thing on the list to do but you need to be confident. Start going out to places and talking to random women just talk to them, don’t have the mindset of trying to bring them back to your place or anything as you are not ready for that step at all. All you should be doing is talking to woman to get comfortable around them. Keep moving to the next person to the next when the conversation is done. You will know when you are ready to try and pursue something as stupid as it sounds and even then you will fail and flop but you just have to get back up and do everything again. Do all of this and your chances will increase of finding a potential partner but it’s not guaranteed as some people are just destined to be alone and you could be one of them. This is all the harsh truth that no one  wants to hear but it what’s you need to do and for anyone  that tells you otherwise is completely wrong even if they give you valid points they are still wrong. Not everyone is the same which people don’t seem to understand so you need to be the best version of yourself that you can be and sometimes that’s not even enough. Heed my harsh truth or not but it is the truth.

29,pxxx9c,1632929740,23M had a very bad girlfriend experience in second semester of college in 2019. Please help need lots of advice. Currently working on myself.,"

I’m a high functioning autistic guy and way back in 2018 I was accepted into a college program for other people with learning disabilities. Got to move a state away from my parents and into a dorm as I wanted the hell away from them. I moved into one of the dorms which was brand new and I didn’t have roommates I had a room all to myself which was great. First semester went amazingly well I made a great amount of friends and did really well in all my classes. 

Come second semester second week my best friend told me that our other friend told her that this one girl liked me. Now previous semester I kinda had a thing for this girl (I’ll call her M) but it kinda died during the last few weeks because she likes to complain about her mother and other things that don’t matter. She would also compliment me sometimes no one’s really ever complimented me before it made me blush when she did. 

She complimented me when I got six inches taken off my hair it was long and curly it was still long after I got it cut shoulder length and people would say I look like a rockstar with my style of hair. She said “hey did you get a haircut? It looks really nice.” Me:”thanks.” “Can I feel it?” Me: ”um sure.” “Ohhhh it’s so soft!” 

Just hearing that she had a crush on me was enough to bring the feelings I had back and the fact that no one’s ever been interested in me romantically. So I guess I liked her because I thought she liked me :(. 

The next Monday we both sit down and something in me tells me that something is wrong about this. I asked her that I did like her and then I asked if she liked me back but she didn’t say yes or no. She told me that she loves her mom, her sister, and her two brothers and after she graduates the program she’s transferring to a school that’s like 30 minutes away from mine. Then she asks me what does this make us and I said I’m not sure and I had a class to go to right after that. For the rest of the day until the end of my 5:30-8:00 class I was super confused and upset. After I got back from class she wanted to tell me she changed her mind and wanted to try with me. 

Now since I am new to dating I’m not all that great with communication. We didn’t really go out on any dates throughout two months we dated I asked if she wanted to go out a few times but she always said maybe. We also lived in the same dorm.

On weekends she likes to go home to see her family so one day she asks if I can take her home and hang out there. She also didn’t have a drivers license at the time. We hung out for a few hours and I just constantly felt awkward and I didn’t feel relaxed.

The next time we hung out at her place I felt a bit more relaxed and a little less awkward. Her teenage sister hung out with us and I had to listen to horrifying BTS music videos. The next day I was walking to my evening class and she texts me asking if I hate her. I told her no why would you think that? And she said that her sister told her I looked like I hated her. I didn’t hate her and I convinced her I didn’t.

Come Valentine’s Day I buy her a card, flowers, and a box of chocolates and I also wanted to take her to the Cheesecake Factory. Her mom already made plans for her to go to church and on a Thursday which was odd to me. Her mom canceled the church plan and I asked her if she wanted to do dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and she asks if I made reservations for it and I said no. I’ve only been to the Cheesecake Factory twice in my life I did not know they made reservations. She made me feel like shit for not making a reservation. Later that night we exchange valentines gifts and we end up ordering a pizza.

A week or two later about an hour after her mom takes her home she starts texting me and getting on to me about how I am bad at communication and getting on to me about how I’m not all that close to my brother but she’s very close to her brother. My brothers a busy guy with two kids to raise and he’s kind of a serious guy that can make any conversation uncomfortably serious he’s also 14 years older than me so there’s an age gap. And she said something that scarred me mentally and it’s something that I’d never thought she’d say “alright but I don’t usually date people with a disability that’s not really my type when it comes to guys.” That sentence really made me upset and had me in tears for a few days. I showed my text to my best friend right after she texted me to try and get advice he tells me that yes I could work on my communication and she can as well because a lot of the messages she sends me are cryptic. He end up calling her and shaming her for saying what she said he told her she was a bigot. We lasted two more weeks I should have broken up when she sent that text but I was a dumbass and thought I could move past it.

The next two weeks were just downhill. One day we were sitting in the union and she wants to know how much money I have in my bank account and I tell her I don’t think that’s your business and she says “don’t make me yell at you I need to know.” So I caved and told her I didn’t have much and she said ugh my sister has more money than you. The Sunday before we break up I really try an attempt to communicate with her and she gets mad at me for texting her while she’s at work and tries to make me feel bad about it. My best friend sees an upset look on my face and asks me what has she said to you? I told her she’s mad because I texted while she’s at work. Unknowingly after I told him that he send a really long text to her i don’t remember what but I do remember the text saying “stop acting like an asshole to him” and when she rolls me about the text that is the only sentence she got out of it. The next day she breaks up with me and I’m feeling the same way about it. During the process of the breakup she tries to turn my friend against me unsuccessfully and later that day she tells me she just wants to be friends and I agree to it. At the end of the semester I told her I didn’t want to be friends and I blocked her on everything. Throughout the rest of that year I was depressed and afraid to get into relationships. Fast forward to now 2021 I am trying to work on myself and lose 90 pounds 255 to 165. I didn’t weigh 255 back then and now in 2021 I just feel gross, unattractive, and just plain afraid to get into another relationship.

31,pxy09f,1632929975,Having difficulties in getting over a girl that is always all over me,"Warning: Can be quite long so appologies in advance
Wattup guys i'm a 20 year boy that really needs advice on what to do. First off, i am not english so please forgive any mistakes i might make along the journey that i am about to take you into. Also it is my first time writting in reddit so fingers crossed ahahaa.
So a litle bit of a backstory about myself, i am 20 year medstudent that really didnt dive into the idea of dating and girls in general since last years and it has been quite the struggle. I gamed probably my entire life (which helped deal witha lot of stuff) and I consider myself pretty good in social meetings and have a great sense of humour, and some self esteem issues😳...but when it comes to girls I dont have a clue on what to do😂😂. A lot of people say it is with practice and I accept that but I really need advice in the situation i am currently in.
So I met this girl, lets call her Beth for explanation purposes, when I got into university, about a year ago and we got along REALLY well and i mean really well, we talked everyday and I fell HARD for her (my first love/crush ahah). Then something happened, we slept together, but nothing sexually related happen just cuddling. I was a bit like 'wtf is happening here' bcs i had no clue if that meant annything to her or if that was a normal thing to happen...so i talked to her about my feelings and about that night and i got rejected...which to me didnt make sense bcs she was all over me hugging, kissing, even holding hands at times and dont get me wrong she has a very touchy-like relationship with people but no where near to the one she had with me and everyone thought we were dating. So I actually took the rejection really well beacuse I was so happy that I had the courage to spill out the feelings I had which I considered to be a lot of development in my courage department ahaha. But after 2 weeks of not contacting her (just did when i needed something school related) she began to call me and text me everyday which I found odd at the time but found it fine since I liked our friendship a lot, and so never tried anything sexual again (despite having some feelings). Then I started to hang out with new friends that I met in college and I loved them, they bassicly became my family we are really close and i bassically almost got over her....and THEN she got JEALOUS, but really jealous and so she started to hang out with them also and became part of my group of friends which kinda pissed/is pissing me off. So then the summer came and now in the beggining of the semester , about 1 week ago she began to almost ONLY hanging out with THEM, she had her other group of girlfriends but now it is like she ditched her girlfriends and now ONLY hangs out with my friends...like WTF...i mean they were kinda my way of also getting over her and know she is in there. Also she started to hugg me, messaging me and saying she misses me all the time, and so i started to set boundaries about what she can do in that department but she IGNORES ALL OF THEM. She is also constantly jealous of a girl which is in my group of friends and Beth is jealous of her all the time and wont shut up about it. I am really losing my mind and it is becoming really difficult to interact with beth. And now I am kinda struggling with anxiety and some sort of depression that  because my feelings started to come again and when Beth's bestfriend is with me and Beth she ONLY talks about boys for Beth and always pointing to attractive men that are good for her and I swear it is the only topic of conversation when she is with us which kills me inside but i try my best to hide it. So as i said I am feeling really depressed because I dont know what to do and I really cant concentrate or feel motivated to do things. So i really wanted to know you guys opinion in my situation since i am really strugling and dont feel confident to talk to someone about it. 
If you made it this far, thanks for reading!!😊

Messaging: have an actual conversation. When I wait for days and get a one word response, I'm out. I ask about you, you ask about me. We get to know each other. Lots of women come off as narcissistic and short during these messages.

44,pxz2nz,1632933011,How To Develop Romantic Charisma?,"I have a tendency to ramble so I'll try be brief here, but I'm happy to answer any follow up questions for details.

I consider myself a generally charismatic person. Most people I've met in pretty much any setting like me. This has been very consistent from primary school all the way through two high schools, a university and 3 workplaces.

But to my knowledge I've never attracted anyone as a result of being charismatic, and I've never gotten the sense whilst speaking to a woman that she likes me in anything besides a platonic sense. A woman I was dating once commented that she'd be more attracted to me if I wasn't so goofy/expressive/hyper all the time (though she didn't go into any detail about how else I should be acting, stoic would be my guess?), and I realized that there's a difference between being charismatic in general, and being charismatic romantically/sexually. I'm looking for advice on how to work on the latter.

I sometimes think it might be because I have a overly positive and jokingly child-like demeanour, so that makes people sub-consciously categorize me in a platonic zone in their minds since those qualities on their own don't fit with typical masculine traits (though by my understanding they make a great addition to them).

We happened to share the same space and after a few back and forth eye glances, she approached me and we started talking. We found out that we had a lot of stuff in common. We talked for close to an hour before she had to leave with her friends. She asked for my phone number before she left and I asked for hers in return. I went back home thinking I'd message her in a day or two, possibly ask her out even, but she surprised me later that night by messaging me first. She told me that she had a lot of fun with me. She ended her message by saying that she found me interesting, and that if I was ever around, to let her know and we could grab a cup of coffee. We chatted for a bit.

I was ecstatic. I messaged her 2 days later and asked her out. She told me that she was busy but ""should be free next week"". Cool. I messaged her a week later and asked her out again. This is what she had to say:

""Can't make it. Will let you know when I can.""

61,py0qsx,1632937810,Finding it difficult to continue talking to someone that doesn’t have a car.,"I’ve searched for similar posts about this issue. It seems most people assume someone doesn’t want to date someone without a car because of financial reasons, that it must mean they are broke, and being broke is unattractive. I don’t care about money. I am broker than fuck myself. For me, the reason I’m debating this, is because of transportation issues. We are about 30 minutes apart. I do NOT want to have to be the one driving to get to them every time we do something together. There is not a great public transportation system in this area. So it probably means they simply do not go out to do much. Their manager at work picks them up for work. Not having a car in a location that doesn’t have widely available public transportation really limits things you can do. And that is what I find unattractive. I empathize with people in this situation, I know it is very difficult to not have a car. It prevents you from being independent. And I’m sure that fucking sucks. Having said that, I just can’t see myself dating someone in this scenario. And, yes, maybe there is a bit of worry over their financial situation. How long have they been without a car? Are they irresponsible with their money and that’s the cause of not having a car? Do they just simply not understand the importance of saving up for a car? Is their credit awful? A decent used car these days can be under $1,000. My mind thinks about the reasons behind being financially unstable and not so much the being broke part.

This is one flaw with online dating, but I was willing to suck it up and try, because I didn't really have anything else to gun for. My plan was to meet up with guys as soon as possible to avoid the possible false intimacy of texting. 

So there was this one guy I was really interested in, he said he would love to get to know me, planned to meet up but a few days before our meet up, boom he took rly long hours to reply and the convos became one-sided, with me showing care and checking in on him mostly. 

He shared that school was hectic etc...but I also felt that regardless of the reason, if he didn't have the capacity to put in effort/reciprocate care then I didn't want to be in a r/s with him...so I told him our plans were off...but should I have talked things thru with him, asked him if his lack of capacity to care was temporary, and that after things become less busy he'd care? Should I have waited for him, given that he had still put aside time to meet me despite his crazy schedule?  Was I in the wrong for cancelling on him before giving him a chance to show me he cared in real life? 

Altho we bidded our farewells, all i feel like doing now is confessing to him and asking if this phase is temporary, asking if he'll reciprocate when he can.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py0wi9/online_dating_and_texting/

I warn you, english isn’t my main language.
I went on 2 dates with a girl that is going through a breakup that happened less than a month ago. Her relationship lasted 4 years. In the first date, we really connected. In the second date, we had fun at the start and I felt a connection. Knowing that she is going through a breakup, I didn’t feel comfortable kissing without saying something beforehand so I told her that I felt like it. She started crying and talking about her ex and how she wish she could get back with him, but that she doesn’t want to at the same time. I talked with her, tried to help her as much as I could during 2 hours. Eventually, we had to go.

At the end of the date, I said I was open to see her again and that I don’t want to pressure her into anything. She said she wanted to see me again too and gave me a hug. 

The next day, we texted a bit and she told me she felt really awful. She said that she need some time alone and that she isn’t ready to date. I said that I understand and to take care of herself. I told her that my door remains open for when she is ready. Later that day, she messaged me again and I answered her that I was confused since I thought she wanted to stop seeing me. I asked her if she likes me and she said she doesn’t know, that she is in a weird part of her life.

Yesterday, we texted a bit and I asked her if she was open to simply be friends since we really get along well. She said yes.

Here’s where I’m beginning to feel doubts. A part of me thinks that I may have been pushy with her and scared her off dating/a potential relationship with me in the future. Another part of me understands that she is in pain and that it’s not my fault, that it’s not because I’m not attractive/interesting enough. I can’t help but feel responsible. Also, I hope that it will develop into a romantic relationship eventually, but I feel like I shot myself in the foot by asking to be just friends.

Like I feel sort of like a fool for asking her for her Instagram now, but at least I tried and that’s worked in the past, but like damn maybe she just forgot or who knows, and idk why I take it so personally.

78,py1zfg,1632941499,Had a really bad first girlfriend experience. Please help I need lots of advice.,"

I’m a high functioning autistic guy and way back in 2018 I was accepted into a college program for other people with learning disabilities. Got to move a state away from my parents and into a dorm as I wanted the hell away from them. I moved into one of the dorms which was brand new and I didn’t have roommates I had a room all to myself which was great. First semester went amazingly well I made a great amount of friends and did really well in all my classes. 


Come second semester second week my best friend told me that our other friend told her that this one girl liked me. Now previous semester I kinda had a thing for this girl (I’ll call her M) but it kinda died during the last few weeks because she likes to complain about her mother and other things that don’t matter. She would also compliment me sometimes no one’s really ever complimented me before it made me blush when she did. 

Now I think I have a pretty good personality. I love hanging out with my friends and going out and having a fun good time. I love gaming I play things like assassins creed, halo, Skyrim, any adventure or RPG and I can’t wait till 2022 because I believe that will be one of the best years for gaming ever can’t wait to play Starfield. I’m also a lover of sci-fi books and fantasy like the Percy Jackson books or the Maze Runner and so many others. I am currently reading the Witcher series and when I am finished I plan on reading the Dune books then watching the movie. I am a fan of anime and I think it’s much more fun to watch with your friends. One of my favorites is Tokyo Goul. I am also getting into manga starting out with Black Clover.

She complimented me when I got six inches taken off my hair it was long and curly it was still long after I got it cut shoulder length and people would say I look like a rockstar with my style of hair. She said “hey did you get a haircut? It looks really nice.” Me:”thanks.” “Can I feel it?” Me: ”um sure.” “Ohhhh it’s so soft!” 

Just hearing that she had a crush on me was enough to bring the feelings I had back and the fact that no one’s ever been interested in me romantically. So I guess I liked her because I thought she liked me :(. 

The next Monday we both sit down and something in me tells me that something is wrong about this. I asked her that I did like her and then I asked if she liked me back but she didn’t say yes or no. She told me that she loves her mom, her sister, and her two brothers and after she graduates the program she’s transferring to a school that’s like 30 minutes away from mine. Then she asks me what does this make us and I said I’m not sure and I had a class to go to right after that. For the rest of the day until the end of my 5:30-8:00 class I was super confused and upset. After I got back from class she wanted to tell me she changed her mind and wanted to try with me. 

Now since I am new to dating I’m not all that great with communication. We didn’t really go out on any dates throughout two months we dated I asked if she wanted to go out a few times but she always said maybe. We also lived in the same dorm.

On weekends she likes to go home to see her family so one day she asks if I can take her home and hang out there. She also didn’t have a drivers license at the time. We hung out for a few hours and I just constantly felt awkward and I didn’t feel relaxed.

The next time we hung out at her place I felt a bit more relaxed and a little less awkward. Her teenage sister hung out with us and I had to listen to horrifying BTS music videos. The next day I was walking to my evening class and she texts me asking if I hate her. I told her no why would you think that? And she said that her sister told her I looked like I hated her. I didn’t hate her and I convinced her I didn’t.

Come Valentine’s Day I buy her a card, flowers, and a box of chocolates and I also wanted to take her to the Cheesecake Factory. Her mom already made plans for her to go to church and on a Thursday which was odd to me. Her mom canceled the church plan and I asked her if she wanted to do dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and she asks if I made reservations for it and I said no. I’ve only been to the Cheesecake Factory twice in my life I did not know they made reservations. She made me feel like shit for not making a reservation. Later that night we exchange valentines gifts and we end up ordering a pizza.

A week or two later about an hour after her mom takes her home she starts texting me and getting on to me about how I am bad at communication and getting on to me about how I’m not all that close to my brother but she’s very close to her brother. My brothers a busy guy with two kids to raise and he’s kind of a serious guy that can make any conversation uncomfortably serious he’s also 14 years older than me so there’s an age gap. And she said something that scarred me mentally and it’s something that I’d never thought she’d say “alright but I don’t usually date people with a disability that’s not really my type when it comes to guys.” That sentence really made me upset and had me in tears for a few days. I showed my text to my best friend right after she texted me to try and get advice he tells me that yes I could work on my communication and she can as well because a lot of the messages she sends me are cryptic. He end up calling her and shaming her for saying what she said he told her she was a bigot. We lasted two more weeks I should have broken up when she sent that text but I was a dumbass and thought I could move past it.

The next two weeks were just downhill. One day we were sitting in the union and she wants to know how much money I have in my bank account and I tell her I don’t think that’s your business and she says “don’t make me yell at you I need to know.” So I caved and told her I didn’t have much and she said ugh my sister has more money than you. The Sunday before we break up I really try an attempt to communicate with her and she gets mad at me for texting her while she’s at work and tries to make me feel bad about it. My best friend sees an upset look on my face and asks me what has she said to you? I told her she’s mad because I texted while she’s at work. Unknowingly after I told him that he send a really long text to her i don’t remember what but I do remember the text saying “stop acting like an asshole to him” and when she rolls me about the text that is the only sentence she got out of it. The next day she breaks up with me and I’m feeling the same way about it. During the process of the breakup she tries to turn my friend against me unsuccessfully and later that day she tells me she just wants to be friends and I agree to it. At the end of the semester I told her I didn’t want to be friends and I blocked her on everything. Throughout the rest of that year I was depressed and afraid to get into relationships. Fast forward to now 2021 I am trying to work on myself and lose 90 pounds 255 to 165. I didn’t weigh 255 back then and now in 2021 I just feel gross, unattractive, and just plain afraid to get into another relationship.

So I have been tinkering with this idea. The loneliness or desire for companionship peaks randomly throughout the day for most people.

How about I make an app (I am an engineer) that lets people meet others within the next hour. They can choose whatever activity they want.  

You select you are available to do whatever in the next hour and then you either find someone to do things with or it just removes you after 1 hour.

The app shows who is available NEAR YOU to hangout within the next hour and if they match with you, you can chat and figure out the details of the meetup

84,py2dvu,1632942672,How long to wait before a second date?,"So I am very new to dating and I went on a date last night and I really enjoyed it, from what I could tell she had a great time as well. We spent a couple hours out and at the end we hugged and when I mentioned maybe doing something again soon she said yes. Before I got home she ended up texting me thanking me and she said that she had fun. I texted her this morning and she replied right away. So as far as I can tell she seems interested in going out again (could be wrong idk). So I was wondering when the best time to ask her out on a second date would be, do I wait a couple days or should I try to ask her out quicker than that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py2dvu/how_long_to_wait_before_a_second_date/
85,py2fc1,1632942789,Are these not common dating behaviors anymore?,"1. The man walking on the outer side of the road by having the female switch inside.
2. Opening the car door.
3. Asking for a “text me when you’re home safe” text. 

Not that a female cannot open her door or walk on the road alone, it just seems like little dating behaviors are gone. Similarly, I feel like dating expenses should be split after the first date (or even on depending on $$), make sure whoever lives the furthest gets home safely, etc.

87,py2k3e,1632943180,Why keep following on social media?,"I understand that both guys and girls do this but I'm going to talk from my friend of reference for this one. 

There's this girl I went on casual date with. My intention was to just go out for coffee or ice cream. Since it was the first time we were going to spend time together since the first time we met when we conversed. I was working security at a bar for a weekend and she stirred up the Convo. 

We met up once, and it wound up sleeping together. (Not my intention, I fully went in prepared for coffee or ice cream and to actually get to know her) I found this woman very attractive so I really wanted to try things organically. 

Shortly after we texted for a bit. Then she stopped showing interest. 

I went about doing my own thing for a while, and then the other day I thought of her so I decided to reach out. 

She stated that ""she thought I was cool at first, but then it seemed like I was self centered"" personally I'm not going to sit here and argue whether I am or I'm not because I think that's up to everybody else to decide based on knowing me. 

I then told her: ""OMG, I had no idea you felt that way. I'm am embarrassed I gave off that impression. I would love the opportunity to see you again and we could discuss at length and maybe get to know each other better.""

Now at this point, she was actually responding to me which was more than she was in a long time. 

But then I guaged that maybe she'd made up her mind. So i went on to say. 

""I totally understand if you've made up your mind on the situation and you don't want to see me anymore. I will make my self scacrc on social media as well to alleviate the process"" 

To which she responds: what does social media have to do with it

---- now. A little back ground
The entire time I've known her, even when she got distant, she has been actively viewing all of my post stories and profile. 

What is the point? 

If she doesn't want to be involved with me anymore, and it doesn't seem like she necessarily wants to be at least friends or acquaintances. Why maintain the Social media connection. 

Generally if I can tell that the person and I are not going to converse or interchange ideas permanently, I usually just remove and unfollow. I just like my connections to be organically transparent. I see it as meaningless empty fodder if the person is connected to me but we don't ever talk update or catch up. 

Now I am aware that I have total autonomy here and I can remove unfollow and block her easily. But if I'm being honest I wanted to explore whether there's any chance of redemption in the situation.

Because if there isn't, then I know that it's hopeless, I can get rid of the fodder, and never look back. 

I'm curious as to what her frame of mind for wanting to stay engaged on social media and watch my activity but not wanting to pursue any kind of relation with me?

We have known each other since high school and have met back then but we recently started talking and want to hang but he has not really made plans for it? Like he responds so fast 24/7 and we talk consistently and also mention hanging out but he hasn’t necessarily made plans for us to do it. He just says like oh we need to hangout &amp; we are talking about spending time together this weekend but we still haven’t planned it out?? What does that mean? Only reason why it’s been two weeks and we haven’t hung yet is because I just got back from vacation and he plays football in Utah. He tells me all the time he loves my vibe and wants to see me in person ?? Is he just too shy? Should I just move on and not pursue him anymore or am I thinking too much? He’s not too busy for me though because he’s technically not playing this season because of a back injury and he’s always at home so idk,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py31q9/what_does_this_mean/

I messaged my ex and looking back I know that was a mistake. Anyways, I said he could come get his stuff because our friend doesn’t want to get involved. My ex freak out on me and was completely rude to me. So I didn’t respond. He messaged a couple days later and ask if we could meet for his stuff. I said yeah but not until Thursday or Friday. On Tuesday he sent my best friend a picture of a girl in his bed. I’m just super confused and not sure what to even do or say.

We made plans several days in advance, I show up and then just end up waiting 30 min to an hour before feeling embarrassed and leaving. Then they message me with some lame excuse about 3 hours later or not at all. I tell them it's okay it happens whatever, and then either they unmatch me or just ghost me. The last time I really used dating apps was early in college, and only tinder was really a thing, but I remember going on some really great dates and meeting people, having long conversations, etc.. That doesnt seem to be the case anymore. 90% of the time I get ghosted and if we do set up a date I get stood up. Has dating really gotten that much worse in the past 5 years?

We we were going on dates for 2 months when he finally told me he liked me and that he wants to take another step. The next day he asked me if I knew this guy (let’s call him John). I said I did know him and that he was my friend’s friend. He said John told him that we’re texting and hanging out and asked me to show him my messages with him. There were two messages between me and John, he asked me if my friend and I were coming to a concert that day and I said yes and that was it. It hurt me that he chose to trust him and that he doubted me. I showed him messages and then told him that we’re done. 

A month or two later, I met Dave’s best friend and he told me Dave is still in love with me and that it’s a pity I didn’t give him a chance. He arranged for us to meet again and talk about everything. He admitted what he did was stupid and asked for another chance. We started going out again and then got into relationship. He was the best bf ever for the first 3 months and then he became slightly different. He still assures me he loves me and sometimes talk to me about marriage and stuff like that, but I just feel uncertain when we’re not together. I know it’s my problem and I try to keep myself busy and not think about it. Sometimes I just want to tell him that I miss him and want to see him but I can’t because he’s not this really emotional guy and it makes me kinda embarassed.

95,py3fcm,1632945759,Discussing family problems,"So this is something that comes up often on dates. 

Do you have any siblings? How old are they? What do they do?

I really struggle to answer this truthfully and I’m curious how people would respond to the truth. 

I have a younger brother. He’s 22. He lives at home with my parents and plays video games. Never went to college. Never had a job. 

It’s a difficult subject in my family. They’re both super white collar, so am I, and it just so happens, living in a big city, I end up dating people from a similar background / job as me if not better. 

I am sad to say I’m a little embarrassed. I love my brother and he has so many great qualities but he seems stuck and I have never been able to help him the way he needs. My parents have essentially given up on him. It’s a pretty sad situation because he’s really smart. 

Anyway I hate talking about it not just because it’s embarrassing but it makes me sad and stressed. 

How would you react if someone was open about this on a first date? I feel bad when I kind of lie and just say he lives at home and was in college (he went to community college for a semester I think). It’s not really true. I just don’t like talking about it with someone I don’t know well, and then once I know them better I struggle to bring it up and clarify because I lied.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py3fcm/discussing_family_problems/

98,py3njf,1632946435,The wilted rose (beauty and the beast),"People of reddit allow me to share my story with you for a moment.

I'm 41 years old and I've never been in love or in a long term relationship with anyone. now I'm aware of my shortcomings and the mistakes I've made when searching for my person so maybe in part my situation is partly down to me.

Around April this year I started to notice that I felt switched off and disconnected from the idea of meeting someone, I realised that I'd never really met anyone I connected with in that way and our interests and personalities never matched up.

So around this time my situation changed (I won't go into detail) I felt something I'd never noticed before and suddenly I felt differently, I felt human again like I wasn't just a robot with no emotions, I felt motivated and full of energy, my stress and anxiety vanished and my confidence got back to where it was 10 years ago.

Unfortunately this situation didnt go as planned and I can't help but wonder why? I trusted my gut Instinct this whole time and yet it was wrong despite everything feeling right, how could something feel this right not work out?

Now usually I'd be sad or a bit depressed about things not working out but for the first time in my life I'm not, I feel content that the universe showed me something I felt didn't exist and I genuinely could go happily through life doing my own thing now.

I used to see my dating life like the wilted rose in beauty and the beast and yes the last petal isn't far from falling off, when that happens I will stop putting myself out there but I won't be sad about it.

I did want to put this on my Instagram but the person in question will probably think I'm crazy 😂 I guess I just had to get this out somewhere because I'm an emotional guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py3njf/the_wilted_rose_beauty_and_the_beast/
