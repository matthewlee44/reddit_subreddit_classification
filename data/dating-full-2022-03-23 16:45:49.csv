&gt;Context that might be helpful:  
\- We have met 4 years ago through a mutual friend and have not met since. We realized some similar interests and connected on Instagram and planned to meet up but it fell through. Some months later she hit me up again to meet up (likely in a friendly manner) and we scheduled a date.  
\- When she hit me up she had the idea to meet up with a mutual friend, I said I would rather meet her alone and she seemed enthusiastic about that.  
\- On the date we sat for a meal and talked about our lives for 2 hours, then catched a comedy show that I happened to have tickets for on the day we planned the date. I'd rather have talked for longer rather than watch a show barely connecting with my date, but it is what it is. The end of the date after that was abrupt because it was late and we just went to the car park through a crowd, hugged and left.

So now our relatinoship is kind of friends I respect her relationship, and we are good frinds, it felt like I truly bury my feelings. So fast forward aroun 2 years we are about to graduate and we are becoming closer, but I dont mind that much. One night we start holding hands and she start bringing up if I ever was in love with her, I confess that I was, and next week gave her the letter from 2 years ago. Now all the feelings that I ""buried"" came out and I truly fall in love again, at that time I had been hooking up with a girl for a year, but we werent official since she was 7 years older, so I sent her flying, also she then goes to break up with her BF at the time, which was the guy from other state. We start dating and were in love, at least from my POV, but after we kissed, she stars acting all weierd next weeeks, and then the pandemic started. So basically she took her distance and went really cold, fast forward a year later she now has a BF and was her birthday and got invited to a party since all our friends in common were invited, I also was invited. I decided to go since I truly care for her, and still had feelings,  so when I arrive I recognize that her BF is the ex of the girl that I was hooking up, and they were engaged, so it definetley hit me hard, it felt like a movie or a script. I never told her anything about it and we dont talk much other than the times when we go to a reunions with friends in common, but I am preety sure she knows that her current BF was engaged with my ex hook up.

Its just fucked up how my ex hook up didnt want the other guy, how I didnt want my ex hook up, how my crush didnt want me, and how they end up, and I am the only one with kind of view of the whole story.

I try to describe it as simple and brief as possible, let me know if you have any question and thanks for reading.

He made a post about it under this same thread generating hundreds of comments bashing me for taking this action. This man left out the fact that he has cheated on me multiple times and continuously manipulated his way back to me. He actually hooked up with a woman who I thought was my friends that my ex and I had threesomes with. He also told me he never responded to the girl from the podcast who dm‚Äôd him. Come to find out when the episode aired he actually invited her to come hangout with him. 

I was absolutely done at that point. The parts of me that wanted him disappeared but I agreed to try and be friends. I agreed to this because he lives down the street and I like to end things on a good note. I also informed him that I was with another man the night before. He seemed to be initially fine with that so I agreed to get dinner with him. 

On our way to dinner he proceeded to ask me questions about my interactions with this other man. I was hesitant to answer because I know that is a huge trigger for him. He told me if we‚Äôre going to be friends we could talk about things like this. I made the mistake of believing his word once again. We had dinner and it was a miserable waste of time he barley said a word to me. Then on our way back he proceeded to talk down to me, insinuated that I‚Äôm ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, and told me he never had respect for me or our relationship. Then he became so heated that I was sticking up for myself he decided to speed on the highway and serve between traffic. This was dangerous and extremely scary. When I told him to stop he told me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù. We ended up making it home. 

He asked to come up to my apartment to use the bathroom and I agreed. The last words he said to me were very mixed up telling me he respects me and he was lying, then he told me he has been seeing other women I don‚Äôt know about then took it back. One of the last things I said to him was ‚ÄúI had Steve‚Äôs cum all over my face last night‚Äù. And that was it.

A couple of weeks afterwards we both felt like things had gotten better but as of sometime in January those feelings had crawled back in me. I know the best thing is to break up because I essentially have lost any real romantic feelings for her, it even feels kinda weird or uncomfortable to say I love you. 

The problem is that her life has been pretty shit lately.  A year into our relationship she suddenly was having thoughts of how her previous boyfriend had pretty much molested her on a weekly basis and how she never really talked to anyone about it. Then a couple months later her mom is trying to get out of a mentally abusive marriage and brings my gf's sister to live in out town for a while but while she's here she attempts suicide twice. Then her little sister had a gender identity crisis and wants to be called he/they. Me and my gf don't care and support little sis but mom is super conservative and is rejecting the change and my gf is worried that her sis is gonna get depressed and might hurt herself too. THEN her mom for some reason decided a couple of weeks ago to go back to the abusive husband and take little sis with her and her mom threatened my gf that she couldn't see her sister anymore if she keeps calling her sister he/they. And NOW her best friend is coming out as being depressed and suicidal as well.

So the thing is that I've been trying to help her and make her life easier while going through this cause I'm just a nice person, not as much cause I'm currently her bf.

I'm not sure how to start but I'll just try to give as much context that I think is needed while trying to keep it as short as I can (sorry it ended up longer than I wished).

And a request, please say if you are a man/woman.  I already know how I feel and basically have gotten the same sentiment from guys.  I don't mind hearing from more guys but **I'd like to hear from women** (I can't find a subreddit that will let me post this that is only for women)

* **Our relationship:**

So I met my girlfriend on a dating app a year ago and it things have been pretty great since then. We love each other and she has been saying that she could actually herself spending the rest of her life with me because I treat her so well (she has had some terrible prior boyfriends).  She has been saying things like ""I never wanted to have kids but now I imagine having a family with you"" and smiling and saying ""I'm the one that gets to marry you"".  These things make me happy but at the same time I'm now hurting.

So it all started when we talked for a lot on the dating app, in her words she said I was the only guy who talked to her and not just pushed for a hookup. When I asked her out she agreed to go but then ghosted me, which truthfully really made me sad because I had finally put myself out there after a terrible life changing experience many many years ago and I really liked her. A few days later she apologized and gave me an excuse which was true (well.. only half true now..) and it was always a funny story that I repeat all the time. So we met and as time went by the rest is history.

The problem is that when we were going out she was always saying that she doesn't just meet people on dating apps and does not hook up with people because with sex she has a weird relationship with it (understandably so, I will keep that private though because it is not my place to share but she has been with some really terrible guys). I was in the same boat because women have really been terrible to me and she is the first person I had been with in a long time because I really got hit hard when it comes to dating early in life because of a false rape accusation. I was always afraid to ever talk to women after that, but I told her and showed her some documents and I was afraid because I had never told anyone other than my very close circle about this. But she said she didn't see me differently and said she was sorry that it happened to me because I didn't deserve it, and well she says by the story I said.. I actually was the one who got raped and well my lawyer never wanted to take that route I always kind of thought that too but whatever, since then our relationship has been great and she is the first woman I have trusted completely and am not afraid to be around.

So anyways long story short, it turns out she slept with multiple guys right before me. And truthfully, whatever, a young girl in the city it is almost expected. But what hurt is that she lied to me, but not even that, was that I'm the one who gets ghosted and they didn't. All they did was say ""come over"" and she did and within 24 hours she had sex with both of them and I'm the one who gets ghosted a few days later. It just makes me feel sick, like why me? I had a cool day planned and she just no showed, but the other guys just said ""come over"". Like I'm an attractive, kind, interesting, successful guy etc (her words not mine) but at that time I was the only one to get ghosted.

You see, if that was it, sure fine, but some more things cropped up. The final nail in the coffin that made me just ugh was in the 1st or 2nd month of our relationship there was this one guy she was friends and I had met him a few times. Well she always said she kinda had a crush on him but nothing ever happened. Well, it turns out she had slept with him but I only found that out a few days ago. Sure whatever, but what hurt was when she was drunk at a party I lost her and found her by a couch like straddling him and like all over him. She was super drunk and doesn't remember and I never said anything because I thought it meant nothing. Had I known she had slept with him I would have left her right there.  

Other than that our relationship has been pretty great and is the only reason I haven't just got up and left but it still just has kept me up so much.  She would never cheat on me, truthfully she is afraid I'd be the one to leave her. I said I wouldn't but this whole revelation just hurts.  She is saying it doesn't matter but it isn't just meaningless to me... 

It's just hard to know that our relationship's beginning which we talked about a lot was completely different. She just was looking me in the eyes and knew the truth that I was always laughing about.  

How would you feel if someone lied about this? I just want someone to talk to. I will be talking with her again later today.

* **Some general questions that I just have:**

Why do women throw themselves at guys who just do not care about them?  I am in the camp where I personally think it is just not that good for you.  Guys and women alike.  Like go sleep with people, but just throwing yourself at random people just isn't it.  Because every women who has talked about it with me has regretted it including my girlfriend.  As for guys, I don't think it is good for them either, but just harder and takes more effort.  It is fine to do it here and there sure, but looking for someone who actually cares for you is so much more fulfilling.  But after getting used, assaulted, just not enjoying it why would you continue to do it?  

* **Main question I do not understand:**

And one of my main questions why I'm here is because I don't understand why women say one thing but do another.  Why do they go out of their way to go with guys who they know are terrible and only want sex?  Like my girlfriend specifically wanted someone good to stick around but was going to see guys that were giving her one word answers while for instance me gets ghosted.

It's why I don't take dating advice like this from women and just do my own thing, I stay true to myself because I am kind to everyone.  But I never have taken woman's advice because almost every time they have said what they should say but their actions are completely different.  I don't blame them, but it does confuse me.

So yeah, this ended up longer than I waned but I can only trim so much.  I just want to have a cordial conversation with some people that can help me understand this all.  Thank you.

He states he never reaches out to her first, but he will still agree to FaceTime to listen to her play and give feedback.

After that only 1 or 2 bother to try and meet or keep up. 

Well I kinda hit a really good stride 2 weeks ago. I met a girl we can call her M. Now M and I have been talking  for a while and she wanted to finally hang. She has made several mentions that she is trying to ease into dating as a single parent as it is all new to her. After about a week of on off texting she wants to hang. I proceed to pick her up. She‚Äôs a little drunk I refuse her advances sexually because taking advantage of a drunk woman isn‚Äôt really my style. She starts guilt tripping me and starts turning up her sexual forwardness. I repeatedly try and disengage but I‚Äôm only human. I ask her to give me consent in written form if she really wants me to do anything. She quickly and gladly does so. Come to find out the next morning she remembers literally nothing. Apparently a few more drinks hit her system by the time we were got to my house. She isn‚Äôt tripping about it and mentions several times that she woke up with a smile on her face despite not remembering much so it doesn‚Äôt make her feel odd or uncomfortable. She goes back to her busy life and we talk every now and then and she still has interest in seeing me at some point once her life settles down. Her mom is is in the hospital and she is currently moving into a house and getting herself situated. 
I‚Äôm interested mentally and physically and she seems to be stable minded. She has plans and wants to move slowly. I guess I don‚Äôt mind it so much. There are days when she won‚Äôt even respond to me until hours and hours (more like 8 or 9 hours) later which annoys me because it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs trying to solidify my place as a booty call that she talks to when she‚Äôs bored. Sexually I feel we are very compatible and truly she is very attractive but she is also very closed off to herself and her own life. I feel like she is open to letting me in because she makes attempts but in my opinion it feels sometimes as if I‚Äôm being ignored. It‚Äôs been like this since the day we first talked so I guess I shouldn‚Äôt mind it so much. I have her on my Fb friends list and I see her on posting stuff or on messenger but she hardly ever has enough time to respond to simple texts. She‚Äôs been trying to call me more though when she‚Äôs driving all night but it feels like it‚Äôs more for her benefit as she claims it helps her stay awake during her overnight Uber eats job. 


Then I meet a girl we shall call K. She‚Äôs wild, Down to earth, amazing personality, a little out there sometimes but she‚Äôs possibly the most attractive woman I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on. She even acknowledges that she is hot and definitely a little crazy as the stereotype fits. She‚Äôs Hispanic with Native American which are both my absolute favorite ethnicities. I find that I want to spend every possible moment with her and she understands my excitement for her. She‚Äôs hot af but she wants her freedom. She is more receptive to texting and communicating whereas with M she makes time when she feels like it which is almost always at her leisure. K doesn‚Äôt like sex very much. She has mentioned several times through vague responses that she just wants to enjoy her life with friendship whenever I ask or hint at me wanting possibly more. She is patient and I like that about her. I am slowly accepting that she wants to stay single even though is sucks. She is also really off her rocker sometimes when she does whippets like speaking to imaginary ghosts but I do like her when she‚Äôs not doing that. She‚Äôs sweet to me and is very understanding.
I just don‚Äôt wanna be another ‚Äúfriend‚Äù if she‚Äôs doing these ‚Äúfriend‚Äù things with other people. I like exclusivity. 

Both very beautiful women popped up in my life and neither of them want much of anything outside of being friends that they can hook up with if it feels right. Each with their own flaws. One doesn‚Äôt like sex the other doesn‚Äôt like communicating and I‚Äôm stuck in the middle of it like wtf. They both know I‚Äôm dating other women. K wants me to make sure I use a condom with other women so we don‚Äôt have to and M wants the same‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Without a doubt I‚Äôm in another dry spell with dating apps as I‚Äôm waiting for some one with some of these qualities they have but more availability emotionally.

I have been understanding towards some of the girls that have told me that based on why they say they are busy, but others I question whether or not they are actually busy. 

The thing that bothers me is why would you even make an online profile to go on dates if you're too busy to do so??!! Why take the time to talk to someone, get to know them and then decide they're too busy to go any further, leaving the the other person led on?

I work part-time, go to college, hang out with friends, work out, am focused on making music and other hobbies like hiking, and I still can make the time for a relationship.

I am positive that some girls that have said they are too busy actually aren't and move on to another person, but I don't want to assume that all the time because I want to give the benefit of the doubt if they are actually busy, thus the dilemma.

This has caused me a lot of stress, anxiety, disappointment, and wonder as to what actually is going on with them.

Thought this was interesting, and I do think discourse on it could help both men and women out.

From the perspective of a guy she makes valid points: the current social climate is about talking up your independence as a woman, memes about horny guys are everywhere, the fact all men regardless of social standing are evil etc. 

Another big one is body shaming. If the sausage don't measure up, you didn't trim your fat, aren't the best sex of her life you get publicly shamed. It's accepted to post about impotence and bad one nights, it's accepted to shove it in the man's face, when women cheat there's often some level of praise that comes with it (my mother cheated on my father simply to humiliate him, her own words, my girlfriend's friend laughed and talked herself up for cheating on multiple guys who she no trouble admitting she played). 

On top of that we always see how visibly annoyed women are when an uninteresting guy tries to talk to them. With positive movements aimed at ending harassment men are also less inclined to simply try flirting or having a conversation. 

Guarantee most men would be surprised or confused about what the Tiktokers saying- we're surrounded by words, jokes and events that tell us women would rather not be spoken to when they're out with friends or at a bar. Is it really fair to expect men to come to you with open arms after knowing what's seen and said online daily? For some theybdont wanna face public shaming, some they don't wanna have an embarrassing night in bed, some are just being respectful, some really do hate the rejection. 

And no I'm not coming from a political or incel mindset, nobody's a villain here, just think it's an interesting societal thing to comment on. And again, perhaps discourse can help both men and women out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164374,public,self,Found an interesting video.

I'm a 43 year old male.  I counted the number of job interviews I've had verses the number of jobs.  34 interviews.  31 jobs.  One job I turned down after interviewing.  They went with someone else for the other two.  So I've been offered the job 32 out of 34 times I've interviewed.  So it seems I do pretty well in job interviews.

On the other hand, I've been on so many first dates I've literally lost count.  I wanted a second date on every one of them, as far as I can remember, but I've only managed to get a 2nd date 3 times.

I feel relaxed and confident whether it's a job interview or a date.  I don't get nervous.  My internal mindset is the same.  I'm just as affable and sincere for both.  I'm interested, but not desparate or overeager.  I'm more open to talking up my accomplishments in a job interview since it's expected, whereas on dates I'm more inclined to let them uncover stuff about myself rather than try to brag.

She doesn't do it to the other ladies at work just me.

Things have been going well and we‚Äôve almost been seeing each other for 3 months now. I have noticed a change in our texting patterns though. Up until about a month ago we would have lots of long back and forth texts and I could almost feel she was excited to hear from me and text me back. 

Lately our texting has been much shorter and I can almost sense a ‚Äúless excited‚Äù vibe in them. Mind you, we have been seeing each other a lot recently, and I‚Äôve began hanging out with her friends and going out with them altogether.

She says she is happy she‚Äôs with me (which is clearly validated by us spending lots of time together) but I‚Äôm just wondering is it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as part of an earth relationship where the initial ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù phase of someone new kind of wanes and the texting (or any communication when we‚Äôre not together) kind of slows down? Just curious if anyone has experience with this.

but then the one who come up with the voucher con i live with my aunt but she working away from home i look after her kids if your coming  around to hookup you will need to forward steam voucher for the kids to  use in a friends house while you are around ..( do people fall for this )  just email me the voucher code first.. 

and was told by a mate never to give out any phone numbers ,email  address, facebook details or instragram as his mate from work had fallen  into a trap where he was swapping details back and too and the person  said unless he sends cash would foward detail to all his family and all  friends ( he did not pay ) but thats just messed up. 

and i have 6 or 7 so far that where using photos of porn stars account  pictures and other models never get to the point why they are doing this  ( but alway want to go to another chat client ) why dont poeple check photo\`s online or do the old send me a picture holding a sign or more than two fingers ( which ends the chat most times ) 

 are we all having the same problem or does it happen more to older men  like me thinking i have loads of spare cash ( i wish ) and always its  what do you do for a living in the first few questions ( is cash the  only thing men are good for ) sorry for the moan but good to vent...
