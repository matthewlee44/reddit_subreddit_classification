So I (27M) have been struggling entering the dating game in a new city, and some repeat issues have me questioning whether my scope on life is having a negative impact on my romantic ventures.    


Quick backstory -- I was in the Army and got hurt.  The Army retired me (Full pension, healthcare for me and my dependents for the rest of my life, with a bunch of rad benefits that I am fortunate to receive) at 24.  I've spent the last few years dealing with my health and have finally gotten to a point that I feel like I can participate in a healthy and fulfilling relationship.   


I am legally able to work on top of the pension income, and honestly if I had to, I could!  I got a degree in business while working on myself and have the capacity to be able to work, but here is where I have begun questioning myself.    


I just purchased my first home, and my pension is more than adequate to afford me a modest lifestyle.  I own a 2019 Honda Accord with no payments, i have no debt whatsoever and while i'm not going out to eat every night I have plenty of room for entertainment and dating.  I have no need to work right now.  I wake up every morning when I feel like it.  No stress to be anywhere (unless i have an appointment)  everything is on my time.  That being said, I dedicate a lot of time to self improvement.  I go to the gym every morning, and i spend my days working on an endless list of hobbies.  I have recently been working on calligraphy, basic woodworking, guitar, coding, photography and exploring my new city.  I've made it my mission to try something new every few months and i've learned SO much doing so.  It's surprising how many people you can relate to and bond with when you know a little bit about so many things.   


I've been on a few dates, but so far 4 out of the 5 women i've met have said they weren't interested because I don't work.  Last night, I got a text saying that I was nice, but I wasn't ambitious and that was a red flag.  It hit me pretty hard because she's right, I have pretty much zero ambition to grow professionally.  All my needs are met with excess, and living a stress free lifestyle is far more attractive than having more money at the expense of losing time that I could be spending doing things i actually want to do.  I feel like my ambition to better myself doesn't matter, and ""ambition"" only refers to professional achievements or money.    


I guess i'm just looking for validation that the time I'm spending making myself happy is more valuable than giving away that time for more money.  It feels like i'm going to need to work and be unhappy in order to attract someone and that feels wrong on so many levels.

Two of them translated to long-term relationships and engagement. However, it seems like me being a half decent person has worked against me. 

In some cases, men I dated became very very controlling later on. And me being an empathetic person did not help containing that behavior. 

I got back into dating earlier this year, and went on some six dates with this one guy. His parting words for me were that I was ""too sweet"". He was looking for a candy and not the whole bag. He needed someone rational. 

I have never had my friends tell me that I'm irrational. I consider myself to be a realist. 

Since when did dressing up real nice for dates, buying thoughtful presents when the occasion arose and complimenting your date for the right reasons, become unfashionable. 

To keep things objective, here are some examples of things I did that made my date angry:

1. On date number five with this guy, I had a friend prepare some of his favorite dishes, because I don't know how to cook. I packed those dishes and dropped it off at his place.

2. I made too much eye contact while talking or too little eye contact.

3. I dress up too much for our dinner dates even though I dress down for brunch and lunch. 

He needs someone more practical. My heart hurts because this is the bare minimum effort for me. I didn't go above &amp; beyond to make him happy. I send flowers to my girl friends at their workplace when they are down. I believe in the goodness of gestures. I believe in creating safe spaces for people around me so that they can be themselves free of judgemental.

Since then I'm meeting him for lunch and a hangout and he's also invited me up to the city and to meet his brothers and doggo!

I am kinda out of the loop and not very active on social media rn. 
Whats going on is that 3 weeks ago i met a girl very randomly and we’ve been texting non stop and have gone out 4 times total. We haven’t kissed but she almost did kiss me, BUT also, she touched me. She flirts heavily and i am falling for her very fast. The tension is hard to resist. 


The thing is i literally just found out that she is tiktok ‘famous’ and is in a relationship with another girl. + I checked her background and she has previously been in a messy, toxic relationship where she cheated and then got a third girl involved and just like so so so much drama. 

The situation seems to be scary tbh and i dont know what to do. If from one side my heart is broken because of what i’ve found out, the other side of me just keeps wanting her. I crave her literally the whole time and i cant stop thinking about the insane connection we have. The way she is with me, like super cute, interesting, charming. 
I remember the second time we went out she invited me at her place and we sat for 20 minutes straight staring at the walls, and it felt good. Cause we were both so electric and in ecstasy because we were next to each other. 

Above i said she touched me and what i meant by that is that the third we met up we briefly went shopping cause i needed something and i tried the dress on, let her inside my cabin when i was done and i was looking at myself in the mirror and she was behind me, with her breath on my neck. And while we were looking at each other trough the mirror she made her hand slip trough my whole body and she squeezed both my breast and then my thigh. I was in complete shock. Electrified. And she never stopped making eye contact. She just knows what shes doing. I am completely falling for her. 


Plus she always remembers EVERYTHING i say and keeps baking stuff i like and gifting me things i mention even if its silly stuff. She literally shows me sooo much love its insane. 


I dont know what to do. I dont know if i should tell her that i know about her gf. I dont want her to distance herself from me. I know it isn’t okay cause duh, she has a gf but my mind and body are craving her and i just can’t stop that. I am attracted to her in a way i cant explain. I don’t think i can help myself. I dont think i can retain myself from this. I literally dont know how things will turn out, how it will end up, if she would even leave her gf, why she hasn’t left her yet, why she hasnt been honest about being ina relationship...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131362,public,self,Girl is flirting with me F20 and i am falling for her.

I noticed a pattern in my dating behaviour. I go on dates, sometimes I have sex on the first date, everything seems good to me and I think my date also enjoyed himself. I leave the date with a high, feeling relaxed, great about myself, sexy and desired. and I think about how proud I am of myself for being so chill, and feeling excited for something casual. 
and then the high dissapears within 24 hours and if the guy hasnt texted me yet I get crazy anxiety, my head is buzzing, I feel a heavyness in my chest and I feel like freaking out. and then, as the empowerd woman I claim to be, text the guy first. something chill like „i had a good time, hope you too, lets do that again!“ and I dont receive a reply. I freak out and feel like puking, fall into a sad hole, question myself and never want to date again. I start regretting having had sex and think about how it can be that I am still so soulcrushingly single, even though 24 hours prior I was loving that I had sex, felt feministic and empowered, and just wanted something casual. 
 And after a few weeks I forget all about it and it starts again with another guy.

I dont really know how I can change that. How do I handle rejection better? And how do I not depend that much on confirmation after a date? Also, why am I being ghosted so often, I really dont get it. Do I perceive dates so differently than my dates? Why are my emotions changing so rapidly? Do I really just want something casual or am I lying to myself?

I have been trying to meet a lady online now for 3-4 years. I have had no luck whatsoever. I am always respectable. I always make my TRUE intentions known. Those intentions are that I am in no rush but that my ultimate goal is a serious long term relationship that could someday hopefully lead to marriage - No BTW I do not talk about marriage at all in the beginning, I am very well versed in ensuring I don't scare anyone away seeming clingy or weird - Like talking about looking for a wife in the first message, etc.   
I usually start out discussing what I am looking for, asking her what she is looking for. What I am interested in, and vice versa. Normal, healthy and intelligent conversation. Once we get that out of the way, I will usually ask her when she would be willing to go out and do something interesting. I always make it known that her comfort is my priority, if she isnt happy with some place I would be interested in taking her, I am always open to suggestions, etc. I am very laid back. It seems like NONE OF THIS MATTERS. I can hardly ever get lady that is actually my type to answer messages, and if they do, I can get them to continue to talk even less, and IF I DO happen to get them to continue talking for more then a night, or a few messages. Getting them to agree to meet? Damn near impossible..

 I have a therapist who is about 34 and she is pretty damn attractive (as a gauge only for this conversation) and even she says its just how people are, has also given me some stories about what she went through, to help me better understand what women go through online. But I am not doing that?! I am not acting like that, because it is NOT who I am. But I am loosing the interest. I am a strong person, but getting let down over and over, and honesty straight getting my heart broken multiple times is making me not even want to try dating anymore.  
Also don't get me started on trying to meet a women in public, that is nearly guaranteed (95%) to be a let down, or a rejection in the form of a lie that she isn't single (usually)

My job is hardly a big thing so please don't just stop in and say ""Don't shit where you eat"". I'm completely over that.

Feel free to look at my post history (I think I only have 1 other post haha). I originally asked for advice on whether or not a girl was expecting to have sex or be intimate with me. She seemed very interested in me, and I still think she is. 

At work, we flirt with each other alot. Comment on how the other looks, point out something sexual, talk dirty, and sometimes we maintain eye contact within like a foot of each other for extended periods of time. 

I asked her out last week after about a month and a half of overthinking it and she was very receptive to it. I offered to cook dinner for her one night. She kept asking me if I still wanted to come over and was teasing me about it in a playful way.

Now to start with where I'm starting to have my doubts. Maybe completely unfounded, but like I said, I overthink and overanalyze to my detriment. The day the date was supposed to happen, she texted me in the morning and she had a family emergency with her brother. I know this wasn't a lie and didn't hold against her or anything. I told her it's unfortunate and I was really looking forward to tonight, to which she responded ""I was really looking forward to it too😞"". I basically just said if everything is okay by the next day I'm available, just hit me up. She said she would and that was basically the end of that conversation.

The next day, I asked how her and her brother were doing. Eventually I asked if she thought Monday was gonna be possible. She said it should be be everything ends up okay. I ended by simply saying, ""Alright, just hmu if it all goes well""

DISCLAIMER: I felt like I needed to add this in here. This is the only time I've asked her and I don't think I'm being pushy or selfish. I know things happen outside of your control and while I am disappointed we weren't able to have our date, I know what she's going through now is more important, so I really don't want to be annoying about it.

Today was the day of our backup date and she hasn't responded yet. I've read all the FAQ and websites on what to do in this situation: She cancelled but offered to reschedule. Ask her whatever day works for her and leave the ball in her court and let her take the lead, which other than asking her the other day, I have and haven't texted her since.

I know I'm probably overanalyzing this which I why put that in the title and I'm trying not to think about but it's hard not to. At the very least I'm not constantly hitting her up saying ""Today? Today? Today?"" so that's a start😂.

TL;Dr
* girl I've basically been in the ""talking stage"" in for about 2 weeks (but have known about 6 months) accepts my offer to come over to her house

* Something unexpected comes up and she has to cancel but offers to reschedule. We both agree we're disappointed.

* I text her the day before the reschedule date to ask if her if she thinks tomorrow is possible. She hopes so, but can't promise anything.

* Today is the day of the reschedule and I haven't heard back from her and I'm really getting in my head over it, but also am refraining from being annoying or clingy about the whole thing.

We had a date planned for when I got back, but my return got delayed another couple weeks. At this point it will be almost 6 weeks before I get to see her again.

Now we still communicate, text like once a day, and we do a video chat hangout once a week. I feel this is great and I feel our online hangouts are going well.

The only thing is I feel like I'm struggling to keep my romantic intentions known. The online hangouts are great, but obviously I cant make any physical contact. And it feels like its really easy to fall into this ""friend"" pattern, and that's something I want to avoid. I mean, I try to compliment her and talk about plans we might make, but it also feels weird to just shower her with compliments.

So I guess my question is, do I just straight up say I'm still interested in her romantically and really want to take her out, even if its a little out of the blue. Or am I overthinking this and just keep doing what were doing, and just wait till we actually see her in person to make more progress. I just don't want to lose this chance since I really want to see where this can go.

As a disclaimer, I do have a fear of abandonment and I have been working it out in therapy. However, I still find that finding someone who will stay with me when we are having an argument / working through a conflict helps. Finding someone who knows your triggers is so helpful and even having someone stay there beside me is helpful.

I don't think someone just being there will fix anything but from my perspective, I am used to people leaving when things get bad and that is traumatizing. Someone that can stay with me is really helpful and even if we are not talking and just sitting there in silence, even that means the world to me.

Basically, over this summer I (f) was going through a lot and was dating multiple men at once to try and fill some sort of void and escape my emotions. To clarify, these were never serious dates, nothing was exclusive and I truly don’t believe I was “cheating” on anyone. However, I decided that I’m not this kind of person, I don’t like “playing the field” because to me I felt guilty and still felt like I was unofficially cheating. 

My cousin gave me the advice to pick one if I wanted and see how things played out with one person instead of leading on all three. I chose the one I had spoken to the longest and had the most in common with. The second guy (went on two dates in a month) I ended things with. It was very amicable, no hard feelings I think, I just essentially said I wanted to be friends, he understood but made it clear he wasn’t comfortable being only friends since he wanted to work towards something more than that. I totally understood, we wished each other well and went our separate ways. The third guy is irrelevant to this story. 

This first guy I continued dating for several months blah blah blah. Turns out we didn’t have the same views on relationships so we ended things as well, on good terms, no trauma or whatnot lol. 

I went to therapy to deal with my shit, got myself sorted and now I can’t stop thinking about guy #2 (he’s the same age as me if that makes any difference). I don’t think I’m rebounding since it’s been several months since I ended things with the first guy. Me and the second guy seemed to connect and I had fun when we went out. I think I just maybe chose the wrong one to pursue? 

I was thinking of texting guy #2 to ask if he’d be interested in me taking him out for coffee, apologizing and saying I regret my decision and think I made a mistake. 

I wasn’t going to tell him essentially I chose someone else because I think it’s hurtful and unnecessary unless he blatantly asks because I don’t want to lie. 

But my question is, based on this info, do you guys think I deserve a second chance?

We met on bumble and both were looking for longterm relationships. We used to go out once or twice a week and got along really really well. I've gone over her house and met her mom and grandparents too, as well as she came to my friends halloween party.

I do really like her, we love so many of the same things, and we would talk for longer than I had ever talked to anyone else in a single go too, but lately I feel like on her part she hasn't really put anything in towards relationship wise. We have kissed but its only when I had asked if I could kiss her when she had dropped me off back home. She hasn't done it herself. I'm very big into physical touch,(one of my top 3 love languages) even just hand holding, cuddling, or leaning up against one another, and I know she doesn't like touching whatsoever when she's tired(and she usually is always tired).

Lately our schedules just haven't been matching up at all to go out too(if she works one day she doesn't want to go out at all) I tried to bring myself to talk to her last time we went out but I just couldn't bring myself to it.
I don't want to talk to her about the physical touch thing cause I feel I will be an a** saying I want physical touch but I know I have to say something soon I'm just so nervous and anxious its killing me.

Been mostly focusing on myself and thinking about what I want in a long term partner. I downloaded bumble during the summer and was using it on and off, went on a few dates here and there but nothing substantial. 

I started swiping on bumble a few days ago out of boredom and I matched with this guy (25M) who I had instant chemistry with. The text messages were back and forth and we got each other’s humour like we shared a brain. Once we got to know each other a bit better, we realized that we’re both looking for the same things (long term partner, family, similar values). We haven’t met yet, but so far we’ve been talking for two days and spoke on the phone twice. I’m meeting him on Friday. 

However the longer we talk the more I doubt, I know we haven’t met yet but I keep thinking that if we’re not truly compatible then it’s better to end it sooner than later. There’s a few things that I’m unsure about;
- I recently got a promotion where I’ll be making a good amount of money (88k). He just got into the tech field and is working as a recruiter, his current salary is 45k but he says he will make six figures in 2-3 years based on his plan to move up in the company. I want to be with someone who makes at least as much as I do.
- When we talk on the phone, it feels more disconnected than over text. I feel like he talks about himself a lot and I find it difficult to get a word in, there’s not as much back and forth.

I’m not sure if I just have rose coloured glasses on and I’m making this more than it is. Since my break up, I’m careful about getting too excited over a potential prospect, my ex portrayed himself as a great guy with all these great qualities but the relationship quickly deteriorated once we got serious. I’m worried about making the same mistake. 
I’m also not sure if we really do have chemistry? Especially if the phone calls are awkward at times. It seems like we have the same long term goals and values. He takes his job very seriously and wants to make good money in the future. I’m worried I’ll fall for this guy who may not be a good match for me and it’ll end in another heartbreak.

I recently went on one date with a guy who I met online. A few days after the date, he texted me asking if I enjoyed it, because he couldn’t tell if I had fun or not. I said I did. He then asked if we could have a second date and I agreed. Then, a few days after that, he messaged me asking if I had plans for the upcoming weekend. I said I might be going out sometime, and I thought he was going to reply with plans. 

He told me my message was “vague”. I asked him to clarify, and he said that I didn’t specify where or with whom I was going with, but it “didn’t matter”, and that maybe I am just a “hard to read person”. 

I mainly didn’t specify because we’ve only been on one date, so I don’t feel like it’s reasonable for him to expect me to not date anyone else at this point. I did think it would be kind of rude to blatantly mention going on other dates, so I just kept it vague. He’s also shown a hint of possibly being clingy. Before the first date, while we were still texting, I once didn’t reply for a few hours in the evening, and he made a joke about me not replying because I must be on a date with someone else.

Want to get back into the online dating scene but it usually goes like this:

1.	Get some matches and try to strike up a conversation.
2.	I’ll message and either get no reply or get ghosted after a few messages.
3.	 Any remaining matches I’ll try to set up a date and either get ghosted there or sometimes meet irl.
4.	 Most of the time after the first date I think “that went pretty well” then get ghosted.
