It wasn’t until I took ownership of my situation, and realized that there were things about myself that I needed to change, that things began improving. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s also freeing. You realize you have control over most aspects of your life. 

- “I’m ugly.” There is a difference between being physically attractive and naturally good looking. Being physically attractive involves being in shape, wearing clothes that fit, having good posture and body language, being well groomed. Being physically attractive, which you have control over, is more important than being naturally good looking.

- “I’m short.” There are some women who put emphasis on height, and there’s nothing you can do about that. Move on. You see short guys with beautiful women all the time. The height requirement is usually a fabrication of the online dating world. A gregarious personality and confidence is far more powerful than height. 

- “I’m shy.” This isn’t a static quality. Being introverted and shy aren’t one in the same. It’s extremely uncomfortable, but you have to ask yourself if you really want to change. Being shy is the single biggest inhibitor to social success. If you can’t function socially, you should pursue therapy, or even medication if a mental health professional feels it’s necessary.

I (f,24) am out of 4 year old relationships. This has been a very serious ones, we were engaged and publicly very official. 

So first years of relationships with my ex, he was in the university for some program and had a group of classmate with whom he’d hang out, around 15 people. He wasn’t close with everyone but there were sometimes big gatherings where everyone would come and spend some time together. 

There was a guy (let’s call him B) with whom my ex was an acquaintance but never friends. We all (my fiancé brought me to the events, as many people would bring there significant other) hang out maybe 4 times. Including once when we went to this (B’s) house for a big barbecue party. Me and him were never flirty, max of what we could do was some friendly small talk, I did kind of like him but I’d never cross the line as I was in relationship. Even for my fiancé it was never more than that, they never hang out one to one.  

He was on my fb page and would like any of  pics I post but many good acquaintances are this way. Then, when we broke up I got on dating apps. Once I saw that this guy was on bumble and that he gave me a like. Then I also was on tinder, saw him and gave him a like too. It was a month ago when we matched. A month after he He messaged me :”Am I wrong or we have met some time before?”. 

I honestly didn’t expect him to message and I decided to go with a joke too. I said: “not sure, but I’m getting a feeling we might have met before” , he’s like : “ abc  bar in xyz location possibly?” I’m like “most likely”. And final was that he’s like “ wanna meet for a drink over the weekend and talk about it?” And we set the meeting. So basically everyone understands everything but it’s all been a joke manner :D 

I’m thinking whether it’s okay to go out with or is it too much including the fact they never were friends and I like him and could give it a chance to talk and see how it goes? I feel that it is.

So theirs this girl that I’ve liked for quite a while and snap chatting quite a bit. This girl knows I like her.A week ago she asked if she could FaceTime me. We FaceTimed and she told me about how she wanted to break up with her boyfriend and how he was horrible but that she didn’t know how or if she could. I told her that if he is making her feel shit and all it’s not worth it and she should but ultimately it was her decision. She texted me the next day saying. I’m meeting him now I’m going to end it. When I asked her how it went she said I’m really sorry but I didn’t end it were on a break and I’m gonna see what happens over Christmas. 

So that Friday night I FaceTime her and we talk for hours, it was never awkward and we laughed and it was amazing. We didn’t speak at all about the other guy and just spoke about our random shit. We spoke about a wierd guy in her year that has a huge crush on her and bought her a giant teddy bear, to which she said jokingly you have tough competition. Two days later we FaceTimed again also great. Then yesterday we agreed at around lunch time to FaceTime again that night. She didn’t reply to my snap for hours so I asked her that night if everything was alright. She said “yeah yeah sorry ahah “ this confused me quite a bit so I just left it at that.

This morning she texted me said hey you good ? I said yeh everyday alright how r u. She said something like. Idk I feel a bit wierd sorry we didn’t call Yesterday. 

We haven’t organised to FT tonight and I don’t know what to do. I really like this girl and I don’t just wanna be her friend if you know what I mean.

Very quickly we moved from the app to exchanging phone numbers and texting. Sometime during texting she asked me what I was looking for from this and I replied by saying I’m a kind of person who likes to go with the flow. I suggested let’s meet and see where it goes. But  while she agreed to meet she made it clear that she is not looking for anything serious but “something friendly…something casual”. And I was completely ok with this (I completely understand that not everyone on the dating app is looking for a relationship). As I also like to make new friends, we kept texting (mostly goofy memes and gifs nothing flirty or serious). Last Sunday both of us didn’t have any plans so I suggested we can go to watch a movie and maybe grab a drink afterwards (now by this point in time, she was in my buddy zone and I had completely stopped thinking about her as potential date). As planned we went for a movie and a beer afterwards really enjoyed our conversation but in my mind we were just two friends hanging out. 
Meanwhile I had matched with other girl on the same dating app and I was having some sporadic conversations with her. Today I received a message from the first girl saying she just realized she and one of her friends were dating a same guy. Now as any normal friend would do I laughed at her message (now in retrospect maybe insensitive). Then after entire day of silence I received a message something on the lines of how dare I date her and her friend (the other girl I matched, who I haven’t even met yet)simultaneously and laugh about it to her face. So, now I was super confused about who misread this entire situation is my interpretation of “something friendly and casual” was wrong?

So, recently I’ve been back in the dating world (F-27) and I’ve been on a few dates. Some bad, some good. However, on the dates that I do like, I’ve noticed that men seem disappointed that I don’t put out on the first date.

I like to wait a few dates before sex, even if I’ve invited them over to hangout. For me personally, I have to have a connection with a person and feel comfortable with them. Which I can not achieve on just one date. 

For example, I had a date over the other day and we spent several hours picking each others brains and before he left we made-out. I did let him touch my chest and I think he took that as me wanting sex (he put his hand between my legs) and I said I’d like to wait a few more dates before we go there. He seemed frustrated and awkwardly left. I’ve noticed this with a few other guys. It’s like they automatically lose interest.

I felt bad as if I wasted his time or something but I did mention earlier that day I prefer to wait a few dates. 

Anywho, am I wrong that I like to wait and would prefer just basic intimacy on a first date and build up to going all the way?  

I feel so pressured for immediate sex these days, like people don’t know what to do with each other if they’re not having sex.

1. After school one day, we walked out together and I told him I park in the same spot every morning. He jokingly told me he'd remember so that he can steal it from me one morning. (This one is a stretch, I know)
2. He was going to an event one weekend with his sister and she invited me to tag along. I couldn't go and later found out that my friends went to the same event. I told him about this and he said ""See?! You should have come with us!"" (Also a stretch)
3. We were hanging out and talking in the hallway with his sister. We were all dressed in movie character outfits and his sister noticed my nails matched my outfit. She asked ""Did you REALLY get your nails done just to match?"" I told her ""Nooo. I've been wanting to get this color for awhile now and it just worked out this way!"" He says ""That's adorable.""
4. My team and I were discussing Secret Santa because another coworker of ours has him as their Secret Santa assignment and didn't know what to get him. Work bestie (his sister) was listing things off that he likes and I added ""Oh he really likes Spiderman"" and my team lead playfully says ""Oooo so you really know a lot about \*blank\*, huh?"" Later, I give work bestie a car ride home and this comes up in convo. She tells me her family has mentioned the same thing to him at home because we are close in age and have similar interests. We joke around about the fact that we hardly know each other. I blanked when she told me this so I didn't think about asking her what his reaction is.

Is this cheesy or lower effort? Should I not get her a gift altogether?

So I’ve been talking to 38F for a while and she suggested this coming weekend that we go out on a date to get to know each other. I’ve agreed but I’m trying to decide what might be a good date idea for us.

I’m not interested in age gap comments. We both are just looking for something short-term right now and our conversations have been good. I’ve also been told constantly that I look in my 30s-40s so I’m not worried about her “looking weird” being out with me.

Where I live, masks mandates are limited only to in businesses. I’ve been considering getting lunch/dinner but that sounds cliche. I considered walking in a park but it’s supposed to rain all week and I’ve got injured knees from sports when I was younger so the weather reaggravating my injuries combined with prolonged walking would tend to make me limp.

So we meet in August and only had 3 dates which all were amazing, I had sex with him the first but he still acted really into me and was extremely romantic.

Then my dad died and I went through a manic episode and ghosted him because I didn’t want him to see me that way. 

So fast forward last Friday I sent him a long text that I was sorry. He understood and he invited me to a house party. 

He introduced me to his friends as his girlfriend (which was surprising), and the whole night he was saying how he would want me to come back, texting me and thought about me non stop. He was very happy that whole night. He slept over my house and that was that. 

So now last night, he came over, he was smoking a cigarette outside and I was gonna ask him something. I saw he was texting someone on hinge. 

I acted like I didn’t see it. I don’t like it but at the same time there was no DTR, and we just reunited literally 3 days prior.

&amp;#x200B;

Broke up with my girlfriend half a year ago and still miss her a lot. I've been looking for some company since then, but it's hard for me to meet people because i'm really not a social person.

I've had a lot of gay men try to approach me, but i'm completely heterosexual.

Some women have shown some interest, but I wasn't into them at all every single time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to think that it's because of my looks. My gay friend told me that I don't look gay at all though, on the contrary. So i don't understand why I attract men much more than women, and why among all the women I could like, none actually seemed to like me ?

I feel really bad about the whole thing, about my role in everything. 

For one I was never really into her the same way she liked me.  She was an attractive woman, but I still wasnt attracted to her, at least not nearly as she acted towards me. 

 I'm really not good about letting someone know that I'm not into them, at least without being rude and hurting them, which I didnt want to do.  And she was really bad at taking hints.  I would take long to respond to texts, try to tell her I was going to be busy, that sort of thing...

But over time things just became more serious on their own, even after telling her that i wanted more time to myself. 

 It got to the point that she basically stayed every night at my house.

Aside from letting things get so out of hand like that,  I was running around with other girls at the beginning of ou relationship.  I did eventually stop and made the decision to be faithful, but she eventually became suspicious because she would go through my phone and must have seen some old texts or something.

I really worry about her though, like whatever happened to her and what's going to happen to her.  I dont know what she ever saw in me, but shes just too nice and I feel like shes going to get hurt again and taken advantage of.

Previously it was going really well: great dates, amazing conversations, thoughtful, and the sex was incredible. He was planning future outings and even wanted me to come and see him when he goes away for work. We were honest about what we wanted which was obviously different things. He said he loves spending time with me, all that stuff and I said jokingly “you want your cake and eat it too huh?” And he said “Yea I kinda do”.

&amp;#x200B;

So 6 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 months, we were really in love but because I felt I wasn't good enough or emotional ready to handle her. She had said she loved me more than anyone, that she'd wait for me, I told her not to wait for me because I don't know how long it would take for me to fix myself. For the next couple of months after break up, she would email me now and then.

A few weeks ago she emails me, saying she is doing a clear out of her clothes, she didn't want to bin my favourite jumper, and said she could send it to me if I gave her my address. But I wanted to see her, so said I'd come get it.  I wanted to tell her that I'm better and I still love her and would love to get back together again.  When I saw her, I was so happy to see her again, we chatted, we had laughs, as if nothing had happened before.  But I saw a polaroid on her tv unit, I couldn't see it properly, I asked who is that, your nephew?  She looked at it for a good minute before she replied and said it was her boyfriend.  I felt a massive sting in me, so I grabbed my jumper and said I was going.

For the next few days, we are messaging each other,  and I decided that I should give her her birthday present and card that I had for her before we broke up (her birthday is in August).   I sent it to her with a letter, explaining that breaking up with her is my biggest regret, and I wish that I never let her go.  But she couldn't read it until after work, so she read the letter and it made her cry, said the card and present were lovely.  She said, she is frustrated that it took me so long to say what she had wanted to hear all this time, she said she had gotten into this relationship still being in love with me but wanted to get over me, and if I had got back to her 3 months ago, she would have been with me again but she is dating this guy and she loves him and wants to see where it goes.  I'm pretty much hurting, cause I was frustrated at myself, and that the girl I've lost more than anything was with someone else, I know this was my own fault.

I said that we should stop messaging as I kept wanting to win her back, and couldn't help but message her. She said she still had feelings for me.... and enjoys talking to me as I'm easy to talk to.

So, on sunday there, I receive a text from her, saying she is hurting, and if I would talk to her as a friend. I ask her what's wrong, I can talk.  I then said, I'll come over to talk, she said I shouldn't, then said it was a mistake for me to message you.  I got to hers, she invited me in, she was crying, she told me her boyfriend broke up with her a few hours ago.  I was sad that she was hurting but deep down I was happy that they broke up. Sorry, not sorry.  She explained what happened, that he couldn't handle her issues, and left her at the door. She had been drinking quite a bit, I did my best to console her, we chatted and watched tv for quite a while, then I said you should get to bed, as it is 4am.  I put her in bed, I lay on the floor next to her bed, just chatting and listening to music, she had sobered up at this time.  After a while, she said I didn't have to sit on the floor, and can get in bed, I replied, that if I did, I wouldn't be able to resist cuddling her. After a few moments, I said fuck it, I might never get to again.  So get in bed and cuddle her, after some singing together, she snuggles up to me and sniffs me, and then goes in to kiss me.  I stop her and asked her what she was doing, I said I can't take advantage of you in this state, it's not that I don't want to kiss you, I REALLY WANT TO KISS YOU SO FUCKING MUCH.  She looked sad then faced the other way, I began to think... what if this is what I needed to do to remind her of us again, so I said out loud, fuck it, turned her face towards me and we kissed passionately for a good while, all of it was rushing back to me, I kissed her on the eyes, the forehead, twiddled our noses like I did when we were together, she was smiling and looking at me like how she did before.  I knew my love for her was definitely real after all this time, she wanted to do more as she tried to put her body underneath me but I don't know why but I stopped her from doing this, I mean I started kissing her but I didn't go in for making love to her... I hesitated and said we shouldn't... so we ended up cuddling and falling asleep.

I wake up early as I have work at 8:30am, slipped out of bed as quietly as possible without waking her, and leave her a text saying I had to leave for work, and that whatever happens after that, I'm happy that I got to spend one last night with her, it was like a christmas miracle. And you know where I am if you need me.  
Later in the day, she replies back.  Saying she is still heartbroken, and wants to get back with him, she loves him, and he had messaged her saying that, he didn't know how to control the situation because of her issues and left but wants to work it out with her.  I say to her, what about what happened last night between us?  She said it was a mistake, and that she shouldn't have led me on, and that she was vulnerable, even though she has feelings for me.... she said she is confused but still wants to be with him.  In my head, I'm thinking, if she really did love him, would you have kissed me and wanted more?!?

I wanted to marry this girl, I wanted a life with her... but now I'm just hurting... so much.  I'm frustrated at myself for letting her go.... and there is nothing I can do...

I know I should move on as my friends say... but I feel every bone in my body say that we should be together, when we were together, I had always said, maybe it isn't the right time or place for us to be properly together, and that there will be a right time and right place in the future which I believe....

But I guess I'm just being totally stupid, and should just forget about her...

  
TL;DR I lost the most important person in my life, she is dating someone new, loves him but also still has feelings for me, stuff happened between us on sunday night after the broke up.  She still wants to be with him despite her feelings for me, and I'm hurting a lot.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137354,public,self,Hurting and confused,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgjhry/hurting_and_confused/,no_ads,0,,,,

I’ve noticed that whenever we meet for the next 2 days he seems a bit quiet which makes me overthink, I do have abandonment issues so I may to be blame for the overthinking. I was concerned that if we slept together I would start to get attached and overthink etc. 

So the weekend just gone I travelled 2 hours to stay with him for the full weekend. We had an amazing time the sex was incredible! He treated me like a princess, cooked us dinner and was very loving. However since I’ve been home he has barely text me, didn’t answer my call yesterday when I rang him and didn’t follow up with a message. Today I woke up with no message from him or again a message to say he had been busy etc. I panicked and sent a message saying I don’t know why he hasn’t communicated with me and let me worry about him but I hope everything’s ok.

He rang me a few hours later and 2bh I was a little annoyed that he couldn’t be bothered to message me so I didn’t really make conversation. Since then he hasn’t messaged or even read my message from 4pm and hasn’t been on his phone! Am I overthinking and being needy?
