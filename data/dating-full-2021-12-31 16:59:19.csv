There were some highs and fun moments, and some heartbreaking ones, too, but I’m still excited about finding my person in the near future.

• I’ve learned that no response is a response (I got ghosted, and took it HARD.) going forward I know that I should leave the first time around instead of trying to get an answer from the other person.

• Dating should be fun! If you find yourself dreading it, I think taking a break is helpful to avoid dating fatigue. 

• I’ve also learned that OLD is not for me, so in 2022 I’m looking forward to getting out of my comfort zone and meeting new people in other ways :).",True,True,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1143976,public,spoiler,2021 Recap,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsyg96/2021_recap/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,,

I recently broke up with a man (25M) that I dated for 5 weeks. In the end I decided that he wasn’t quite the right fit for me, even though I caught feelings. During the breakup I explained briefly why I was ending it while still respecting him. He was calm and understanding. 

He sent me a text last night, 3 days post breakup, asking for sex. I explained that I didn’t want to as I value sex more than that and it led into a conversation where he was degrading my decision to end the relationship. He blamed me for not having the patience to wait for him to basically get his life together and that I was missing out. I was kind in my texts and even assured him that there are better people out there suited for us. 

In my opinion, the first month of a relationship is typically to get to know someone and properly decide if you want to keep pursuing them or not. In his eyes, we were very committed and since I caught feelings that should be enough to fall in love and stay together. My opinions were all bashed and thrown out the window. He was basically laughing in my face.

You’d think that they would be more understanding and it would end of a civil note. Am I right for thinking that first month or so is for doing that - getting to know someone?

So when I actually try giving a genuine compliment more often, it’s met with unenthusiastic reply, no compliment back, etc. Over a simple compliment too (about their style, music taste, smile, etc.) Does it look like I’m trying too hard?

Another example, sending any message other than “hey” typically looks like I’m trying too hard, and is usually met with unenthusiastic reply.

1. Was this an attempt at flirting?
2. Did he likely send this to multiple girls?
3. Am I just reading way to far into this?

They keep telling me that there's tons of people out there who would be interested and if I just went and asked someone it would totally work out and yadda yadda yadda. . .

I tried to explain without embarrassing myself that I'm not the type of person who likes to pursue. They told me I'm just too shy and even if I get rejected everything will be fine. But I couldn't really explain that it isn't so much about rejection it's more that I don't want to get myself into a relationship with someone who isn't really attracted to me but says yes anyway since I made the first move. (We have a mutual friend who is a very active pursuer and has gotten into this position numerous times all with disastrous results).

But as time goes on, I'm really starting to wonder if they, and others, are right. Everywhere I look the most common piece of advice for guys like me is to be confident and make first moves. I'm starting to wonder if there's really no chance if I don't. I don't want to be alone anymore, but I also feel uncomfortable and doubtful about taking the initiative.

Does anyone have any experiences or know any relevant statistics relating to this?

I really like Stacy a lot, think we are very compatible, that she’s good for me, and I care for her a ton. I first told her I loved her a month ago, because I felt so strongly about her (and she said it back). This is my first actual relationship and first time telling someone I love them. Things are really great, though I wish I could see her a little more often in the week.

Shortly after I told Stacy I loved her, we had our first fight bc she found flirty texts of mine with other girls (no I did not intend on pursuing anything with them) that had been exchanged between the time we became official and I said I Love You. Stacy was hurt, I felt terrible, made it up to her, and promised her and myself this would never happen again. I loved her too much to mess around like this (I think I had sent those texts as I was used to being single and maybe freaked at the idea of exclusivity and needed a fantasy outlet). I’ve stuck to my word since, ignored any girls hitting me up, and our relationship has been stronger than ever.

However, yesterday out of the blue this one girl \[22F\] that I met/hung with only once 3 years ago, and thought she was absolutely gorgeous and a really good match for a long term partner at the time, reached out over text. Let’s call her Jen. While I’d never told Jen what I thought of her, I had often fantasized about being with her over the years but couldn’t see her since that first meet bc we’ve lived in different countries since. I’d told Jen in the past I may be visiting where she lives/our home country but haven’t been able to due to various reasons (visa, covid, etc.). I had last texted with Jen a few months ago before I ever became official with Stacy.

Anyway, I gave in and responded to Jen’s text and kept it platonic, when she suddenly makes it a little flirty, for the first time ever, which I went along with unfortunately. Then she asks if she can call me, I say yes, and in a nutshell: she tells me that she would really like to date me with the intention of marriage down the line, assuming we click (in our culture/where she lives, dating is often done with the intention of marriage). Shockingly she really had liked me just as much as I had liked her when we met and had been thinking about me more recently hence the hit-up. We called for 3 hrs learning more about each other and discussing the potential of a future between us; I did not mention that I currently already have a gf.

Jen is even down to start a long distance thing right now if I’m down (again, common where are from) bc I told her we should meet in person to see if we really wanna pursue each other before committing to anything but we both know that’s not gonna happen soon. If we were to commit via an LDR/over text and calls though, then Jen could make a case to her family to come out and see me soonish. However, I personally would like to build a foundation in-person with anyone before committing to anything especially if marriage is the end-goal. She agreed with me.

Now, I feel that I’ve basically just bought myself time to see how things go with Stacy and re-assess whether I actually do love her, given I found myself engaging in this sort of shit. I really thought Stacy and I were headed a pretty serious route, and even she is envisioning marriage, though we haven’t discussed it explicitly at all.

I feel like an unfaithful asshole leading them both on, not knowing what the hell I want, and just being selfish trying to keep both options open. Does this mean I don’t actually love Stacy? Am I just not meant for monogamy? Do I have a mental or personality disorder? Please help me with your view of the situation and how best to navigate. Note that both girls are great in their own right, though I think from my family’s perspective Jen would be a better long term option (yes families do get involved in our culture). Is it worth ending it with Stacy who I know well and have established love and chemistry with, simply for giving it a shot with Jen who seems very promising but obv I don’t know her 100% like I do Stacy. I would love your input here.

**—TLDR—**

**TLDR;** I’m in a relatively new relationship with a great girl that I love, that “checks all the boxes”, and think we are headed quite a serious route. Suddenly, another girl, who I only know a little but have previously fantasized a lot about being with but couldn’t due living so far apart, reaches out saying she’s super interested in pursuing something serious with me even if it means starting off as a long distance at first, which was surreal, something out of a dream.

Ever since I've started dating (I've had one LTR that lasted 3 years, a couple of FWBs and some minor ""one-to-two casual dates""). In each of my situations, I've been infatuated witht the prospect of having a LTR. But whenever things get serious, I tend to back off and lose all interest (I've been in therapy to fix my avoidant-insecure attachment style, I know that 90% of my reluctance and fear is because of this and I've made great progress).

However, I've noticed I've recently lost interest in dating in general. Like, I would love to have a person to talk with everyday, cuddle, have sex with and share things with. I met my first GF when I was 21, and I felt *so* unready for the seriousness of the relationship. I was just getting my feet wet in dating (I had lost my virginity the same year to a different girl). Anyway, things got serious pretty quickly - this girl had her entire lifetime planned out mentally. She was to get her first kid when she was 28, get married around the same time and settle down early. For me, the whole prospect of settling down and getting ready for this made me so unsure of the whole thing. This led to us breaking up after a couple of years of dating, because I was so unsure if this was the life I wanted to live. Don't get me wrong, I really cared for this girl (and to a certain extent do today aswell and miss her dearly, even though we didn't want the same thing).

But it's like.. I see some of my friends entering LTRs, getting married, having kids, buying homes, cars etc. And I just can't feel that this is what I want in life, to settle for that road. At the same time, I don't want to end up single and alone for the rest of my life either. It's just that I'm so unsure on the whole ""settle down with one person for the rest of your life""-thing. Are all relationships supposed to lead to marriage? How do I take this pressure of myself and just enjoy the relationship for what it is?

Does anybody feel the same way, that they are unsure of what the whole goal of dating another person is in the long term? Is this something that will probably change when I approach my 30s and my goals/perspective in life changes?

Honestly I'm fine by myself, mostly. I have many hobbies, friends who care about me, a good social life and there are things in life that fulfill me. But having that special someone would still be nice, after a certain time.

I must say, I've rarely met anybody in their early 20s who are ready to settle down and commit 100%.

Me and my gf are both 23 if that matters, anyways we have been dating for about 5 months now, I really like her and I like being with her she’s a really caring and a passionate person but I do feel like she has a weird obsession or unhealthy obsessive relationship with her dog. She adopted this dog a month before she met me, the dog is about 1 years old now. 

•She had a birthday party for this dog at the dog park

•she lives in a two-bedroom apartment and uses the second bedroom for a “pink themed dog room”  which basically is a room with all the dog’s toys, play room area, portraits/pictures, not to mention that her dog has her own closet in this room filled with the dog’s clothes, shoes/boots, many different collars, bandanas, ETC. (her dog doesn’t even sleep in this room but she still gives this dog a whole room) 

•They share the same bed! I thought this was strange because she cuddles her dog and falls asleep like that. This dog sleeps with a pillow on its head lol. I don’t know it just looks very odd to me

I find it creepy that when I stay over her place, we sleep with the dog. The dog isn’t even on the foot of the bed, the dog’s head is where our heads are and the dog shares my girlfriends pillow with her. Her dog snores and it’s just annoying that her dogs face is just where our faces are. I’ve asked her to move the dog to the foot of the bed and she has, but the dog wakes up in the middle of the night and will put itself back on the pillow next to my gf

•most of the times when I ask her what she wants to do, it includes her dog. For example, we were getting bored of the things to do in our small town and I asked her what she would like to do, she will say things like “the dog park”, “the river walk” (which is basically a large open park where people bring their dogs and kids) or she will suggest dining at some bar/restaurant that allows outside dining so she can bring her dog 

•she will sometimes refuse plans if it requires us to leave her dog for more than 5 hours (says her dog has separation anxiety and she needs to take her potty every few hours)

•she has SO many clothes for her dog

•brushes her dogs teeth every single day, has all these dental products for her dog like dental mouth wash, two different toothpastes, dental treats, and dental flossing toys 

•she spends so much money on treats, clothes, and toys for this dog like everyday there’s a new package it seems like.

I also understand this is all her money and she is entitled to do whatever she wants with her money, it’s just kind of concerning! 

•this dog has it’s own Instagram account 

•on her photo album in her phone, I swear it’s only pictures of her dog, you’ll rarely find a pic that isn’t of her dog 

•she overly posts pictures of her dog on social media 

•she talks to her dog in a baby voice and carries her around like the dog is a small infant. (The dog is about 33 pounds and is a medium sized breed) 

•she literally kisses and hugs her dog and tells her how much she loves her every second 

•She has stated she likes her dog better than most people. She has made comments about how she values dogs more than babies. She finds babies annoying and dogs cute. (Which is fine, it is her opinion that she likes dogs more than babies but that was her explanation of why she values a dog’s life over a babies). Because of these remarks I am kind of scared since she seems like the person that would put her dog before anyone else. I’m actually terrified and concerned for her if something ever happens to this dog because I don’t think she can live without her. Everything just seems to revolve around this dog. 

I just found a lot of things that she does to be obsessive and just kind of weird. I guess I just need to know if this is normal behavior or not?

When I first met this girl she was in a relationship with somebody, and they had been together for about 8 years (since she was 14 she is now 23). I told her that I liked her and that if we could get to know each other more and she said yes and told me she had just broken up with her ex 2 months ago. We talked for about 8 months and nothing really came from it except that we would talk on the phone everyday, text, and hang out frequently however we never had sex. She then confessed to me that this whole time she was still having sex with her ex but that she had stopped and now wants to take me serious. 
Things got a little more serious and she started coming over to my house and met my fam and what not. About two weeks after that she tells me she doesn’t know if she wants to keep talking to me and that she’s not sure if she’s done with her ex. So after arguing we decided to stop talking and that lasted for about 4 months.
I chose to hit her up after seeing her at a party. We talked on the phone and caught up with each other and kind of naturally started to talk again like we did before. She tells me that she still talks to her ex but that she doesn’t have feelings for him for sure and that she is eventually willing to stop talking to him.
From there things were good we talk on the phone every morning, night, and throughout the day. After hanging out a couple times she came over and we had sex. That same week we started to argue more than usual and now she says that we don’t always have to talk on the phone every morning and night. I think she is doing this bc she is getting feelings for her ex again.

So, I've been talking to this girl for about 2 months through Snapchat, shes 18 and i' 19, we have talked every day since the first day we started talking, we facetimed had good convos, she always replies quick. I would ask to take her out and she would be busy, sometimes she would even show me proof why she was busy and tell me what she was doing. So she was free eventually and I took her out to watch spiderman. I had to meet her parents and I met her sister. The second she got in the car and we started talking I just got super nervous and anxious, I didnt really think much of it.

this is my second date ever, and im a virgin. She was talking a lot, she brought up most questions and I would answer them. She even talked about how her last 2 ex's cheated on her and how, and how she hasen't had a relationship in like 2 years, she just said a lot of personal shit involving her sister and stuff that I can't even say here. point being she was talking theee wholeee time about any little question I asked her about, I didn't have room to really start my own conversation.

I held her hand during the movie, then I dropped her off and she gave me a kiss on the cheek. I texted her about 4 hours after saying, It was really nice to meet you, I had a great time. She said it was nice to meet me too then yea that was it and we just started having normal convos again. Then I asked her why she doesn't send snaps of herself, when I do to her a lot. She says she just doesn't like it, then I say how your so pretty then she says I'm not even that pretty, then I say I your the prettiest girl I've met, then shes like you have been talking to some ugly asss girls then.

and I say ""I \*was talking to girls and I don't talk to girls like that"" then we keep talking and I say things like your the only girl I talk to, I give you all my attention. then she asks ""what about after the date? "" I say why would I talk to any girls, all I need is you"" then she ask ""what do you see happening to us"" I'm not gonna lie I think I said shit too soon but she just makes me so happy when we've been texting for a while and I know so much about her. I said "" I don't know depends where it goes, but I want you"" and then she said how I was quiet during the date, I didn't match the same energy she thought I had during texting and that she said I looked uncomfortable/ nervous around her and that I pulled out a vape lol, when she told me during the date that she brought a vape with her sister and she hits it with her friends. and I told her that I was nervous anxious, we had some convos and she just said she doesn't want a relationship right now, which is fine I don't understand how you can think I meant a relationship by saying I want you and 1 date. and I told her to give me a second change, It won't happen again it just a in the moment thing and she says ""you would really wanna hang out again?"" idk but that made it seem like she thought I didn't like her anymore or I was uncomfortable around her but I reassured that i wasnt. she just said she needs time to think about the date. after that, I just changed the subject and we have been talking everyday for over a week now since the date and she hasn't changed her texting, or response time or anything it's like nothing happened, which on my side is good but I just wanted to get your guys opinion.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1144027,public,self,Nervous and anxious first date help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rt54tf/nervous_and_anxious_first_date_help/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,,

My best ( and only friend, since we were 6 yo ) kept telling me about this girl he met. He’s always been a stunningly good looking guy, and so is the girl he told me about ( he showed me some pics ). They got together some weeks after, and he was enthusiastic. I was feeling pretty sad, honestly, but of course i was happy for him. 

It’s not an easy achievement ( I mean finding a gf/bf ). It’s nice to be happy for other people’s achievements… but i’d rather be happy for my own achievements too.

Our friendship started fading. He’s always been a very popular dude, and never really had any kind of trouble with girls. I feel like a ghost now. He’s the reason why I deleted my socials too. He kept posting pics with her, or just pics of himself. It’s not that i look bad ( I regularly go to the gym ), but he’s the main source of my insecurities, especially regarding girls and friends.

Considering I’m not even his friend anymore, I spent this year in total loneliness. This night has been the worst night of my life. Why can’t I be normal? Why can’t I be like my friend?

Having a gf looks like something unreachable honestly, and I hate myself for that. I hate my stutter, and I hate the way I look. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for years, and i kind of feel like I’ll finally have the guts to do something, even if it will end it all. I’ve never been courageous enough to live.

The first person I ever asked on a date politely turned me down and came out as a lesbian a month later.

A while later, I end up going on my first ever date with a lovely woman, we had great fun! However, we decided not to go out again because she just wasn't sure about a relationship. She came out as a lesbian about a year after that date.

And finally: just a few months ago we ended a two year relationship because my partner... (you guessed it) is pretty sure she's gay ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ

The only issue is that I’m currently on vacation for the holidays and we haven’t had a chance to meet in person. We have a lot of common interests and have been texting pretty consistently with equal effort put in by both sides. Even when things slow down, one of us finds a way to bring it back up. 

The issue is that maybe 5% of the texts have had any flirty or sexual context, and with some time before I go back, I don’t want things to fizzle out. We’ve agreed to meet in person when I do, as well as hinted towards potential future dates. 

The reason for concern is I don’t want the lack of sexual tension in combination with good back and forth conversation to lead her to start looking at this more as a friendship before we have a chance to meet in person. I’m more than fine if things don’t work out, but with the chemistry we’ve had, I would want us to see if that romantic spark is there at least.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1144076,public,self,How to Avoid the Friendzone in this situation?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rt8bvx/how_to_avoid_the_friendzone_in_this_situation/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,,

There are two main hills for me to get over which are my confidence and how poor I am.

There is something that makes both harder and that is that I have epilepsy, which shot me down from school, also I don't think I'm going to have a car.
Distances are terrible to anywhere and anything from here where I live.

I'm bit bitter for all of these things. 

I thought I could have had something going already that could have let me try something on my own 
These dating apps seem to only stab the tires of my slight enthusiasm for finding something to try out, as I have no idea for how to even start when I don't have anything else than my endless rants about what ever... 

And showing off my real interests and facing possible let downs, because of them, scare me a bit.
I used to have problems with shyness, and to have something build up on those grounds after I have dealt with it in some sense, I mean I can chat and talk with people, and socialize, but I don't think I can come up with anything that would point out my possible interest, because I have so terrible self confidence.

I think I can't have any relationships, and I just don't only think so, but I guess I feel so also.
Possible passion or finding any flame for anyone is pretty much impossible now I feel.

When I was in junior high I think I had someone in the corner of my eye, but I thought I was too poor and fat for them. I felt so demolished after I saw them winking at me...
Yeah I was shy and barely was able to talk with those people in that school.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1144081,public,self,I don't know where to begin...
