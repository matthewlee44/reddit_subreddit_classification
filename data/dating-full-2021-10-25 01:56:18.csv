I(18F) met this guy(21M) on tinder. We've hung out once a week on the weekends for the last month now. He told me he just got out of a long term relationship and wasn't looking to get into one ""but if it happens, it happens"". He drives about 40mins-1 hour the past four saturdays to see me because he lives in a different state. We've hooked up each time. He's paid for food, alc, etc. He texts me good morning and good night and ss my snaps where he thinks I look good in. He asked me how my family would feel if I dated him(he's a diff race), opened up about his previous long term relationship.  Since we only see each other once a week, he's told me that misses a me a couple times. He's said that he actually enjoys being with me and that ""sex"" is just a bonus. He likes that I'm uplifting and kind and understanding. 

Today he asked me the question: what am I to him. I responded with ""what do u mean"" and he said that he enjoys spending time with me but he doesn't know if he wants a relationship anytime soon. I told him that i know because he told me that earlier. then he said ""we both kinda like each other"" but that we can still enjoy what we have without being bounded.  then i asked him what he wanted and he said he doesn't know. he wants to focus getting his career on the right path wherever that leads him. and he said that he thinks im a genuine person and that we vibe really well. and i told him that i thinkn he's kind and we always have a good time together. he asked if i wanted to date him and i said that i wanted a relationship(in general) but when I was ready bc I told him I wasn't looking for one either. and i said that i would like to date him bc he had the qualities I was lookinig for but i was fine being casual with him. he responds with that i might never know what could happen and maybe he'd want a relationship down the line. Yeah people say that ""i don't want relationship *with you*"" but why would he do all of this when he could just stay in his state/city. 

The issue: I'm obviously getting mixed signals and it's not the usual kind. He does very ""relationship"" things but says something differently. My friends told me to start detaching my emotions from this but also let it flow but guide the flow. Yeah I like him but I just want advice. How do I deal with this?

We met through friends, and it was undeniable from the beginning that he had taken a deep interest in me. So far, we‚Äôve seen each other in group settings, and it's been nice. There is chemistry, and we have a lot in common.

Here is where all my self-created troubles begin. I acknowledge that I am incredibly insecure and fear the unknown, even though I am constantly trying to change that and better myself. I had not met a guy with whom I could see a future in the past few years. Either the guys I liked were not interested in me, or the ones that did like me I ended up not liking. 

Here comes the guy I met a few weeks ago; physically, I see that I can get past my prejudices; I enjoy him. He‚Äôs a genuine guy with great intentions and incredibly well-mannered. However, yesterday while we were at a music festival, I experienced all of my fears in real flesh ‚Äî a.k.a icks regarding him. Yesterday was a combination of things that annoyed me. I will attribute that some of these icks are mine to blame; however, there were things he did that I found unacceptable. Simply not to my taste, not who I am ‚Äî turn-offs. 

However, at some point during the night, I decided to communicate what I was feeling, and as we were having a fair discussion about it, I noticed that while he spoke sense into me, all I could do was stare into his eyes in the most profound most strange way. I had never felt this before. As I looked him in the eyes and  I saw the future, I saw our future. I had this moment of clarity where I saw my future feelings, my feelings for him in the near future, and those were feelings of love. The ones you get when you are deeply in love, you see the person with loving eyes and not with critical ones. It amazed me that even at that moment, I was relieved from the terrible energy I had.  

I now know those feelings and emotions of ickness were fleeting. I just needed to allow myself to go through them and be open to giving us a fair chance. Still, it‚Äôs early to know about what will take place, but I think that now I am open to seeing him with different eyes‚ÄîGotta flow.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1095232,public,self,"I looked at him in the eyes and I felt like I could see the future, our future.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf7wjd/i_looked_at_him_in_the_eyes_and_i_felt_like_i/,all_ads,6,,,

Since I have met her, I never had much problem being friends with her for the first 4 years, but when she broke off with her first ex, I started liking her a lot. At some point she tried to make a move on me but back then I was too much of a wuss to ask her out and she moved on to dating and banging bunch of guys. I was hurt and I moved on, but she broke up with her second ex and she came back to me telling me a lot of stories and started wanting to hangout with me a lot. However, this time she went back to to her second ex. Past few weeks I have been not feeling well, dealing with dark emotions and I just told her that I wanted to not talk to her for awhile. I did not tell her but I felt that she was just emotionally draining me and emotionally manipulating me. It's been 5 days but I broke my own vow and called her because I felt so sad. She texted me that I was the one to tell her I did not want to talk to her for awhile. I just brushed it off by texting thanks for not picking up my call and kept it that way.  


I just am feeling so unsure about myself. since about 3 months ago, I was sick of myself not having anyone, I started to make improvements in my life. I have been working out a whole lot more than maybe I should be, lost much body fat and gained muscle to look nicer, and have been going out to social groups to see people. However I just can't seem to shake the feeling to talk to her because I feel that I miss her too much. Am I doing the right thing? I should not see or talk to my friend (28F) right? I just feel like the relationship between her and I were toxic because I only support and not getting anything back where as she just gets all she wants.

We went for sushi (I knew it was her favorite food, but today I learned that she greatly over-estimates her spice-handling ability), watched a Hallmark Christmas movie, complete with hot chocolate (""I hate watch these because I know they're predictable and cheesy but they give me a little bit of Christmas when I watch them randomly through the year, and it cheers me up"" - my date), thrift store shopping, and to a brewery she's been wanting to go to, but hasn't made time for, even though she's been craving one of their sours for weeks. 

Today was the best date I've had in a long time because I stopped waiting and wishing to be with someone else to go out/do things with, and instead decided to take myself out. I sat alone in a sushi restaurant and I swear my mouth is blistered from the spicy roll I ordered, watched a cheesy Hallmark Christmas movie with hot chocolate, got some neat stuff from local thrift stores, and found a new sour from a brewery I love because they didn't have my old favorite. 

Today reminded me that I don't need a partner to go out and do fun things, and \*\*neither do you!\*\* You are your own whole, with or without someone else. You can take yourself out to new places, old places, weird places, wherever, and I promise you it'll be more fun than it initially sounds. Dating is hard enough without the added pressure of feeling like you can't go out/try things/be 100% happy without having someone else there with you.  

I thought someone else on the sub might benefit from the idea of taking a day to focus on themselves, especially as we start moving into the holiday season and all of the ""couple things"" to do will be everywhere.

I'm 24F and i've been single for the last 5 years by choice. I was cheated on but honestly didn't effect me that much and don't have much hard feelings for the guy, he was kinda obsessive and over protective though. But i'm at a point in my life where I want a relationship but i'm pretty aromantic and sill have so much I want to experience. I'm introverted but I also have a personality that everyone likes and i'm usually described as the kindest and most loyal and genuine person they know, and because of that I have the knack for getting guys attracted to me. I want to hook up with people and be causal and sleep around on apps but I know that I have the personality that the guy might catch feels, it has happened way to often and then I ghost (which i'm terrible for)

I also want experiences of meeting people in person, but covid hasn‚Äôt really helped that situation....though that could be an excuse. I always have an excuse, when I was in college it was *I gotta focus on my grades and projects* and then after it was *I gotta focus on getting my career started* but now i'm in a position where my job situation is good and i'm happy and my financial situation is also great. My mom is always nagging me that I need a boyfriend and I should get serious with that but i'm always making excuses. My excuse right now is i'm not super happy with my body (5'5 at 145 pounds). I'm actively working out and going to the gym to work on that because I notice when I feel good about myself I almost develop a...god complex maybe? I just dress better and I leave my apartment more, even just walking around the city doing errands I will be shocked at how many guys flirt with me and cat call me and it makes me feel amazing. Then I get into the phase where I want to hook up with as many guys as I can because I think this body deserves to be shared and I want to feel validation. Its funny I hate myself and have major body dysmorphia but keep having situations that enforce that i'm attractive but my brain doesn't let me think that and i'm scared every guy will be disappointed when I get naked.

But once i'm at that phase I don't know where to go. Sadly my small group of friends here are all in relationships and some are even getting married and generally are older than me. So I don't have any friends to go to bars or clubs or live shows with and I don't know how to go on my own since i'm shy. I can drink get get super bubbly with people but i'm still nervous. I love the feeling of going to these places and being hit on but I feel like its been such a long time that I forget how to act. I wanna meet guys on apps but I also find my self swiping on people I find attractive because i'm scared (because I don't know how to act, and also scared they will wanna date me seriously). I also have certain guys i'm into, I hate basic dudes so it's hard to find the right place to find the right guys. I'll be honest I haven't had sex or kissed anyone in like 2 years and i'm so scared that I have completely forgotten everything I have reversed back into being a virgin (lol). And yet there are lots kinky things I wanna try ~~some are kinda messed up and intense but still and I don't know how to safely find people.~~ I know there are too many things I want to explore before getting into a serious relationship since i've been cheated on and i know how that feels. I want to get everything out of my system before I commit, but I keep pushing off my exploration and don't know how to start.

I was super bummed out and texted him in between how he‚Äôs doing had asked if he was going anywhere for his vacation - he actually told me no he‚Äôs just staying home and resting.

Some people get obsess with a country or region and some find people from a certain country or region particularly attractive.

I have particularly seen this with weebs/otakus (mainly young men) that want a Japanese girlfriend. And with young women that go down the rabbit hole of K-pop and K-dramas.

While dose are the main ones that I have seen, I have also heard of people that are super into the stereotypical American cowgirl or into Russians, Australians, Spaniards, French etc.

I think that there's nothing wrong with finding people with a certain accent attractive, Or that you tend to be more into certain races or people from some countries/regions. As in not everyone from a country but, from the people that you find attractive a good portion of them have certain physical traits, basically having a ""type"".

I have heard of people saying that they find all Asian women attractive, really, all of them. This guy said that to an Asian girl and obviously she wasn't flattered, because that sentence implies that he finds her attractive only because of her race and not by who she is. 

This has also cultivated a plethora of videos and articles on the internet about ""dating \*insert country or region\* \*Women/Men\*"". While I find that there are general things to know about the dating culture of another country and understanding the general culture of the place, I find a little bit insulting to mush every woman/Man of a country (typically millions of them) and say what they like or not, or what they find attractive, etc. While there are certain similarities because of the culture, it's asinine to think that everyone in that country thinks the same.

I‚Äôve came to a realization recently that I tried denying my whole life. Until about 21, I was so worried about rejection in every facet of my life, you can imagine how that was with dating too. I think when you have a highly competitive field of study and everything is always expected of you, this is kind of common. When it came to dating, I didn‚Äôt want to put myself out there. I had confidence in my academic talents but hell, a human woman who‚Äôs ideas on me would be subjective and not objective... it was a terrifying thought that I didn‚Äôt confront. Wow, don‚Äôt I sound crazy, or maybe I sound incredibly relatable, who knows, lol. 

So over the past 2 years, even during covid times, I forced myself to put myself out there more and more. I learned that I could be great at flirting, that women actually did find my success attractive, and that I deserved more than I thought I did. It was wild. The only problem is that I‚Äôm still not afraid of being headstrong in a relationship instead of laying back and playing it cool, but that makes me, well, me and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change who I am to try to come off as someone I‚Äôm not.

The point that played in my head over and over and that has made me feel so comfortable with every woman I‚Äôve met on here? ‚ÄúThe worst thing they can say is no.‚Äù My dad first said that to me when, shit, I think I was in junior high.

My boyfriend calls me Pretty Bird. I always thought it was a cute nickname that he must‚Äôve randomly thought to call me. Every time he called me that I‚Äôd get butterflies, it made me feel so good and loved. 

One is the pages I saw in the notebook was made out to Pretty Bird, I read it and immediately cried happy tears. What he said was sweet, I couldn‚Äôt believe he actually wrote about me in secret. I read it over and over I was that obsessed. But then I come across another page that was placed inside the notebook, he didn‚Äôt write it.. it was a female‚Äôs handwriting. It was a nice, sweet note a woman had wrote to him and that wasn‚Äôt the worst thing to me. I mean of course it made me sad he kept a lovey dovey sappy note from another woman but that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm typing this right now. She signed the note as Love, Pretty Bird. 

When I saw that it broke my heart. Not even the fact that he used to call someone else that but carried that nickname on to me. Then I realized the note I thought he wrote for me wasn‚Äôt even about me, it was for her. I did bring it up to him and she‚Äôs someone from his past that he was friends with and helped him through a very hard time in his life. He said they were never anything more than that cause she moved away. This is still fresh in my mind considering it happened the other day. We talked it out but I‚Äôm still sad whenever I think about it. I felt like an idiot thinking that cute note was for me and I had gotten all giddy inside. 

I felt insanely bad for reading his thoughts and I told him that, he didn‚Äôt mind. He‚Äôs very open and honest with me, if I have questions he will answer. And he was very open about all of this which did make me feel better but I‚Äôm still a woman with feelings who keeps thinking about it. I‚Äôm not trying to ruin the best thing I ever had.

So I (23M) have never done something like this before. My first relationship just naturally grew from a friendship so i never really experienced asking a girl out before.

So theres a girl (18F) I have an interest in at a small restaurant where i work and we've interacted a bit. I want to ask her out for a date where we get to know each other more (thats a date right?). Even though i'm 90% sure im gonna get shot down/rejected, i wanna give it a shot.  ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"".

I've asked the business owners for permission as to whether I could do i before/during/after their business hours and they told me to do it during off-peak hours such as after lunch. They even told me that they will let her know for me that i have something to ask her (which is real nice of them). It seems that they are supportive of it so i don't have a worry about that.

Anyways, I have never asked a girl out who've i had limited interactions with. What the hell do i do?

I've been planning a lot of scenarios in my head, thinking about what to say, what to do, how to dress, what to bring etc. The only thing i know is how to handle the rejection. I absolutely have no idea at all.

Any suggestions, ideas or tips would be highly appreciated.

I noticed she gave me a full scan a few times and I knew what was going on.
Well, that was literally it, how it started, I happened to bump into this situation, talked to her, hooked up and this turned into a second, third, fourth time and so on. 

The result? Now we're in a relationship. I know so many people say is clich√© to say to just be the better version of yourself everyday and eventually something will come, well it's true even if it's clich√©.
I haven't had sex or any hookup in TWO YEARS up until that point, I gave up on seeking relationships and focused on my own well being after getting destroyed dedicating myself to toxic relationships that ended up nowhere.

By pure accident I found someone with a reality really close to mine in terms of mental health (empathy on this sector is a big point for me), almost identical personality, likes a lot of stuff that I like and even if she doesn't, she understands why I like it and incetivizes me, and of course I feel relaxed to do the same knowing it comes both ways. Compromising is not a problem, communication is not a problem, it's a sincere, kind, loving and empathic relationship and I for once in my 22 years of age feel completely safe on a relationship, after 5 of them.

I feel like a dumbass for not focusing on my issues and trying to be the better version of myself for so long, but now, I'm never going back to the cycle of trying to fulfill my emptiness with ""loving someone"".

If there's anything I would like to say to anyone out there is: Work on yourself, your life, your goals, be at places you want to be and eventually someone that share the same values and goals will come along and hopefully it works, it's hard, after all we only find so many people we love that can actually work on a relationship level, but on some rare ocasions, it works and it feels like fireworks.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1095776,public,self,"Sometimes, not actively seeking someone out there is the best option.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfd17h/sometimes_not_actively_seeking_someone_out_there/,all_ads,6,,,

I was in a relationship for 5 years and have been single for around 8 months now. I just recently started dating and met a girl (27F) two weeks ago and we really hit it off. The two dates we've been on were great. After our second date she actually bought tickets for both of us to this art exhibition we wanted to go to which is just by mid-November. That made me happy, as I interpreted she wants to continue seeing me for a while. 

After our second date, she said she got sick (not covid, something else), and that was over a week ago. She's been struggling with that for a while now. We were supposed to meet up this weekend, but she cancelled as she said she wasn't fully recovered yet. I told her that's fine and we should meet up again when she is feeling well. But I'm now confused on whether I should wait for her to reach out to tell me when she is feeling fine for a third date, or if I should ask her again soon if she is feeling better to go out.

Many comments say that she felt used because he only saw her as a potential partner and once she wasn't available, he dropped her. This may be true in some situations but I, when I see a girl, I don't immediately see a potential partner. However most of the time I start being friends with a girl, I develop a crush. And even though I didn't see her as a potential girlfriend, I now want her. 

So my question is, how are you supposed to show your intentions when they aren't there at the start? How should I prevent the girl feeling used when I no longer want to be friends with her? Because saying ""hey lets be friends but entertain the possibility of me developing a crush so you won't feel disappointed"" seems... Weird.
