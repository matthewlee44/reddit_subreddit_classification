(21 m)

I have 2 friends who I went to school with who also work there and

have been doing it for almost 1 year.

&amp;#x200B;

So we have different departments at my job. She works in a department where it is always quite busy, so I have not had the opportunity to talk so much with her yet. But we were put on a work assignment together the other day and it went pretty well. We talked a lot together and we had fun. And I found out she knew some of my friends from elementary school.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the twist

&amp;#x200B;

In the past she has dated one of her old colleagues (same workplace as now. I did not work there then) They had some problems and broke up. He then resigned 2 months later. He then began to stalk her a lot. Seek her out on the streets, contact her on social media, stand and wait in front of her address. (i think all of this happend around a half to a year ago) And that, of course she thought was uncomfortable and weird. I do not really know how she feels about it now, or if it is something she thinks about a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

All this I have been told by my 2 friends who also work there. Because I asked them if they knew a little about her. (she does not know that I know this about her)

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to invite her out for a single beer. Or a coffee, or something like that. But I just do not know how to handle the situation. Do you think she is very closed to going out / dating a colleague after her previous experiences? 

&amp;#x200B;

She seems reasonably open to me when we talk, which I think is a good sign? I also do not quite know if I am sexually attracted to her(maybe just gonna be a friendship). But she seems like a sweet girl with a lot on her heart, and a good personality. And I want to get to know her better.

She is 20 and i am 21.

  
I hope it all makes sense, and you can come up with some suggestions or help a little. (im not the best at english but i tried my best)

Today’s Valentine’s Day and I (25M) got really depressed about being alone and never having a girlfriend. Desperation overcame me and I ended up booking a one on one free consultation with a dating coach (not PUA). Now that I’m thinking clearly, I don’t wanna pursue this without being well informed. So the dating coach I’ve booked a session with is Emyli from emlovz.com. I chose her because she’s the only one who seemed genuine. By genuine, I mean that she was the only dating coach I’ve heard saying that you need to be what you wanna attract and that she can’t make an overweight guy who plays video games all day attract an Instagram model. Every other dating coach sells the bs that all you need is “game” and looks don’t matter at all. Her actually acknowledging leagues (that could work against her) makes me believe that she actually knows what she’s talking about. Her reviews are amazing (almost 5 stars on different websites with videos of success stories from her students themselves). She helps people with improving conversation skills, improving their wardrobe, setting up OLD profiles, texting skills and mock dates.

My biggest concern is that if I pursue this and this ends up working, I don’t want a woman to feel betrayed by the fact that I had to learn this stuff. I don’t want her to think of this as catfishing.

Hence, I ask, what’re your opinions (especially women) of men who seek professional help when it comes to dating? Should I continue being the way I was that has proven to not work?

(Like really bad with social cues.)

I asked a girl out yesterday and while she turned me down, I don't know how definitive it was. Now I'm not sure if I should give it another shot down the line or just leave it alone.

She is a new busser/waitress at a restaurant where I eat lunch nearly every day. Over the course of the last couple of weeks we've become friendly with a little bit of light flirting, just a tad bit more than I would consider normal waitress flirting. 

On Friday she said that it always makes her day when my group and I come in. On Saturday there was a little bit of teasing, talking, and she came to the table a couple of times. (The busser doesn't normally interact with customers after they are sat, and my group doesn't currently sit at her tables on the days she is waiting.) On Sunday, I was off and went in by myself, I asked to sit with her but she was bussing only. After she sat me, we talked for a couple of minutes until other customers came in, but she said she'd be right back. That happened several times and I had her exclusive attention while she wasn't seating other customers or doing other things. We started to get into personal details a bit.

Despite her coming back to talk more a few times, our conversations kept getting cut short. (Which is to be expected.) So after I finished eating and paid, I approached her and we had the following interaction.

Me: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow evening?

Her: What's tomorrow?

Me: Monday.

Her: I was going to work, but then decided not to. I am going to go out with my friends.

Me: What about after like 5 PM?

Her: I'm going out at 7:30.

Me: Okay.

Her: Why?

Me: I was going to ask if you wanted to go do something.

Her: Like what?

Me: I don't know, I hadn't thought that far ahead yet.

Her: Oh, take care.

Me: You too.

So she didn't really offer any alternative availability or options, but still inquired about what I wanted to do which leaves me unsure whether it was my own uncertainty with the plans that was the issue.

My goal is really just to get to know her a bit better without the constant interruptions that happen when I see her at work. I don't know where it goes from there. She is significantly younger than I am, and below what I would normally consider within my dating range. That already has me on edge about any of this to begin with. Normally I wouldn't think twice about this kind of thing, but for whatever reason she is 11/10 for me and I can't stop thinking about her.

I didn't see her today (she was off), but I will most likely see her tomorrow and through the rest of the week.

Obviously, I will consider how she interacts with me going forward. Does she continue to give the increased attention, or does she back away a bit? If she backs off, then clearly I should drop it, but if she does continue at the same level should I approach her with more certainty with my plans or what? How long should I wait before bringing it up again?

let's say you were in that position, would you be focused on finding a girl to settle down with?

i think i'm a bit jaded to be honest. all my life getting girls has been a huge pain in the ass. i've finally gotten my fair share of them and my fair share of sex. at this point, the struggle that i've had to endure was painful, and i don't think i'd ever want to give up the ""keys"" to my life to any girl in the united states

the reason i say the united states is because all my dating experience has been here. i just can't bring myself to seriously attempt dating the women here. i've tried tons of times in the past with varying success, most of the time it was frustrating

at this point i would rather just fuck em and chuck em, to be honest. i certainly wouldn't take any girl seriously past the age of 30. that's an automatic no for me. and all the young girls are just too problematic and i don't think it'd be worth my time and effort

i feel i'm better off just leaving the united states and becoming an expat. find a nice traditional country to settle down in where it's easy to just come across cute girls, and get them to fall into my lifestyle right away

there's just too many headaches dating girls in the states. maybe if i had better experiences growing up i'd be less jaded. but at this point, i can't be bothered to enter the game when i know the level of work required will be super high for very little pay off

So last night after work a bunch of us went out for drink. We had a pretty large crew come one of them being a girl from another department I’ve been interested in. She sat at the same table as me and we talked for a while. She went over to another table when the rest of her department showed and said “thank you for the company have a good night”. 

Well my coworkers wanted me to go over to that table and buy her a drink. (I had already decided prior I was taking an Uber home) Eventually one of them ordered 2 lemon drop shots and after trying to get me to take one over to her one of the guys I work with took it to her and said it was from me. After a few mins she called me over and we did the shot together. Chatted for a few minutes then I chatted with another guy in her department before I went back to my department. 

My coworkers seem to think that based on how the shot went down that she’s not interested. I’m not 100% sure how to read what happened and feel like it was almost inconclusive. 

I had fun, which I guess is the important thing. I’m glad I was intoxicated as it made me less nervous and it didn’t hurt when the shot didn’t go exactly as planned.

boy sings at work, just like girl sings at work. boy sings all the oldies. frank sinatra. nat king cole. frankie valli. girl even visits boys church despite being different denomination. sees him in dazzling blue suit that really brings out his eyes. wowzers

boy is corny funny. girl likes that. boy is incredibly intelligent. girl likes that. boy loves the Lord. girl also loves the Lord. AND likes that

boy wears an  a c t u a l  analog watch. analog. in this day n age? how very old school &amp; classic of him. also boy always wears nice cologne and sports the fresh cuts (hair, beard, etc). boy is humble 

girl finally get up nerve to express interest by nervously (with blush) saying goodbye after work then going ""actually, X! I want to give you my number. I think you're super cool and I'm interested in getting to know you better. if you're interested in the same, heres my number (on piece of paper). thank you baiiiii""

boy smiles really hard and says ""absolutely, I will! thank you!"" &amp; goes back to work. the rest of that day, and the next pass, no text which is okay. he's probs busy or playing it cool or simply not interested

today I saw him again at work and he engaged with me more then he usually does, asking about my day so far, etc.. I ended up invited him to see this violin concerto that's playing at a symphony hall in a few weeks.

he said he'd think on it, bc he likes the violinist a lot, and shoot me a text later letting me know if he's interested. it's been a while and I'm not tryna be crazy but he probs already had his break at work and hasn't texted. he's probably just not interested, which is okay, but I still feel bummy :(((

I've never asked a dude out before and I worried I messed up. we come from different denominations (his church/upbringing is strict, conservative, and legalistic, mine isn't) and I wonder if showing my interest first put him off

it's only recently he's begun to show interest in me, and vice versa, as we've been around each other more at work/realized the other exists lol. maybe I moved too soon?

idk, I'm probs over thinking it. but how do y'all not feel so bummy? I'd rather straight up ""not interested"" then wishy washy. but then again, homeboy could just be shy/unsure/praying/controlled by family/etc/who knows

I appear to be 21, I never aged much. 

I've been told I'm a 6-7, and I believe that. I've never been called ugly and most girls I've pulled have been the same. I'm fairly confident in my looks, with my only flaws being how skinny I am, and I'm sure for some girls that I'm 5'09. Most girls want a taller guy, and most girls I've been with in the past were 5ft-5'05. (And believe me, I don't care about height, this is just who I've usually had success with.)

The reason I'm even bringing this up is because despite being average/slightly above average (facially)  I cannot match with any girls on tinder.

I mean, I've matched with some girls that are very pretty just based on photos of my face, but most of them don't engage in any conversation. I went on a date with one who was 6 years younger, really beautiful, and is going to college. I was trying to hook up, but it was clear from the first 10 minutes of the date that she was looking for a long term partner and I was being interviewed. I knew it wouldn't work out so I kind of botched the date, I was cool and kind to her but I was being honest to a fault and I didn't put in an effort.  I'm pretty sure I turned her away because of this. After the date we continued talking for a day and then she ghosted me. I knew she wasn't feeling it, and honestly I wasn't either.

After that, I started messing around with a girl from work. FWB kind of deal. Still cool with her but it's very off and on and it's driving me crazy. I'm starting to want a relationship, and I'm feeling hopeless that it's so hard to meet girls even in a bigger city.

My last relationship lasted 6 years, and after that I only went for hookups and never had consistent success. I know that the problems that I have are more to do with me than it has to do with everyone else. I'm not in denial, I'm a good looking dude- but clearly the older I get, the harder it's getting to find beautiful girls who will accept me not being bigger muscularlly and financially.

I've matched with maybe 15 girls after that date, and it's like talking to girls who have zero interest in even talking about their day. ""Hey,"" ""haha"" ""ikr, me too? And u?"" And then nothing. Maybe a week later, I'll get a message.

I've been so antisocial for so long that I don't even have friends outside of work to meet girls with. I really just want to find a girl who (no offence) is around the same height and weight as me, who doesn't care that I'm not buff(and I know i should work out), who doesn't care that I only make 50k a year, who just wants to kick back and watch TV, play videogames every now and then, eat take out with, and go on scenic walks/adventures with.😔

Sorry for the length of this really got out of hand as I include so many details xD Would love some advice though :)

I was travelling in South America and met a girl there, we are both mid twenties, I asked her for dinner then we spent the next 2 days and nights together hanging out and hooked up on the second. It was honestly perfect I have not felt so good about meeting someone since my ex ex girlfriend who is the only girl I ever really loved.

So the girl has to leave she is visiting her family back in her home country, I stay on for another month. We had talked a little bit about our plans on the last night, I told her I would maybe visit this country or this one and she asked me if I thought to visit her country Argentina. I bring it up again later and ask if shes serious and she says yea.

So a while later weve been texting and I say I want to come, I am feeling romantic and so fuck it the lengthy travel is worth it for a girl im this into :/ she tells me a good time to visit. The one issue is this girl has been away from home for two years, has not seen her mum and dad for this entire time I think,a little bit of her siblings. When I visit the plan is to spend 2-3 weeks with her in Argentina, then she plans to travel back home and possibly after travel more... The door seems open to anyhting at this point as I have no plans at all just travelling around having fun.  Then I catch covid and am delayed a week to get there, we spend 4 days together and again its perfect for me,for her too  im sure at this point she feels strongly and told me she really likes me, she is with her family and i meet them go for dinner etc. Now again fate seems tofuck it up as she has to leave a few days early since their airbnb had to be changed and the family had no where to stay (they were vacationing). So four nights  is not really ideal, eventhough every moment seemed perfect its hard to build something strong from this short time :(

So I am left alone in Argentina and kinda heartbroken, and we never really talked about where to go from there, except that she asked if in the summer when she is moving to europe if i will be driving through europe in my van and i said come to england where i live... nothing really planned, just hinted. she is wanting to spendthe nexdt months withher family before she moves back to europe where she is starting a buisness.

Now I just cant get over her, we text a bit and I try to play it cool, I kind of crack a bit and get soppy, say my eyes are only for her and i am having a strong feeling, just ask her straight up is this complete for her or if i should wait. and she says right now she has no time because of her family/buisness but says it doesnt mean in tthe future we dont meet or she doesnt hear from me.

I say ok thanks for being open, i leave it with you if you want to meet again. (cause u know i came to argentina and laid my heart open a bit now i should just back off and let her try.)

The texting has now kinda died. at first she would ask me every few days how i  am where i am. now we didnt text for two weeks and i cracked and asked her how things are. im not a big texter and she is a frustrating one. she will msg instigate a convo and then leave me on seen all the time.  Anyways she told me she will come to europe in a couple of months but we havent talked bout meeting or anythinglike that. part of me keeps telling myselfvshe is just focusing on her buisness and family and when she comesto europe she will hit me up. The other part tells me if she reallylikedme she would have tried more to see me in south america, and the fact she doesnt try so hard on the  texting means shes trying to let me down gently. 

I travelled for a month by myself aound argentina and urugauy met some great people and hooked up with a few other girls since we parted ways just trying to get her out of my head, one was really nice and beautiful and ordinarily im sure id be more into her but I just cant get this infatuation i have out of my head. The travelling just seemed to be duller after meeting this girl, I decide to go back to the uk as I cant take being stuck in hostels trying to pretend to be happy with people all the time. Now Im back in the uk and crying all day about it, i cant beleive how badly torn up over her i am. I think its the not knowing if there is a future or not that kills me, and shes just quite strong person in general, i know crying to her or asking about the future will just make me look desperate.  I want to get overher but at the same time im so desperate to seeher again and so hopeful that we will meet. Its like my mind is telling me get over it but this hope just keeps coming back about spending more time with her. Its so consuming, the moment im not doing something she is on my mind. Even when I am doing stuff I am constantly reminded of her.............. idk what im really asking for maybe just someone to tell me if  i should try to holdon to these feelings? which for me are rare i dont fall for girls much. Or do I just block her out of my mind and move on and if she does contact me in the future then great...

Am I crazy for being so into someone after so short a time together? I just cant explain how it was short but so intense.. she told me she felt wehad known eachother for a lot longer just two days after we met. And I feel like this completley, as if I met someone Ive known for years and I know is perfect for me... but the distance and the complications and her unwillingess to sacrifice much to see me is crushing me :(",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159011,public,self,I fell for a girl while travelling and cannot get her out of my head.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ssrt9t/i_fell_for_a_girl_while_travelling_and_cannot_get/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I didn’t really like her at the time (in a romantic way) but now I see her at the gym and can’t stop thinking about her.

He's 7 years older than me. 

So this guy, has a great personality, in the sense that he has amazing vibes. And we match musically. Which is strange, since most people don't get my taste of music... I feel like he understands me on a deeper level and his vibes feel like home. 

I met him online and he lives in another country so we couldn't meet in real life. But we've talked a lot. He's really funny and he started to flirt with me immediately. 

I didn't meet him with an online dating app, but an app of music. 

So I feel like our ""souls"" or whatever. Have much in common, in the sense that I love that he does music and his sound is amazing and I feel like he completes my soul in that sense. Like he completes that intellectual and emotional maybe part of me. 

But... Physically... Here comes the problem. I just simply don't find him physically attractive or at least I don't find myself being physically attracted to him. I feel like I'm too young. He looks almost like my dad. Like, I know 7 years is not a huge difference. But I don't know. He feels like an old dude to me and I feel incapable of imagining him in a sexual way. 

The problem is he also wants me sexually, obviously, because he's attracted to me. But the thing is that I wouldn't say I'm attracted to him at all... 

So I have this huge conflict inside because I feel like maybe I won't be able to get that level of connection with someone else mentally. But physically... I don't think there's attraction from my part. I also haven't met him in person so maybe it can change?

I'm fairly outgoing, charismatic, attractive, and young (20, in college). I have a ton of friends and don't have a problem talking to strangers.

But

I still struggle to talk to (attractive) women, approach women, and especially to get numbers/snaps. I overthink how not to be weird / creepy and then freeze up. I don't know what's okay / acceptable and when people usually escalate to going on dates. I've had several failed attempts where I misread her signals and then asked her out, and those rejections felt so gaslighty and embarrassing that I presently feel scared to do it again. I don't know when and in what contexts a woman 'wants' to be approached, if that makes sense. Deciphering whether someone is flirting is something I am completely unqualified to do, so I really need more than just ""if she does X she's interested"". Women look at me a lot though, and I've gotten enough 'attention from a distance', so I know there's a market for what I have, I just don't know how to meet the demand.

I've been on three dates with this one chick, and even though we didn't have long term compatibility it was still something to prove that romance was possible. Plenty of my friends are in relationships. I'm not hopeless, rather, I'm genuinely confused about what the expectation is from me as the dude.

It would be great to get some responses either from women or from men with anecdotes of approaches that went really well and ended by exchanging numbers / planning future dates. Or maybe the trajectory a friendship took in developing into a relationship, and when that transition happened?

I am like 7/10 in terms of attractiveness. I am also involved in a large variety of extracurricular things like sports and clubs so I guess I'm around a lot of people. I can be pretty good at talking and starting conversations with people. I'm   awful at reading signs that people like/dislike me (I think). So, I'm not really sure what holding me back. It's not really a matter of waiting since I will be around the same people as I am now for like 2 more years. I don't know what others are doing right that I'm doing wrong.

So, I thought i'd leave some advice and words of encouragement for those who feel lost in the crazy world of dating. So here goes:

I know at times trying to find the right person and the right relationship may be exceedingly difficult and the longer it goes on without substantial success the more hopeless it appears to be. For those that think like this, you aren't alone. But its essential to remember that every human is equal and therefore has equal rights to love and be loved. There are so many people out there just waiting to meet you that may be that right one! As the cliche saying goes ""you miss 100% of the shots you dont take!"" So keep pushing forward and fight back against insecurities, self-doubt, and fear. These are the things that will drive you to hopelessness and depression. There are people out there that WILL see the best in you, but the world is a very big place so you have to put in the effort and not give in to giving up. Giving up may be the easy and safe route to avoiding fear, doubt, and pain, but thats because anything in life worth working towards will involve fear and doubt. The sooner you understand that, the sooner you can stop letting these things control you!

If you feel hopeless, heres some advice:
1. lower your expectations, but create boundaries. What i mean by this is be more open minded about less attractive men or women, you may be surprised by many other aspects that are so much more important than looks. At the same time have boundaries, things you wont compromise on, so that you know you will never settle for toxic people or relationships.

2. Work on yourself!
Both men and woman are attracted to self-confidence and those that have passions and goals. Choose something you want to do, whether thats a new career path, being more healthy, or learning new things. Whatever it is don't do it thinking you will get a significant other, but rather do it for yourself because it's something you qant to do for yourself. People will take notice of that and let you know they're impressed or interested.

And 3. Stop comparing yourself to others. 
Know where you stand in all things and not trying to live up to societal expectations. If you compare yourself to the best of the best, you will always come up short, but if you compare your current self to past self, you can find what you need to improve and eventually will always look vetter than a past version.

It is the individual who controls their world, not the world who controls the individual. You all are bright, beautiful people in my eyes and many others, you just havent met them yet. Don't let Valentine's day be a time of sorrow and hopelessness, but a challenge to rise above yourselves and  find the one you will truly love and who truly loves you.

What people don’t understand is that I wasn’t born yesterday. I know I can be single and enjoy Valentine’s Day. But I’m not just single…I’m disillusioned about relationships as a whole from my experiences but somehow I’m also a hopeless romantic and that’s what really makes my jimmies feel rustled every February.  I’m almost 30 and I’ve only had three relationships and none of them lasted longer than six months. My first one was just using as a rebound to get back at her ex and even her friends led me on. The second one I dumped after five and half months because she was abusive to me and I thought I deserved better…but I haven’t seemed to find better so was I right? And the most recent one ended right before COVID. I don’t think I was passionate about her at all. We both just got together because we were lonely.

Dating apps haven’t been helping me feel better at all. If I’m lucky, some fat chic will swipe right on me but other than that, I'm not finding any connections.

About 6-7 years ago an employee came into my office and started making out with me. When working I tried to match peoples energy. Maybe we flirted while working together or she saw it that way. We ended up hooking up a lot and a month or two later I got the “what are we” talk after hooking up. I think I was 21 at the time and at that time I asked her if she would be my girlfriend. Things go well we had are ups and downs especially while working together it got tense, but overall we managed a nice relationship. 

As we grew older we both started thinking about the future of this relationship and that’s when things went south. I come from a religious family (Islam) and also grew up with many Muslims and was taught in my younger years about my religion. I wouldn’t say I’m the most religious person. I just hold my values and try to be a good person. A lot of Muslim people live double lives. Meaning hiding one side of their lives from there parents and then infront of them act like an angel. My father and parents eventually caught on. That was a hard time on me, they didn’t know I was in a relationship with this girl just knew I was doing stuff. I have this inner side of my that wants to please my family and fears judgement from friends/family if I were to marry this girl. I care and love this girl so much but I guess it’s not enough to pull the trigger and marry this girl. 

She loves me more than I love her. This is when we broke up. About a year and a half ago. She couldn’t take it, she loved me so much and it hurt her more being with me knowing there’s no future. It was hard for both of us we eventually started talking again, she still worked for me. Shes in nursing finishing up this semester. We went back as if we were still dating. Also I should add I started losing sexual attraction with her the last 2-3 years of dating, and we didn’t have much sex when getting back together unofficially. I didn’t look at us talking everyday as working on getting back together, but she did. It felt good to me having her back in my life and she felt the same but she looked at it as maybe I’d change. We ended up breaking off again after a year and a half after breaking up. Because I haven’t changed and she’s calling me selfish. I feel terrible I didn’t look at this relationship this way. I don’t know why I held this relationship so long. I broke this girls heart and dreams of seeing a future with me. It’s crushing me for what I’ve done witch wasn’t my intentions. I wanted her to be happy and I saw that when I’m in her live but in reality she will be happy when she’s with someone who wants and knows to have a future with her.

This is this stupid obsession I have and I don't know to how to fix it. I'm like embarrassed of myself and I don't know what to do. She's on my instagram too (surprisingly she hasn't blocked me or unfollowed me) and I see her watching all my stories. I'm like fighting the urge to contact her on a daily basis. I just want to say hello or have her really reconsider this, as stupid as it sounds.
