Ok i don’t get it. So, like half a year ago i stopped seeing someone, and after that i went to Tinder and went absolutely crazy. A lot of them i only had sex with like once and spoke with for a few weeks, so obviously didn’t know any of them very Well.

But this past fucking week? I have received everything from nudes to “should we begin seeing each other again” from these girls that i barely know, and haven’t spoken with for half a year. 

I’m not trynna brag, i honestly really don’t get it. Why does these girls wanna suddenly hang again after we already tried once? Like, they have all asked within the same week.

So my best attempt to make a long story short is that I've been talking rather intensively with my landlords daughter(she comes down about once a month with her kid) and the previous month we talked multiple times a day pretty much all day, about all sorts of things - but really leaning towards .. well topics you wouldn't be talking about with a 'friend', in all honesty leaning towards a relationship, or at least something more.

She came down maybe a week ago, for 6 days. Throughout the first 5 days we spent as much time together as we could, with her kid there. At night she'd sleep in my bed, we'd fuck, yada yada, all good. Then all of a sudden she stayed an extra day, and suddenly she turned cold. I asked why and she literally said ""well i'm going back home tomorrow so I'm trying to distance myself"" and pretty much after that led to her being like she's not looking for a relationship and she could tell that I was, and she didn't wanna hurt me. I kinda tried to say how I took that, that I was rightfully confused - because all of our conversations were, well, not typical to like friends? if that makes sense. We'd cuddle when I'd come home from work and she'd come down to my room and ask how my day was and cuddle / kiss and what not. Slept in the same bed for the 5 days and stuff, and overall I'm just really confused. Like all of a sudden she just went cold and I can't help but wonder if it's because of something I did, I know she's bipolar - but only manic, never depressive. She'd always say how much she loves how much her kid loves me and how we are together and what not - and it really fucks with my head. Since then she basically told me she sees me as a best friend but I think that's bullshit personally - I think she's afraid because she was saying she's been developing feeling and she doesn't like that (to be fair her ex was rather abusive to her so I sorta understand where she's coming from) but still, I don't really know what to do moving forward. I've been trying to give her some space and not talk to her - but in the back of my mind I know that she's gonna be visiting again in a few weeks and I can't help but think about how that's gonna go, or how I should act .. if that makes sense? Should I just not talk to her until she comes in person and see how the vibes are? Or just spare my heart and feelings and just drop it alltogether and move on? I appreciate any advice, I've just been kinda lost in my head since the last day she was here and went all cold out of nowhere and I'm hurting.

I thought we all agreed it was something weird, sort of like the personal ads in the newspaper. Now you actually see attractive people on these dating apps. 

It seems to be more popular due to its element of filtration and carefully curated selection. But is that it? No more spontaneity? It seems like society today is _too afraid_. 

Inagine if 50 years ago, there was a big catalog that got mailed to folks' homes and it was just pictures of people with descriptions and their contact. Would it be taken seriously? People used to date those in their social circle, their school, their library, etc... 

Now everybody has to go to some sort of pre-screening TSA-like electronic matchmaker because folks are too frightened to meet people in their network or in public. The average woman sees the average man as a someone ready to take advantage of her body and the average man sees women like someone that is going to screw him over financially or smack herself in the eye and tell society that he abuses her. 

What a ridiculous society we have become. When I went to Greece, Brazil, Hungary, Poland, Colombia, etc... folks are still quite casual and not all uptight about dating. There just seems to be less anxiety in the dating market.

The fear we have of being scammed, abused, lied to, etc... has prevented us from interacting with our fellow society. 

Like imagine if everytime a couple meeting for a date at a cafe, the man brings a lawyer and the woman brings a bodyguard. It's a bit exaggerated but thats honestly how I view online dating. Its not very romantic, its more robotic than anything else. Men scare women and women scare men. One thinks he will get scammed and manipulated, the other thinks she will get abused and abandoned. People in our social circles are not good enough, people in the open public are too sketchy.

We've only just now started fighting and it caused my rose tinted goggles to come off. Now the red flags are very clear and they scare me. But I also love him. So I don't want to act rash. 

I want to start with the most difficult part. He has been going on and off medication for depression and ADHD for the entire relationship. So I feel like I owe it to him to wait until he gets it consistent and under control. But 6 months is a long time to be going on and off medication. He started new medication when we got together, then a few months in didn't like it and quit it. Then a few months after that we started fighting for the first time. I got too aggressive about a subject and he felt attacked. But by the end of the argument he was just yelling at me. Saying things like ""I don't get angry you made me angry."" He said he regretted saying it and it prompted him to get back on medication. But a week into taking his new medication he lost it and is in detox again. Its been a roller coaster and I feel uncomfortable that he thinks part of his anger comes from being unmedicated. 

More on mental health, he says he has an addictive personality, where he can't have interest or hobbies without getting fully addicted. I taught him a bit about wine and suddenly he's drinking two bottles a night. Then when I point out its not healthy he quite cold turkey and won't pick up a glass. He does this often with many different interests. He also will binge eat for a month then purge for a month. He says he gains and losses the same 30 ibs over and over. This worries me. He says his medication suppresses his appetite. 

This leads into another issue, that I feel like a mother more the a girlfriend. The other day he asked me to remind him to eat. That didn't feel right, or maybe I'm a bad girlfriend. He doesn't wash his sheets, and acted like I was high maintenance when I asked him to start. He doesn't know how to buy groceries, and lives off pepperoni and candy. His home isn't furnished, and is trashed from his previos relationship. That's not his fault but I wish he would work to make it nicer. I bought double night stands, a second phone charger for his side of the bed, his favorite snacks, shampoo and a tooth brush for him. Every time I go to his place I have to bring a charger, I have to buy shampoo and face wash, I brought my own blanket because he doesn't have much comfort items, and so on. When I bring it up he says I'm high maintance. Not in those words, but in a joking way. 

He says he has a past with phsosyopathy, he says it got bad enough once he hallucinated, lost time, and would need to burn himself to feel. But this was a long time ago, and he sought help after this and got medicated. It was years ago and hasn't happened since. 

A very different topic, he compliments me often, telling me I'm beautiful. But once in a while will make fun of my shoes, my hair, my style, or how I emphasis a vowel in a word. I felt for a long time it was a joke, and he compliments me often so I'm not sure if this is a big deal. 

The fights are a dog of their own. I don't want to get into them because I have a biased understanding of them. But one thing is strange to me. He thinks we should be able to put down an argument (unresolved) and just watch TV, act normal, laugh and chill. Come back to the issue another time. He also thinks if the fight is bad enough then we should take time outs, but not 20 min, he wants to leave for a day and then not come back to the topic. I told him I can't just snap back to normal right after fighting and he thinks thats weird. I also think we should talk over a fight until we can meet half way, and take breaks as needed, but for an hour or so.

We met as she was standing on the hiphop dance floor with her friends and I asked if we could walk over to the attached country bar to swing dance (I think it is so much easier to pick up girls by swing dancing than it is to try to get them to grind with you) we danced for maybe 5 minutes however her friends came over because they wanted to leave. I asked if I could kiss her and she said on the cheek, so I did. About 20 seconds later she surprised me with a kiss on the lips. I asked if I could get her number and she agreed. She mentioned that we should go on a date the next day and also messaged me the same thing shortly after. I was honestly impressed with how straightforward she was. We then went to a couple of bars the next night and hit it off.  

Over the past month we have seen each other about 6 different times. She is busy with med school so we only see each other at most twice a week, which makes the time together even more special. It also shows that even though she is incredibly busy she can still make time to see me. We also rarely text, with the exception of planning dates or random things that pop up. That is perfect for me, as I am not a big fan of texting and I can focus on work and she can focus on school. Over the month she has been amazing about planning dates, that she likes me and looks forward to spending time with me, etc. She is also super honest and says what she likes to do, how she feels, what she is thinking, what she likes when sleeping together (which I have found to be rare, especially this early). It just feels great with how things have gone so far. I've learned from past mistakes that I need to talk about dealbreakers early on and how important topics need to be discussed sooner rather than later. The last few girls I dated I had a gut feeling that it was not going to work out and it was right. I am happy to say I have not felt this at all and don't have any doubts or bad feelings. 

We were eating at a restaurant yesterday and she randomly brought up that she is not seeing anyone else and I mentioned the same and we discussed the fact that if things continue to go well that we are both open to a relationship in the future. I like how casual the conversation was. There have been no games or guessing if she likes me the entire time. We have both been open and honest with each other. 

I was also introduced to about 15 of her friends/classmates at the same time yesterday and was the only one in the group that she did not go to school with. So of course I was a little nervous. They were equally amazing and so welcoming. They all came up to me and introduced themselves and almost all of them would go out of their way to come and talk to me and have an extended conversation throughout the night. I had an amazing time with them for the 5 hours we were all together, and look forward to hanging out with them in the future.   

I know this isn't a helpful post or anything. I just wanted to post something positive and show that if you keep looking you might finally find someone you have been looking for. I have been browsing this sub for the past month and it makes me cherish what I have right now, as there are so many games being played, ghosting, people not being honest, etc. I have had my fair share of these happen to me in the past and have experienced many of the frustrations that are common on this sub.

What do you think about litmus tests while dating or searching for someone to start a relationship with?

A test such as, “I will only date someone who says bless you after I sneeze” 
Or
“I will not date someone who consistently ignores my messages on social media, but expects me to respond to every message they send”
Or even 
“I will not date someone who doesn’t have Facebook, or an apple product”

Is this ridiculous?

I will admit flat out that this whole situation is fraught with red flags that I can probably live with but there’s one thing in particular that is telling me to leave but I can’t put my finger on it and it bothers me.

I *think* it’s this: he uses vulnerability to get people to like him. At least with me. 

What I mean by that is the first time I talked to him, he told me something sad that had just happened to him that really hurt his self-esteem and bummed him out. He’s an artist so I was like well... he just wears his feelings on his sleeve. 

But he keeps doing it. He tells me about being attacked by someone in his city because it’s being slowly overrun by Proud Boy assholes. He lets me in to this like, terrible family shit that really formed him as a person. He cries to me— and that’s not a big deal but he cries like, at the drop of a hat. And it’s always at a time that it feels like he’s trying to pull me in closer. 

And to be clear I have no problem with a man being vulnerable or crying. It’s *how* he’s doing it. 

But then again is that different from what any of us do? Like we invite people into our lives, open ourselves up to someone, and then we deepen the intimacy.

I am now a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none, not even a hug. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and extreme introversion.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. Im in a natural resources major. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of aquantences who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations. When I finish college this year, my options will reduce even more due to my job taking me to a remote town.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. On top of that I am waiting for marriage which reduces possible dates even more. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Extreme introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"".

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though my first few years of college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is almost done with school (done in december) and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I dont know what.

I have been lurking here for a while and now I have a list of questions. Let me know if I should be making different posts.

I'm 23, going to be 24 very soon, graduated college last year and on a working visa in the US, and plan to go to graduate school. I'm brown, short, HWP, black hair, and black eyes; just your average Indian girl. I have never dated before, no kiss, cuddle, or anything but lately I have been thinking that I am ready for a relationship. Emotionally and mentally ready to spend time getting to know someone. Here's the problem, I want to date for a LTR/lifetime partner; I'm quite happy with my own company and if I'm going to invest time and money into something then I would prefer if both persons are looking for same thing. From multiple posts, it seems that dating apps are more for people looking to chat and meet a lot of people but I don't want to meet a lot of people, I would prefer that the getting to know part goes through texting, phone calls, and video calls before actually going to do something as I'm more shy in person with new people and that is extreme opposite to how I am when I'm relaxed and myself. Is this unrealistic? I don't mind LDR as long we both work towards moving closer to each other if we reach that stage.

I think I'm demisexual as I have never been physically attracted to anyone but know that I have a (medium?) libido. Does this matter? I find some male celebrities super handsome but not sexually attracted to them if that makes any sense like John Oliver, Trevor Noah, James Corden, Vir Das, Min Yoongi, and Ayushmann Khurrana among many others but just to say I don't think I have a type. On that note, what if I would prefer to have some feelings before anything sexual? Should I be upfront about it or just go with the flow?

I don't think I'm comfortable talking to more than one person at a time and frankly I don't think I will have the time and energy either. How will that be possible? I have tried replying to some posts on r/r4r but got no replies so should I really make a dating app profile? But I have read that if you don't reply to a match then it's a lost match and sometime people get other matches while still chatting with the first match. I'm a happy homebody, researching stuffs related to work and my field of interest, reading books, bingeing shows when something catch my eye, and occasionally go for a run. I like to travel and visit places at least once a year and once I get my driving license, I really want to get into hiking trails near me. So from people who comment on work on yourself in your 20s, any suggestions on what could be helpful or should be my focus on improving myself?

So basically please help me find a way on how to put myself out there or approach potential partners. On a side note, am I going into this with too high expectations? Do people not date to marry anymore?

Guys of most ages come onto me like I'm easy prey. I used to always wonder why I attracted players with hidden ulterior motives that were never straightforward with their intentions. And why I'd secretly romanticize the scenarios despite how toxic and dysfunctional they were. I was subconsciously seeking the love I never received from my dad and family. Constant name calling, spanking, public humiliation as forms of discipline. Just feeling unloved despite having two physically present parents.

Almost every guy I've liked only wanted to use me for sex and nothing more. I'd make up so many excuses for them and give the endless chances when I could've left. 

While the guys that genuinely cared for me, I drove them away. They'd wait until I was comfortable to kiss me instead of grabbing my face, slapping my ass aggressively, or asking me to suck their **** to make up for an argument. None of this was healthy yet I still convinced myself I could make it better if I change for them.

I jump onto the various dating sites a couple months after, all of them pretty much.  95% to give me something to do and 5% maybe find someone but in all reality I'm not ready.  Anyways!  Here are some various thoughts!

1. I'm not a bad looking guy but I am short 5'4"" so I get that just is a no go for many women.  With that being said, the likes and mutual likes over 4 month period (should say the lack of) is outside the range of probabilities.  There are some sites that allow you to see who's viewed your profile.  The idea that no one has viewed in weeks (come on now, you still look at a profile when you get a like at times!).  Something isn't quite right.
2. The overall experience, if I didn't have high self worth and confidence I would have been destroyed lol.  Just, it's bad.  I'm thinking I've probably viewed 1000s of profiles and have gone on one date where I was a fan.  Now, I did do the bit of the sexual fun thing with 2-3 women but really not my cup of tea.  Just has not been good.
3. Strangeness...so I had a lunch date with a woman.  Confirmed and on my way there my spidey sense was saying she may not come for whatever reason and I was traveling like 35 miles.  I got closer and she completely ghosted.  So weird, I was cleaning out my phone and noticed I still had her #.  Decided to ask what the shit happened?  She just was like idk.  I had another lol, this was great....I liked on like match.  She decided to reply with the 5 reasons she's not interested.  Who does that?  lol delete the message.  
4. Can be a bit addicting...these apps.  you get bored and you start checking them out.  swiping, saying hi, etc.  I've about run my course with checking this dating option out.  My objective opinion, this has been complete garbage and a waste of my time.  Maybe I'll just delete all apps and do like an hour on the weekend (computer) to see what may be of interest.

Firstly, I want to add that this all happened last year but it randomly came back to me yesterday. I (22M) had romantic interest in one of my classmates (21F) we both came from the same country and she really seemed like a nice girl. She approached me on the first day when she saw me reading alone and was kind. After about a day she began acting masculine towards me like using bro, homie, my guy etc to which I didn’t pay much mind. I asked her out after 4 weeks of knowing her asking if she was free to eat out she said I think I can spare some time. After she said yes I asked if she liked specific food in particular bc I was a vegan at the time... she says ""I don’t mind I f*ck with anything really"". She definitely wasn’t interested now looking back and when we went out she treated me like a women. She was opening doors, paying her own bill and conversing like a man I just thought that was her personality. But when she asked me how my parents would react if I was gay , I took slight offence tbh and told her that wouldn’t happen and changed the subject.

The main point of this, I was caught cheating in one of my classes that we were in together (online) and I figured out it was her who emailed my prof and said which website “students” were using to find answers to the test. She also asked to remain anonymous — during my investigation they had slipped out that they have been notified of online cheating. Huge dumb part on me for cheating tho. She always asked what I got on tests and would even ask me to send her pics of my work on assignments to which I think she used as evidence but not 100% sure on this part. Point being, I took her rejection well when she said “I am not at all interested in being in a relationship"" I was like “thanks for being honest :)” . I don’t understand why she went so far to get me in trouble (I shouldn’t have cheated although). To add, her reaction to me being nice to her was trying to appear as masculine as possible. Never heard her speak softly to me now that I think about it.



TLDR - 21F classmate rejects me and we still continue to be “friends”.

Today we went for a walk (our first time seeing each other in person) when we met up she was really happy to see me. During the walk we didn’t talk much, we had a few short conversations but due to this being my first date I don’t have experience knowing what to say. It felt pretty awkward and she said around 30 minutes in that her sister kept texting her because she runs an online store and needs to deliver stuff and is only texting her now (this is true btw, she was also looking at her phone occasionally throughout the walk and said she doesn’t do that often but her sister was annoying her). She said we can meet up again another day but I assumed she was just saying that to be polite.

When the date was done I personally think it didn’t go well due to the fact we didn’t talk that much and when we didn’t there wasn’t a flow to it like we did have online, but due to this being my first date I can’t compare it to anything or tell if it’s normal.

Assuming she didn’t want to actually go on a second date I texted her “Had fun walking, too bad we didn’t talk much” and she hasn’t responded and doesn’t seem on planning too.

I've been holding off on dating as I think I haven't earned the privilege yet. I don't have a good job yet nor any post secondary education. I'm not poor, but I work a menial job with some passion jobs on the side.

 My social skills are okay, I can keep a conversation well once I open up and can be quite funny, but I take a while to open up and struggle with strangers, especially if I find them attractive due to putting pressure on myself.

I don't really have any friends due to the pandemic except one and a couple online, so I'm pretty isolated aside from work and bare necessity shopping. 

Main bit: I worry that I won't have anything to talk about and plus my inexperience and low wage job, I worry I will fail with dating. I don't think I'm ready.

It started with the sweet restaurant dates and he is the sweetest guy i had ever met. We had so much in common. Eventually we made it official and i started sleeping over at his house and this where shit started.

- His apartment and car were FILTHY! Empty alcohol bottles, stale food, old shoes. The smell of his car was absolutely disgusting. His apartment smelled like rotting food and of course there was rotting food everywhere. Dishes were piled up, empty soda cans on the floor, sticky tiles, his beard hair was everywhere, the grease building on his stove was about 10 years old, oil splatter on the walls. His bathroom was filled with beard hair.  I mean how hard is it to vacuum that shit up. Shower curtain filled with mold, toilet still had tissue and pee inside(yes he doesn’t flush), trash can piled up with tissue, no soap to wash my hands, a bathroom mat which was also full of hair and smells disgusting. His room was full of empty alcohol bottles, more hair stuck in the corners, his gaming chair had a cushion which had one of the biggest stains i ever saw in my life. I didn’t have the guys to tell him that his apartment is disgusting so i just started to clean up. He took the vacuum from me and cleaned for about 2 minutes before he started gaming again. 
- His personal hygiene 🤮. I slept over at his place and as soon as i woke up i took a shower. He woke up with boogers in his eyes and the most disgusting breath i ever came across. I saw him walk into the bathroom and assume he was going to take a shower. Instead he took a shit and came back out of the bathroom and sat at his work desk. (Did not wash his face or even brush his teeth). For an entire day he did not shower.  It tried finding an excuse to leave by saying i had a migraine. He said “i have a tool for that” and started taking my clothes off. This guy literally took a shit and walked over to me with horrible morning breathe and boogers in his eyes and tried to have sex with me. 
- His arrogance was a big turn off. He initially told me that he is an accounts executive. I work in accounting so i was very excited to have met someone in the same field. I asked him exactly what he does and to summarize what he said... “im a salesperson”. Not that anything is wrong with that but why try to make it seem like you actually work in accounting when in reality you sell IT products. He always mentioned how much his company needed him(like sure, if you die the company would definitely die also). We both worked from home together and i was always extremely busy with client meetings. He would usually just sit infront of his laptop and play games on his phone for an entire day. He’d ask how my day was to which i always replied “busy”. And before i could go into details he would cut me off and mention how busy his day was as well and how much his boss really needs him. I honestly felt like he was jealous of my job and here’s why. He constantly asked me how much i make. He even applied to my workplace (with no degree in accounting). He has a really old car and i have a luxury car which he drove one time and complained about my car the entire time. He even argued with me because i purchased my vehicle cash and he said that as an accountant i should know that getting a car loan is a better financial decision than purchasing a car cash because “those who get a loan get their interest back and use the car for it’s full worth” . I used my accounting knowledge to tell him that taking out debt to purchase a depreciating asset is never a good financial decision. He said “forget it you won’t understand”. Can someone please tell me how purchasing a car cash is way wayy wayyyy worse than getting a loan? I’m thinking you end up paying interest and by the time you paid off your car the value decreases. Correct me if I’m wrong. 
It just pissed me off how much he hated my car but still tried his best to find out how much i paid for it. He started as such a nice guy but little things started to piss me off. For example.. i told him before that i hate sushi. He bought sushi and told me to try it again. He spent about 15 minutes teaching me how to use chopsticks which i was not interested in. I finally ate the sushi and spit it out. I told him again, i do not like sushi! He said that’s because I didn’t eat it with the chopsticks properly. Is it possible that some people just will not like every food? Is that possible? Ugh
What sickened me most is how he always mentioned he hates underachievers but in reality he was one. 31 years old living in filth with a half ass job. You are the underachiever! He tried to make me feel so insecure about myself but I strongly suspect that he was jealous of me. Just an arrogant person who laughed at others(doing better than him in life btw). Also i feel like he was just festering with issues. He had a rash on his groin, a fungus on his face, arms and back and scalp. But he really showed me affection, always talked about getting married some day, introduced me to his mom. He knew i loved a particular drink and would purchase everyone from the supermarket. He really expressed his feelings, always told me loved me and the way he looked at me i could tell he really did and i felt super horrible for ending the relationship because he was the sweetest boyfriend i ever had but. 
His butt crack would also show when he got out of the car and he wouldn’t even pull his pants up and it was so embarrassing. He also had pre cum stains on his pajamas and he would walk around comfortably with the stains. I just could not see myself living with him for the rest of my life.

So I’ve been keeping it pretty light. No real pressure lol, I think the first night we went out we talked, had a good connection; went back to his place, did what we did. I asked him if he was actually serious about looking for an LTR; he said he was and asked what I was looking for. He was literally the first guy I matched with and first date I’d been on so I was like eh, I have no expectations. It’d be nice to find someone to pass time with and if something develops from there great. 

I left pretty quickly afterwards, lol not the kind to overstay my welcome even though he offered to sit down and watch some more tv or whatever. We hung out again a couple days later…had sex; I left again. 

So then about a week and a half goes by I don’t really hear from him…not too surprising…he was selling his house/closing and moving. Or for all I know going on other dates. It’s cool, I was going on other dates too so I wasn’t really heartbroken that he didn’t really contact me. I met another guy who actually made me want to be in a relationship but then that blew up so I went on a couple other dates that didn’t really go anywhere. Throughout all this, this guy starts texting me more and more. Saying he can’t wait to have me over and we should make plans to hang out soon. 

Cool so about 3 weeks after our last date we finally set up a third date. I come over and he’s all shy, showing me his new place. He was like yea I was worried you would get here too early and I’d still be cleaning. Internally I was like I feel like I’m just a booty call you don’t have to try that hard…externally I was like oh you didn’t have to go that far, I get moving is a difficult process. 

Surprisingly we had a really great night..I mean yea we had sex again but afterwards I didn’t exactly rush out the door. We talked for awhile and I was like oh crap. I may actually have a lot in common with this guy. And the sex…the sex was a bit more intimate versus just physical? He was actually kissing my thighs and being gentle with me…but when we were talking I mentioned I’d been going on other dates and kind of joking like yea I mean I saw you were like the ambassador of all these sites because like we met on tinder but I got tired of the fake profiles and guys I was matching with so I join bumble and there you are, I quit bumble and join hinge, and there you are…lol and then I quit that and join match…like seriously though do you get paid to be on these sites??? I was laughing but he got all flustered and embarrassed. He was like oh man I’m sorry, that’s so embarrassing. He’s like I match with a lot of women yea but the conversation always dies out. So I hardly meet anyone. Then when I do lock in a date, I’m introverted so it takes a lot out of me to actually meet someone. Like I start out like dreading it to be honest. I’d rather sit on my couch but I also realize sometimes I get lonely so I force myself on these dates. Seeing you isn’t bad because we’ve gotten past the first date already. I was like yea no I mean don’t worry, I get it. Dating is tough! I quit all the apps and am just not trying anymore. It’s just not worth it, especially since a lot of the guys on there have been on there for year or longer. Like some folks come with a lot of red flags and I’m beginning to realize OLD might not be the place to find love or an LTR.

Lol ok. So anyway. I leave late that night and he texts me before I get to text him asking if I made it home ok, I’m like yep was just about to text you and let you know. Teased him not to make me wait 3 more weeks before I hear from him again.

So this week. Derby week here in KY. He was supposed to have his brother out this weekend but cancelled with him because he got food poisoning. Obviously we didn’t hang out though I offered to come cuddle. With Covid though he felt it better to be safe than sorry. No big deal. He’s definitely stepped things up texting wise, checking in almost everyday to say hi or something. And today. Today he asks me if I like zoos or roller coasters. I was like oh coasters for sure! I used to go to six flags in Geneva all the time as a kid. Went to six flags in California in 2017 and that’s the last time I’ve done anything like that.

He asks me if I’ll go to Cedar point with him…I’m like yea I’d love to but isn’t that like a 6-7 hour drive from here? He was like well yea but I figure we can make a weekend of it. Ok so I’m pretty spontaneous and love random road trips lol so I was all for it but this guy is just so crazy? 

Lol I keep wondering if I’m just a booty call or if he has some feelings for me. Who asks a person on a weekend road trip after only 3 dates in one month?? I’m also legit curious if we are going to see each other before then or if he’s going to make me wait until the end of the month to see him. 

TL:DR Would you ask a girl out you’ve gone out with 3 times in one month to go on a 6 hour road-trip for a 2 day trip to an amusement park?? Technically 4 days because well drive out Friday, spend the night, go to the park Saturday and Sunday; then come back Monday. 

I feel like I’d wait maybe until we are actually a thing before going on a road trip but maybe he already sees us as a thing? This dude confuses the heck out of me. I’m like I don’t even know if you snore?? Like we haven’t spent the night together yet; sex yes but actual sleepovers??

I separated from my husband in august of last year and am almost done with my divorce. End of September last year I meet a guy that swept me off of my feet FAST but our relationship quickly became unhealthy. Jealousy on his part due to previous cheating in old relationships, has 4 kids and owns a business that is risky. His kids are a lot but I fell in love with them quickly too and we blended our families fast. Way too fast honestly. Come November I let him move into my new home that I bought for me and my two kiddos. Well our relationship consisted over lots of fights about the stress of our 6 kids, financial concerns belonging to him because of his business and poor credit and child support and other not so smart financial decision. I’m a college educated woman with a good career and am able to very comfortably support myself and my kids on my own. Honestly, he can’t do the same even though he owns a business. Our fights turned nasty, lots of screaming and yelling and cutting each other down. I decided to end it last month and it’s been a battle back and forth of emotions on to try again with him or not. At the park I met a guy there with his daughter and we hit it off quickly. He’s a jam up dude, very successful, a bronze star veteran and just you can tell this guy has his shit straight and is very financially secure. He’s interested in dating but obviously I’m still stuck on this recently ended relationship because one second I think I’m ready to move on and boom here is this awesome guy just thrown right to me almost immediately that could give me the kind of secure life that I’m looking for but I can’t help but feeling like maybe I should try and repair what I had with the previous guy. I fell so hard for him and I’ve never experienced anything in my life what I had with him and I’m terrified of not getting that with another person. Hell I didn’t even have that with my husband of 15 years. I don’t know if that’s just what happens when you’re stuck in the web of a toxic relationship or what.....but I honestly feel paralyzed regarding what to do now.

I’ve been dating my bf for six months now. We have our ups and downs, he’s in the marines and i am a civilian. We’ve been seeing each other pretty regularly and talk during the day, we are both 30 yo. 

So we were together this weekend, and it was the first time he had asked me to move in with him. We’ve talked about a lot of serious stuff since when we met, since we both told each other our intentions. So in short we are pretty serious. Then later that night we were looking at some funny videos on his phone and I saw that he still has a folder of his ex on his phone. The ex that he dated before me for over two years ago. I got super upset. He apologized and deleted the folder, he said “I didn’t realize that its still there, it was an oversight. Its not like I’ve been looking at it”. He then showed me a folder with my name on it and I said “thats not supposed to make me feel better”. He said the reason I kept that folder is because I wanted to make an only fans account of this girl so I can make money off of it. Which that made me even more upset and disgusted!! 

Honestly I feel so fucking betrayed that this guy on one hand would ask me to move in with him and at the same time have those kind of intentions. Another thing is he kept talking shit about his exes on our early days of our relationship and I thought it was because of trauma. When I talked to him about that he said he’s saying those things to show that I’m the opposite. I said I don’t need validation,the reason why they’re gone and I’m here is bec they didn’t work out so why point out those thing. 

I don’t know what to think of this, yes he deleted the folder but it makes me think, not only the fucked up part is making the only fans but he could still be looking at her photos when im not with him. I’m so disgusted I hate it. I told him before he is not over his ex and tbh this confirms it.

After dating for the summer she cheated on me and bailed. Even though she never apologized I forgave her because looking back the relationship wasn’t going anywhere. I just wish she would have been more mature about it.

I find myself thinking a lot about that relationship because I had a blast. We gave each other shit. We went on adventures. We stayed in and watched a movie. We did so much stuff together and I had a blast. Summer of 2018 was the best summer I ever had.

We got separated because of the pandemic and live in different cities now, but before that, we would hang out pretty often and would be on the phone for hours with each other. We were both involved in the local music scene, and we both didn't drive, so we would catch Ubers to shows together all the time because it was more cost-effective. He tells me about his love life and I tell him about mine. 

We're both night owls, so sometimes we'd take walks together at 1-2 AM. One time I was taking a walk with him and ran into an old friend, and she seemed suspicious and playfully kept asking if there was something going on between him and I. I told her there wasn't, but she didn't seem to believe it. 

There's a guy I have a crush on \[23M\], and and one time I was telling him a story about when I went with D to get snacks at a gas station and we were put into a dangerous situation. He asked me if something was going on between me and D, and I told him there wasn't. Skip to a few months later, I had admitted to my crush that I liked him and we were in a situation where we were about to hook up but there was a lot of hesitation. He admitted to me that he couldn't stop thinking about me and D, and I asked why. He said he felt like something was going on between me and D, and would feel weird about pursuing me if there was. I reassured him there was nothing going on. Then there was a point where he went to the bathroom and I was messaging one of my friends, and I set my phone down when he came back because I wanted to give him my undivided attention. He didn't have his phone in the room and he picked my phone up to check the time, but I really think he was trying to slyly see who I was texting so I'm not sure if he fully believed me. We ended up almost hooking up anyway but it didn't end up happening because of something unrelated. But after that night, things kind of fell through and my crush seemed anxious about something and nothing really happened with us. We're still friends, but I have a gut feeling it was related to that and we never really got to talk it out (because we were also separated by the pandemic). 

A few weeks after that, I went to a show that D was hosting but I rode with another friend. So, I was standing with a different friend in the audience. An acquaintance came up to me and asked me if me and D wanted to hang out with him afterwards, and I think I explained my ride situation. He said he thought I was with D, and when I told him I wasn't, the guy started to act interested in me like he wanted to hang out with just me. I wasn't interested in this guy, but I feel like it was another indication of someone who was interested in me that didn't mention anything because he thought I was with D. 

I also bring D up in conversations with friends, because he's a big part of my life.

I’m a 20 year old guy and I’ve got a pretty serious crush on a friend of mine who’s a 20 year old girl. I’ve always liked her and have gone through several periods where I’ve noticed that I’ve had a kind of liked her, but I had an experience last weekend with her that made me realize that I really like her. 

So last weekend my fraternity had an event in a city about 40 minutes from my University, on the way there we mostly talked as a group with the people that rode with us, we had a really great time at dinner and at the event, but I realized that I really liked her on the drive home. We talked one on one to each other the whole 40 minute drive home but it felt more like 5 minutes. We got so deep into our conversation that neither of us noticed that I missed my exit on the highway by about 5 miles, only realizing when one of the other people I was driving noticed. 

If this was anyone else, then I’d know 100% that they were into me but because we’re already kind of friends and she is honestly one of the nicest people I know. 

I know it can be hard to read the situation from an outside, Reddit, perspective but I could really use some advice. Because she’s such a nice person I’m not really scared of rejection in this case, I’m honestly mostly just worried about putting her in an awkward position. We’re in our last week of classes before finals then summer, then she’s studying abroad in the fall, so this week is my last chance to make a move for awhile.

He looks at me a lot (the other guy in the group who is a bit older than the rest of us tells me he sees him starring at me a lot)... We stargazed the other night and he told me a secret about an STD he has get from his former partner and how he regrets it and he talked about his life and we watched the sunrise together. Yesterday we walked in the rain at 5 am and again he talked a lot. I'm not a talkative person so he has to ask me questions agout my life. 

But I seen him flirt with other girls who visit us sometimes, a new girl has come to the group and he is now talking to her a lot. But my older friend sais he's just being friendly with her and he has a crush on me.

I really like him, we have so much in common, even our name are kind of the same. I don't know what to do? Tell him I like him? Play along?
