might wanna strap in cuz this might be a while. so right before i turned 17(M) i - met 15 year old girl. we were BOTH in VERY hard places. we have been for the MAJORITY of our lives. she had a VERY traumatic childhood. because of this she is hypersexual. she had relations with 4 different guys before we met. she was only 15 ive been trying to get over it over the years but i cant, deep down it hurts. she had a misscarriage when she was 14 with one of the dudes, he was 20 years old at the time‚Ä¶. on the other hand, the only time ive slept with someone, it was at a party where i had been date drugged and brought upstairs by two girls, because of this, sex is a really scary and touchy subject for me. she understands she takes it slow with me and i respect that. anyways thats just the backstory on her. me? ive been thru alot aswell, i had an alchol problem by the time i was 15, and a pill and coke problem when i was 17. i used it to cope with my extremely traumatic childhood, i know its not healthy but its the truth. almost 2 years clean now because of her. she also struggles, she‚Äôs been 48 days sober because of me. the first like 20 months we were together it was good, it always had been, things just got EXTREMELY toxic when we argued probably due to the fact that we werent taught how to deal with emotions in healthy ways, or because we werent taught real love when we should‚Äôve. i was HONESTLY an absolute asshole to her. we literally gave each other eating disorders because of how verbally abusive we were with each other. i never trusted her because of her past and MY pst and how i had always been lied to by everyone. i always thought there was never anyone there. and turns out there never was. until the 2nd most recent break we had. (we take alot of breaks, but always promised to stay loyal) i cant even remember what set it off, probably something so petty, but we ended up not talking for 2 months. she slept w her ex, the one that she had the miscarriage with, the one that literally groomed her. she told me about it 4 months later after we had been doing PERFECTLY fine for about 2 months AFTER the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù i kept pressinf her and asking her if there was ever anyone there. and i had a DEEP DEEP gut feeling that she was LYING about it this time. she got very defensive about it, she got very rude, very hurtful VERY FAST anytime i asked her.so i used screenshots i got from my friend and his gf to make it seem like i had been talking to someone on our break, as a means of exploiting her ‚Äú ha im greater than you, im always one step ahead mentality‚Äù and i was right. she had slept with him a WEEK before we took that break. while we were still together. i couldnt get past it, i still cant almost 5 months later. at first i was so angry at her, literally fuming, i took screenshots of the chats she sent me with him and i was gonna send them to her mom who works a federal job (i wanted him GONE) it was something they only did 2 times while we was with me, both while we had that last big break. i calmed down i sat down for about a week or two, everyone told me to leave her because i cant love someone after they do something like that, and the truth is‚Ä¶. i love her, i love her with every fucking muscle and bone in my body. what she did LITERALLY tore me apart, i stayed away from drugs but i slipped back into my drinking habit. whenever i got back in my head (i was still hurting) but realized i needed to stop drinking or i was gonna literally kill myself off. so i got my shit together, i got professional help, i started going to communication classes, i did research so i could help with her eating disorder that was NOW out of control. i did research to learn how to manage her psychotic episodes, i did research to help manage her BPD. basically i took 2 months almost to become a subject matter expert in dealing with her. we‚Äôve been going good for 4 months now. i got her off the coke, the pills and the alcohol almost overnight. she is gaining healthy weight, we BOTH communicate in healthy ways 90% of the time, sometimes she slips and says some VERY nasty things to me ( i dont want to sound innocent, ive caused SERIOUS damage, but im trying now, ive been trying for almost 5 months, putting EVERYTHING aside to fix us). the other day she asked me why i was so hurt about what she did if i didnt love her and my literal reaction was ‚Äúüòê‚Äù i did love her, i was just broken, i still am but im mature enough to realize this isnt the way. i told her she had made me insecure about myself and she kinda just shrugged it off. she said she would fix it and she has a little. i told her why i was so upset, and the truth is its because i love her, i never DID stop loving her. i told her i was uncomfortable about it because of the age gap and because the age gap didnt seem to bother her, i called him a pedo and that SET. HER.OFF. it was our first big fight this whole time and now we‚Äôre going downhill. i told her i want him dead for what he did because he knew we were together, and she said ‚Äúwhy do u want him dead? why do u want the man that treated your girlfriend right, when YOU didnt, dead?‚Äù and i told her everything i thought about him, and the way she spoke about him says it all, i feel so compared, i feel lesser than him, i feel insufficient, i feel little. i know i deserve it for the things ive said and done. but im trying to right my wrongs. she gets upset anytime i talk about it because i need closure, ‚Äúoh i already gave u closure, im not asking u to let it go or get over it, but if u want us to get better we need to move past him‚Äù. granted i bring it uo almost everyday. because how can u tell me u love me but yet, say the things u said to him, or do the things u did with him. and STILL tell me u love me RIGHT after u were with him. i KNOW SHE doesnt want ANYTHING to do with him. because he is WAAAAY worse than i am. and i do believe she regrets it. i was in the phone with her when she called him and told him it was over. but i DONT believe shes over him. ive told her so many times to leave me and go be with him (she talks about him, and how he treated her, like he‚Äôs some god) i just want her to be happy, even if its not with me, or because of me. and she says shes good where we are, yet anytime she gets angry at me she calls me a piece of shit or uses my past against me or tells me how much better HE wouldve replied. she says that relationship is dead. its in the past. and that she doesnt want it because he doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with her mental issues like i do. but idk. i just need help. she blew up on me again 2 days ago, called me disgusting for having an opinion different from her, told me it gave her an ‚Äúick‚Äù for the first time ever.  those words echo in my skull, along with ‚Äúno matter what i do my ex is always in the back if my head‚Äù which is how she admitted to me she had cheated months ago when she came clean. i told her i was ‚Äúdone‚Äù and then i blocked her. i still love her so much i think about her all the time, anything something funny happens at work. anytime i have something cool happen i‚Äôll literally pick up the phone to go tell her about my day and then ill remember i blocked her and emotions overwhelm me. part of me thinks im confusing ‚Äúlove‚Äù with comfort. example. she has been in my life for 4 years, the only SEMI consistent thing in my life which may be why i think im in love w her. but at the same time i cant imagine a future without her, anytime i think about kids i see her face in my kids faces. her nose, her lips, her bright green eyes. im just so tired of fighting over every little thing. i need help. it is VERY hard for me to keep her blocked for long, this is probably the longest ‚Äúbreak‚Äù we have that SHE doesnt initiate and its only been 2 days. the worst part is she acts like it doesnt affect her, i know that it does because her friends text me telling me how sad she is or how much she tells them she misses me, or that she wont shut up about me, but anytime i ask her to tell me about her feelings for me she doesnt have anything to say, im a VERY loving person, i need communication i need to VERBALLY hear etuff like that from her and i dont. its so tiring. i know it wont be easy but in the end if we figure stuff out and fix our issues this could be the best thing i will ever have, but im already so tired. i guess im just venting, but a little but of advice would be nice.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164163,public,self,reddit please dont let me down‚Ä¶,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tjc265/reddit_please_dont_let_me_down/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Warning: This is indeed actually quite long story ;)

**Prologue and some basic info about me**

In 2016 I undergone coming-out that I am not ""straight"" but actually yes after I got brief and low quality date with my 1st GF in 2015-2016. I realised I am an **hetero-demi-romantic asexual**, which means I like idea of being in relationship with girl, but I want to completly exclude sexual dimension from our physical intimacy and also I am not falling into love instantly, rather gradually and basically in sync with friendship quality build-up.

I also have since my 4 years diagnosed asperger syndrome. This means I have a lot of scientific interests, I am very pragmatic and also I am driven mostly by ""brain"" in relationship, than by ""heart"" when it comes to relationship and I mostly learned how to be in relationship from guides, advices and manuals. If anyone watches TV series ""Good Doctor"", I am basically Shaun Murphy in mild version.

This set of properties is quite hard combo to get ""compatible"" partner and I was completly aware of it when I calculated probability of getting compatible counterpart. ( I estimated it to 1 : 12500 chance taking into many variables and estimates )

**First time bumping into my current girlfriend (3rd one and current one)**

The story begun in Sep-2014 when I joined school trip into CERN facility in order to explore the LHC, whole facility and also Geneva after this. This was during my high-school studies (equivalent to CZ - gymn√°sium or UK - grammar school). After we had explored LHC we travelled into French town Annemasse in order to get back into hotel and Flunch (local fast-food). When I had been waiting on parking lot for our rented bus, I bumped into girl that attracted my attention because she completly ommited small-talk and I was feeling that she basically has more sophisticated mindset compared to average in her age range. For some reason I did not invite her to any kind of 1:1 appointment or started casually spending time together. Few months later I graduated (passed maturita exam which is required in order to pass certain types of high schools in Czech Republic) and on ""maturitn√≠ ples"" (prom equivalent here) I was only with my parents and friend. She kept studying, because as she was younger than me, she had to study this school for 3 more years.

**First relationship - fail non plus ultra, asexual coming out and 2nd attempt**

Meanwhile on university 2015) I got into short-term relationship after my friend attempted match-making. (Between Oct-2015 - Jan-2016)  It was generally bad experience, but I finally satisfied my wish to experience romantic feelings, got first experience, improved soft-skills and it also opened topic of my identity. Which lead into my asexual coming-out as explained in second paragraph.

I discovered after breaking up with 1st GF, that I need to specialise on asexual girls and because of this I should be more ""systematical"" becauase meeting randomly asexual is quite rare (1 % of population is estimated to be asexual). For that reason I created account on one of Czech asexual forums which I also has online dating module. This was in Feb-2016 and few weeks after that I submitted post that I am looking for long term relationship with asexual girl where I also specified in about 2 little paragraph, what I would (not) like to see in relationship and what I can offer with refference to my account there.

**Second relationship (GF no. 2)**

I finally got some reasonable answer in Jul-2016 and when I saw she had declared herself as heteroromantic asexual and from her writing I noticed she is not too simple person and we have mutual interests I have proposed to meet each other in person still without intention to make a date out of it.

Meet-up was neither fail nor success, because at time when we were supposed to meet sudden thunderstorm with strong donwpours had come and at the place where she had been wating, lightning struck only about 300m (\~ 1000 ft) next to her. Afterwards we moved to local caf√© which I suggest, exchanged more private information and it confirmed me, she might be compatible with me.

After four more meetups we started feeling romantic attraction and we declared ourselves as couple. This was in Aug-2016. We had a nice romantic relationship, we loved each other, managed to keep alive middle distance relationship (about 2.5 hours by train) and I thought we were ideal match. However the downside was that she was not that eager as I expected to share information about her psychological problems (depression, using SSRI antidepressants) and she was quite moody, basically from super happy to annoying and grumpy, which I did not like. Partly because this was part of her personality and partly due to non-ideal antidepressants, which amplified that. This escalated up to few strong arrguments and after I saw there is no progress, I gave up on this we broke up. (Oct-2017)

**Long phase of being single and temporary fail**

This break-up was for me quite hard, because while I used to love her (2nd GF) I also hated a lot of her properties. It had taken me about 2 years to completly stop thinking about her and stopped seeing her in my dreams. Meanwhile I had to pause my university studies, I switched to full-time job and studies to part-time.

For my surprise I noticed, that during Prague Pride 2018 there was planned meeting of asexuals. For that reason I joined, I wanted to see who else has the same orientation + exchange experience. This was nice and important event for me. Which eventually lead into creating AsexuaLOVE Facebook group next year (Aug-2019) in order to replace old forum, where a lot of people started being passive.

I noticed when there was large surge of welcome posts and among them was one, which attracted my attention, because she had as mutual friend physics professor from my high school. That was quite weird for me and after some public answers below the post we switched into private messages. We learned, we were those students, who had met on that parking lot in France during our school trip into CERN and that she is also asexual, which was for me great discovery and chance. That was in Aug-2019. Initially it looked promising, but after few days she told she was by that time taken, I accepted that and kept respecting virtual friendship but for some reason she stopped answering after about 2 weeks after I learned she is taken.

I assumed this was a forever lost chance, however due to fact I finally handled completly break-up with 2nd GF and I aimed more on getting independent counting with option I might remain single for long time it actually did not make me as much disappointed as I expected.

**Finally meeting old-new girl**

After that pause I posted a video on my personal facebook account in Jan-2021, where was my bird feeder swamped by long tailed tits. For some reason Facebook dropped that video in few minutes, probably because it evaluated ""tits"" from that bird specie name as sexual content, so I got strike, which I appeled and was eventually lifted (there were only birds :) ). I posted screenshot of this as joke post on AsexuaLOVE FB group. The same girl also responded firstly under the post, later into private messages.

After this I started to like more birds, bird observing. From sporadic chatting we moved to regular chatting. Being polite and indirect i ask her, how she is doing well with her boyfriend (I assumed still she was taken). I got information, she had broken up with her boyfriend few months ago. After this I realised there is a chance after she handles break-up, I get ready to dating / getting into relationship and finally COVID restriction are lifted up. There was regional lockdown in Czech Republic during Jan-Mar-2021, so any meetup / date in person would have been impossible.

From my point of view it had super slow progress and I was afraid, this will end up with eternal friendzone. I was almost at the point I wanted to give up, but that perfect match on paper was actually something I did not want to give up. The list of properties I liked was:  


* Mutual interests
* Both PC gamers
* Both asexual and hetero-romantic
* Both having asperger syndrome (we understand each others abnormality :D )
* Being less than 10 km / 6 mi next to each other
* Being very nice to animals
* Being 3 years apart in age (26M / 23F), rational approach
* Being tolerant to meeting friends of opposite gender 
* Direct, honest, transparent and pragmatic communication

Eventually we agreed on meeting us in person in local cat caf√© in Jun-2021 (caf√© where live cats can walk among guests and even jump on your lap) without intention making a US style date ouf of it. We repeted this several times. However the issue was, she was not very eager having physical contact (like hugging, cheek kiss, etc.), actually we started hugging on arrival and after escorting her to the bus stop after 3 months.

**Upgrading from friendship**

Frequency of our meetups started rising up during Nov-2021, I was introduced into some family secrets and our communication became more personal and some compliments slipped into our talking. In order to disrupt that stalemate I risked and wrote slightly romantic message where I mainly stated I was pleasantly surprised, I was feeling relaxed with her and reached break-even point being happier together than without each other. This opened question, whether we should move to relationship straight away or later. We postponed answer to this question to time after university exam period.

On 12th January 2022 we visited us at my home, so my mother could meet her in person. During discussion she called me ""boyfriend"". After we moved into my room and played some PC games, she asked if I am O.K. about status quo ""boyfriend"". I gratefully accepted her offer and asked the same question vice versa if she feels O.K. if I start calling her ""girlfriend"". 

It is quite unbelivable how complicated can be path reaching your loved one. I am happy, that my patience and systematic approach lead into almost ""winning a jackpot"" and basically almost perfect match",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164164,public,self,Random meetup in 2014 in CERN and patience in friendzone 2021 - 2022 rewarded by stable relationship.

I recently dated a woman who had only been with 7 people - They were all relationships but one of them was a guy she was ‚Äútalking to‚Äù for 8 months but really didn‚Äôt see it going anywhere. She said they slept together 3 times over that 8 month period (occurred towards the end). I wanted to get an understanding as to why she slept with him if she knew it wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and she stated that she was going through a state of depression at 21 years old and that she was feeling low about herself. That she enjoyed his company and companionship so would question ‚Äúcould I see myself with him - some days being yes and some days realizing no‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm thankful she felt comfortable being open and honest with me but I don‚Äôt understand why a woman would sleep with a man that she is uncertain about. I initially told her I understand, that sex is an enjoyable act - but she came back saying that she didn‚Äôt ever crave or desire sex with him, that she was just at a low point and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel confident in herself to tell him no at the time‚Äù. Which surprises me, as she comes across as one of the most confident people I know. I get that people mature and grow from 21 to 30 years old. 

I know this may be silly to many but it really affects me emotionally. I was raised quite conservative and I feel like EVERYONE I‚Äôve ever dated or ‚Äútalked‚Äù to has slept around - and that‚Äôs with meeting them at church, local events, restaurants, etc. no matter where I go or look it‚Äôs the same story and the older I get the more it‚Äôs going to become.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164164,public,self,Anyone have tips on how they personally accepted their partner‚Äôs sexual past from their college days,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tjcm8p/anyone_have_tips_on_how_they_personally_accepted/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

so the girl i know had been more than 2 year, and already haven't meet in a year due to covid, she been back hometown. before we been out for dinner and movie few time, but as friend. then we been texting and having call for a year, in between i got confess the feeling to her, and wanted to be more than friend, she said didn't know yet (maybe is just turn down with a polite way), but after that we still got call and text.

But recently is been running thing to talk with and she was like not much more interact( like me mostly start the topic and carry the conversation) and she never been text me first, but she do will reply. also got few time she been around the town, but she refuse to meet due to travel with family and the covid case(case in my country is quite high)

So been wonder is anyone had situation like this before, can gave some advice and suggestion. or maybe there is no more chance in here.

It was wonderful,even tho I think I may have caught a cold due to the super chilly and snowy weather outside, I still managed to have a blast with my gf at home. The past couple of days past like a fucking joke (we binged a whole season of a TV series we started, we played some games and had a lot of sex). So let me cut to the chase.

I am the one in the relationship with the big sex drive. I can really go on and on. Usually the way this rolls I make her orgasm till I feel that she is satisfied or till I cum myself. I manage to make her orgasm/squirt about 10/2 times each in usually about 45 mins. Because I was a bit under the weather tho (due to the cold) I wasn't quite in the mood yesterday, so we just sticked to the series and went out on a drive. When we came back home both of us where in the mood for some sex, and this is when things started going out of the ordinary. In about 2 hours (\~1:45\~2:00hours I dont know I wasn't keeping that much track of time) she went crazy. She came right about 20 times and squirted 10. I know this can sound like normal or nothing to make a fuss about but the last 5 of them were insane. 2 orgasm before stopping she said she had a terrible headache, so I went ahead and suggested to stop because I got scared. At this point she went full baby mode and started crying because she wanted more. I mean I am not that experienced but I know for sure she has NEVER DONE THAT. She hasn't even came so hard or CRAVED for another on so badly. She even asked simpler stuff like a blowjob or something like that. For a moment it felt like she was addicted or like I want giving her some kind of drugs or some shit.

Look I know I can sound exaggerating or this whole story story can sound a bit weird. I have had a couple of experiences before and this is a first. Afterward she was extremely chill and VERY hungry.

Now I'm smart enough to know that this wasn't entirely a joke and it's definitely a flirty comment which is absolutely unnecessary. I confronted her and told her how I found it weird and inappropriate. She proceeded to gaslight me and say how I always make a big deal out of things and that I only look for opportunities to fight with her.

I‚Äôm a 24 year old woman who grew up extremely shy and didn‚Äôt have many friends. 

I‚Äôve been working on that, though, and I don‚Äôt consider myself shy anymore. I have many friends and people think that I‚Äôm smart, funny, and have a good sense of style (they‚Äôve told me that). 

Buuut I still get very insecure around men. When I was little (&lt;15), I always avoided the boys in my class, because they were immature and were mean to the girls (including me). 

As I grew up I was still shy and barely had any friends, so I didn‚Äôt exactly talk a lot to guys. 

And now‚Ä¶well, I‚Äôm 24 and I still don‚Äôt feel relaxed when there‚Äôs men around (especially if they‚Äôre around my age or very attractive). I feel like they will judge me or think that I‚Äôm not pretty enough. 

I want to change this, because it‚Äôs stupid. I‚Äôm not 12 anymore, I want to be able to talk to anyone. I think I would get along fine with most men if I was more confident, because I think we have a lot in common (I spent my lonely teenage years being very nerdy, so I have many interests). 

How do I get started? How can I feel more comfortable? 

I‚Äôm not opposed to some ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know what to ‚Äúfake‚Äù.

But dating? Ugh... It just stresses me out. I am a 24 year old male. I'll be honest, I have mild autism, so I have struggled with social awkwardness, however I do have many friends of both sexes and often go out, so I am a lot more social and have an easier time talking to people than I did in high school. I also don't mean for this to be a hate post towards women, it's not. I know there are plenty of good women out there, but they're hard for me to find. 

So recently, I had been talking to a woman I matched with on Tinder for the past couple of weeks. This was my first time dating in 2 years since my last bad breakup with an ex girlfriend of 1 year, which really fucked me over, that I took a break from dating completely. Now that the covid situation is relaxed, I felt like I was now ready to get back in there again. 

So she messaged me first, we then exchanged numbers and had great conversations, exchanging voice notes and video calls, so we were very intimate. She often text me first, even while she was at work. I felt like we had something. As days went by, she was showing more interest, such as flirting with me, talking about wanting to meet up with me and even mentioned how she talks to her family about me, which I thought was nice to know that she may be serious about this. That's when I started developing feelings for her, so I asked her out and she said yes. 

We had a great first date, it was all going perfect. She was flirting the whole night, we even talked about meeting up more, talked about our similar interests, talked about sex and even made out by the end of the night. At the end, I walked her to a taxi and she said she wanted to meet up again this week, so I went home happy feeling like this was finally the next chapter in my life that could turn into something special. When I got home, she texted me saying that she 'missed my lips already.' I felt that this was finally it. 

But until yesterday morning she texted me saying she 'just wanted to be friends' and couldn't see potential romance from us. I was very surprised to hear because I genuinely thought we had something, but I just reluctantly accepted that and gave her some space. Then this morning, I messaged her just to ask how she was doing, but she ignored me and then deleted me of all socials and my number.
After everything we did... Weeks of intimate video calls, conversations, what seemed like a great date and her saying she liked me and wanting to meet up more, I really thought we had potential, but now it's all gone in an instant. I was happy and excited for the future for a while, and it feels like my heart was just crushed in an instant. And I'm left feeling like was I played or is there something wrong with me? I just feel so stupid now for allowing myself to be vulnerable with her. 
Yes, I did have a cry about in my bed by myself last night. I'm aware that I need to just move on, but I can't help but feel very hurt. 

But this isn't the only dating experience I've had. I was in a relationship for one year as mentioned two years before, which ended because she had been texting other men. Before that, I did date a few other women which were mostly similar experiences to my recent one, they show interest but then ghost me eventually. I also have a hard enough time trying to attract women too, so I think in those rare occasions where I do end up meeting new women, I just get too easily attached. That's probably my biggest weakness. 

Regardless, it just makes me sad. I know I sound pathetic after just one bad experience for the first time in two years, but I just want to one day find someone who I can be comfortable with, I want to get married, have kids one day and just be happy. But now I'm starting to lose hope. People often say ""the right person will come along"" but I don't think I can go through any more, ghosting, mind games, rejection, cheating just to find one person in 10 years time or so. My friends are all in long term relationships, two are also getting married soon. 
I may only be 24, but I'm not getting younger either. I worry too much that by the time I'm past my prime years, it will be too late for me. 

I am also well aware that I am not entitled to a relationship nor a woman's affections, but it still hurts.

This past week was spring break so I was back in my hometown. He took me out to dinner (date 1) and introduced me to his friends (date 2). We made out a lot on date 2. I moved back up to campus yesterday (it‚Äôs an hour from him). We go to the same school but he‚Äôs not on campus this semester.

We were supposed to see each other the day before yesterday but he cancelled. He asked to come visit me at college and stay the night, and I said that sounds great but I‚Äôd want to take things slow. I also told him that Im not gonna be around this weekend and that this week might be super busy. 

He asked if we could get together during the week, and I told him I‚Äôd probably be free today (Monday) but he said that wouldn‚Äôt work but that we‚Äôd figure it out.

I noticed slowed communication after saying I want to take things slow. I sent the last text at the end of our last conversation (it was just ‚Äúsweet‚Äù). He never responded or tried to make more conversation after that, and he normally does. That was 16 hours ago. He also broke our Snapchat streak :( 

I really like this guy but I‚Äôm worried about reaching out again because
a) I told him that I didn‚Äôt just want to bang, so I want to let him go if that‚Äôs actually what he wants

b) I feel like I might be getting ghosted, and I always regret sending a text it when I find out that that‚Äôs the case. It makes getting over it easier if I can keep my pride üòÇ

Reason 1: he smokes. It‚Äôs always been a deal breaker for me, and his profile says he doesn‚Äôt smoke but he told me he occasionally smokes. If he enjoys it i don‚Äôt want to make him quit just for me. And if he says he quits and lies about it, that‚Äôll ruin the trust between us.

Reason 2: different family background. He grew up in a small family with average income, while i‚Äôm from a relatively well off family. My parents are frugal and i wasn‚Äôt raised like a spoiled rich kid but we still have our differences, and he sometimes makes ‚Äúrich people joke‚Äù which makes me feel uncomfortable.

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I‚Äôve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven‚Äôt found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21.

My mom says that she really loved my dad and she‚Äôs been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don‚Äôt know them or aren‚Äôt related to them). She says she didn‚Äôt settle but I just don‚Äôt get how you aren‚Äôt settling if you aren‚Äôt physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don‚Äôt really have an active sex drive, I don‚Äôt enjoy masturbating and haven‚Äôt had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to him.

The thing about it is that is that I'm not expecting anything to come out of the date. In fact, I am expecting the opposite. She is attractive but may not be my ""type.""

She seems out-going so I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about but this is my 3rd separate date in two weeks. First date went well but she rejected me (think she wanted a hookup but wasn't that attracted to me in-person). Second date was an out-of-towner who rejected my kiss attempt at the end of the date. Now, here comes this third date with someone I matched with quite literally after the second. 

I haven't had these many consecutive dates in a row since my early 20s but I think at this point I just admittedly want something casual. I've tried to establish relationships but it seems like a lot of the people I date aren't looking for that, at least with me. I am good-looking guy, but I guess I'm having some bad luck. I don't want to go into the date with bad vibes but I don't know how much effort I can give. If she is visibly interested, we'll see.

I've always wanted to be able to date and have a normal ""love life"", but it just seems so unattainable for me, at this point.

I'm at a place in life where it feels like my only shot at dating is via dating apps or whatever, because I quite literally can't figure out how to ""get myself out there"" any other way. In general, I don't like the dating apps, and I'd rather not meet someone that way. But, it feels like that's literally my only chance.

Unfortunately, that seems high impossible, as well. I've been on and off them many times over the last 5-10 years, and I've never gone on a date from them.

Actually, I pretty much never get any matches to begin with. That's kinda bugging me a bit. I know dating apps are a ""numbers game"", and I know they're pretty much based on looks and quick attraction. But even still, I don't get how seemingly nobody will match with me.

Sure, I get it, being that I'm a low key introvert, I don't have pictures that feature me going on amazing adventures, or a bio that makes me sound like a mogul. I'm average in every way, and I get that, but... ""average"" usually still does decently, right?

I definitely don't have movie star good looks, but I don't think I'm bad looking. The pictures I use may not be overly ""exciting"", but I think I look fine.

With my bio, I usually try to just make a silly jokey kind of bio to demonstrate my personality and sense of humor, and hopefully make people smile when they read it.

And I'm generally pretty liberal about who I swipe on.

Yet... I get zero matches. Or, at most, I'll get one match every few months, who doesn't really end up talking to me beyond maybe an initial pleasantry.

I just don't get it. Am I really that bad? Am I really that unappealing, unattractive, uninteresting?

Now all this isn't my issue, but what I did notice is how she kinda brought it out a few times whenever we spoke the first time we went out for a hangout and since, now the thing is, today we met at Uni and the same issue of hers did come out, I was a bit annoyed because i never brought out her past, nor asked personal questions that would make people uncomfortable if you ask me honestly and so i told her:

""Listen, we both might have something for each other and it shows, but, you've gone through shit, and that has led you into not trusting people easily, i get it and fully understand. But honestly i cannot do this, i have tried avoiding that topic whenever we spoke, but it always comes up and you've been restricting me to even understand who you are as a person, i want to know you, idc whether we date or not, but i wanted to know you.

i was hung up over this girl who told me she really liked me but needed space to heal from her relationship. I told her I‚Äôm okay being friends but she said she didn‚Äôt know if she could do that bc she really liked me.

I finally realize she didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings because she said when she dates, she‚Äôs looking for a relationship so I accepted she meant not with me. 

Then I started talking to someone else who I met before I left the city and she ended things with me when I told her I still care about my ex. I asked her to talk to explain myself but she didn‚Äôt want to. I then realize she was projecting because her last ex left her for their ex and it was easier to end things than to risk getting hurt again. 

i really liked her but I‚Äôve come to realize no matter how much you want to make it work, you can only work on yourself. 

i started making plans with my friends and coworkers, got back into drawing and designed my new tattoo, joined the gym and finding a personal trainer to help me with my fitness goals. I‚Äôm also applying to cafe jobs so I can work on my latte art again. I was a mess the past month but I deleted my app, started focusing on myself and I am much more stable than I was before. I‚Äôm seeing a psychiatrist next month to talk about meds because even though I eat healthy and exercise now, I know I‚Äôm still mentally ill and if I don‚Äôt take care of it now, I will make the same mistakes In the past. I want to go back to the time when I was happy on my own before I met my ex because instead of taking time to reflect on myself and my shortcoming, I was trying to find validation from other people and when things go wrong, I blame myself. But we need to understand it‚Äôs really never about you but what the person want or is going through. 

I still get urges everyday to text her but I‚Äôve been mediating in the morning and reading to calm myself. I tell myself I‚Äôll text her in a month if I still feel the same. I have trouble with impulse control due to my possible personality disorder which I will dive into next month.

I‚Äôve actually tried to do a lot of online dating before. I kind of went on a bit of an unhealthy spree which I will admit, but I had come out of a long term relationship and had felt especially empty, with the addition of being really alone from the pandemic and having a ton of stagnancy in my life.

Aside from dating apps and a few unsuccessful dates, I was using r/R4R a lot. A few times I had talked to people on there for a while, almost meeting but never actually doing so. The majority of r4r folks were honestly quite odd too. I definitely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd meet someone off of Reddit but I kept my hopes up for some reason. 

I posted one day and I had pictures on my page and he did too, and he started his message off with calling me the envy of Aphrodite. Super corny, but it did catch my attention. 

He goes to college where I used to live, and I live in the same state he originally lives. We had been talking since January and started dating online in February. Comes spring break, we meet when he visits home and we go on quite a few adventures. All of which where super fun. We also went to a ren festival and I stayed at his family cabin. 

I honestly can‚Äôt really.... express how much we click and how happy we are when we‚Äôre together. I‚Äôve been struggling with insomnia very bad lately, but when I slept in the same bed with him at his cabin I got the best sleep ever. Every morning was full of cuddles and then we would walk around his tall tree filled property with a big pond and go to the festival during the day. 

He gave me a lot of gifts (that I didn‚Äôt request for btw) a necklace, pearl earrings, two of his hoodies and he made me a little leather bracelet with a heart carved into it. I bought him a silver necklace shaped like a heart with a keyhole at the festival. 

However, he goes to a military college. He‚Äôs a midshipman and for the next something years will be on ships for long periods of time. Yesterday, I had to go back home (4 hours away from his) and he‚Äôll be ordered to be on a ship anytime now. 

He wasn‚Äôt normally the type of person to cry very much, it was probably a very long time since he last did, but yesterday I heard him cry softly in the other room because he didn‚Äôt want me to see. I was too. 

We walked around his wooded area one last time and then he dropped me off. We had really big hugs before we left. This morning we mentioned how we both had a slightly hard time sleeping.

I love him, we get along well and I think that we are very compatible long-term. However, Ned has exactly ZERO past dating experience. Because of this, he has issues with emotional intimacy and communication, and it's something that I'm really struggling with. 

For example, he didn't tell any of his friends and family that we were dating because he ""didn't want to get their hopes up after so long."" Any compliment that he gives me is in direct response to one I give him (i.e., I tell him he's cute, he says, ""Not as cute as you!"" and that's it). He ""panics"" every time I tell him that I miss him, that I love him or any time I mention something about our relationship getting serious. For example, I asked a hypothetical question about if we got married in the future, and he started hyperventilating. He also hyperventilated when I told him I loved him for the first time. However, a lot of the time, he will state that things make him ""panic"" but will do so with a smile on his face or with a smile/laugh emoji via text. I know that he does have some genuine issues, but I'm not sure if he's exaggerating to be funny or if he's trying to play off his genuine discomfort when he does this.

Honestly, I know that this issue is above my pay grade. I know that he has a fear of commitment and intimacy that requires professional help. However, I would like to try a few strategies before I throw in the towel. I know that I can't sustain a relationship with someone who is *this* averse to intimacy, however, I think that he is feeling more for me than he's let on. I learned over the weekend that he's now told his entire family about me, including showing them photos and giving them information about me (job, age, etc.) when he was totally against doing that just a couple of months ago. Of course, he didn't tell me when he did that, and apparently he told them quite some time ago, so I've been under the assumption that he kept our relationship a secret for months. He never communicated that he had taken that step, and if he had, then I think it would have alleviated a lot of the doubts I've had for the last few weeks. Just knowing that I was no longer a secret would have been reassuring in its own right. 

I don't want to fall prey to the sunk-cost fallacy, nor do I want to be na√Øve and excuse his behavior as inexperience and allow myself to become resentful and frustrated. However, I have dated quite a bit in my young life (okay, maybe not so young anymore), and I have only felt this strongly about one other person (and I thought that person was my soulmate... I was 19, okay?). 

Those of you who have dealt with emotion and intimacy-averse people, what strategies did you try to help them feel comfortable opening up? I think one of the things I'm going to ask him to do is take the Love Language quiz and share his results with me (and I'll share with him), but other than that, I don't know how to help him communicate. I don't want to resort to ultimatums because they never work. I might be doomed here, but I'd like to give it a fair shot before giving up on the guy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164177,public,self,How to help my SO with emotional communication,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tjjtrb/how_to_help_my_so_with_emotional_communication/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

This all started because of a single girl, and I feel pathetic that one girl who I've never even dated and don't even know too well has caused me to become so depressed. Basically this girl lives on the same corridor as me in uni and \`I started to develop a crush for her back in December and since January she has been on my mind literally constantly. In February we had a huge uni party and \`I got extremely drunk so finally got the confidence to talk with her (we've talked many times before but never full on conversations cuz I'm always too nervous and try to get out of the situation). We hung out for a couple hours of the all night party, but that's the night I learned that she's a flirt with most guys, not just me. Still though, seemed like I had a chance so I stayed with her and then at the end of the night (5am) we went back to the kitchen where my other mate was.

We decided the three of us to go to my room to watch some Rick and Morty, around 7am he got tired and left, I didn't ask her if she was gonna leave as well or anything, \`cuz I wanted to see what she would do. She had a perfect out to leave tho cuz it was 7am after a long party night but she just said she'll go to the toilet and be right back. She then said she could stay until 9am without me asking, so we sat down on the edge of my bed and watched Netflix until then. Towards the end, I put my hand on her inner thigh and she rested her head on my shoulder, I was a bit out of it (I had had maybe 15 drinks that night), and we were laughing most of the time but we didn't click like we were earlier in the night. At 9 she left very abruptly (like she didn't hug me and just sorta got up and left, wishing me a good break) even though we weren't going to see each other for another month because we were going home on break. 

Three weeks have passed and neither of us texted the other, and I know she knows my birthday was a week ago (she put it in Reminders) and I was waiting the whole day but she never texted. I feel like I've become obsessive about this girl, but I just like her so much and think we would be so good for each other. I just hope she doesn't think I'm creepy or a pervert for putting my leg on her inner thigh, even though she seemed into it. Idk, we go back in a couple weeks, I just hope I still have a shot.

It might help to get some more context by looking at my post history, but here we go.

I (M17) have a slight ‚Äúcrush‚Äù (I hate that word) on my friend (F17)

I took her out to golf yesterday, as the guy she likes was there. (No I‚Äôm not trying to get between that, although I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm jealous) 

By the time i had picked her up it was too late, as the guy had left, but we went anyway. My friend was working the driving range so I got a few buckets of balls to hit. While we were there I basically taught her how to swing and all that. We talked about the guy she likes. He‚Äôs a quite person, and is quite good at golf. She had been sending him messages on Snapchat and eventually he started using words in his replies. I know for a fact she likes him, but as he‚Äôs a senior and she is a junior, I wouldn‚Äôt quite work and I have brought this up to her before. I do regret the intent I had with bringing it up as it was purely out of jealousy.

However, she said something that got my attention. I was teaching her how to be a ‚Äúgolf wife‚Äù as if I know what any man who plays golf would want out of a wife, ha. Anyway she was cleaning clubs and she told me that I am ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than this person she likes at some things. I can‚Äôt recall how this got brought up by the way. Anyway she listed off a few things and I said well thank you that means allot. I wish I could remember exactly what she said though. I believe the conversation started when I said ‚Äú(guy she likes) is better than me at golf‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt recall precisely. 

This was all in celebration of her birthday, by the way. So after we went to a friends house and watched a movie. I wouldn‚Äôt say we were cuddling but I held her hand and put my head next to hers. (I know so sweet)

Now here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. Either A, she likes that guy and doesn‚Äôt have any interest in me, just has a physical/flirtatious attitude (which I‚Äôve never noticed before)

Or B, she possibly has a thing for both of us, however her appeal to him being stronger than to that of me. Possibly sensing she wants to find a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù.

Please help me figure out what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôve tried to read her but to no avail.

Some things to note:
Yes, I am jealous of her attraction to him
I am exactly what she described as her (dream husband) (don‚Äôt get me started I just added that in for context calm down mom)
I have been actively flirting with her, on a low down scale though

Roughly 2 months ago, I (26F) met someone (31M) through one of those various dating services that kind of just seem like a tinder spin-off. I basically lived my ""party"" years in my early teens and am a mother of a toddler so I'm not about just going out and partying/hooking up. I'm pretty clear about this in my profile along with a few other things I'll omit for length sake because its a lot to explain. I'm also someone who doesn't even have any sort of intimate interest unless genuine feelings are involved. I just want someone to be happy with, to love and to appreciate me for me. I know I have a big heart with a lot of love to give. My biggest downfall with that is falling fast and hard for someone and it's done nothing but cause me more harm than good.  

In my time on these dating apps and even just people I've met through friends, I've been either ghosted or just flat out ignored after a month to several months of talking. Because of this, for about a month prior to this guy, every one of my ""matches"" were either just me reading their first message and that was it or just very brief exchange of conversation before getting that ""this isnt going anywhere"" feeling. But something about this one felt different. I immediately found him attractive and the things he said he wanted in his bio seemed to line up with mine so the thing happened where we could start to talk to each other. He messaged me pretty quickly about a game I had on my bio that I said I played at some point through the night and I debated briefly on responding and obviously did otherwise I wouldn't be here writing this right now. We ended up meeting up in the game we spoke about, exchanged discord information which led to him giving me his number to text because he doesn't pay attention to discord much. 

I tried to keep my distance, knowing how I am, and not wanting to start to REALLY like him just for him to be like ""No, this isnt for me"" immediately after. After a few weeks of texting back and forth daily, some calls here and there, and some time playing the game more together, I found myself becoming less and less distant and liking him more and more. We arranged a day to see each other and when the time came I did that bad thing you're not supposed to do with internet strangers and drove a dumb amount of distance/time (2 hour drive, maybe a tad longer) to his place and we hung out there. I was super nervous to meet him but also because I was going directly to his place and not being smart and meeting him somewhere public first. But it turned out okay. He was just as wonderful, if not better, in person. We spent most of the time cuddling &amp; watching stuff or just talking. We did end up having sex, which was incredibly shocking for me because I went there with the intention of shutting anything remotely like that down immediately. According to him, it was a bit of a surprise on his end too since he said he doesn't like to have sex right away like that. It led to me staying the night and being a little sad that I had obligations at home and had to leave straight away in the morning. 

Since then, I've been driving over to his place every weekend and staying the night and its been nothing but wonderful. It's honestly the thing I look forward to the most in the week and each time I'm there, I find myself falling for him bit by bit. (I've gone over there a total of like 5 or 6 times now?) We've had a few deep conversations and I REALLY enjoy the person that he's shown me who he is. During the week though, I've got nothing but anxiety that eats at me pretty hard  about him because I have a horrible habit of over analyzing things and jumping to the wrong idea which also just makes me feel horribly conflicted. During the week, some days it feels like I'm really struggling to hold a conversation as his responses will sometimes take quite a few hours and other days its only a few minutes. On the days it takes him a while to respond, it usually feels more like I'm just the only talking as his responses are very short and not much of a response at all. 

I try not to think to much into it and try to assume it's just him being busy because when we call each other, it's nothing but fun and laughs. He's even told me he missed me a few times and when I'm over there, he'll generally hold me very close to his side while we're watching stuff. He also can be very content just laying next to me and just looking at my face, which is something thats very new to me with someone so I end up getting really shy and panicking every time which usually leads to me hiding my face (and sometimes he'll just put his hand on my cheek and make me stop hiding it). When he looks at me, especially in moments like those, his expression is also so soft, warm and to me feels very gentle and loving that it really melts my heart every time. But then my time visiting eventually comes to an end and I'm back to panicking. 

I believe I self inflicted a lot of this anxiety by jumping the gun after my 2nd visit. First, since I thought things were going so well, I tried to add him on facebook. His page was very public at first where anyone could see his posts  but within a few hours later when I wanted to double check I sent it to the right person (I was pretty sure before but living with anxiety still had me wanting to double check) and saw his page had gone super private. I also made the mistake of asking what we were. He told me he wasn't seeing anyone else and to consider it as we were dating. 

I don't know dating works, I've gone from long term relationship to long term relationship since I was 15 going on 16 where due to certain situations, those relationships were kinda forced to kickstart to be something actually serious pretty quick (usually the biggest reason being living situations). It took a google search with a lot of conflicting information to even find out that dating is different from being in a relationship but the last time I was over there, he also indirectly referred to me as his girlfriend which just makes me confused. I haven't been seeing anyone else or even talking to anyone else and shut down all the dating app stuff quite a while ago since I really only just want something with him. 

To circle back to the facebook thing, I sat at requested for about 2-3 weeks before removing my request. Everyone I spoke to about it said that it seemed really weird and that I should ask him about it but I also don't want to feel like social media should feel like it's that important and it would have me also feeling like I'd be making a problem out of what is most likely nothing. Some of my friends keep asking if I spoke to him about it and I just keep telling them, ""It's only been this long. I'm sure he has his reasons, I'm just gonna ignore it for now."" And I have been mostly been able to ignore it until last time I was over there I was going to grab my drink off the dresser in the morning after we woke up, when I saw his phone screen blink on and saw he had like 7 new messages on messenger and for some reason that spiked my anxiety.

First, a bit about myself - 32 years old, male, straight, single. I'm a pretty introverted guy, have some mild depression and anxiety, not super outgoing, and a bit picky when it comes to dating. So even though I think I've got a lot going on for myself - tall, pretty good looking, good sense of humor, surprisingly social in spite of the anxiety/introvertedness - I have not had much luck in my life in terms of dating. In general, I am looking for something long term and to have kids, start a family.

So last week, one of my closest friends since middle school sends me a text that I should ask out his older sister. The week before, he kind of casually mentioned in conversation that he'd be cool with it if I wanted to date her. I know a lot has been said on the topic of ""should I date my best friend's sibling?"" and that's why for most of my life, despite finding her attractive, I never even considered it. She was off limits in my mind, and to be honest I didn't talk to her much so I never even had any real interest in the idea.

The last couple years I've actually gotten to know her a bit better - she and my friend had been spending more time at home and hanging out together since the pandemic started, so I had more opportunities to actually get to know her on level beyond her just being my friend's attractive older sister. And she's actually pretty cool, and we get along pretty well. I still never really thought of dating her though.

And now that my friend has brought this up, my mind has been racing and...I might actually be interested? Lots of confused feelings coming up. As I mentioned, she's attractive and we get along pretty well. She's sweet. She's fun. She's creative. I know she comes from a really good family. I know she has similar values to me - family, political, etc etc. If she was someone I met organically outside of this context, I would 100% want to ask her out.

But I feel like there's a lot at stake here - I don't want to risk losing a close friend. I've known him and his whole family forever. His parents love me. And I know his sister relatively well now too, so his nudging me to ask her out feels like it has a lot more weight to it than if he was suggesting I ask out some random girl he met at a bar that he thought I might like. It just feels like something is up - either my friend really sees something, or his sister is interested and is nudging him to nudge me. I want to talk to my friend about it, but it just feels so awkward and I'm not even sure how to bring it up again.

On top of all of this, there's the age factor. As I said, I'm 32 and looking to start a family, and she's 34. Assuming she's also looking for that, there's suddenly a very real window of opportunity that is closing quickly. I feel really bad even bringing this up, but it's just the truth that if I were to have kids with someone who is already 34, things would have to move very quickly - add that to all of the other pressures and factors mentioned above, and it feels like there's a lot of potential for things to go wrong.

I'm just looking for advice on a relationship that I recently went through.

Met a girl 6 months ago, really connected. We both felt the same way about relationships, didn't want to be in one, didn't like all the drama that came with it.
I had approached her about a relationship the first time, but she said she actually had feelings for another guy. So I didn't press. We still kept talking and then that other guy ended up in a relationship himself. After that she would text me to come over and we started sleeping together. I'm the kind of person that saw this and thought, it's meant to be. We talked and gave it a go. I thought we had common expectations from relationships. 

I'm usually very easy going and was in this relationship. But then a couple of months into the relationship I was starting to feel down for other reasons. I was unemployed, and passed my time drinking. We both did. I wasn't in a good place. Looking back now, I can see that it effected my self confidence and self esteem. I started to doubt the relationship.

Maybe i was wrong to worry, but I would worry that I was just a rebound for the guy she missed out on because one week she didn't want to be in a relationship, then after he was dating she wanted to date me.

If I would bring this up she would argue and get defensive. I started to feel like my feelings weren't being heard. I felt like any time there was an issue we didn't talk about it. 

I had a feeling things were maybe starting to go stale on her end for a while but didn't approach her about it because I didn't want to complicate the relationship.

Last month we were both drinking and got into a big fight. I had made an inappropriate joke, she got offended. The majority of the fight was me trying to defuse the situation (lets talk tomorrow, I can sleep on the couch tonight etc). She said then and there we're done and left.

I felt like crap the next day. I poured my heart out and said sorry, sent them flowers and asked if we can talk about what happened. She said I can't anymore, I've given you enough chances. I don't want to try again, I need a clean break.

I respected that and left her alone. Spend a month getting over it. Worked on myself (finally employed yay!) and tried to move on. 

Cut to last week. I was out and she came up and talked to me. I thought great. So I text her the next day saying, it was nice to see you, if you fancy going for a walk sometime, let me know I would like that.

She replied saying ""yes but I don't want to send mixed messages"". 


I had been beating myself up saying it was my fault because I wasn't in a good place and took it out on her, but part of me thinks it wasn't just me. The way the relationship started, never sat right with me but I would get shot down if I asked about it. I always felt like my concerns didn't matter. That builds up and it did. Part of me thinks it was just a good reason for her to get out. 

What I want to do is go on this walk with her and talk about us again. I want to say that I like her, I liked our relationship, the timing was bad, I wasn't healthy to be around then and not to throw this away because of something we can work through. I know we can't try again now but I would like to in the future.

She goes away for the summer months and I'm busy with my new job, so even if we didn't break up that night, the week after I wouldn't have time and then she would be gone a few months later, it probably wouldn't have worked much longer.

Sorry for the long post, I hope someone can chime in. Should I go on this walk and say this to her? Should I not? I'm probably silly hoping she thinks we might have something down the line right?

Our relationship just consisted of having sex on the weekends and hanging out. But we messaged all the time and he called me pet names. He eventually started getting distant over time, especially when he didn't leave the country when the time came. So I started feeling like something was off so I ended it. I started feeling those anxious attachment tendencies and knew it would be pointless because he really didn't want a relationship.

Unfortunately I just liked him more than he liked me.
Logically I accept these facts. However, I think about him all the time even though I ended it. I had to block him on Instagram because it hurt to see him. It's been months now and I feel less pain over it but I still want him back.

I know it's probably the toxic allure of the emotionally unavailable man reinforcing old abandonment issues and I know it's best I try to heal as much as I can and move on. I also kind of get the science of why I would've been more attached to him. I understand that the toxicity is addicting. I just want to understand why he was the one that made the biggest impact. Especially because our time was so short. And we didn't even have that much to talk about. Maybe it was the sex? I've never been so attracted to someone. Who knows.

Recently I had a conversation with a good friend and we somehow came to the conclusion that I am an invisible women and so I was wondering if there are more women out there who experienced that. 
I am 27 and straight but I have never been in a relationship with a guy or even kissed someone. When I look at my life I realise that there never was a guy who showed any interest in me. When I go out with my friends, they are chatted up regularly but I am completely overlooked. Just last weekend I was out with my friend and a guy started talking to her and his friend simply didn‚Äôt talk to me, he looked past me as if I would not exist, despite me trying to start a conversation (to end the awkward silence). And this is not the first time this has happened. Even on dating apps I send out more messages than I receive. It‚Äôs simply that I somehow can‚Äôt relate to a lot of experiences women seem to make, like being flirted at, or receiving messages on dating apps and even (and I know how horrible that sounds) being harassed by men. And don‚Äôt get me wrong I am happy it does not happen to me and it‚Äôs not some sort of compliment but a very disgusting act, but I wonder why I am seemingly invisible to men as a women. 
It‚Äôs not that I have not tried to date men but all the guys I was trying to date were not at all interested in me. And I know that‚Äôs normal but for me it‚Äôs even impossible to just have sex with someone bc I am just not seen as a potential partner (which is impossible according to the internet). I simply don‚Äôt understand why my experiences are so different from the women around me. I know that it must be something about me and I keep asking my friends if the somehow notice anything about me being different. One friend told me that she also realised that guys never really talk to me but she also can‚Äôt understand why and thinks I am acting like everyone else. 
I am sorry for that long rant but I was just wondering if there is more women out there who feel like being absolutely invisible to men regarding dating?
