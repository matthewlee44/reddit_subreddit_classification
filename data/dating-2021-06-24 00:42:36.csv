0,o6uo56,1624513676,You are too good for me.,"I have been on dating sites for a while now and have met with few women till now. There was no date in which it felt like we lack a connection since everything went really well and both had an understanding that we both like eachother a lot. Days passed by and we are chatting, calling (audio &amp; video) and meeting, getting to know eachother more. Everything seems to be going really good and all of a sudden while chatting, I would receive this text, ""You are too good for me, you will find better girls than me, don't stick with me, go explore."" I can tell the exploration part since I haven't had a girlfriend before because I didn't consider myself matured enough to enter into a relationship or stuff earlier but now I have the confidence and the emotional maturity to do so and then I hear this. It's not that only one date told me so. Every date said something similar to this, I am quite exasperated.

Maybe all of them wanted something casual (didn't seem so though) and they thought that I am into relationship but I already made them clear that I am open to all and if things go good between us then we can have something serious as well. Everyone has a boyfriend/s before meeting me and it felt like they have been betrayed and disgusted by them so much they barely trust and always have second thoughts regarding me like why I am being so nice to them, etc etc which is me just being me. 

I have no idea what to do. It feels like every woman I will meet will say the same as it has happened multiple times in a row now and it really turns me off. Maybe I am a nice guy and nice guy always finish last (found this on web though), could be one possibility.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o6uo56/you_are_too_good_for_me/
1,o6uonr,1624513740,Question about who should pay,"So this is obv a controversial topic, but I have a question about finances. So I’ve been dating my gf (22) I’m 21, officially for almost 2 months, and I’ve been seeing her for almost 4. Aside from 4$ street tacos, she has not paid for anything, or offered to split. At first, it didn’t bother me because she lives almost 30 miles away and would drive to me, so I didn’t mind paying, but now I’m starting to drive to her, and it’s getting a little annoying that everytime I see her, we end up going to a store/food spot, and I end up paying for things that aren’t even mine. Is that just something that happens with girls is they grab things when shopping and ask you to get it for them? Or is it something that I should call her out on? Cause idk if at this point we should be splitting the Bill, I should still be paying for everything, or what’s up. At least for me personally, I would never, and have never asked anyone to get anything for me when I’m out with friends.

Hey all, Imma keep it as short as possible. I'm \[20M\] a college student and just invited a coworker student \[19F\] to a party I'm having in a few days. She agreed to a come to the party. I've had a fat crush on her for a while now and we've had really long conversations (mostly focused on her life) in the past few weeks. We get along really well FYI. She doesn't have a boyfriend but is talking to someone in an unserious fashion and has been surprisingly open to me about her previous/current hookups and relationships. She does a lot of casual hook ups FYI and is open about them.

There won't be many other girls at the party (maybe1-2) and maybe 15-20 people total and I will be the only one she knows. I haven't seriously dated anyone before or got laid so I'm not sure how to make any moves at the party. Or should I even make any? I'll be leaving town in a week from now and so will she so we won't see anyone for couple months.

3,o6upes,1624513831,WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND,"At times, normal conversations with your friends can really turn into a mind blowing one, may it be through chat/ text/ call or when you are with them. You can never deny the fact that at some point, you get to discuss about certain interesting question that's thrown at you, out of nowhere, that you can't let go of not until you're able to reach that feeling of satisfaction when you know you where able to truly express your sentiments about the topic mentioned. 

RELATIONSHIP —  CHEATING, an issue which is never new to us all. Just like I always say, disclaimer, I am no expert when it comes to relationships and what not. Also, points posted might most likely be just a HIT or MISS but what- e- vuuuhhhh! Moving on... 

So, my friend's trivia question was, "" If you broke up with your ex for let's say, a long time ( 3 years for example), then wants to be back with you BUT... there's that big BUT right there..  the reason of the breakup was HE CHEATED ON YOU WITH HIS EX GF AND GOT HER PREGNANT, would you welcome him back or let him go?!""  

Without any second thoughts, I answered, ""NO!"" (All caps for intensity level, lol) Do I have to explain?! Okay, fine.. I'll just emphasize 2 strong points.


First of all,  if a man GENUINELY loves you, never will the word cheating cross his mind cause he is so busy working on your relationship. He's interested in getting to know you each day and he's excited to discover the whole you (vice versa). And although we all have imperfections (in all aspects) and shortcomings, using it as an excuse while being in a relationship is not a valid reason for him to cheat on you. Yes, nobody's perfect and people commit mistakes, but cheating is not just a mistake, it's a choice. Men with STRONG PRINCIPLES in life would never do such thing. They always value the very most precious things they have in life and if your man loves you, then you should be one of those he treasures. If he does otherwise, well, you're the judge to that. 

Second, that the "" I believe that if you broke apart and come back together again, you're meant to be.."" saying, never applies to everything. You have to always consider those red flags that's on your list. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. If you caught him cheating on you once, what makes you think he won't do that again? IT IS ALREADY IN THEIR SYSTEM!  They chose to do it. Before you two met, he already was a cheater. Do you think he never cheated on his ex before you?? The reason why they broke up might be just the same reason why you two broke up. Save yourself!
GIRL,WAKE UP!!!!  Why on earth would you want to be back with someone who already broke your trust and hurt you so much?? Not only will this kind of men destroy your whole being, they will literally make your life miserable. And this is where self-pity, insecurities, and other negativity starts.
KNOW YOUR WORTH! You are a diamond! Not some cheap ass plated jewelry. If he prefers cheap items, then so be it. Remember, ""CHEAP ITEMS ATTRACTS MOST BUYERS"". You are rare, and unique. You deserve to be with a man who has the same strong values and standards as you. 

On a sidenote, please, if you're the type who can't literally just stick to one, might as well be straight forward about it to the other party. So you won't hurt anyone. And so they will be able to finally meet the ones that is for them. I don't know who else is with me on this but just sharing my point of view. That's all. And I, thank you!

6,o6ut0w,1624514287,Advice regarding a shy guy,"So there has been this guy who I thought was really cute for a while, so I built up the courage to DM him on Instagram. He responded very kindly and gave me his Snapchat without me even asking and told me to snap him if I ever wanted to talk. So the next day comes and he snaps me first. The conversation flows pretty well with some but very little flirting. This continued on every day for about 2 weeks, in which he’d almost always snap me first. Eventually I gave him my number telling him he could text me if he wanted, so he did later that night. We talked for alittle and then he stopped responding after a double text and eventually a good night text, which he never responded to. I haven’t texted him since because I didn’t want to be pushy or annoying.

The back story on this guy is that he’s very  nice but super shy and afraid of relationships so I don’t know if that had to do with this? Not to sound conceited but I’m a decently attractive girl so I don’t know if he was intimidated by me if he hasn’t had much attention from girls? Maybe he’s too nervous to initiate the conversation again? I’m just confused because he seemed genuinely interested. 

I’ve thought about texting him and apologizing if I scared him off and explain that he seemed very sweet and I just wanted to get to know him... but I don’t want to seem desperate.

46,o70fqz,1624539785,"Going out with an old family friend for drinks for the first time, is this a date or friendly catch up? (I am M24, she is F24)","Context: We were born 3 days apart and at the time our mothers were put in a ""mothers group"" together with a few other new mums. All the mums became (and remain) good friends and  all the families stayed in touch as we grew up, so we have known each other for our whole lives. Her and I were friendly growing up but due to not seeing each other often (we only see the mothers group families once or twice a year) it was always really awkward with small talk and we never really got to properly know each other.

Fast forward to a month ago, we are 24 and haven't seen each other since who knows when, she likes me on Hinge (dating app) and I wasn't sure if it was a joke so I liked back and we got to talking on and off, the conversation was slightly flirty but also lots of general talk about work/studying. she mentioned that she'd be interested in going out for drinks sometime, and yesterday I asked her to do so out of nowhere, to which she told me she yes and that she is very excited.

Now, I don't know what the intent behind this going out is. If it was drinks was with a complete stranger off of a dating app, I'd have a better idea of what the other person was hoping to get out of it, but because its someone I vaguely know I don't know if this is just a friendly catch up as mates, or if there are more romantic/sexual intentions in play. 

For me, I personally would be interested in pursuing something more if the drinks goes well, but I am worried that I will misread the situation. If I knew whether it was a friendly event or a proper date, I think it would really help me figure out how to be on the night.

I also think its important to note that this is my first date (?) with a girl since my breakup with my ex of 3 years (ended a year ago), so I am very nervous to put myself back out there again.

I know I am overthinking this, but if anyone had any advice I would really appreciate it.

49,o710c2,1624541737,I think I figured out why dating feels EXTRA for a virgin,"23 F. I think I figured why dating feels tricky for me. I'm at an age where most people have already experienced their firsts, so things are maybe a little less magical than they were at 16/17/whatever age you were and been in relationships, so maybe you're a little bitter or broken hearted because you've likely already been in love. But you've done it before. 

And I don't hate my journey because it's made me into me, but what I don't like navigating is it's like, everyone's done the rodeo already and I'm still getting used to the horse. (be kind to my euphemisms). I'm feeling extra because something meant something to me, when I'll probably just be a faded image in their rear view mirror. 

Like, I went on a few dates, found this guy really attractive, liked what I knew about him. And sure, I didn't know a huge amount. Pink flag for next time that they weren't maybe emotionally available. But it felt promising - a lot of a dates I go on, I don't see a romantic connection there. And I felt a bit giddy (honestly, save me) and it felt comfortable, like it could be something, while also trying to not attach because we'd only been on 3 dates. And then he ghosted. And I'd never made out so much with someone, let alone probably been a few dates away from sex for the first time. I should have told him I'd never had sex before, when he invited me back to his, but would have informed him on our next date had there been one.

But I know I come across as cool and fun and like I've dated a lot, but I still have firsts ahead of me. So it's like, these things feel extra because they're new to me. 

So I can know my worth and what I deserve, but getting ghosted when I was feeling fluttery and thinking about finally having sex (yay!) just feels like being jilted by your Year 7 camp boyfriend Richard who ditched you for Shelly-Anne because she has weed and into fingering, if the rumours are true. On paper it sounds basic as fuck, but it didn't feel basic as fuck to me because a small part of me is still in year 7, thinking Richard could have taken me to prom. (Exaggerated, but hope that paints the picture of that fluttery newness I'm trying to explain) 

I'm emotionally mature and wise for my age, but not when it comes to dating. Would have been easier to fumble awkwardly with a hs boyfriend, than be fumbling through firsts on apps.

And sure. Dating can feel extra at any age and everyone has their own hurdles to jump over, and that will probably differ for different ages, but it's especially something when you're still figuring out how all this works. Dating and love and sex, and feeling big feelings when you got your hopes up too soon.

Thanks for letting me vent.

50,o716sa,1624542337,Can I build a relationship on hidden truths?,"
I’m bi (21F). I had a girlfriend for three years when I was 16-19. 

It was a horribly toxic relationship and I don’t talk about it often because of the toxicity but also because I’ve started to go back into the closet these past two years. 

I still am attracted to girls, duh, but I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m likely only going to be dating guys from here on out - because it’s quite tough to be queer in my country anyway. 

I’ve been dating guys and I quite like this one guy, but whenever we talk about our dating and sexual history, I’m not honest about my relationship with her.

I talk about her as if she was a guy and when we talk about my sexual history, I change the details of my stories (they’re true but they’re filtered). 

He is an amazing guy and he is understanding. It has nothing to do with him but it’s more of a fear I have WITHIN myself. 

I can truly see a future with him but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell him what really happened. Is that okay?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o716sa/can_i_build_a_relationship_on_hidden_truths/

I knew this girl, a friend of a friend, who was always pretty nice to me. I didn’t have a prom date this senior year, and she didn’t either, so I asked her. She’s a genuine sweetheart.

It’s just really weird because she was so nice to me in prior years, before and after prom, and then suddenly switched.

She stayed by my side when my aunt passed, and also during my dissertation week. She and I promised to stay together forever and are having fun until the fateful day came. We were sending some dirty memes while we are on call until I said something I shouldn't have said - ""Oh I didn't know you were so dirty"" in  a very sarcastic manner.

Great chemistry, both got each other thoughtful creative presents for each other’s birthday. From the first date she told me off the bat that she’s never been in a “real” relationship and had only seen someone for up to 2 months. And during that situation she was also seeing other people(as was the other person and this was communicated to each other). I knew from the beginning she liked having multiple partners and she has always been 100% up front about what her perspectives on dating are.
I have a different perspective as once I really like someone I only want to be with this person. For these two months it’s been great, we’ve only been seeing each other. However the conversation I always knew was coming happened and she asked about my thoughts about dating other people. I told her I wouldn’t really mind(slight white lie) if she slept with someone but dating someone I wouldn’t be happy with. However, she wants to actually go on dates with people and see them. This hurt a little bit as even though I knew that we’d have this talk eventually, it felt like I wasn’t offering her everything she needed. She said that that wasn’t the case and that different people just have different things to offer. Also, I semi-hoped our situation was going to be different than her open situations in the pasts as she kept telling me how rare for her the relationship her and I have is.
Again, she has never been dishonest at all about what she is into and we get along so well. This isn’t a situation where she is lying and trying to hook up with someone behind my back.

Basically all bullshit with no evidence, I should be excited that someone who's into me will make a longish trip and go way out of her way to meet me and it's taking all the fun out of it.

71,o74fu5,1624552156,How do you balance conflicting advice? In certain situations I have avoided going after women but after years later I regret it because they were obviously showing signs,"For most of my life I follow the doctrine of trying not to make a woman uncomfortable which means there are a lot of places that will be perceived to not ask out a woman

Combine that with the stigma of men having to approach and then doubly combine that with some women being attacked by creepy or rapey men then it's no surprise to so many men have trouble approaching women in real life

We get two very conflicting ideas on what to do. But the common denominator is that it is still on the men approach in women to be approached

Not every girl is mature in how she rejects A man also. A guy could muster up a confidence and ask out a girl he likes but if she embarrasses him publicly then he'll probably not try to do that again.

I find myself kicking myself after years of trying to analyze why I couldn't find a girlfriend. There were so many girls who were throwing interest at me but because I was so scared of getting it wrong or being labeled a creep that I just never went for

I had an Uber driver about a month ago who seemed to be very flirty but because she was the driver and I was a man and we're both in an enclosed space like a car I did not go for it

But obviously judging by her social cues she was into me but it wasn't worth the risk to me at the time

I had a classmate who was super flirty also but I always chopped it up to her just acting girly until I started realizing that she always made it a point to make physical contact with me. Whether it be a pat on the shoulder or on the chest and of course I never went for it

I envy the guys who just go after every woman in any context without fear or shame.those types seem to do better because they don't give a damn about what the girl thinks or his own reputation

76,o74vj0,1624553436,Why is it that non-relationships sometimes hurt more?,"You know, the kind where you’re talking to someone and they know you’re into them. You have deep conversations, open up to each other, flirt, say good morning and good night, basically do relationship things. You think they might be into you too, because why would they even bother taking the extra mile especially when they know you like them? Then it all just comes to a close as soon as it started and the rumination begins. You start to question if you made up everything in your head. They’re ignoring you now, not acknowledging your feelings and pretending you never existed. Was it even real? Was it all just a dream? 

Most of the pain comes from a shattered fantasy, from all that expectation and hope of taking things further. I’ve already gotten that part down, but right now the thing that’s bothering me the most is how tf I fooled myself into thinking we were more. How did I allow myself to be led on? How do I get over the embarrassment of telling him how I felt? Why is it possible to feel so much when he probably felt nothing at all? To worsen the impact, this was a long distance thing. We haven’t even fucking met, yet I invested months of my time and am hurting so much over someone I barely even know.

People do LDRs (he’s currently in one with someone), but compared to actual in-person relationships it’s just not the same. Some even call it being pen pals which is essentially what I did, but it all felt so real. It’s just so hard to move on from a relationship that never existed, because it doesn’t feel like you deserve fo feel hurt. At least when you break up from a real in-person relationship you know every memory you made was true. But this, it’s like falling in love with your imaginary friend and no longer being able to see them as you grow older.

We fell in love over the phone. However, I told him repeatedly how it will not work out between us, and I need time, at least a year before I’m comfortable dating. In June, I came home to be with my family. He lives in a state nearby, an hour plane ride.  He bought me a ticket once without asking. I said I’m not ready. Most recently, he sent me first-class access to Texas to go to six flags, an art museum, stay at a historic hotel, and hang by the pool/lake. I have wanted to go on a roller coaster ride forever. However, he didn’t even ask about my schedule. I said I have my cousin's graduation party. He said he thinks my family will understand if I’m meeting my husband. 

If I decline, I’ll feel bad because he would be wasting money on the tickets for six flags. He said he would not continue to be my friend and would cut me off from all of the apps he had me subscribe to, as well as not finish the book we were reading together, and that he would hate me.

78,o751j9,1624553927,Struggling Not to Overstress or Overthink,"I've been seeing this guy for a couple of weeks now since the end of may, and as much scared as I am since it's been a while since I dated someone new, I ended up having slight feelings for him.

When we initially started texting, we were talking pretty regularly. It wasn't anything too crazy, just casual conversations, but the ball really started to get rolling when we met up in person. I never expected to enjoy someone's company as much as I did since it has been almost 3 years since I went on a date and things went really well. We ended up making out in the first date but didn't hook up till after the second date, and since then things moved a little too quickly.

Now the problem is when after the first 4 times? We met up, he started tapering off a bit. Texts where I used to get instant responses and are not getting any responses and I understand things can get busy but to me it didn't make any sense. When we are together in person, everything is fine and he would be very doting to me. We always have pretty good fun and would do things together but it just irritates me when I can't get a simple reply back with texting. During cases like these he would text me back the around midday the next day, and would apologize stating how busy he was but then the conversation just dies down there.  

Now because this hurts my pride a little bit, my instant reaction is to just ghost/block/avoid him because it hurts a little bit and I avoid situations like these. But after having some conversations with some friends last night, they suggested that I wait it out a bit since the guy promised to come see me next week, and we do end up seeing each other at least once per week, and to ask him what his intentions are. 

I guess my question is, I'm currently trying to be patient, calm down, and not overthink till i see the guy. I know I sound pretty panicky here but im a pretty mellow person on the outside, while panic central on the inside haha....

But yes, my question is:  
a) despite the fact that we've been talking and seeing each other a little over a month, is it too weird or alarming for me to ask a very lowkey casual question as to what his intentions are?

b) if i do ask, are there any suggestions as to how i could go at it? I know its not the ideal question to ask but because im trying to keep my emotional health in check, i figured it was worth asking since at the end of the day i should prioritize myself.

87,o75ljd,1624555514,I (25M) am wondering how to approach a situation with an employee,"This is kinda random but here 

My parents own a store that sells those scratch-and-win kinda instantaneous lottery tickets. We sell them and give away the prizes but then we need to get the already scratched tickets to another store (inside a small shopping center) which sells them to us in bulk so they can give us back the total amount of prize money. Maybe this was confusing, but this isn't the crux of the problem anyway

There's this new cute girl working at that store around my age, maybe younger. I always tried to maintain a formal, professional relationship and never even considered making any kind of move, I always went in, exchanged the tickets back into money, thanked her, went back out. I don't want to risk putting another employee who is being paid to be nice to me in an uncomfortable position.

Today, though, was different. As I was finishing and saying goodbye she went ""Are you leaving already? You have only just arrived"". I just laughed and said something like ""Ahah I appreciate the sentiment but unfortunately I have more stuff to do"". Then as I was signing a paper I have to sign to say I went to pick up the money, she said ""Do you want me to sign your copy too?"", which I'm pretty sure she knows there's no reason whatsoever for her to sign it lol again I simply replied ""No, I don't think that's needed. I mean, sure if you want to go ahead, I'm not stopping you"". She just laughed her ass off at this and I have no idea why, just said something like ""I just love giving autographs"". Under any other circumstance without a employee-customer relationship going on I would have added something like ""And if you want to write your number next to it then I bet it would look even better"" or whatever came to mind but I felt that would be innapropriate. She then started asking me questions about my course and internship (she's on her own internship) even though there were other customers waiting their turn, I just said ""Boy, you really want me to stay don't you?"". She just laughed again and offered me a bench to sit down with her for a while, but at this point I just smiled, said my goodbyes and left (because my dad was waiting outside, otherwise you can bet I was taking the invite at this point)

At some point, though, I made a mistake. I think I dropped a $10 bill somewhere, 99% sure. I remember counting the money in front of her, realizing there was $10 extra, putting it away somewhere, but either because I am sleep deprived right now or out of confusion because there were extra tickets than what had been ordered and I had to withdraw more money, I have no clue where I put that bill. I either left it there or it fell down on my way to the car. I even recounted the money three times and asked her to attend to other customers because I was keeping getting lost.

Still after leaving and guaranteeing the $10 were missing I had to go back and warn her to tell her colleagues about the situation so they would notify us if they found them. This second visit was strange because part of my mind was like ""Ask her out. Ask for her number. Ask her if she wants to grab a coffee with you on her next break. Ask her if the invitation to sit down is still open"" and another part of my mind was ""Shut up. Don't be an asshole who makes her uncomfortable and rushes things. Go inside, tell her what happened, admit some responsability and remove pressure by saying maybe you messed up your math, move a few boxes around to look for the bill, ask her to notify her colleagues and leave. Keep the professionalism""'. The second part won but there were a few moments I awkwardly stopped or fidgeted as I figured what I should do.

After I left I went back to my car. The first part of my brain still won the next battle, it convinced to go back inside without going to her particular store, look to the ground for the money, grab a coffee, and then decide whether I want to go talk with her again or not. So I went in again, passed by her (she was going out on a smoking break), didn't talk to her and went for a coffee instead, and at this point my mind woke back up and screamed ""Alright you're just being annoying and somewhat creepy now, you have absolutely no business still being here and she knows that. If you talk to her again today you'll just ruin your chances and make her uncomfortable any time she sees you from now on. Just leave her alone and talk to her more personally next time you come if you wish to do so"".

And that's what I did. Finished my coffee and left. She was still smoking outside, called me over to ask if I had found anything, I said that I hadn't, reiterated that maybe I had just messed up the math, said I would appreciate it if she notified her colleagues, she told me not to worry and smiled, and I finally left.

Questions: a) Did I mess this up by seeming too pushy or did I save myself in time (at least professionally)? b) Should I ask her some personal questions next time or keep it 100% formal? c) Part of me is worried that I came across as a dummy or clumsy for losing the bill, how true is that?
