I've never experienced this situation before and am trying to make sense of my emotions.

I'm a 27M who experiences anxious preoccupied style of attachment. Had a great relationship in the fall that lasted for 4 months where I genuinely fell in love with a 28F dismissive avoidant attachment style who had a lot of trauma in her past. We had a flourishing relationship for the first 3 months before she said ""a switch flipped"" in her and she started feeling the need to pull away which was about a month after we started saying I love but also right before the holidays. She went back and forth between blaming my anxiety issues and blaming her own personal issues and saying it wasn't about me. Despite the ending I felt secure during the relationship, it was the first thing that made me feel truly safe and okay in NY dating history. When it ended, it was in typical anxious-avoidant fashion, she didn't want to talk it over and only wanted space whereas I wanted too many specifics and to figure out where things went wrong. 

I wanted to stay single for a while after the breakup but 2 months after it ended I had a very extroverted friend nudge me into a new relationship with one of her friends. Me in my insecurity and depressed state thought it would be good to pursue to get past the past. This new woman has had tough things in her past but is generally secure. She's intelligent and fun. A little demanding wanting me to be more ""dominant"" and less reserved but overall pretty accepting. Its only been 2 months and we havent defined things yet but she is pushing me in that direction, telling me she had a dream where I told people she was my girlfriend and even outright asking if I was in love yet. 

Early on it felt great to focus my mind on something new and someone who is genuinely interested in me, but recently I've been thinking back too much about the last relationship and hurting myself with those intrusive thoughts. I find myself missing the person from the last relationship, now 4 months after it ended with 0 contact with the person. As much as I hate to say it, it feels like I am still in love with my ex and I feel like a piece of shit for feeling this way. But I don't feel like I have any control over these emotions. I also feel that in my current state I'm unable to for a deeper emotional connection in this current relationship. 

Have you guys experienced this before? How did you handle the situation? I don't want to be a bad guy by being in this current relationship with the unresolved emotions of the past, but maybe I'll get past it with a little more time? The biggest things in my mind after the last relationship was I don't want to get hurt again and I don't want to be responsible for hurting anyone else - my brain may be subconsciously holding back on forming a more emotional connection in the current relationship with the scars of the last relationship still stinging.

I recently took a new job out of state and just moved here.  I reached out to a former coworker of mine I hadnt talked to in almost a year via email to ask her a question (she brought our department snacks/candy a couple years back from a business trip she took here and I wanted to have those again) and she gave me her number to text her.  Turns out she also just moved to the same state at roughly the same time as me, albeit in a town an hour away.

I used to live in my current city a few years ago so I know it somewhat well while shes never been here.  We texted back and forth for a bit and I offered to show her around town sometime and visit a few brewpubs because she likes going out to drink.  She said yes but only after things open up again which I agreed with.

A few days after this the time it took her to text me back increased until she eventually stopped altogether.  I waited almost 3 weeks to try texting her again and she apologized, saying shes bad at seeing texts  (she said the same when we talked more and sometimes it did take her over a day or two to get back so I didnt think much about it) and she reiterated that she still wants to get a beer together when things feel safe again.  I told her again Im totally ok with waiting and tried changing the subject but got no response.  

Its now been a full week since that last text from her and Im not sure what to do.  Shes admitted to being bad at texting multiple times but at the same time its starting to feel like shes not actually interested.

I broke up with my SO of 7 years in October because we'd basically grown apart and had no attraction left, the ""period of mourning"" didn't last very long at all, and I began dating again mid-January.

Since then, I've gone out with about a girl a week, ten in total. I've got another one to see this weekend, and I say that because *once again* the last date I had led to *nothing* except for the physical. Jack shit.

I go into every date with the mindset of looking for a new girlfriend, because that's what I want. I don't want a ONS, hookup or FWB. I want a partner. But every damn time I put in the effort of getting to know them, of presenting myself, kissing them, sleeping with them, liking them, I've ended up being ghosted almost immediately afterwards. Like why go through the effort of having sex with someone if there's nothing of value for you there? And isn't it your obligation to tell the guy you're dating that you're not looking for anything serious, if that's the case? 

I've seriously begun to feel exhausted; *physically* and emotionally tired of always having to get my hopes up, dream anew, and go back to square one, over and over again. I know there's something wrong with my approach, maybe I'm not interesting enough, maybe our personalities don't match, maybe I should be more physically restrictive. But it's a dance, and if there's flow and feeling you just go with it, and I guess I'm just tired about the stream leading to nothing but a dead end so soon. Having written this, I realize I should just hold back on the sex until I know there's at least some affection behind it. I guess it's just who and what I am.

We first messaged on the app for about a week, then met each other in person. I had really fun time, there wasn't much romantic going on and I wasn't even sure if he saw me as anything else than a potential friend. We messaged every day after that and he asked me out for a second date and I was happy to go. Eventually we ended up to his place (since because of Covid everything is pretty much closed) and watched a movie. At one point we snuggled up a little, which eventually turned into making out. He seems great and attentive and keeps making sure if I'm feeling ok and when we proceeded into kissing, he was asking if it's ok that he does that. I found that to be really nice of him and it makes me feel safe around him. I have experienced violence in my childhood and I know through therapy that I have some trouble recognizing red flags in relationships. But with this guy I felt pretty safe. We also talked about why both of us joined the app and what we are looking for and both of us said that we are not looking for just a hookup.

During the second date, even before we kissed the first time, he said that by the way if I want to stay over, that's a possibility. He asked it again a couple of times during that night and said that it is safe to be there and that anything I don't want to happen won't ever happen. I felt it was nice of him to say that but every time he asked, I said that I think I'm still just gonna go home at the end of the night (we even checked the bus schedule together so I felt it was clear I was being serious). But then when we were making out, he asked again if I was sure I didn't wanna stay over and I again said that I'm gonna go home eventually, but that time he said: ""Nah, I think you actually DO want to stay over.""

I did say again I wanted to go home (and I think he asked it one more time before I left) and when it was my time to leave, he escorted me to the bus stop and asked when we could see each other again.

I did have a good time that night and making out with him was great and I was into that, but at no point did I truly consider staying over (I had stuff to do early next morning and I was on my period). I also felt that it would've been a little too fast, since we only first kissed close to the end of the night. It felt weird that he said that after I had consistently declined. I didn't think much of it at the time (I was kinda drunk), just felt a little embarrassed that maybe I had seemed too into making out with him. But it has bothered me a little bit afterwards and I've been wondering should I be worried that he does not respect my ""no""? I have difficulties trusting people, so I could be overreacting too.

More than 5 months that I haven't seen or talked to her. She was my first GF ever, and I'm 26. She was my first sex and everything.

I always struggled really bad with dating although everyone tells me that I'm handsome and fit. I have an amazing career and traveled the world already, but no one ever gave me a chance. I always keep hearing like I'm too good for the girls I try to talk (this must be some kind of BS but I'm so tired to hear). I'm really really afraid no woman that I find that amazing will bad an eye on me.

Since she was my first GF I tried so hard to show a lot of love and affection. I would cook, cuddle, we had amazingly sex, I always cared for her on the smallest details and she always acted like she was really in love and happy.

She left me after 7months together because her ex that had dumped her wanted to be with her again.... No need to say how destroyed I'm still am with this . I'm doing therapy and having a way healthier lifestyle, but I'm REALLY lonely due to this COVID madness. It's really weighting a lot on me and I'm barely holding on together.

Every girl that I try to talk to online on dating apps, Instagram or friends of friends, even asking them to introduce me or anything like that, they all have their SO, already have a kid or some sort of really heavy baggage that for me it's too much to handle and get interested.

I'm 26 and I always wanted to find a girl that I love with all my heart and I honestly thought I had found on my ex. Hell, she was the only girl to really get interested in me, she knew a lot about my desires, fears, issues and I knew hers, at least I thought I knew.

I'm really sad and seeing my friends marrying or having company in this COVID times, the girls don't bother to know me even just a bit and I know I have a ton to offer. I don't want to be someone's step father because I always dreamed to have my kids and my family. Also would have to deal with the father of the child and would significantly be an issue for traveling and stuff.

I don't want to be alone. But why it has to be so difficult? I'm looking for it and trying to be my best version always and I'm always getting rejected, left or dumped for someone else's... My self esteem now is basically negative and I can't take this anymore... I don't want to be alone, I just wanted to love and I guess it's life's way of telling me I'm worthless no matter how much I try.

Feeling comfortable about the way I look around my woman because she also helped me. Despite me gaining a little weight the complements never stopped. I felt like my woman really loved the way I body looked. 

I thought the body hair was part of it.... so the topic of shaving came up and it made me feel uncomfortable that she said she likes it when men shave there armpits and and also down there bwteen the legs. 

Ummm idk if I'm taking it to far but I said no? Like I don't like shaving.  I be down to keep it  clean for sure, Like I'll trim it and stuff. So then it wasn't enough that I let her know that I did feel uncomfortable and she know be insecure about the way I look. Never had to worry or think about me being too hairy because I thought she liked it and it's part of the package.

So trimming wasn't enough, I guess idk sounded like a good compromise well idk i guess not because I would still trim anyways. Then she starts comparing bringing up other men like her bro does it and how then Gen men shave down there and it's more common. 

So then I said that I'm me and that's just who I am. I'm a Hairy dude, me shaving down there would look weird unless I shave everything off because holey crap my hair does not stop from the top of my chest down to the tops of feet. 

Then that wasn't enough so she goes head and tells that it would look bigger down there if I shave...... Um yuh idk would you dudes feel uncomfortable with that comment? Idk let me know because I did. Kinda hurt my man hood a little?  Just...  f**k me who doesn't have Insecurities these day... 

To be honest I just feel shaving and trimming down there is a personal choice and you gotta love yourself. Find someone that loves you for who you are... I told her that I would love  her still even she just trimmed, shaved or didn't shave at all. 

Ugh should I just shave!?!?! I got such bad shaving  bumps/In-grown hairs? Idk it was bad,  i let her know this too and still she says its something simple and small that she is asking me to do.

For starters, I have mental health issues. As I am growing up, i overthink pretty much everything, and I try my best to make it go away, but I feel like I still just have a lot of healing to do before I get where I need to be. Not saying that my bf doesn’t help with that, I just can’t help but overthink rather than try to enjoy myself with him sometimes and focus on the positives so I don’t think that’s fair. 

I also feel as I was growing up I didn’t have the best representations of love/what it looks like when you are fully committed, so sometimes I think I shy away/try to run away bc he’s showing me healthy love and that kinda scares me. I also got my heartbroken prior to us dating (which I was over) so idk if that plays a part in me just thinking I need to let him go bc he’s too good for me. 

He also has experienced life WAYYYY more than me and has all these stories to tell when I think I’m one of the most boring people ever. That makes me see him as superior. He is so sure of himself, which is something I envy, bc he carries himself so well and I feel like sometimes I project my negative emotions on him when I don’t try to. 

And then the icing on the cake, we started dating when I was a senior, so my parents of course kinda were in the mix with that, but my parents used to b toxic and they prohibited me from doing all the things I wish I could do, so I feel like as our relationship progressed, we just haven’t really been together the way we wish we have, and now we’re in a long distance relationship. 

Bc of all that, that makes me feel like I haven’t got to love him the way I wish bc most of the situations/obstacles we have were bc of me, and he even told me that’s okay bc that’s what he signed up for, but at the same time, I just have a lot of baggage I feel like I need to get rid of in order to “properly” love him and I feel like this version of myself isn’t good enough for him when I feel he deserves someone on the same maturity/mental/life level he is. 

I don’t want to leave him bc i feel like our relationship is just getting started and I truly do love him, but then also I get scared of the future as well bc I don’t trust myself and feel like one of these days I’m just gonna scare him away.

Gonna dive straight in: I grew up without a mother because she was off doing drugs and was left with a father that beat me, abused me, and neglected me. I’m not gonna go into details but my childhood has left me with PTSD from as early as 5 years old. My gf just broke up with me because i was battling suicidal depression. She was a very good girl but I was always pushing her away because I didn’t want her to be very close to me when I decided to kill myself. I finally decided that I want to commit to loving her and overcome my battle with depression but at that point it was already too late.
     I’m generally regarded as a very attractive male. People always say I should be a model and I get complimented on my genetics and appearance fairly often. Not trying to brag but it is an important detail to note because people always assume it’s easy for me to get girls because of the way I look. Now my experience with my ex has left me even more emotionally scarred rather than healed and I’m trying everything I can to shake a deep rooted feeling of being unlovable. The fact is I’m in my early twenties and a feminine touch still feels like a foreign concept to me. Love has always been and only been a source of the biggest pain in my life. At what point do I just cave in and give up on love entirely? Well, unfortunately I have no quit in me which means I have extended my suffering here so I have no choice but to have blind faith that someday I will find love again. My reaction to the pain and heartbreak of my gf leaving me was to cut out all coping behavior like weed and alcohol, start waking up at 4:30 AM and living as healthy as humanly possible, quitting my toxic job, getting into bodybuilding, cooking every meal, and now building a modeling portfolio, starting a side hustle, and going back to college. I don’t know and have never heard of a human enduring the things I have and A) not killing themselves or B) not turning to hard drugs and a corrupt life. I find it that most, if not all females my age want a happy go lucky, open, fun, and stoner type of guy. I myself am more of a quiet, focused and reserved personality because of my experiences so I find It hard to see any female even giving me the time of day because it takes a while for me to gain trust and open up. So, anyone think there is any hope or any suggestions on what to do as far as finding a woman that will accept me for who I am?

I (26/f) have been talking to this guy (30/m) for a little more than 3 months. Due to COVID, we took the physical part of our relationship slowly (we texted for the first month before stepping up to in person and virtual dates). But I honestly never fell for someone like this; we agree on all of the important things, but we have enough differences where we can constantly teach each other things and keep things interesting. We both commented on how unique and amazing our connection is, and when I last saw him a few weeks ago, he even mentioned that he hoped I'd eventually come down to his parents' beach house with him, and in my head I planned on asking him to be official the next time I saw him.

He suffers from anxiety, which he didn't hide from me, but I definitely didn't know the extent of it. After I left his place the last time, his anxiety got triggered (not by me, he was feeling ill and that added to his anxiety around COVID) and it mentally paralyzed him, to the point where he didn't text me or anyone else for a week. He finally reached back out and explained what had happened, and I tried to be very calm and understanding (thanking him for trusting me enough to tell me, apologizing that he was going through that and assuring him that I was still in this with him). He texted me again the next day (which also happened to be my birthday, so I'm glad he made sure to reach out), but now it's been a week since then and once again I have not heard a peep from him.

I recognize that our relationship is very new, and not even officially a relationship yet, but we grew very close and were building something that felt really special to us both. I don't want to overwhelm him (I've only sent 4 texts over the week just reminding him I'm here for him and asking for him to reach out how he's able to--I've offered to call or meet up in person if texting felt too difficult--just because I care, am worried about him, and just want to know how he is). The last text I sent was 2 days ago. I don't know how to move forward from here--I don't want to give up on him because his anxiety isn't a deal-breaker to me. I have friends that struggle with it and I have mild-to-medium social anxiety myself, and I want to work through this with him and figure out how to be a support system for him or at least be someone he doesn't feel the need to run from. But I also recognize that he now might not be ready for the type of relationship we were building and/or he might feel really mortified that I had to see him at his worst this early on. It's also really frustrating because part of the reason I fell for him was he is an open, honest, and thorough communicator normally, and so it feels shitty to be essentially ghosted and not have a clue about what's going on. I would accept if he needs space right now, but I hate that I'm not hearing that from him, and it's hurting my feelings having this happen twice after going 3 months with no hiccups at all.

This woman and I were talking for nearly a month, consistent facetiming etc. We occasionally would talk about scenarios to embarrass each other, prank each other in public and what not. Everything seemed well and we went on a date, made out a few times and later that day I texted her about how amazing it was and vice versa. 

Now the day after the date is April fools. We text on IG and iMessage and both convos are well and I ended the convo along the lines of “I’m gonna prank you good” to which she says “I’m not gonna fall for it cause you told me now 😭”. I take a nap and wake up to being soft blocked on instagram, and no reply on iMessage.

I figure this is the April fools prank and I tell myself I won’t fold and give in on her prank. Later towards midnight I text like hey haha nice prank now wya you WON clearly. No reply.

I ft’d her twice that same night because we were supposed to watch a movie on netflix party, calls go through, not declined. 

I text her throughout the next two days like oh I’d appreciate if you said something this is a bit confusing.

In actuality it is, we had a GREAT date and even talked about going on future ones and then the day after we text fine and she vanishes randomly on April fools? 

I could understand if ghosting builds up, she texts dead for a few days, then vanished, but in the middle of a funny conversation? 

I even messaged on IG just to see if she’d read and she read the message no reply, i’m not soft blocked on other socials nor is my number blocked, however she isn’t replying. I obviously stopped hitting up so I don’t seem insane. I did say just be transparent and let me know cause it’d go a long way for me 

What on gods green earth could be happening fellow people? You would think a simple “I’m not interested anymore” or even a quick text to say something would be fine, but it’s so bizarre what’s going on and the lack of communication

I matched with this guy who is a couple of years older than me (late 20s), great career, well educated (basically amazing on paper). I gather that he has a very busy job (so do I) so we never got around to texting much. He would typically respond after a day/2 days. 

I met up with him in person recently and though there was not any instant spark, I had a fairly decent time. He seemed respectful and curious so I liked that. I was a little reserved on the date because I usually open up too fast too soon so I kind of wanted to keep things a little mysterious (don't roast me on this one lol). The thing is, our date was only about 2 hrs long, he said that he had to leave so I thought maybe he isn't interested. Then towards the end he said he'd like to grab a bite sometime soon and I was like yeah sure once lockdown eases blah blah. Then next day he texts me saying it was great meeting up etc and would like to meet up again. I responded and I know that the ball is in my court so should make up plans lol.

I (17F) am so bored and don’t really go anywhere or meet anyone in this annoying pandemic. So when I actually did go somewhere, someone approached me. We started communicating and he I asked him how old he was and he said 28 and I lied and said I was 18. The fact that he was ok with that was unsettling. He then told me he worked at Walmart. I wanted to stop talking to him but I feel bad when I do that and I don’t know why and so I became even more bored. So i kept taking forever to text back and then finally stopped so he could take a hint but he texted again. Then he finally said he was uninterested. Did he reject me? How do I reject someone.

I have seen a lot of low effort profiles or ones where it’s clear the individual might struggle a bit finding the right words for their bio. That’s totally fine, I’ve been through that and understand.

Dating apps actually worked quite well for me, and I would be happy to help offer some personalized advice. If you’d like, you can DM me and I will help you improve your profile, give you constructive criticism on techniques you’ve got, and point out anything I notice where you are particularly strong. I have discord and would be happy to help you out from a female perspective. I also can get a male perspective on any questions you may have an help you out there as well! 

If you don’t want personalized advice, here are a couple general tips!

1. Have a variety of pictures (not just selfies)
2. Open with a fun line or comment, not just “hi”
3. Have an open mind, you might match with someone you wouldn’t normally go for and click well
4. Avoid generalizing in your bio (avoid statements such as “since all women like...”)

I would feel trapped here. I think I am a bit more of a risk taker than he is and I want to move out of this town as soon as covid is better/I can move it a less expensive city on my own. 

This is where I need the ""am I crazy input?"": there is this other guy (22m) that I knew in middle school (I know ancient history) that I came across on instagram and it turns out we went to the same college/basically the same program/have mutual friends. He would remember me if I reached out to him and asked how he is doing. He's honestly he's one of the cutest boys I've ever seen. He's always been in the back of my head as an option and I feel like I should just shoot my shot, worst case scenario he says no and I can just move on and live my life.

My boyfriend(40m) and I(28f) have been together for 3.5ish years. We’ve traveled a lot, spent a lot of time with each other’s families, and obviously have survived a pandemic. He moved in with me (I own my home) in October of 2019. He has never lived with an SO before me. 

We both have really good jobs. He comes from a really good family while my family and my past are very complicated. Neither of us have been engaged or married before and this is now both of our longest relationship. I had a dog before, and we got a puppy together last January. This last year has not been easy, but we have survived. Now, I have cPTSD, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have been in therapy for ~5 years. I am also on the correct medications, and they fluctuate depending on the season and my workload. 

With all of that being said, we’ve talked about a lot of things regarding the future. However, he has said that he is nowhere near ready for us to take the next step because I still have full blown toxic meltdowns every other month or so. I am fully aware of what happens, but once my body goes into full flight/freeze mode during a disagreement, I turn into a completely different person. I HATE it. The only way to avoid it is to recognize it before it happens, which takes practice.. and when you’re doing everything that you can to communicate effectively so as to avoid any sort of argument involving raised voices (one of my triggers due to domestic abuse) you don’t get very many opportunities to practice. When it does happen, I spend the next 2 days in a deep depression because it makes me feel like I’m not getting any better and like it’ll never go away and there isn’t anything that he can do to help, plus it’s not his job to manage my emotions. It’s a hard 3 day experience for both of us. 

He has known about my struggles with mental health since very early on, but it still seems to be the one thing holding him back from wanting to take the next step. It’s so hard to feel like I have to force myself through becoming healthier if I want him to ask me to marry him. I hate to sound harsh, but he’s not getting any younger. It really bothers me that he doesn’t seem to be any closer to taking the next step despite the obvious progress I have made over the time that we have been together. 

I can’t help but feel like I’m never going to be good enough, and that really isn’t great for my mental health. I’m currently planning a significant career change, so I really need to know where this is going, but all he can say is basically “not yet”.

We’re not official. Working our way up to a relationship or so I thought.

We’ve already had sex multiple times and it’s honestly the best I’ve ever had. Can’t speak for her even though she’s said the same.

Had a gut feeling she was talking to other guys. She’s single. Beautiful. Yes, has two kids but they don’t live with her (it’s a complicated situation- not anything she’s done wrong). But told me that she’s not interested in pursuing anything further with me if I’m talking to anyone else. This is after about a couple of months of us seeing each other. Whatever. I respect that.

Fast forward to a few weeks later. I’m still having this gut feeling. She’s older by a few years. Figure it’s just a thing that she barely texts me during the day. Stuff like that. 


Tonight, Her mom FaceTimes her while we’re sitting in bed together. She never lets her know when I’m around unless she asks. Then Mom let’s it slip, “So, still talking to your ‘men’?” 

“I’m with (my name) right now.” She says.

“Oh,” her Mom answers, “I meant (my name). By men, I meant him and Jinx (her cat)”.

Not only did I get confirmation that she’s talking to other men inadvertently through her mother, but her own mom is in on it.

Here’s my issue. I don’t care if she was talking to or sleeping with other men. But just be honest about it! Don’t tell me to be exclusive otherwise we can’t grow and you’re fucking around. That’s what really bothers me. The sex is good. I just hate being lied to. 

Now, I’m just sitting here on her bed after that whole encounter went down. She fell asleep. Didn’t say shit about it. What would you do? Would you just forget about it and stay?

So there’s a girl (I’ll call her Meg) that I met over a year ago, and we became friends. Meg invited me her church many times, and I eventually started going. Before I started going, I asked her out and she said she wasn’t looking to date at the time. I started going to her church anyway cause I like it, but then Covid happened and it closed for most of last year. Last Spring I asked Meg out again (stupid, I know.... long story) and she said she sees me as a friend. 

Church opened back up last fall and I started going again. Around the same time I met another girl, who’s now my girlfriend. Only our close friends know that we’re together since we don’t post each other and stuff. Anyway, I occasionally see Meg at church, and we usually talk for a minute, usually just checking in with each other. This past Easter Sunday we saw each other and she asked if I went to the Good Friday service that we had. I said no and she was like “You should have went! You should go to our events and stuff like that”. Then she asked if I’d be interested in serving on the youth team and becoming one of the “youth leaders” because they need more people. She said that I’d be a good team leader and we talked about it and she invited me to their youth service this Wednesday. She said that she’d text me the details if I’m available.

I know that she’s not inviting me just because they need people, because she’s not the type to be around people that she doesn’t like just because they need more people on the team. Here’s the thing, I’m hoping that she’s just being friendly, since I now have a GF. How should I proceed so that she doesn’t get the idea that I’m interested? Or to stop her from being interested in the off chance that she likes me now? I feel like I’m overthinking things, but I wanna make sure nothing happens. I talked to my GF and she doesn’t mind me being around her, but she wants me to mention that I have a GF now. How do I do that without it being awkward or random?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my character usually involves trolling the forum and making jokes/being a clown for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she was dating someone at the time when we met, who was also on the forum. Everyone on the server who was her friend who make a joke of changing their username to be one of her body part (for sake of example, let's say her name was X, so ppl would make their usernames/display names as ""X's arm"" or ""X's teeth"" or ""X's liver"", etc.). Now, me being the clown I am and wanting to reach, I changed mine to ""X's lover"". Clearly, this didn't sit well with neither X or other members of the managing team, and after some time, I ended up changing the username when one of the members of the team told me that it was pretty much harassment at that point and it was making X uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time later, she ended up breaking up with the guy. Flash forward to two months after, when the semester is restarting, I start talking to X, develop a romantic interest in her, and start hitting things off. We are vibing well and essentially ""dating"" from the second week onward considering how close we were getting, but was not officially boyfriend/girlfriend yet. In this timeframe, I joked about how I would change back the username to ""X's lover"", and she mentioned that she doesn't mind it anymore because while her ex might be in the server, she did not care and that she was her own woman.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed this sounded odd, so I said I might change it in the future at a random time, but internally this was sounding like a bad idea bc I wanted it to be serious if I were to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

We officially started a relationship a month after we started talking. However, in the time between mentioning bringing back the username and after dating her, a few red flags started popping up:

* She seemed to be avoiding in public on the server. She would only be telling me to tune into her gaming streams on the server when no one else was on. But in other scenarios when other people would be on and I would try to interact with her, she would avoid me and offer really brief responses that wouldn't be more than an emoji (and most times, it wasn't even a response, it would just be a emoji reaction to my original message)
* She didn't tell any of her friends on the managing team that she was in a relationship with me and would tell me how that's a ""good thing""
* She set a reminder for me to get to class on the server, but quickly deleted it after it did its job. I suspect this was so no one else finds out she's interacting with me. Contrast this with another reminder she set for someone else, but that reminder is still there to be seen in the server, so clearly, the indication I'm getting is that she's avoiding interaction

&amp;#x200B;

While these were signs, I figured it was overthinking and assured myself that she was not the type to do something like this/had that shitty of a character. It was not until a few days after we started dating, that it really came crashing down. Her friend on the managing team who messaged me months prior to change the username, I kinda thought it'd be funny to message him and do like an inside joke where I'd say ""yeah, I'm keeping the username actually"", watch him get mad, only to find out I was actually dating her this time, and laugh it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, when I told him to ask her if she was fine with it, she told the managing team that I was just joking with the username and that I don't really mean the username. She also privately told me to keep a distance from her on the server, not make any advances in the server, and to basically act like we are complete strangers on the server. She also mentioned that any talk of relationships would basically be engraved in stone on the server, so she doesn't want that to happen. What really hit the nail on the coffin was when I asked why she doesn't just say we're dating - ""because they don't have the best perception of you.""

&amp;#x200B;

All of this cut very deep. I am not one to feel emotions strongly for the most part, I rarely cry, maybe once every few years. But this hit me like a train - I can still feel sharp pangs of pain radiating across my chest as I can feel myself lose oxygen and slowly slump back in disgust and anger and sadness and shame. I still wonder to myself what I could have possibly done that was so wrong to be abandoned like this?

&amp;#x200B;

She mentioned it was a conflict of interest since she was part of the managing team and her circumventing the rules for me would be abuse of power, but she could have very easily said something along the lines of ""we are dating, that is why I don't mind the username, so that can stay; but, if he is doing anything else against the rules or being disrespectful, feel free to ban/kick him out, and I will not interfere."" That wouldn't be abuse of power, and it'd good judgment on her part. AND I AM PERFECTLY FINE WITH BEING KICKED OUT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BTW. It just hurts to know your gf doesn't feel comfortable admitting to others that she's dating you. And it's not like she's shy either, literally anyone else on the server she says hi, talks very well, and send a ton of emojis and is very enthusiastic. But whenever I try to interact with her

&amp;#x200B;

After all that happened, that same day, we kinda worked it out, and she mentioned that she was not ashamed, has my back, and will not shy away from it. She mentioned that she didn't know I was fine with being this open of my relationship with her, and that she will be more open about it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I trusted her, and everything was going along smoothly. She was mentioning that she's in a relationship on the server and to her friends, but a few days ago, she pulled an april fools romantically cute love letter prank on me, and posted ab her bf (me) having a fun time with it. I responded to the message, only to be not met with any response or acknowledgment or even an emoji reaction (even though she sent me a message ab posting it on the server). What really struck me as odd was that her same friends who she said she was telling them we were in a relationship, responded to my comment with surprised emojis in shock that I commented that. Soooo, I have no idea what she's been telling them or if anything she's been saying this entire time has been true.

&amp;#x200B;

She has not contributed to one good night of sleep for me since we have started dating. Either I have headed to sleep crying and depressed, or headed to sleep mildly feeling nothing. I give her tears of joy every day from being genuinely interested in her and in love with her, but I am starting to match her tears of joy with my tears of sorrow on a daily basis at this point.

I don't love her 100% anymore, and I sure as hell don't trust her words 100% anymore.

TL:DR; met current gf (assume name is ""X"") on an online communication system (Discord/Slack/etc.) and changed the username to ""X's lover"" as a joke after other people had theirs as ""X's liver"" or ""X's teeth""; she is on the managing team of the server, so one of the other members tells me I'm harassing her w/ the username (her bf at the time might see it and not take kindly to it) so has me change it; she breaks up a bit afterward, and two months later, we're talking and vibing well; we hit it off and enter a relationship (the irony hahaha); she shows several signs of avoidance in public on the server by not interacting with me or telling any of her friends on the managing team that she's dating me or only talking to me when no one else was around or in her dms; I assume I'm overthinking and trust her character isn't like this until I message the original managing team member who told me to change the username to tell him I changed it back (as a joke bc it'd be funny when he realizes we're actually dating this time haha); she tells the team that I'm just joking and tells me to keep a distance and pretend we don't know each other in public on the server; I tell her how this makes me feel and she realizes it was bad and promises to be open and not hide it; she tells me she tells her friends ab the relationship and stuff and even posts something in the server referencing her bf (w/o a specific mention to anyone) and when I responded to the comment, her friends she said she was being open with shot me a confused look so I have no idea what to make of this or to trust her anymore; I am not one to feel emotions deeply, but this feeling of dread and sorrow arising from the situation is still stabbing me in the chest and sucking the life out of me, I don't know if I can continue doing this for much longer.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,699354,public,self,"(18F) GF Might Be Embarrassed to be Seen With Me/Interact With Me (20M) In Public, Share You Thoughts Please?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ml0419/18f_gf_might_be_embarrassed_to_be_seen_with/,all_ads,6,,,

And I know... rip the bandaid off, just do it and get it over with, etc. I understand that all of that is excellent advice. Unfortunately it’s just not something I’m gonna be able to do right now. My anxiety is just too much and I would rather just continue enjoying being around her as I am doing currently but still seeing how things go. 

So I was wondering if anyone had tips on maybe little ways to communicate interest on my part and then see how she reacts to it. Just like picking up on signals, I feel like I’m horrible at flirting as well. What are some little things that guys can do that indicate interest? This is a super basic question, I know.

Background: We met on a dating app and he asked for my number. From there, we would FaceTime once and text often, basically daily, until I just decided not to text back one day. (After a month or so I was bored of our conversations and overall stagnation in the relationship.)

We follow each other on Instagram so this opened the door for causal interaction in the form of responding to or liking each other’s posts. One day (FINALLY) he direct messaged me and said “Why haven’t I taken you on a date yet?”... To which I responded that he was playing games, dragging his feet, etc. He quickly texted me and made plans for the first date. 

...and that first date went well! Or so I thought. Since I started talking to him, I got the idea that he was a nice guy, ambitious, family-oriented, likes to have fun...all that good stuff. He admitted that he isn’t shy but is generally a reserved guy. I wasn’t physically attracted to him at first but that changed after meeting in person. We spent about 3 hours together chatting and catching up. During which he mentioned another place “we should try” so I got the idea we’d see eachother again soon.

Well...the week following the first date we texted throughout until that Friday night he just didn’t respond. I haven’t heard from him in over a week however, his birthday just passed and I decided to send a text. He responded thank you with a smiley face emoji. I didn’t expect to be invited to his plans considering we just met in person, but I would’ve liked to hear about them or how we was doing. I’m trying not to be down about this but I can’t help but focus on how much I like him and want to continue getting to know him. Why would he say he had really great time and was happy to see me if he had no intention of furthering a relationship? That leads me to my next question: Should I reach out? I’m not afraid of doing a little pursuing or following up.
