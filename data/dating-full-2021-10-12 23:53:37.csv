Throughout adolescence and early adulthood, I basically gathered that the main answer I could conclude is ‚Äúbecause that doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù. So I understand why on some level that direct honest expression isn‚Äôt ideal. 

But now that I‚Äôm older, I still don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm supposed to do. Flirting the way that apparently works seems to be based on dishonesty, deception, and manipulation. It just seems like I kind of have to treat the person like they‚Äôre stupid, as if they don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing or something like that. 

My confusion lies here. If it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù and they aren‚Äôt supposed to know necessarily, then why do it in the first place? And if they are supposed to know, then that means we‚Äôre both aware and the more reasonable, ethical thing to do is just treat them like an adult and talk to them about it. 

I don‚Äôt do that cuz like I said it doesn‚Äôt work. But I‚Äôm just confused on how the whole thing is supposed to work. How can I convey interest in a way that is likely to be received with reciprocation from them if they‚Äôre also interested? What does interest even look like? 

Every time I feel like someone likes me, I do those subtle things everyone says. Make more eye contact. Put myself closer to them. Engage them and share humor / experiences. But it always ends up with them pulling away so I usually just let it go and pull away myself. Cuz if they don‚Äôt want it then I‚Äôm not gonna keep trying obviously. 

So either literally no one is interested in me, which I know is unlikely (I‚Äôm tall, fit, hygienic, stylish, intelligent, interesting, etc.). Or I‚Äôm just really misunderstanding the whole entire process. I‚Äôm past the age where it‚Äôs acceptable to be clumsy in the early stages and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I also have no idea how to go from talking to touching.

He mentioned something sexual about something we talked about and I said ""when can I come over?"" jokingly... and he said his parents are in two so it would be awkward and then I said ""maybe another time if you want"" and he said ""maybe"" then he said ""I heard when you said you felt like you didn't show up"" and I apologized again and told him how I was feeling very anxious on our date and he said ""No worries"" but we have not talked in days again.

A couple of things to add that make me kinda nervous about it though: 

1. He lives 6 miles away and I don‚Äôt have a car (we live in a big college city so I can usually just walk to the places I need to be) he does have a car but if this relationship is to work out, I won‚Äôt be able to just go walk over and see him, he would have to come pick me up or I would need to take the bus and I don‚Äôt love that.

2. He works all the time, which is probably part of the reason why he hasn‚Äôt asked me out yet and that‚Äôs totally understandable, but if I‚Äôm going to date someone, I‚Äôd like to be able to see them fairly often.

I know I‚Äôm probably overthinking all of this since we haven‚Äôt even been on a date yet, but I tend to be an overthinker. Should I go ahead and ask him or should I wait for him to ask me?

Would love some advice on what to say. Matched with this girl on Hinge, definitely had some fun flirty back and forth so I got her number. I suggested drinks she said she was up for it for last friday. Last friday came and she said she was super sorry but had to reschedule for next week. She texted me on Sunday saying she was looking forward to it but wanted to see if we could do a FaceTime before then. I said I'd be up for it and we made plans for tonight. Tonight she missed the date and texted an hour later saying ""Sorry I have to run to Orange County unexpectedly. I feel like such a terrible person""

First of all, I appreciate anyone taking their time to read this and giving me their opinions. I met this girl about a month ago at a friend's small party and we hit it off very well. She's a good friend of my best friend's girlfriend and they take notice that I'm interested in her and my best friend starts wingmaning me. We plan a day together as a small group and we have a lot of fun. I find out more about her and turns out we have quite a bit in common. There's even a moment where she tells me she is looking for a boyfriend and asks me what I'm looking for romance wise. Anyways at the end of the day, I drive her home and ask her out. She says yes and I'm on cloud nine.

The next day she texts me out of the blue and asks to see the sunset with me. We do that but I noticed while we were driving she starts talking about dating apps and how she's been talking to some guys. Now I'm not upset that she's on these apps, her and I just met and nothing is official between us. She's a very beautiful and sweet girl so I'm not surprised she's popular but I just find it odd that she brought that up while we were on a date. Well I brush it off and after the sunset we have dinner. While waiting for our table she asked ""why did you ask me to hang out just the two of us?"" Now when I asked her out I didn't say hang out, I said go out but she didn't know there was a difference. English isn't her first language so I think this is an honest mistake. Of course I'm a bit deflated but after explaining the difference we have a bit of a laugh and we sit and have dinner. Dinner goes very well, she is still laughing at all my jokes and we start having deeper conversations about life, romance, ex's etc. She even starts to compliment my looks and starts saying how much she loves spending time with me. She asks about what my type is and I mention that I like a girl who can make me laugh. Later in the night she made a joke and I legit laugh and she says ""oh I made you laugh, that's good."" I noticed after the whole date confusion she completely stopped talking about online dating and any other guy. After dinner we drive around for a bit talking, listening to music and even though things never got romantic I feel like there's a connection there. She even starts talking about other things for us to do together. But of course I don't know if she means as a friends or more. She then asks if my best friend and his gf know that I asked her out and that she said yes. I told her yeah but I'll clear things up. I drop her off, get a big hug and she tells me to text her when I get home

Anyways we lightly text each other for about a week when our friend group plans another day of stuff for all of us to do together. We're both invited and I offer to pick her up. She says that would be amazing and that she misses me. I'm feeling pretty good about that but am keeping my feelings in check. Anyways that day rolls around and we have a great day together as a group. When her and I are alone she starts planning things to do together just the two of us. There's even a moment where she lets out a sigh and says ""seems like everyone is dating someone"" and as I'm driving her home she asks if I cleared up the whole date thing with my best friend and his gf. I told her that was all cleared up and she goes ""well we can go on a second date"" and I'm a bit surprised that she says this. I respond by saying ""oh really?"" in an surprised but optimistic tone. She back peddles and then goes ""or just hang out."" At this point I decided that I was gonna make a second move just so she knows where I stand. I didn't want her to think I've lost interest, plus in my mind she's giving me hints that she would like to pursue something here. Well when I dropped her off I told her how sweet and funny she is and how much I enjoy spending time with her. She echoes all this stuff to me and says she has just as much fun with just me and her as she does when the whole group is together. I ask her out and she's quiet for a few seconds. She says she really like to get to know the person first before dating them and that she's not ready for that yet. She still wants us to spend time together but just as friends for now. Of course I said okay because now we share some mutual friends and I don't wanna throw a monkey wrench into our social group.

I don't mind taking things slow with her. The last few relationships she has had were short term and one guy even cheated on her. So I don't blame her in wanting to take things slow just to make sure it's going to work out with the person before heading into dating them. Well a couple days after that. My best friend gave me the word that she's been seeing this guy and she really likes him a lot. I'm not mad of course just disappointed that it wasn't me but also a bit confused as to why she would even bring up the whole second date thing when she has this other thing going on. I don't know how long they've known each other or if it's official. But now I sorta get the feeling like I'm the backup guy, even after I made a move twice lol. I don't really see a scenario where he turns her down since she really is the most beautiful woman I've ever met and she's super sweet.

I know this was a long ass story and I thank you if you've made it this far haha. I'm not gonna try to win her over or anything like that because it's probably not possible but does anyone have any indication on what was going on with all those comments about second date and planning stuff to do with me, just to get shot down?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1062666,public,self,Accidently becoming the backup guy?

However, I feel it's going downhill.  I'm horrible at flirting, banter, sexual innuendos etc...  I asked people about these things who are married and they said they never did any of those, they just were being themselves and acted normal.  Well, that's the way I acted, as if I was with a coworker/friend and just trying to enjoy the moment.  I don't crack jokes, but I do tend to use physical touching like shoulder touch and smile.  I do hug to greet and say goodbye.  But that's it, nothing else.  All three dates consisted of playing gaming activities (arcades, mini-golf, bowling)...

When we first had our first date 3 weeks ago, we had a fun time that lasted about an hour doing a gaming activity.  When we ended the night, I went for a kiss, but got the cheek instead.  However, when the date ended, a few hours later she had requested for another date asap.

So on our second date, it lasted about two-three hours, shared an alcoholic drink together, but she ended the night by saying that she was tired and wanted to go home (looked kinda annoyed)... and I told her ok, that's fine and walked her to her car and hugged her goodbye.

After two weeks had gone by we had scheduled for a third date to play another game and planned to grab drinks afterward, which she sent a kissy emoji face.  However, after we finished playing our game, I asked let's go grab those drinks, but she used the same cue that she was tired and wanted to go home... I was confused and asked her if anything was wrong, but she was just tired...  Keep in mind, she had texted that she would be free the entire night (she works night shift).

I texted her I had a fun time and wanted to see her again, but I haven't gotten a text back yet.  She normally takes a while responding.  She is a nerdy, introvert-style girl who I truly don't see dating a lot of people.

I‚Äôm a 21yo guy, and a few months ago I met a girl (19f) and we hit it off. She actually confessed first to me that she liked me, and we later started dating. We‚Äôve been on about 6 dates, and she‚Äôs said that she really likes me. 

Here‚Äôs the problem. She‚Äôs really busy with school. She‚Äôs a film major so her weekly schedule can be unpredictable sometimes. She mentioned this before we started dating so it‚Äôs nothing new. She sometimes takes hours to respond to messages and she sometimes has to reschedule our plans. The last couple weeks have been the toughest. She had to cancel a date because of school, then we both went on separate out of town trips. I will say that on the trip I sent her a meme and said I missed her and hope it went well, and she said she missed me too.

Yesterday I asked if she‚Äôd be available this week, but she said she has a video to shoot that‚Äôs due next week so she‚Äôd get back to me. I told her to let me know if she got free, and then she ‚Äúloved‚Äù the message.

Obviously it sounds like she‚Äôs just busy, but I‚Äôm kinda nervous she‚Äôll eventually lose interest. I‚Äôve had girls say they‚Äôre busy, and then never respond again. I would occasionally text her, but she‚Äôll probably take forever to respond. Mainly because she‚Äôs busy, but I‚Äôve also noticed that whenever we‚Äôre together she isn‚Äôt on her phone, so I don‚Äôt expect her to check it that often.

We were talking everyday for about a month before he asked me to hang out and we did and it was great and we got along really well and saw each other almost every week after that. He was very shy at the beginning didn‚Äôt even kiss me until the 5th time we hung out or something, generally a very respectful guy. Things were going good for a few months still talking everyday seeing each other constantly, going out to dinner, having slumber parties and stuff like that. 

I finally decided to work up the courage after dinner one day at the end of July to tell him that i really like him and that i know where i want this to go and wanted to see if he was on the same page. He told me he really likes me too and needs a little bit more time to see where he wants it to go. He said he didn‚Äôt wanna tell me he wants a relationship when he doesn‚Äôt and lead me on but he also doesn‚Äôt want to say he doesn‚Äôt and then regret it later. I respected that because considering how slow he moved for everything else i understood if he needed more time (he is a Libra) after all. He told me he wanted to keep seeing me and said he wasn‚Äôt seeing anyone else. I generally don‚Äôt believe guys when they tell me this but considering is shyness, the amount we talk and see each other and the amount he works i knew he was telling me the truth. 

Since then he has been treating me wonderfully, still takes me out to dinner we still hang out/talk all the time he even got me an extremely thoughtful gift for my birthday at the end if august about a month after the conversation. As if it didn‚Äôt scare him off at all which i know those types of things usually do. We saw each other once more after that but then he had to move back home (about 45 minutes away) because his contract at work was up. We were only able to see each other once since then cause I went back to school and was working a lot. He‚Äôs also been working on his med school applications and he‚Äôs told me that its really stressing him out cause they take up so much of his time. It‚Äôs been about 2.5 months since we had the conversation and things have been going the same if not even better than they were before and he still hasn‚Äôt asked me to be his girlfriend yet. I know that the med school apps might have something to do with it and he‚Äôs still working on them now for other schools so he still might be a little bit stressed. I wanna bring up the conversation again but honestly im just scared his answer is gonna be the same, or hes gonna say he doesnt want a relationship with me. I‚Äôve done the friends with benefits thing before and im so over it i just want commitment considering this would be my first serious relationship. He checks all the boxes and i don‚Äôt wanna lose him so i don‚Äôt know what to do!!

Should I wait for him to ask me?

I‚Äôve been out of the dating game for a long time now and frankly, I‚Äôm not sure how to get back into it- or even if I want to try. Some background- I‚Äôm a 24M, she‚Äôs a 20F, and this is our second semester in the same class, although the first was online over Zoom. 

So I genuinely wasn‚Äôt interested in trying to ask this girl out initially, but I‚Äôve been thinking, you know, she‚Äôs cute and has a good personality as I‚Äôve come to find out from working with her this week, and I‚Äôm considering going for it. I have her number, but we haven‚Äôt texted for anything other than to meet up in preparation for this presentation we have due next week. We met up and it went pretty well, I think- we talked a little bit afterwards but it was a pretty professional type of conversation, about the class and work and such, nothing too serious. 

We‚Äôd spoken a good bit over the Zoom semester and I got to know her decently well (better than anyone else in the class, which is why I asked her to partner up with me), but this semester we haven‚Äôt spoken much. She seems very receptive whenever we do, but I‚Äôm not reading anything into that since she‚Äôs probably just being nice- mainly just because that‚Äôs what I was doing up until this point any time I‚Äôd spoken to her. 

Since we finished our preparations earlier this week a bit early and I knew she had free time after our meeting, I‚Äôd considered asking her if she wanted to go get some coffee after, but I figured that might make it seem a bit deceptive or something. Like, it might make it seem that I only asked her to be my partner so I could score a date, which wasn‚Äôt really true and I don‚Äôt want to cause any friction before the presentation. 

So anyways- the presentation is in the middle of next week. I haven‚Äôt made any type of move or shown any interest up until this point- is it too late for me to give it a shot now, like two months into our second semester together? If it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôm considering hanging around after our presentation and asking her then if she has any free time to go get a coffee, either after that class or another day that week. Is this a good idea? I‚Äôm thinking I just compliment her on her part, thank her for helping me out with it, ask her how she thinks it went- and then just say ‚Äúhey, are you free at any point in the next couple of days? I‚Äôd like to buy you a cup of coffee and get to know you a bit better.‚Äù

I figure it‚Äôs best to wait until after the presentation, is that fair to say? Should I do it immediately after class, or maybe wait a couple days for a bit of a cool down? Should I be texting her any more between now and then, trying to build up some friendly conversation in the meantime?  It is a kind of small class and we are likely to be in the same class for at least two more semesters, so I do worry a little bit about making it weird if it doesn‚Äôt go well. I‚Äôd feel genuinely guilty if I made her feel uncomfortable with finishing her academic goals because of me crossing a line. 

One other thing- last time I was in the dating game, I remember it being a pretty hard and fast rule that you don‚Äôt ask someone out for a first date over text. Is that still true? Would it actually be better to do that now? The age gap isn‚Äôt too big, but I do feel a bit disconnected from most of my classmates when it comes to social media/tech stuff like that since I don‚Äôt really use any of it, so I‚Äôm not sure what the protocol is for that kind of thing now. I‚Äôm returning to school after like, a five year break and it just feels like a ton has changed over that time, especially after COVID. Maybe I‚Äôm the weird one here but socialization as a whole just feels totally different to me these days, is that fair to say?

If you show up on a date 50 pounds overweight, hungover and depressed with a person who was truly compatible with you and who felt like a ""soulmate"", they will be totally into you whereas going on a date in a fantastic mood and perfect physical shape with someone who just doesn't get you will never go anywhere. I think this is a scary thing for some people to acknowledge because it is COMPLETELY out of your control. You can lose weight, you can work on yourself emotionally, you can move to a bigger, younger city, but you can't force emotional connection, the only thing that matters in dating at the end of the day. I think this leads people to beat themselves up and take the blame on themselves for lack of dating success when the true culript is the lack of luck in happening to meet the right person. 

Sure, you have to put yourself out there so as to get the chance to meet this person in the first place, but the whole metaphor of a ""dating market"" where you have some sort of quantifiable value based on your looks and income (I'm a 5, she's a 7, etc.) makes no sense if what you're looking for is an unreplacable emotional connection.

So we‚Äôre texting tonight, and he didn‚Äôt like explicitly say he loves me, but he went real close there and did the whole ‚Äúif I had some big weird change would you still love me?‚Äù line, which is so funny because the other day in person I was thinking of making that joke but I was like nah I guess we need to establish that we‚Äôve said I love you first. But good thing he went for it anyway lol. But I said yes and asked the same thing, and he said yes! So... we‚Äôre in that love arena, neither of us is shying away from it.

And he‚Äôs been calling me bb, and just called me babe for the first time, which i love üòç I am falling for this man so hard I‚Äôm WEAK

He is mature and responsible and wants to make a better living by going back to school, but he‚Äôs not like ‚Äúintimidating‚Äù or looking down on me kind of smart, and he‚Äôs sweet and fun and funny and goofy and romantic and so hot, so sexy, so cute, loves animals, and self-proclaimed socially awkward in the same way I am, but more confident than I am. He‚Äôs adventurous and surprising and chill and safe at the same time, indulges the weird conversation twists and turns that I love to make, is patient with me when I get so ADHD around him, and is comfortable in silent moments too. I would love to introduce him to my friends and family, i‚Äôd be proud, I wouldn‚Äôt be nervous to have them in the same room. And on top of all that he‚Äôs into me!!! He tells me I‚Äôm gorgeous and that I have a perfect body, which means so much to me given all I see in myself is flaws first and have struggled with disordered eating for more than a decade. I mean he acted like the first time he saw me he was astounded or something, and I just can‚Äôt see that in myself the way he seems to.

I don‚Äôt know everything about him, and it‚Äôs hard to say I love someone I don‚Äôt know that well. But everything about him has felt worlds different from any prior experience. He ticks boxes I didn‚Äôt even know existed. It‚Äôs like he took all the best features I‚Äôve ever seen in guys from my past and rolled them all up into one person. I just hope it keeps going great, because even though I don‚Äôt know him fully yet, I love who I‚Äôve gotten to know so far.

My close friends are going through sad break ups of their own so I don‚Äôt wanna rub anything in their face, and my distant friends who are in good relationships aren‚Äôt involved in my life enough to bother them, and I‚Äôm not telling my family until my sister‚Äôs wedding is over in a few weeks.

I thought it over and really agreed. So the next girl I came across who was interested I invited to go ice skating. Well we're going tomorrow, and now I'm kinda panicking thinking it's like the worst idea ever lol. Like what are you realistically supposed to do? Ideally it's great because you can break the touch barrier, do something slightly interesting, and talk/get to know each other while doing it. But I see a few things wrong with it for me specifically. 1. I suck at breaking the touch barrier. Like I'm actual dogshit at it. I just can't imagine anyone wanting me to get physical with them. I'm not horribly insecure, but I just never get that vibe. My ex gf was always super apprehensive to anything physical, and I think it kinda conditioned me to believe most people just don't want physical interaction with me. 2. I feel like it's super awkward to have natural interaction. You'll mostly be skating, but realistically you can only skate for so long if you're not that good at it. So you just skate, occasionally talk, maybe race a bit, and that's it? I guess you could do something after, but it just seems kinda awkward. I consider my self fairly socially adept, but those are the two problems I have with this.

I'm just stressin a bit. Any advice?

On august i asked her for a date and it was the most akward date i had in my life, she never started a conversation and she didn't did too much with my tryes. Anyways i gave her another chance and as i was too sharp and in a very nice mood that day i could get a topic everytime the awkward silence was about to come out, everything was cool that day (important detail: that day she told me about how she saw her father and her mom's boyfriend fight and till then she feel uncomfortable with men, ""but she was ok with me"").

We dated a few more times, nothing important happened there, until the last time where i planed to kiss her (and when i say i planed, i mean instead of instantly say goodbye, i kept looking at her for 1 or 2 seconds to see how she reacts) she got nervous and sayed goodbye too fast. When i get home i get a message from her basically asking what happened there, i tryed to avoid her, but she insisted, so i told her i like her and i actually was looking for a kiss. So she started to make fun of what i was saying (then i thought ""cool, i haven't got rejected"") and i tryed to make her tell me what she thinks about it (maybe she liked me too, maybe she needed time to see, maybe i couldn't stand a chance) but she just kept making jokes. I told her ""well, do with that information what you please"" and she told me ""it's ok, but i'm actually angry with you because i told you about how i feel with some things and i know that nothing happened, but now i feel uncomfortable anyways), i sayed sorry but she should know that may happen so she told me she thought we were dating as friends and she haves a couple.

I skyped the details, but she was so sh\*tty with me, she treated me as a fool because ""she didn't make anything to make me feel that something could happen between us"" and it's true but i never sayed that, i just told her i liked her. Besides she always acted so arrogant and sayed it happens to her all the time. I really got pissed off but i didn't lost my mind and told her how she isn't really that special as she think she is and she shouldn't be walking for the life accepting dates from anyone without setting limits. Two days after that i texted her to be sorry for making her feel ""uncomfortable"" and to tell her i hoped we could be good partners anyways, so she told me ""you don't give a f\*ck about it"" i explained her my good intentions but she didn't answered anymore

It's pretty clear to me, and my frinds tell me i'm right, but i want your opinion: Is she out of her mind? i mean i haven't done anything wrong i guess, i just planed to and i don't think that's wrong either, then she treated me as trash and even then I was the only one who was sorry, she never set borders too. Anyways i'm still i little bit confused and i don't know what should i do when we meet on classes (should i act like nothing happened? should i protect the little pride i got left and act a little bit angry?).

I'm (25F) a part of an online friend group (never met IRL) and over the last 2 months there's been some romantic chemistry growing between myself and one of the members (29M). It's not explicitly flirtatious, but I give a lot of emotional support to him, so there is this weird warm emotional intimacy going on.

At first, I didn't really think much of it because he literally lives in another country and I don't expect anything. But over time, his interest in me has seriously grown.

**Problem**

I was going with the flow until one day he mentioned to me and the group that he was trying to hit on some girl in-person and even could've hooked up with some other girl. And since then, he constantly mentions how he is trying to get a girlfriend.

I'm totally fine with him going on a gf hunt (and me not being that gf!), but he wants to continue this emotional intimacy between us and I'd prefer it just not be there. I feel like that kind of warm fuzzy emotional intimacy is reserved for a relationship. I'd feel strung along if I had to keep providing this type of support.

**What should I do?**

I was thinking of maybe just stepping away from this friend group altogether -- it's not really benefiting me anyway -- but I feel like it would be so strange if I just disappeared.

I could confront this guy and say ""hey, no more warm fuzzies. The line between friends and romance is starting to get blurred. Can we keep things platonic? I don't want to become too close or too emotionally intimate because things could get messy."" I'm just concerned with this one because he could be like ""what do you mean? there's nothing going on"" (me: ugh).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1062970,public,self,Feeling strung along by a friend.
