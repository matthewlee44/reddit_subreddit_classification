Intentional dating is about having a purpose and vision for your life and connecting with others who share the same values and who are compatible. 

For women, it is about going within and truly understanding what you need in your life versus what validates you.

For men, it should be more about compatible partners based on values and not solely on looks. 

Until we go a bit deeper, seek out experiences instead of hook ups, we will continue the vicious cycle of crappy dating. 

Dating is also a numbers game. The more you get out to meet people, the more you learn about yourself and what you need. 

Everyone is complaining, yet hiding behind a keyboard with mediocre inbox messages, and less than stellar profiles, yet people want the love of their lives. 

Intentional dating is about desire, purpose, and most importantly INSPIRED ACTION!

Stop complaining about the market place and be the change agent in the market place! Maybe you will see more results if your attitude changes. You can not tell the Universe you want love yet, speak hate and negativity into the atmosphere. 

How many people are you dating on a weekly basis?

Have you crafted dating goals?

What types of questions are you asking your dates?

Are you vetting your dates?

Do you have a vision for your future relationship?

Are you developing the friendship formula or do you rush things?

Do you know the difference between compatibility vs chemistry?

Are you lonely?

There have been few issues (that I haven't expressed) but nothing that really was a stopping point.  But then our county made the national news for COVID infections and the number of people who are still convinced that this is a conspiracy to violate their rights.

I come from a conservative background but have become far more liberal in the past 10 years but I don't think politics inherently make you a good/bad person.  I know plenty of people who are anti-vaxxers for whatever reason.  My father is one, and I've shed tears over it but I don't think they're BAD people.

I know it's still early and who knows what will happen, but he really likes me and I really like him and I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes. We've already discussed and agreed to exclusivity, talked about future plans, acknowledged that this feels unexpected and special etc.

My challenge is that he's not trivially younger than me.  44 to my 52.  He hasn't been married nor does he have kids, but has been in several long term relationships that just didn't work out.  I'm divorced with a couple older teenagers.  And I find myself worrying that I'm going to totally fall for him and a few years later he's going to realize that he wants a family (he says right now he's not sure if he wants kids), or just that I will grow less attractive and exciting with age while he's coming into his prime and he'll leave and I'll be back where I started, just even older.  

I mean, I know age is just a number and all that, and annoyingly my ex husband was exactly that much older than me and I never even thought about the age difference, but a couple things are true:

\-It's not the same when a woman is older than the guy.  It sucks and it's unfair but it just isn't.

\- This decade is hard on women.  40-50 is totally different than 50-60 in terms of what happens to you, aging, menopause, etc.  I can pass for early 40s right now, but I absolutely will not look like this in 10 years.

\- He is gorgeous and fit and charming and smart and almost 8 years younger than me.  Sure, I am a catch, but he could have me at 52, or he could have someone like me at 35.  He's crazy about me now, but if I were him, eventually I'd pick the 35 year old me.

\-It's not a cougar, has a thing for older women situation.  He has always dated women around his age or younger.

I have always had low esteem. I've worked on it but still, it's not good.

I was abused for a long while in my marriage. I have been told I'm never going to find anyone because I'm too fat, I'm too old, I'm too introverted. Do I want to be alone forever? 

I tried OLD a few times but nothing. I tried again recently and started talking to someone about an hour away. He was very attractive and interesting. We met for lunch yesterday in a public area. He has a very public profile and job, not married, all checked out so I wasn't worried about being scammed.

Talked for 4 hours at lunch. It was good but not earth shattering.

He walked me to my car and we made small talk. He leaned in for a hug and I returned it. Then he kissed me. Unexpectedly, long and hard. It was not good. 

Here's where I'm struggling. It just randomly started pouring so he asked if I could give him a ride to his car 4 rows away. I did. We got to it. He grabbed my head, kissed me again and said I aroused him. He put my hand on his penis. He took it out and said to rub it. I took my hand away and then I just was confused, scared, tired. He put it back and I ended up giving him a handjob. I was scared to say no, I was mad at the world because I have been alone so long, I wanted to exert my sexually because all I have done is take care of my kids, my mom until she passed, and work. And so many conflicting feelings.

He texted last night and said he had a good time and we should get together again soon (we could only on a weekend due to work schedules). I said ok and that was it for the moment.

But in the end I felt stupid and disgusting.  How do I move on and forgive myself for the first dating experience out of the gate and get rid of these feelings of stupidity? I thought my self esteem had gotten better. I was setting boundaries. But I failed.

Just wanted a little vent and a bit of advice on my recent situation.

After being single all the way through the pandemic, I went back on Bumble and met a guy, same age as me. The attraction was immediate and intense. It seemed to be both ways. We got along and I felt immediately comfortable with him. He told me quite early on that he had been in a sexless marriage for years. 2 kids, teens, ex has moved on with a long term partner about 5 years ago. He ended it but they are now on good terms. 

He showered me with lovely messages, pics, good morning messages and bought me gifts. I can honestly say that I'd not felt that attracted to anyone in years. Ashamed to say, even my ex husband. Not in the same way. He was very open and I was the same with him. I thought I had an amazing friend who was also a lover. He deleted the app. Then I did too. 

But then, after we had sex, he began to freak out. Said we had moved too fast and that he felt like he was using me. Said he didn't have a lot of time away from his kids and to me, it all sounded like excuses. I felt sick inside. I don't sleep with guys unless I feel a deep connection. I'd been celibate for two years before him. Only been with two other guys since my marriage ended in 2017. I don't sleep around. I was devastated but he suggested doing non bedroom stuff to ease the pressure. 

OK, tell me what you think. I replied saying - I get it, you're not interested. I felt like the 'busy' line sounded like an excuse and he was brushing me off. Never got a reply. It's been a month. Next day, I reactivate my profile and he is back on there with fresh pics. 

Was I too harsh? Should I have accepted the offer of non bedroom stuff or was I right in my gut? 

I still don't feel over this situation. I don't share my bed with men easily and I'm still raw from this.

Hi  everyone.  I'm on a throwaway  here.   I (40M) and seeing a new partner  (39F) a year after ending a  marriage where my desire went without  reciprocation.  I'm in therapy and  I realize that my marriage  negatively affected my self esteem.  I also  started to go to the doctor  since I am 40 now and found out I have high  blood pressure.  I've been  taking one Losinopro a day for a week or two.

I   remember thinking, when I started taking my meds, that I wanted to  make  sure my dick still worked.  In the back of my head, almost   subconsciously, I was worried about these meds and how they would affect   my erection.  Like maybe I saw a commercial where ED was mentioned as a   high blood pressure meds side-effect.   So I tested it last week and   everything seemed fine.  Then I tested it again Tuesday after some   flirty texts with my partner.  Two solo flights and, we are good.  But   its still been in the back of my mind - like ""on these flights, is the   cabin pressure what it used to be?""  I didn't use porn, just imagination   so I probably wasn't as turned on as I normally would be.    My doctor   didn't mention ED issues, nor did the prescription sheet.  I googled  the  meds and it seems to be very rare to have this issue.  It only came  up  if I specifically googled the issue.

Also,   I am not a big porn guy.  I watch it occasionally, but I can use my   imagination just fine.  So I don't think I'm sexually affected by it and   the shit I watch is tame as fuck.

I   met an amazing woman who is kind and affectionate and affirms her   feelings towards me and it means the world to me.  I like her a lot -   and this isn't one of those put her on a pedestal things - but I like   her so much that I am still nervous around her.  I think she's hot.  We   were flirting on the phone and she mentioned my penis size.  Its   literally average.  As men do, it made me worry that I would disappoint.    She also said (being flirtatious) that we should just have sex  already  and if its good, we will know that we have good sexual  chemistry.  I  have always been eager and able to please my partners but  this added  pressure.  Again, because I really like her.

The   relationship escalated last night, sexually.  There was some cuddling   and one thing led to another.  I had an erection just from her kisses!   I  remember from being on this sub that guys sometimes in this age  group  have ED.  This has never been the case for me.  Its been strong  even  during alone time.  I was super nervous, like almost trembling,  seeing  her body, touching her, and everything was working correctly.   But when  the time came for PIV...  I'll just say it.  I couldn't  maintain.  I was  ALL up in my head.  I was hyper focused on my  performance/size/being  quiet/being hard enough.   We worked around it  and both had a great  time.  That part was awesome!   But this still  ranks among the worst  things that has ever happened to me.  I feel so  bad for disappointing  her.  I assured her that it wasn't her and she  really turns me on.  She  assured me that its fine and she knows that I  was nervous.  Also, my  kids were sleeping upstairs so we were a bit  restrained.

So  what do you think?   Was I just really nervous?  Was it self-esteem  related?  Was I  nervous to disappoint? Did I have some medicinal  side-effect built up  in my head?  Was it the meds?  Was it the pressure.    All of the above?   Am I going to have to start taking Viagra?

Women:    How big a deal is this?  She has been very supportive and   communicative and she lined up another date and told me that we are   exclusive and are boyfriend/girlfriend.  That felt nice but I am   embarrassed AF.

Doctors:  Can I take these two meds together?

TLDR:    I have a new partner.  She is hot!  I couldn't maintain an erection   for the first time in my life.  I had one during cuddles, kissing, oral   sex for both of us, but just as I was ready to put it in, it deflated   like a week old party balloon.

I was wondering if you could recommend a site or app here in 2021, been over a decade since I‚Äôve been on OLD. It‚Äôs important to me that I‚Äôm able to edit my profile and respond to messages on the PC, I dislike texting on phones.  

I signed up to Bumble which is new to me. I also signed up for OKCupid and POF several months ago but haven‚Äôt had much luck. Both those apps were a thing 10 years ago and worked great for me at the time. Here and now, not so much pretty sparse in selection. 

Did receive a few responses over the last few months but they were out of scope of what I was looking for.  I did take a glance at Tinder but it doesn‚Äôt have enough information on the profiles to know if I‚Äôd be interested and to be honest some of the things I‚Äôve seen on there cannot be unseen so I haven‚Äôt continued exploring that one.

I suppose I should mention I live pretty remote, in a rural area so there are no major cities, so meet up events and various flavors of that isn‚Äôt a thing out there.  But, we have corn. Lots of it. Does that sound corny to you? 

Any recommendations you have I'd appreciate,  today I realized that my situation isn't going to change unless I pick a new direction,  any one you recommend surely would have more value then the ones I've picked so far.

Full stop.

I've always been open and honest about my mental illness. I've never been ashamed because I'm fucking PROUD of how hard I work every day and how far I've come and how successful I've been and AM. 

I've been priding myself on ""how well I'm doing these past 5 years! Healing, Growing, Promotions, Raises, Moving on, Buying my condo!""

But to everyone who hears ""Bipolar"" they just think ""Unstable"", at BEST.

We got close fast, and I thought we were on the track to a serious relationship, but then he abruptly ended it. 

He did it in a text and wouldn‚Äôt really tell me why other than we both had things to work on and couldn‚Äôt be together while we did that. He asked to be friends, I said no because my feelings were too strong, and that seemed to be that. In order for us to, as he put it, have better boundaries he blocked me on social media. I didn‚Äôt block him because I don‚Äôt use it much and also didn‚Äôt see the point. 

About a month later he asked to get together and we had a month of texting, finally talking about why he dumped me and some hot/cold behavior on his part. He also made a point to tell me I was unblocked. It seemed like when we‚Äôd see each other he was pretty flirty which I finally called out. 

He said no, that he only has ‚Äúfriendship feelings‚Äù for me. I asked for space again, being clear that a) it‚Äôd be a lopsided friendship because I wouldn‚Äôt want to hear about his love life and b) I‚Äôd like to find someone who is attracted to me and I‚Äôll be too distracted to do that if he‚Äôs in my life in a real way. 

I said there‚Äôs a space between being active friends and banishment and that‚Äôs where we need to be. He said ok, I wished him well and figured we‚Äôd probably not talk for a minimum of six months. I fell really hard and it‚Äôs been tough to move on.

Nine days after that, I got a notification that he‚Äôs now following me on Instagram. He‚Äôs also liking my posts and watching my stories. 

This, to me, does not feel like the space I asked for and makes me wonder what it is he wants. Personally I would prefer to avoid someone who has unrequited feelings me because I wouldn‚Äôt want to stir up a mess.

But friends who are more social media savvy than me say it‚Äôs in the space between active friends and banishment - that it‚Äôs just something people do and isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù Is that true?

I‚Äôve just realised that I date a very specific type. It‚Äôs always really safe guys, where I have more control over the relationship. It‚Äôs always based around sex, and I‚Äôm always the one to end it.

I‚Äôm just curious how many other people have seen that pattern themselves.

I do wonder if it is just me, an old friend commented recently how as a teenager I was never as attached to boyfriends as she was, she was always one to fall deeply in love.

My ex husband was convicted of pedophilia after our break up, I had three kids with him and he was my best friend even after the break up. So it was a huge betrayal. I did love him so much.

The only guys I have had that spark for, have always been the impossible ones. The ones who live in other towns or are moving soon.

To me, staying single forever is not at all a negative. I communicate well and often to guys I do date that it‚Äôs casual, just sex, and they always agree. Then they become  attached anyway, so I end it before they get hurt more. Plus something about them always starts to bug me!

We had some great conversations about an uncomfortable topic across all walks of life.  You people are awesome.  I didn't have a dad when I grew up, so it was awesome to hear from some more experienced men (you know who you are and thank you). Other guys have had the same issue and its not the end of the world.   

Women, you really helped me with the idea that this stuff happens, especially early in a relationship.  You also had great input about not making a big deal of it.  So basically, I just told myself that it was 100% psychological.  I made myself believe it and I let it go.  As Walter Sobchak said, ""If you will it Dude, it is no dream"".   

So without further ado:

**I was long, I was strong and I was down to get the friction on!**

Deets: 

She is aggressive.  She invited herself over last night.  It felt good that she did that.  I didn't have the kids.  The plan was to watch a movie, and maybe cuddle and fall asleep since we both were up late the previous night.  We never got around to the movie, but we did find out that we have very similar taste in film.  So that was a nice bonus.  Eventually, after scrolling through hundreds of film choices and chatting, we were getting sleepy and decided to go to bed and cuddle until we passed out.  This was 100% my intention.  No expectations.  

Everything was cool, relaxed and it felt great to get close to her.  I was super happy just to be the big spoon and I was just getting sleepy when she turned around and kissed me.  She kissed me hard and long.  FIREWORKS!  I was firing on all five-and-a-half cylinders.  A little foreplay, yadda yadda and I was just. SO. READY.  It was fantastic.  She was happy and I was over the moon. 

Thank you so much everyone for giving me support.  I would have kicked my own ass into submission if you people hadn't given me such great advice.  

I love you guys.

I'll see you on my main where I pretend to be much cooler.
