I've never been in a situation that was even remotely sexual. People just don't see me that way.

Even in middleschool, when everyone was playing spin the bottle, I was excluded. I just wasn't let it, because I wasn't considered ""an equal"", a sexual being.

I just was so beneath everyone that they collectively decided that I simply do not posses the ability and the right to have any sexual thoughts.

And to this day it is true. I'm in university, and when people discuss something related to relationships I'm quickly booted out of the conversation. Even physically sent out of the room.

And like I've said, never been in any kind of a situation that someone hinted that they might be interested, or that they even consider me as an option.

Rejection is one thing, but to not be even considered is a lot worse.

Went on another date tonight. Previous 4 in the last months I rejected all of them (not a nice feeling). But today hurt a lot.

She was lovely, bubbly, sweet and smiley. I WISH I could force myself to like her but I couldn’t. I made up my mind in about 10 seconds that I didn’t like her.

She was shorter and chubbier than I expected (couldn’t tell on her profile). I could get over that though but her attitude/personality didn’t do it for me. She was really ‘cute’ but I like sexy, edgy, proper femme fatale.

This sounds pathetic but I feel like I want to cry. I talked to her throughout our cute date and established pretty soon that we weren’t compatible and told her as much. And what hurt most was she spent the rest of the date trying to impress me and change my mind.

We live in a different era than our fathers and grandfathers especially did. 

Online dating apps have brought out the most spoiled, most privileged, and certainly the most pickiest of women to ever exist. 

A lot of you guys probably assume you are ""forever alone"" or whatever excuse you give yourself for why you aren't successful with women at all. 

Here's a little something I learned as a 25-year-old autistic male virgin who's never had a GF in his life and doesn't plan on getting one anytime soon...

Simply talk to women whether online (that is through social media) or irl with ***no expectations*** that she'll respond in kind, give you her number, or even put out for you for that matter. 

And don't just talk to the ""pretty ones"" or to ""normal"" women mentally speaking. 

You'd be surprised how many average, but cute-looking women will give you the time of day or women you don't think you'd get along with because she's not ""your type"" in general. 

You'd also be surprised how human a lot of women are and how listening to their problems and sharing your own problems in turn makes you a better man. 

Cut the ""alpha male"" crap guys, there's nothing macho about being a ""Tyler Durden"" esque kind of guy who acts like he's all that, but is also secretly hiding his true self for fear of being judged harshly. 

By simply going in with **zero expectations**, I've built online relationships with women from various walks of life (including NSFW content creators who are female) and I don't feel bad that I'm not dating any of them long-distance because I know there are plenty more wonderful women out there irl and that in time, I'll be their ""Prince Charming"" without even having to try simply because I don't expect to get *anything* out of them nor do I play games with them and by communicating with women over social media, I've learned to be more honest with myself and to be more direct with my intentions.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,889839,public,self,Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself Guys!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohrgds/stop_feeling_sorry_for_yourself_guys/,all_ads,6,,,,

We spent four days at a cabin hiking, canoeing, drinking, smoking and just having a great time. There were nine of us all together. Five girls and four guys. Two of the girls were my sister and her friend Shayna.

I’ve known Shay for about ten years. I’ve always thought she was really cute but when we were younger my sister and I promised we’d never date each other’s friends. We both figured it could cause too much drama. Since we’re only a year apart we’ve also shared the same friend group over the years.

Anyway Shay is a tall athletic girl with this great long black curly hair. She and I have always flirted a lot but because of my promise to my sister I’ve never pursued her. I’ve always been able to make Shay laugh and we get along really good.

On the last night of the trip (Thursday) me and Shay ended up being the last two sitting out by the fire. We were talking and joking and I made a stupid joke that made her laugh. She told me I was a dork. I agreed. Then she said “But you’re a cute dork.” Next thing I know she plants a kiss right on my lips. Not a peck either. A full on kiss. We ended up making out for like an hour out by the fire. 

We came home yesterday and as we were all packing up Shay kept smiling at me. Of course I smiled back. I figured we just had a nice little make out session and that would be it. But then this morning at work I got a text from her asking me to call her. I called her on my lunch break and she asked me if I’d like to meet up with her for drinks this evening so we could talk. 

So now this evening I’m going to meet up with her and see what happens. I don’t know if I should feel guilty or not. I mean I made that promise to my sister when we were in high school.

As it turns out, our two best friends are now dating each other so we still have a weird connection to each other.

I ran into him at a bar last night and we talked for a bit. I hadn't seen him in person in over a year, and I still find him attractive. However, I've been advised not to date him for fear of causing a potentially awkward situation between our two friends if something bad were to happen between us.

So after I ran into him, some time passed and I saw he wasn't there. I was sitting next the friend I was at the bar with (not the friend mentioned earlier) and I decided to ask if he was still at the bar. He said no, but then said something along the lines of he could come back. I don't entirely remember because my snapchat messages deleted everything. 

At this point, my friend is begging me to take my phone so she can say something flirty to him (as me), but just ended up talking in a way that made me uncomfortable (nothing too sexual, but definitely flirting). I took the phone back and immediately apologized saying my friend took my phone. He said it was all good and nothing else happened. I don't entirely remember his responses, just that he sent the 😬 face. 

I feel so embarrassed because he probably thought I was drunk texting him and then lied about it. I told both of our best friends about it, so then if he confronted his best friend about it, she would know the truth. Do I just completely forget it happened? Should I not say anything to him about it over snapchat? What would you do?


TL;DR: I ran into a guy that I hooked up with last year at a bar last night. Our best friends are dating each other now, so we're vaguely acquainted still. My friend (different friend) took my phone from me after I was messaging him and started being really flirty. He seemed uncomfortable over snapchat and when I took my phone back I apologized to him and told him my friend took my phone. I feel like he doesn't believe me but I don't know what to do or if I should do anything. I will most likely see him again bc our friends are dating so I don't want to make things awkward.

I used to see her in the university at different places and sometimes we would have eye contacts and I would catch her looking at me. She seemed really timid. So one day I decided to go talk to her, she was sitting alone somewhere and I just went up to her and said hi and started chatting. In the end I asked if she wanted to go out and she said yes and I got her socials and a week later I texted but she didn’t reply (didn’t even make it seen). I thought she wasn’t interested and was just being nice at that time. Weeks passed and again whenever I would see her, she would keep looking at me but I was too embarrassed to have eye contact with her so i avoided it. Also I would occasionally see the posts she would like on Instagram in my news feed which seemed pretty close to our situation. From all the posts she would like, I gathered she is really timid, suffers from anxiety, likes me but is very afraid to show it and wants me to wait. This staring of her and me avoiding being near to her continued on for 2-3 months. Then I decided to text her again. When I texted her, she again didn’t reply which was very surprising. Now it’s been a month since then, occasionally I would see her in the gym and she would still look at me, sometimes workout next to me. But i feel very insulted and embarrassed to talk to her now. I really like this girl but I don’t know where is this going. Now I’m unsure that if she even likes me or not. I need some really good advice how to make this right and approach her.

P.S More details: She doesn’t even follow me back, she has an open profile with which I followed her twice before texting her both time. Before I texted her the second time, I made a stupid mistake, I was going through the chat settings on IG and I changed the theme to love and when I realised it sends that change a message to the other person, I quickly changed it to some other. I expected that she would block me but she actually accepted the message request (Request as she doesn’t follow me back) And few days after the second text I received a notification that she followed me but later when I checked she didn’t.

When we matched, we had really pleasant and quick conversations over tinder here and there but one day decided to exchange numbers and planned to meet. I, during a stressful time in my life, got cold feet and kind of ghosted him. (Terrible I know, I feel terrible). A few days after we were supposed to meet, I texted him and apologized and explained what was going on though and he was actually very cool about it. From there, for about two weeks we kind of lost contact for the most part barring a small convo or two but nothing significant. Suddenly, about two weeks ago, he hits me up out of nowhere asking me to confirm my day off and inviting me to hangout. I agreed, it was very exciting a to have him initiate. We walked around downtown and visited a couple of parks and it was actually a really good time, even with a sort of awkward goodbye. 

We continue to text after that and only 5 days later I initiate another hangout to which he agreed. It was another park but this park is particularly intimate (namely romantic) and we basically had a picnic. He shared his blanket with me and towards the end of the night we laid down on his blanket and listened to music and had great conversations. Another really good time we had. 

This was very recent. I now am wondering what could come of this, romantically but 1) i don’t think we’ve had a proper date for me to assume that he’s actually interested in me romantically. Neither hangout has been titled as a “date” by either of us. We have even picked out a place for our next “hangout” and loosely made other plans but no “dates”. 

The BIG detail here, to me at least, is that when we first matched, his profile stated that he was “mostly looking for friends”. I am truly stuck and would be bummed out if he could only see me as a friend but at the same time, I can handle rejection and am always grateful to add another great friend to my circle, especially someone like him. I know the mature and adult thing would be to just ask but I don’t wanna ruin the dream I’ve built in my head of what we could be just yet in case he’s not interested in me in that way.

I had decided after a few bad occasions to just not talk/reach out to her, which I had planned a get together and an outing (golf, rock climbing, dinner, etc.) each requiring reservations, but she either cancelled same day or just didn’t let me know she wasn’t showing. Left alone at some events with her excuse being she slept in or picked up a shift.

She is close to my family, but I never had met her family. My family thinks I should just continue for something because she is the “kindest/sweetest human ever”. But knowing my experiences I think it would lead to a bad relationship (which she had been part of a few).

I had put my foot down after the third “flake”, explaining how absolutely ignorant she was on this. She tends to overthink things or think most of everything is her fault, so she was terribly sorry. I decided to leave it all for her to think about it and haven’t called or seen her since.

Sometimes I think she is avoiding a relationship, but she always tries to call me out for not reaching out to her for anything. My thought is maybe she is only trying to start lots of little candles to keep warm, rather than trying to start a flame. 

All I can do is respect her choices and move on, but  I think of her often like the dumb brain some of us men have. So I continue to work out, work, school, do things and be with friends when I can. My perspective is like what can I do to not think of her. Being religious, I pray about for clarity in thought and direction through this challenge.

Any tips? Should I just continue to leave it all up to her? I want to move on. I try to be careful in thought that this is just one girl, not one on a pedestal.

We are NOT exclusive, although we have agreed to a few house rules. 

1. If we ""raw"" doggy with anyone we need to let the other know out of respect for STDs.
2. We were ""supposed"" to not bring other people back to the apartment. What happens outside is fine but we share a bed and play around and agreed this was respectful of the shared domicile.

That's pretty much it for the rules. I spend half my time in the apartment and half my time in a country home and don't ask too many questions. She calls a lot. I call her a lot. We have a great friendship and I genuinely care about her.

Why are we not together? Our relationship took a dive during ""Rona"" and she went back to her hardcore party friends. They hang out with all the coke dealers in town. Close the bars down. Mix and mingle like tigers in what I call the ""social toilet bowl"" of the city. She's been partying hard most of her young life and was quite the wreck when I met her. She got herself back on her feet, got a good job, went back to school, etc. Then we broke up. She took the summer off from school and has been party party party the last 2+ months. 

So here's my dilemma. I installed a security camera in my office at the apartment because I knew she'd have ""friends"" over, and given their behavior I wanted video of my expensive set up should anything happen to it. 

My first week back and and my camera caught her walking IN THE DOOR completely naked at what I think is 11AM or 1PM (the clock was off). Not a damn thing on. Just a phone in her right hand and a scrunchy on her left. She clearly just walked in because her dog is doing the ""OMG you are home"" dance to greet her. Behind her is this grungy looking skinny guy that is completely dressed holding some bag and a bottle of water. He's got this creepy grin on his face as he follows her into the living room. I noticed she was wiping her nose a bit and looked absolutely demolished. 

She disappears from the view for 20 seconds and then reappears looking into my office. She looks annihilated, closes the door, and the rest I can't see. 

I'm not sure I'm going to confront her on this issue. She is free to see other people although I am concerned she is violating the rules of the house the FIRST day I was gone. Plus, when I ask her if she's slept with anyone tonight when she gets home from work, for STD purposes, I bet she's going to say no. 

I am concerned about her well being. I'm sensing the following could be true:

1. She's doing a lot more cocaine (she can literally rattle off all the coke dealers in town and who has the best, the worst, and her good friend was sleeping with one of them for a while).
2. She's giving up her body for cocaine as the dude did not look like her type at all. 

But this is the strange part. How did she come in COMPLETELY NAKED? Did this guy drive her home naked and she walked up the stairs naked (pretty visible area)? Or, was this maybe the next door neighbor (they are losers over there) and she was bringing him back over to our place after? 

I just can't wrap myself around the walking in the house completely naked. How is that even possible? Why?

These are some of the “signs” that makes me think that she likes me...

**I catch her staring at me often. She’s a very observant person, so I don’t think that this is a sign. I catch her looking at me at least twice a day. Once I caught her staring at me while smiling.**

**We joke around a lot and I make her laugh often. One time she said “you’re so funny”.**

**She remembers a lot about me. I’ll mention something once and she’ll remember it. Even really small things.**

**We tease each other all day long. Like the other day we were shooting trash in a trash can she said how if we played basketball 1v1 she’d beat me. We tease each other about our food tastes and random stuff all day. 50% of our conversations is just us teasing each other about something. We also compete with each other over little stuff.**

**The other day we got tipped at our job, but because of my position I couldn’t accept the tip. I jokingly said I was upset, and she said she’s bring my a Gatorade and some sour skittles (we talked earlier about our love of sour skittles). Sure enough, the next morning she brought me some. I will say that I’ve had female coworkers buy me random snacks before, but it was always platonic and they never bought me a snack they knew I loved.**

**She asked me if I worked a certain day, and said she’d bring me a thing of milk that day. We teased each other a while back about how I love to drink milk, while she hates it (lactose intolerance). It was a joke at first but she said she’d really bring it. I asked her what’s her favorite snack so I could bring her something too. The day arrived and she actually brought me a small thing of milk. I also gave her the snack I bought. Later she bought a thing of chocolate milk from our cafeteria to “prove to me” that she can drink milk.**
 
**Yesterday morning she showed me a video of herself that she recorded for me of her drinking milk at home after work. She flipped off the camera afterwards, which I thought was funny.**

**Yesterday was so stressful with at our job that she started crying at one point. I pulled her to the back and we talked and I was able to calm her down. Towards the end of the day, she went to our work cafeteria and bought me another thing of milk.**

Since I’m her supervisor, even if I wanted to I couldn’t ask her out. At first I wasn’t attracted to her, but now I kinda am. I may ask her out, but that’ll be after she leaves our job in August.

In fall of 2020 we had a couple of new girls join our country’s society in college. We all only used to meet in a group when the societies had events. Eventually a smaller group formed where me and this one girl were in the same group. We followed each other on insta, and she is an active poster, and i started liking her/ developing a crush.

In the meanwhile a fight happened amongst another group me and her were a part of, and how she handled the whole thing and trying to save friendships, really got my attention and i developed stronger feelings for her.

We started talking, and were messaging alott…for like a month, i being stupid..was complimenting/reacting to all her stories and listening to her life problems, telling her how she is an awesome person(i know I’m stupid). We started meeting more frequently as a group too. 

Then one day she just told me that she has been noticing what I’ve been saying and how I’ve been treating her and she only thinks of me as a brother/friend (yikes) and if i still want to pursue this and make her awkward, she can leave the group OR we can go back to being friends and have things be normal again.

I didn’t react harshly and just told her that its fine, she just gave me a generic rejection…”its just not the right time/i haven’t found the one”. 
I said okay and just stopped messaging her. 

The rejection made me think about my life and what lacked in it that I’m being rejected. I made some changes to my life and I’m trying to be better for MYSELF, workout, focus on my mental health and i haven’t thought about her that much, although low-key i still have feelings for her, even though ig i shouldn’t. 

Recently she reached out and said that she valued our friendship and wants to save it and she doesn’t want me to not be friends over some feelings(this felt like my feelings weren’t even valuable) and told me how she thought i was there for her and a good friend etc.

I realize that i was simping and was giving her everything without any commitment. I don’t think i can think about her just as a friend. 

What do i say to not come across as a douche and lookout for myself and not be Classic Schmoseby.

He had even been talking about things that we were going to be doing on our future dates. Then, during the time of being intimate/snuggling in his bed, I made one statement that said, ""Sometimes just certain sexual things (like finishing) can be very difficult for me because when I was younger, I was sexually abused."" He did not say anything in response to this. He did seem upset though afterwards mentally (although did not say he was verbally). Soon after, he told me that it was probably best if I left because he had to be at work at 6 AM. I then texted him a week later (after no contact) stating that I was very sorry if what I said upset him (I said it multiple times within the same text). He never responded. It's been a month since that date. I am utterly heartbroken and also concerned. I just think his reaction is so odd and bizarre. If I text someone apologizing if I upset them and that person never responds, doesn't that mean that clearly they are upset and giving me the cold shoulder? I'm also worried that I could have possibly triggered him if he had abuse himself in his past, and he was so upset by this. I really did not mean to cause such a mess by this, I just wanted to tell him that my hesitancy to do sexual things has absolutely nothing to do with my feelings for him - it has everything to do with sometimes I get very embarrassed and ashamed of my body. He definitely did NOT seem like the ghosting type, I feel like he would only ghost someone if he found them unsafe or if he was truly mad at them. I just think his reaction to everything is so bizarre. I mean, I really thought he was a nice person. I just think his reaction is really unusually cold.

The person always says “I think that we would have more fun/or be better together as friends”. Most of the time, we keep hanging out and we have a great relationship. Some of my very best friends are ex’s. 

The gag is I’m not single! I’m in a LDR of two years with a lovely man I have a great connection with. This relationship is friendly but also romantic/sexual. This is my only one at the moment. I am poly and I don’t really have any romantic interests in my city right now.

I’m completely gagged because I don’t think that I should date. I say this because I think they are right. Most of my cherished connections are platonic. I can wholeheartedly agree that we are better off as friends. I feel so much better hanging with them that way. I feel like I can really be myself and connect with them. I’m sure I act weird in some way when I like someone that turns them off. Then they reflect and realize that we are great friends too and want to continue that. 

I’m not sure why I act weird but if I do, maybe I shouldn’t be doing this. I can’t even identify any specific thing that I do. Maybe reactions that are a little too strong and language/emojis that I use make people think I’m becoming attached too fast? They’re kinda right since I do start to develop feelings for them quickly. I think it’s kinda cool that I have all of these close platonic relationships that heal and uplift my spirit. But isn’t it strange that I’ve only had one successful romantic relationship? I feel like putting myself out there in that way with people only hurts me. I always get dumped! I know I get to keep them close to me in life but that part really really sucks. I have BPD and thus a strong rejection response. It can really put me in a dark place if I don’t take care of myself/they don’t know what to do with my strong negative BPD feelings. I would be okay with this if I were asexual.

Something seemed off about his texts. He wasn't like other guys. He texted constantly (which other guys didn't do so early on). By constantly I mean: he'd text me during the workday asking ""what are you doing"" and if I didn't reply in 5 minutes would send another text asking ""?"". Something just seemed...off. But I dismissed that because maybe people are different IRL. The night before scheduled first date, at 9 PM he asks me to drive to his area (30 mins away) and go to a bar with him which I thought is a bit sketchy considering we hadn't even met yet and HAD a first date planned for lunch the next day. First date was okay, but again something seemed off. For someone who seemed clingy over text this guy did not talk much...he barely talked. Long periods of awkward silence. I got the vibe, not of someone being shy, but rather...of strange, mysterious...but there was no rational explanation for this. Just a feeling I got.

In between first and second date he kept sending me pictures of himself. I don't know why. His profile, and mine too, have many recent pictures of us in professional and casual settings. It was like he was trying to flaunt himself and his muscles. I didn't reciprocate with much excitement. He asked me for a picture too and I asked him why-considering we met already-he just stopped there. Again continues to be very clingy on text. I'm a resident physician and I told him I can't reply immediately when I'm with patients but he didn't stop.

I definitely felt something was off and weird but again can't fully rationalize it. It's more a strange mysterious vibe. 

Second date today went progressively worse. Something was just creepy about the way he looked at me. Again, hard to explain, one would need to be there to see. We decided we would get lunch then take a walk around the park. At lunch he ordered a drink and asked me if I'd want one. I politely declined saying I can't day drink as I had to do some work later today. During the walk in the park he took out a shot of alcohol from his pocket and downed it. Again, something was weird about his behavior...the strange, quiet behavior, the mysterious vibe. And then he began to get touchy feely. I'd move his hands away and he would still do it. I never reciprocated but moved his hand away or moved away from him. I'd have thought this was enough to make him stop but nah. I then told him I had to go home to get work done. He insisted I go with him-to a ""surprise place"" and wouldn't tell me where-took my hand and made me go...it ends up being a bar. He said ""I know you won't enjoy this"" but proceeded to a table and guided me to it by physically putting his hands on me...and then got 4 drinks and downed them. He barely talked during this time. I tried to make convo but he barely talked. TBH I was out of it by now, totally out of it. But from time to time he'd get touchy feely, move closer to me...and I tried to move further away..

I then insisted I HAD to leave. He wanted to ""hang out"" even more but I insisted.

I guess i was fine with it being not serious even though i did start to have a crush on him but i never fought or asked questions, that was until he started asking me weird questions... like if i was dating one of the friends i was in a Christmas pic with and pointing out i was looking other guys on Instagram. After a while of not speaking again i was bored and back on tinder i happened to see his profile again and i swipe right thinking there's no way we'll match again but we did lol.

After having disappeared because i was sick and honestly told him to f\*ck off for a week he invited me for a walk (btw i feel like don't need to mention this but our meetings were strictly to have sex, so we did have sex and then took a walk) when we were walking we ran into this other girl he had hooked up with and i was jealous as all hell. The fact that he was seeing all these girls that were so much prettier than me made me feel so insecure and i obviously did not hide it well and he was all like "" you're jealous :p hahah"" and i was all like: ""I'm nooot :("" and then i made up this story about this boy in my hometown that thought that was in a relationship with me and that i was projecting my jealousy cause i felt guilty and some shit. IT WAS DERANGED and then he ghosted me and omg i feel soooo bad why did i do that instead of actually communicating my feelings and now i have to carry this guilt but i cannot apologize or anything and i feel bad for lying. should i just apologize ? or maybe hope he gets it like i don't know i am seeking help cause i never used to do crazy shit like that.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,890487,public,nsfw,I feel terrible for my behavior even though he wasn't the best but i don't know if i should apologize,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohy93b/i_feel_terrible_for_my_behavior_even_though_he/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,
