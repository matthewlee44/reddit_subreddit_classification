5,qwurjm,1637256328,My girlfriend and I were supposed to have an important conversation but it fell through,"Yesterday, we were supposed to meet up to talk about ways we can strengthen our boundaries and talk about personal issues that have been affecting her. We agreed to have notes and plans for the conversation so we don’t forget anything.

We set up the time for after work on Wednesday, this Monday. We discussed it and reconfirmed it on Tuesday night and she mentioned that she would be meeting with her friend that day and her mom for dinner which I had no problem with since I had assumed she gave us ample time for us to speak about it.

Around 4pm I messaged her to confirm she was coming, since she usually is off of work by around 3-330 and is about 10 minutes down the road. I believe she probably got caught up socializing with coworkers. About 5minutes later she said she was on the way. 

I asked her if she was prepared to talk about it and she told me she forgot her notes, so I asked her if she remembered what she wanted to discuss and she only remembered some of it, and didn’t make any plans.

At this point I was a little bit upset because I had spent my time off to spend hours researching and preparing for the discussion. 

So I said we should reschedule to talk about it and she offered the next day, and I had sent her a message how I was upset that this happened because I prepared for it and she hadn’t.

After about 30 minutes she responded and was in a different city with her friend. We discussed why this happened and she said because I didn’t respond to her about the rescheduling that she was at the turn and went to her friends house instead.

She explained that she was supposed to meet her friend at 5pm, so if we were going to meet up as she was already late we would had only 10 minutes to talk. 

I’m pretty upset about this and dropped the subject after arguing in circles about what happened, with telling her it was a misunderstanding and that we should discuss why this happened.

Do you need to love yourself first?,"I (30M) am recently out of a 7 year relationship where I was physically and emotionally abused. I have been actively in therapy for a long time and I am constantly working on myself. I have been focusing on loving myself for who I am. I will admit that I have codependency issues that kept me in my last relationship and I am worried that I will catch feelings and move too quickly with other women or that I will look past red flags just because I am getting the attention that I want. I definitely have issues with desiring validation from women.

One of the big things I am working on is setting boundaries. So if I want to keep seeing a woman I have a connection with, as long as I set firm and clear boundaries with myself and her and communicate them in a healthy  way, is that the right way to do this? Is something like, ""I am still doing a lot of healing and self discovery, so I am not really ready to commit to anything serious right now, but I like the time we spend together and I don't want to stop"", appropriate or am I sending mixed signals?

I want to love myself and be self actualized but I get so anxious when I try to think about removing the women from my life. I am healing through my trauma and low self esteem but it seems so much easier when I have a woman to help talk me through it. I don't want to form unhealthy dependencies on the women I am dating because we both deserve better than that and I want a chance for healthy long term relationships in the future.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwwm7r/how_do_you_know_when_you_are_ready_to_date_again/

25,qwwrun,1637261742,My boyfriend (29) comments are starting to make me lose my confidence,"I, (26F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (29) for 4.5 years now. In most ways he is the most perfect man, he’s loving and caring and hasn’t stopped trying (keeping the flame going) and I know how much he loves me. He is literally everything I could ever ask for in a partner, he’s incredibly talented at photography, gaming, music, etc. I’ve already felt intimated because I was never as good as him in any of those things and he continuously lets me know that.

Over the entirety of our relationship my boyfriend has told me how much I suck at being both in front and behind the camera. How awkward I am to take photos of and how I still need to learn “how to turn a camera on”. He gets frustrated while we’re gaming because I’m slow and not very good at it, even though he’s the one who tells me how he wants to start gaming with me but then tells me how much I suck the entire time we’re playing. He’s told me how I suck at blowjobs because I tend to gag, he’s told me how much I sucked at riding when we first started dating and how he had to “teach me how to ride”. He told me how much our kissing chemistry was off the beginning of our relationship, even though he told me me how good I was at kissing the first time we had sex. And then recently said “I can name a lot of fuckboy lies I said when we first started dating”. We were also reminiscing about our relationship and told me the first time we danced together that I sucked at grinding. 

I never once have retaliated at any of his comments even though I can name hundreds of times I would fake an orgasm to make him feel good about himself. I would never embarrass him in any way or make him feel less of a ‘man’.

I constantly feel like I can never be as good as him at anything. I feel like I’m not enough and get incredibly insecure after every comment. I’ve tried so many times to build up my confidence just for it to be broken down with every comment. He knows my love language is words of affirmation, and how much words hurt me.

[my recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvbndh/it_has_been_10_months_and_he_hasnt_asked_me_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

He (24M) and I (19F) ended up hanging out last night, we went on a walk and saw this kids park and went on the swings and we’re having fun.

*** this is for context on his mood**skip if u just want update.

Basically earlier that day after I finished work I went to the gym. I have a fitness Instagram account and I guess one of the guys (19M) that followed me seen me at the gym and came up to talk to me.

I recognized him and we said hello and then continued our own separate workouts as I was leaving to do an Ab circuit he wanted to join and I said sure. It was cool and everything, randomly he said “you’re actually pretty” and joking I said “thank you, well that was random”

And then I told him let’s do another set so we don’t go into that weird awkward moment.

I go on Instagram and see that I’m tagged in his story. It’s a video of me working out with the caption “Caught the trainer putting in some work” something like that. It was funny I reposted it and that was all.

I guess my “boyfriend” (24M) followed him and seen that he posted me. 

He called me and said he wants to hangout like he usually would and that’s when we went to the park.

We were having a good time and then I sensed something was off. And he asked if I had any new workout partners.

I said nope. And then he said “mmhm” and then I told him the guy (19M) had asked and seen me at the gym from instagram and had asked to do Abs together.

He told me he was jealous, and don’t know why the guy had to post me on his story. (Apparently he know of the guy so he saw his story)

I told him I didn’t even know that he recorded me because I didnt until I seen Instagram.

Anyway he changes the subject(he usually does this when talking about serious topics I think to lighten the mood, I hate it because i want him to express how he feels without hiding it)

Now on the swings, like 20 mins after we were just having random fun as if we’re 8 year olds at a park, he asked me “what my ex does?”

I was so confused why we were now talking about my ex.

I told him and said why are you wondering about him

And then he just sits quiet and says he scared of losing me.(nosy specifically about my ex)

****UPDATE****

He told me he doesn’t like how guys message me or come up to me places. He said he trust me but doesn’t think I know when a guy is trying to be friends or fuck.

I told him I only want to be with him and I told him I show him that all the time. I then proceeded to finally ask.

I said he confuses me. And that We been talking for 10 months, were in love, and that i now understand sometimes people just end up in relationships without saying anything, but how he knows i overthinK too much and need to know exactly.

All he said is that hasn’t he shown that we’re together, loves me, only takes me out, sleeps with me and there was more but.

Then I told him, I want to be your girlfriend. He said if I ask you out what will be different. In my head I took that as he doesn’t want to be my boyfriend

But then he went on about how relationships work, and how he’s not that experienced.

he was talking about taking cute couple photos and how he’s not so good at all the Romance things and he knows I’m a bit of a romantic person.

I told him thats not what being your girlfriend would mean to me, it what we’re doing now, just for the minor fact I know now I’m “taken” not “talking to someone”

It nay be immature but the minor details matter to me.

So that basically what happened. I now know were together but I think hes scared of disappointing me or me leaving him if he doesn’t do what the guys do in Romantic movies. He afraid. I guess, but he make me happy, takes me out, gives me attention, affection,loyalty, laughter,trust. To me, That what being his girlfriend is not the stupid movie stuff

so he doesn’t refer to me as his girlfriend but it’s only been a day and I’m actually

33,qwxo6p,1637264170,What would you do if you were in this situation?,"I [24F] am really interested in this guy [23M] from my university. I don’t know him very well but I have a feeling he’s a little interested in me too, and I believe he is single. 

The problem, and the great opportunity, is that we have several mutual friends. 

It’s an opportunity because these friends might help me (us?)….but it’s also a problem, because I’m a very private person. If I told my girl friends that I’m interested in this guy I feel like they wouldn’t be very discreet about it. At least one of them is extremely gossipy and loves playing matchmaker, and I’m worried that she would just tell everyone too early if I started dating this guy. 

And I’m also worried about a million other things. Like what if he’s not single, what if he’s not actually into me at all, what if it turns out he’s a creep, what if people judge me for liking him etc. And I realize these worries are pretty dumb (he seems like a really nice person), but I can’t stop overthinking! 

So, what would you do if you were me? I don’t want to go too fast, because it’ll make me freak out. But since I like this guy, and he might like me back, I feel like I should do something. Find out if we’re compatible. Let him know that I’m interested. Something like that. 

Sorry if this is unstructured, my brain isn’t working properly at the moment.

34,qwxxyx,1637264929,Gut feeling he likes someone else and how to get my confidence back.,"Long story short, a guy friend who I like and have had some slight romantic situations with has randomly stopped talking to me and no longer reads or responds to my messages. And I'm not sure why.

A month ago we slept together, which was the last time we spent time together. but that night I had stayed at his for the first time, as normally I'd go home very late when hanging out. But before that night we've had many movie nights together and have cuddled or got touchy before. We did sort of get close very quick, But now its all stopped. 

I have a gut feeling he's backed away for one or more reasons or maybe it's something I don't know about and he just won't tell me. But I feel it's either:

1.) Us getting closer than he wanted and it happening too quick.
2.) Him being scared if us becoming close (as he's very introverted and hasn't dated or had a gf in a few years).
3.) He led me on for a few months and never liked me as much as I thought and I of course liked him more then he liked me.
4.) He likes someone else now and is probably interested in them more and have just decided to drop me, but he decided not to be mature, honest and talk to me about stuff. (As I always seem to get left for someone else who's better)

How do you move on from someone who's probably no longer interested and ignores you?

And how do you gain self confidence back again after it being crashed before In the past (I was originally cheated on before) which runined me. And I myself have not dated or had a relationship in years, due to it taking me years to feel worth of having any form  romance,love or affection. etc. Now I feel the feeling coming back slightly with this situation and I can't shift my mind set. Especially as this has happened out of no where and he won't reply or tell me if something is wrong.

I haven't gotten laid in 1,5 years, but don't want to come off as overly sexual and like sex is the only thing I want. I would like to maintain our friendship. Please help!"," Ok so bear with me this is going to be a long story.

There's this guy named V. V and I have been in the same college courses for 2 years now. We were aquintances but became closer during the pandemic when everything was on distance.

Starting early summer he asked me out on lunch. I couldn't go due to work duties so I had to postpone. I then followed up by inviting him on activities like minigolf and pool. There were a couple times where we went out for drinks and pool. None of these activities were labeled dates and I was assuming we were hanging out as friends.

College started again and we didn't see each other for a month or so. One friday evening, he texted me to come to the bar where he works. I was thinking that this was super weird, but I went there anyways because I didn't have any plans that night. I walked in and saw him in the bar, quite lonely. The place wasn't full due to covid restrictions We talked for a good 20 minutes and then I ordered a drink and went to sit at a table with other students just to strike up a conversation. A couple of minutes later I suddenly see a snapchat from him asking me where I went. I answered saying I went to sit at a table with some student because I was bored standing at the bar. Occasionally I would see him serve students, and my eyes would meet his eyes and he would kind of hold eye contact with me for a couple of seconds in the middle of carrying bottles.

For the next 3 hours, I was chatting with a group of students and had really fun. Unfortunately at the end of the night I had a bit too much to drink. When I was on my way home out of the bar, I saw him, and I went up to him and said something to the tune of ""when are you done working"" and hugged him, and he put his arm over my shoulder and said ""you're drunk, go home"". I then apparently called him and texted him on snapchat multiple times asking him when he was done working. I also wrote something like ""too bad you didn't sit at the table with me and compete against the other students!"".

Flash forward to the next day. I was SO embarrassed when I woke up. I decided not to reach out and just put it behind me. I got a snapchat message from him late that day, around 11 pm where he wrote I should come back tonight so that we can take revenge. I was already in bed and hadn't planned to go out anywhere so I politely declined saying I was almost asleep and had to get up early that morning.

After this, we haven't really hung out much in person. College has been demanding. However, I have noticed his friend smiling/looking at me, and I once heard his friend call my name when I went by (but I don't think he noticed that I heard him). It's like his friend knows something I don't, theres a certain vibe in the air. I just hope he isn't shit talking me behind my back to his friend.

I've been attending college events and he has reached out asking me to get him tickets every single time. He is drunk texting me fairly often though, and most recently he was at a social event, shitface drunk and asked me through snap to get him tickets for an event I was going to attend. I asked him who he wanted to go with and he said he wanted to go with me and the rest of the people from the college course. But then a second afterwards he was like wait what date is the event? ""Oh shit I'm working that day I can't. "" Even though the date of the event was clearly written visible for him to see.

I was disappointed so I told him he sucks (in a jokingly way), and he would continue to tease me like a middle schooler about tickets through out the day, writing funny incoherent things, calling me names from internal jokes, and most of his snapchats were selfies of him smiling/laughing. So basically we were snapchatting from 3 pm to 11 pm, and it was him teasing me/joking with me. He even called once (I think it was a mistake) and I was like oh I missed it (due to my phone not having snap notifications on) and he called again, and talking to him I noticed he was kind of drunk, even continuing to joke/tease me.

Now the big question is what I'm supposed to do with this. I find him attractive, I think we get along really well as friends and have chemistry. I wouldn't mind having sex with him. I'm 24 and have only had sex with one guy. I feel like my early 20's is the only time to sexually explore freely and its going to get harder to do that as I get older. But I also don't want to lose the friendship we have. I've never had such a good friendship with a guy before.

My main worries are:

\- Maybe he doesn't even like me in that way? Maybe he is shit talking me behind my back to his friend?

\- I'm going to destroy our friendship if we get sexual

\- I'm assuming things that aren't there, and he is just friendly.

Help?

tldr; i find my male friend attractive and we've been hanging out closely and have good chemistry. i wouldn't mind to have sex with him - if he is remotely interested, which i'm not sure of. but i also don't want to destroy our friendship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwy0i2/i_f24_am_inexperienced_with_guys_my_hot_friend/

37,qwy3jy,1637265359,"I am the happiest I’ve ever been :,)","I know that this sub often expresses conflict in relationships or complaints, but this isn’t anything like that. I’m here just to express how happy I am with my boyfriend. Every day is filled with so much joy, and I just wanna share with you guys. 

So he and I have been seeing each other since December of last year, but we’ve been in each other’s lives since we were little kids. A little backstory- we went to the same elementary school; I didn’t really know him, but his younger brother was in my second-grade class. My dad remarried when I was nine and we moved one school district over, so I didn’t see him again for almost ten years. In middle and high school, I became friends with his cousin, and I’d see him around his cousin’s house when I was in my late high school years. We were friendly, but never got to know each other well. We ended up at different colleges, and didn’t see each other again until last year, about five years later, when I ended up in the smoke shop where he worked. Of course, we were in the thick of covid, so everyone was masked up, and I didn’t recognize him- he was just a friendly sales associate. However, when I was checking out, he asked to check my ID, and then said something along the lines of, “I knew it was you!” We then got to chatting a bit, found out we both like to go to raves and such, and exchanged information. We soon started spending time together, and we got very close and and fell in love. 

He’s my best friend in the entire world. I’ve never experienced a love like this in my life. When we started hanging out as friends, neither of us were looking for a relationship and frankly didn’t really want one- we both had deep personal stuff going on. The more we supported one another and listened and shared experiences though, the more we both realized that we didn’t need to be alone to grow, we just didn’t know it was possible to grow with another person. And almost a year later, I am so happy. I’m happy with myself and the decisions I’m making, how I’m treating others, how I keep my priorities in order and save money, how I’m closer with my sisters, and damn, how healthy and wonderful my relationship is with him. He’s a truly incredible man that I look up to so much; he inspires me every day to be the best version of myself and to live with grace and integrity. He accepts me for everything that I am, little quirks and all. He makes me feel seen, and so beautiful. My insecurities still exist, but the only one who ever perpetuates them is me. I don’t need to dress up or wear makeup, I don’t have to think about what he’s going to think when I say something, he’s never embarrassed of me no matter how ridiculous or silly I’m being, he just really adores me for me and I feel the exact same about him. He’s perfectly imperfect to me and I wouldn’t change a single thing, ever. 

Our chemistry is unmatched. I’ve never been so comfortable and affectionate with someone, nor have I ever been so attracted to someone, mind, body, and soul. I’m always thinking about him, and fantasizing about him (and the sex is insaneeeeee but I won’t get into that!!) We’re just on the same wavelength; we’ve even had a couple of the same dreams (super crazy- we both had dreams that we told the other that we loved them maybe a night or two apart before we’d actually told each other.) We write each other notes, we share very compatible love languages, we’re always on each other’s minds, and just being around him makes me feel like I’m glowing. Everything we do together, from dinner dates and hikes and vacations to the smallest of moments, listening to music in the car or just laying next to one another holding hands, feels like a feeling I’ve been waiting for my entire life. He’s the first man I’ve fully trusted, and I didn’t think I’d be able to ever trust again after being cheated on and lied to and hurt in the past. But with him, I’m not scared. This feels really big, really important. I am excited for the rest of my life, and I hope he’s by my side for all the big things and the little things and everything in between. He’s so handsome, incredible, he makes me laugh, he’s compassionate, he’s incredible listener, he has soft beautiful curly hair, and he’s everything I could dream of and more. &amp;lt;3

Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading my happy rant! Would love to hear happy stories about good relationships y’all have experienced. Have an amazing day! :-)

But I'm a very very reasonable person and I have unanimous support that the other party is in the wrong, in this particular situation. Doesn't matter really, because I'm more concerned at this point with the personality issue 

That being said, when confronted on literally anything, she shuts down, closes up, makes excuses and extremely defensive, to the point of hostility. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, have you dealt with dating someone who did not know how to apologize or own up to mistakes?
Ive always known this personality type exists , but I never thought I would end up dating one. I am known to dislike people who do not know how to properly apologize, so it was a shock to me to find this side...

Anyways. I like her enough to try to work this through or talk it through...but that's just the thing. She refuses to want to talk about it. Excuses such as ""let's just talk when I'm in a better mood"" or ""idk wthell you're talking about maybe it was on accident?"" 

TL DR

If your SO wronged you and it hurt your feelings and you want to talk about it, but the SO then neither : apologizes, or even gives an explanation or a conversation....

I'm talking about when you text with a girl and she mentions how her schedule is, some sort of event or activity we could do, and texts back and forth for a while positively. This is what bothers me.

To me, the best way is to just say EARLY ON in a text ""I'm not interested in dating but I appreciate it"" or some variation of that if that's the case rather than stringing someone along for weeks on end.

And this idea of, ""being afraid"" of the reaction if you say you're not interested just doesn't ring true if you've already met in person before AND you've already talked back and forth with them on text continuously on end.

So when the job week was done I felt I wanted to see her again because we had such a fun time together. In my mind I thought of it as a kind of date, just that the two of us would take what we in Sweden call “fika” (suggest you google it). She said yes absolutely. 

We kept contact, and the day after I asked her if she’s free the coming week, some day after school. She replied: hmm no sorry, and proceeded to ghost me for an entire week.

This led to me getting extremely confused, and I ended up asking her why she was sending mixed signals (exactly a week after). She just said she thought she was clear that she didn’t want to go out with me, and that she straight up can’t recall ever saying she wanted to. 

Obviously I called it quits, since I got closure from her and because she wasn’t worth fighting for. I could understand the situation if she would’ve told me she ghosted me because she had changed her mind about the date and was too scared to hurt my feelings, but the fact that she seemed to have forgotten that she agreed on going on a date sometime makes this all the more confusing. 

If anything though, that made the whole thing easier to cope with, since I now absolutely hate her for it. It’s like she didn’t want to admit her doubt, which I would have understood, and we might have gotten off as friends.

Does anyone have any idea as to why she did this? Was she playing with me? Because there is absolutely no way she just forgot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qx0p2n/why_do_girls_do_this/
70,qx0th9,1637272950,"6 weeks of fun ""dates,"" daily cute texts, but still in the friend zone","*The title outlines the broad narrative of this story, so let me begin by saying I wouldn't play this game for anyone else that I've known. It's a little long, but it's a good read.*

**INTRO** 

I would go every week with a friend to a pretty nice restaurant and ""Y"" was our server. We playfully flirted each week. I'm a little older, and she is fit, smart, and stunningly hot. I'm fit, and take pride in my appearance. Finally after some time, I ask her out. She said ""maybe."" Ok. 

The following week, I ask again, and she said yes. Possible red flag #1 came next, she would not give me her phone number, and instead suggested using a social media channel. Ok. 

She works quite a bit and only has a few small windows of opportunity. I own my company so I can be very flexible.

The first ""date"" lasted 3 hours and was quite nice. It ended with a nice hug, 

The following week we went out again and this ""date"" lasted almost four hours and ended with a nice hug and a sweet, but clear, ""no"" on a kiss. Ok.

This has continued now for about 6-7 weeks. We have been chatting daily for probably 4 weeks. Not long chats but throughout the day and always playful, sweet, and fun. 

At one point, I said to her, ""How do I get out of the friend zone?"" Her response was ""What's wrong with the friend zone, it means you still have a chance."" Similar light-hearted reminders of my ultimate goal have been made on other occasions. Ok.

At the beginning, I would sometimes call her ""friend"" to keep her on her toes, and to her credit, she can give it as good as she can take it, and would deliver it right back to me with devilish good humor. 

I have never treated her like a friend. I open the door, I help her with her coat, I pick up every bill, etc. 

**LOOKING FORWARD**

1. I am wondering if this person may be demisexual. This a person who is only romantically attracted to someone who they trust and have a deep connection to. It's possible?
2. I think being clear and honest with someone is the only path forward in a relationship. That said, is a little gamemanship a possible strategy forward? Are there actions that may make her feel she has a chance of losing me, which she does. 
3. I recently joined a dating app and was surprised by the number of matches (around 15 per day with 1-2 being from above average to wow). I have yet to go on a date from the app. Should I ask Y how she should feel if I were dating? I realize she and I are not in a romantic ""dating"" relationship, but I respect her a lot, and I would rather be upfront, than risk her losing respect, or being hurt if she were to find out.

&gt; **Text** ""thank you, I hope no busses betray me, get delayed and leave me stranded in the middle of nowhere :D
sure thing! let me know if you see any fun events again, since I usually only find them when they've already happened""

First suggestion is always, ""find someone through your friends!"" Except that all of my friends are married, engaged, or should be one of the two. It feels like I'm constantly 11th wheeling while out with friends and they never really expose me to anyone single.

Second is generally, ""find hobbies"". I do have hobbies, but they don't really expose me to many. I'm a professional photographer and go to events constantly, but don't really meet many girls I'm interested in/single. Plus it can be unprofessional at times. I also play hockey (not many girls) and tried MMA for a bit. Was considering trying out wakeboarding or kite surfing. I play guitar also, but I have not been able to find ANY meetups at all.

By this point, everyone always throws in the good ole ""go to coffee shops"". Do girls really just LIVE in coffee shops? Because I don't know about most, but I generally only spend like 10-15 minutes picking up my coffee lol.

Been having a really hard time with this, but I know it can go both ways at times.

Three months later I saw him in the app and asked him for a date ( more like get a dinner) we talked (fucked) and have a good night after that disappeared again. He wasn’t looking anything in particular and me neither since he was in a “relationship”. With I had a thought about him now with his number I texted him to see how is it going, turns out he never replied me back like 2 weeks later that text he replied and told he was in Europe for Vacation so we keep in seeing each other again, we keep in touch more often after this and I decided to invited him to a game night at a friend’s, he came with me with spent a good night I got drunk he asked me to go to his place I was drunk so I told him I can’t leave driving so he let me to crash at his house in that way while he was driving my car I told him that I started to have feelings for him he said some kind he felt the same but he wasn’t ready for a new relationship (o yeah he was single by them). So I stayed a his place I met his roommate and roommate girlfriend and had a breakfast bla bla bla.

After this night we keeps seeing each other he invites to friends party I invited him to we spent “dating” for 6 months until he told me he was seeing another guy that probably this is going for a relationship I kept in silent that moment, since I didn’t know how to react I spent 6 months wasted with a guy I thought i liked so I was destroyed inside I told him what was wrong with us he said he doesn’t feel that us can’t work since I’m younger and unexperience (me 25; he 35) so this ended up being friends but I’m afraid that still a small portion of hope that this could happen and I really want to stop thinking like that and stop seeing him like the perfect guy he is not.

I met her at a party and slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well.

so my issue lies with the fact that, even though we have been talking for months and we have sex and stuff he still has not asked me to be his girlfriend. this is starting to make me feel super insecure like i’m only useful for my body. he doesn’t really speak to me in real life either like the only reason we hang out is for sex.

i just think i’m not sure if it’s worth me trying to break through to him and tell him like this kinda is hurting me or if i should just break things off because i definitely do not wanna ignore it and go on as we are. i feel used and unimportant.

i really like him too like he’s sweet and stuff it’s just like... i don’t wanna waste my time.
