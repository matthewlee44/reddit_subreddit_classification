When my BD and I started to date he made himself out to be very sweet and caring and trustworthy, and all of that fell apart the moment we found out I’m pregnant. Emotional, mental, and at times even physical abuse began, along with endless cheating. But now broken up, and I went to dinner with his ex tonight (that he’s cheated with over and over) and find out the real story of when he was locked up for “false accusations” for what he did to her. Turns out, he SA’d her and was very abusive to her. But that’s not even the worst of it. I find out he knocked up a minor 5yrs younger than us about 3yrs ago but she miscarried,,, but he started sleeping with that minor when she was 14 (confirmed by the girl) and he’s even told me he slept with her back in that time frame however I didn’t realize the age gap between us and her, or when these things took place. He also slept with another girl who was 13/14 around the same time frame that first girl was 14 (confirmed by girl and family and he admits to having slept with her years ago) then I find out a girl around their age who is related to him accused him of attempted R@pe when she was a child. His second child’s mother told me he never forced her but wouldn’t accept no to sex. And when I wouldn’t perform oral on him he would throw violent tantrums (not hitting me, but breaking things, throwing things and screaming)
This is a complete 180° from what and how he portrayed his self when we got together and leading up to me getting pregnant. Now I feel sick to my stomach, like I’m pregnant with a stranger, with a predator. And yet part of me is still sad about the break up for some reason, yet I also have complete chills, feel sick, and disgusted all at once.

We had an OK conversation but nothing like it was online.

There’s this girl in my grade (I’ll call her C for now) that I’ve never been close to but always friendly with due to her being in the same friend group as my sister who is a year younger than us , but I never really saw her outside of school sporting events. 

But recently her behavior has been way different towards me since I’ve been back. I by coincidence saw her at a mutual friends house while he was throwing a get together (basically small parties he throws with only like 15 people max) about a month ago and she went out of her way to stay with me throughout the entire night and chatted with me about random stuff. She also mentioned how I got new motorcycle saying my sister mentioned it, so I showed it to her and she said “you gotta give me a ride,” and when I left later that night she insisted on me staying a little longer and getting a ride later. 

A few weeks later my sister had an event she wanted me to go to so I got myself excused from school and took it as a chance to put some miles on the bike and chill for a day. Low and behold I pull up and C is there (totally forgot she was on my sister’s team) and the entire team C wasn’t playing or busy she spent her time either talking with me or watching my sister play next to me. About 3 hours after I got there I had to go for a sec so I left the building to take a call, and apparently she asked my sister “did Archer leave? I thought he would have said bye,) and when I did finally leave later on after she said bye to my sister she hugged me and said that I still owed her a ride.

So part of me doesn’t wanna just go with mixed signals and assume stuff, but everyone I’ve talked to has told me that it’s clear as day.

So as always, there’s this girl. We’re both 20 and in our second years of college, and we’re also both part of the café. I feel like we have a lot in common and really enjoy hanging out with her, and I think she feels at least somewhat similar. 

We had sex in May. It was fun for both of us (she said so anyways) but when we talked things out a week later she basically friendzoned me. She didn’t want a relationship, whereas i had been pretty clear that i didn’t like casual sex. I think I made things a little awkward after.

But fine, I thought, plenty of fish in the sea. I hadn’t even been completely sure i liked her before, in fact she invited me up to her apartment at 2 am in March and I accepted, but ended up sleeping on the couch because I wasn’t sure.

The problem is I can’t stop thinking about her. I don’t care about other girls anymore, I always end up wishing i was with her instead. I thought I might’ve had a shot today, we were going out clubbing together, us and the café, but when i tried to hold her while dancing she broke away and that was that.

At 2 am she went home, another guy from the café left his bag at her house so he tagged along but for some reason I got really jealous. I did feel like he was kinda hitting on her during the night but this seemed innocent enough? Not like she’s my girlfriend anyway.

So should i just give up now? Is there something else i can try or am i jus making things weird?

So eventually after one night of drinking with my coworkers and her, I had my fill of feeling like shit because of the vibe she brought upon me in those social gathering. So when I left I was kinda mad and decided on a whip to unfriend her on Facebook, which she realized within minutes. She even texted me about it and I made up some dumb excuse. However after that day this relationship was dead to me.

Now fast forward two months later and today we just matched on Tinder... 

I'm so confused, I never expected this and now I don't know what to do, what to write... She made me felt so much up and down back then, I don't even know if I should be investing time in her at all. But if I am how should I approach her...?

I am feeling super lost and my self-esteem has gotten very low. 

I am 22F. I recently met this guy (24M) in my professional program. Him and I have been talking since end of July. He liked me but then realized he’s not ready for long term relationship but doesn’t want to lose me either

He isn’t ready to be in a relationship but always tells me that he wants to marry me but wants to have fun with hot girls atm. I have over the months gotten pretty turned of by him and at this point I don’t really have feelings for him. 

However, him and I study together in his apartment and we always end up getting caught in the moment and hence get physical. We try to stay as friends but things just end up getting physical. 

He doesn’t like me anymore, always talks about hitting up this girl or that girl, cares for me though a lot, and tells me I’m wifey material perfect for him and his family. However, since he didn’t hit up girls because of his anxiety in the past, he wants it now. But says he wants to marry me and  doing this (hot girls) is important for him otherwise it’s going to affect his relationship with wife as he’s not going to be satisfied. 

He has a lot of anxiety and I have seen him at his worst point. I have tried to help him a lot with his mental health but at this point it’s affecting my self esteem -  because we end up getting physical which I don’t like. He is super emotional and very attached to me. I am too, very caring and empathetic towards him.

I feel what him and I do is wrong. I can’t share how I feel with anyone close to me. 

Please help me. What can I do in this situation. How do I stop this - him and I are in the same program, see each other every day, what can I say to him. I have tried remaining friends but it’s just getting friends with benefits relation. He is understanding and really respect me and I don’t know how to articulate myself or what to say to him.

Like the song deja vu by Olivia Rodrigo, if you know it. Please share your stories! I’m very interested to know because I just went through that experience.

For my story, I (f19) recently dated this guy (m20)for 3 weeks. The relationship in itself wasnt bad, and so was the break up. But he definitely dated me, in one way or another, as a rebound from a 1 year toxic relationship. Tbh, I knew it all along but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he did try to be this nice guy who cares about me and are really into me. My friends saw the way he looked at me lovingly and the way we hang out before we started dating so it wasnt just me who think he was a good guy. 

But throughout the relationship, I saw that he was emotionally unavailable and he didn’t care for me and wasn’t there for me when things were hard. Meanwhile, I always cared for him and always tried to put myself in his shoes whenever I had problems with him. Throughout the whole thing, I was very communicative and thoughtful with him and I really wanted the relationship to work because I liked him. Call me a hopeless romantic for trusting and trying. He realized it too, the mismatch in our effort and emotional availability, and that’s why he brought it up and broke up with me. Him owning up to his mistakes makes me further believe that he is a decent person and I didn’t mind the thought of being friend with him or possibly getting back once we’re both in a better place. 

But 2 weeks after we broke up, I saw him hanging out with a different girl, doing the same exact thing that we did before and during our relationship. From the way he walked with her to the way he looked at her and the routines that they’re doing together. What’s funnier is that she has features like me. I don’t resemble his ex as much, but his new girl and I definitely do. 

I’m very glad I saw that to be perfectly honest. It helped me realized I was right all along and he did not deserve everything that I did for him, not even the benefits of the doubt. I think seeing that helps me move on so much faster. In retrospect, I think it was a great learning experience.

A few weeks ago I met a guy when I was surfing and asked if he taught lessons cause I suck. He was super down to teach me and refused to let me pay him. We added each-other on IG. 

A few days later we had a lesson. I wasn’t attracted to him at all and he was a lot younger than me (by 8 years)… so I only saw him as a new friend. That day we were all sandy and he asked if he could come over to meet my dog (I live on the beach in a cool spot)… I have a rule, no guys over unless they are just friends cause I have learned you have to get to know someone first. 

So he came over and showered and he got flirty and suddenly I found him attractive. We watched a movie, made out, and then he went home and asked if we could hang out the next day. He really wanted to come back, I think to hook up… but that wasn’t going to happen for me cause I take things slow. He also went home wearing my clothes cause he had none with him except for his sandy trunks. I had so much work so I said let’s hang out in three days. It was Sunday, so hang on Wednesday. I was excited cause it was so unexpected and we had the best conversation, felt like a breath of fresh air. Although he was younger he seemed mature. He’s 22 and I’m 30. I already knew there was like a 99% chance it wouldn’t work because of our age difference and where we are in life, but I’m open to everything in life. You never know you know?

We texted a little, I initiated, but nothing too crazy. He just told me about his day. Wednesday rolled around and I never heard from him. I’ve learned to not chase, so I waited and nothing. The next day I texted him and just said “so much for hanging out, would you mind dropping my clothes off when you have time?” He apologized and said it completely slipped his mind. I knew that was a lie cause when a guy wants to see you, he will see you. I’m 30, lol, so I know.

So he dropped my stuff off and we talked like nothing happened and he was like “if you ever wanna hang, let me know..” I was confused but didn’t say anything… a few hours later I texted him and said “That was awkward for me. Thanks for dropping my stuff off” He said he was sorry and hoped we could stay friends, surf, and hang. So I said “I’m just confused, you were all over me, then forgot me”… He left me on READ.

So it’s been over a week and he’s watched all my stories! Like he’s the first person watching them… and I just learned he blocked me from seeing his stories. This makes no sense! I know I did NOTHING wrong… and I know he’s young, but I feel so rejected. Why watch my stories? Why block me from seeing his? Literally everything was chill.

I decided to block and unblock so we both don’t follow each other. I’m too old for this, if someone brings me no peace, life is short, and I’m a very private person… but would love to hear your thoughts. I’m so confused. I did like him, but I didn’t know him. Hence why I never let guys over to my house!

She knew this, and instantly knew a file minoge when she sees it. We where introduced on whatsapp, and she took my phone and added me as her motive. It was quite obvious that she wanted me to marry her sister. So that they could live togheter.

Every day I wake up, I get a new video from her. It's her workout video. And for some reason she ALLWAYS films her ass. Like putting the phone on record laying it on a chair and then do squats over it.

At first I thought this was some kind of a joke, and I just laughed. But every day there is a new video of her ass. And I thought... Hmm how peculiar? Sometimes other people are filming her ass as well. So one late night I call her up and say, please stop sending me videos of your ass. I find it a bit weird.

But she acts like she doesn't know what im talking about. And next morning, sure enough, another ass video.

So I just blocked her, and yesterday our shift crew wanted to go to fight club. I just tag along, and yep there's her sister working the tap.

The first thing she does is over charging me for 3 beers, I see the sum is way over what's it's suppose to be. Wtf are you doing? I heard about this little scam of yours but I never believed it was true. ""Everyone can make a mistake she says"" 

Jesus... how is your sister I ask? She is now married with some old guy from Germany she says a bit dissatisfied.

Backstory: around 6 months ago i (M24) reconnected via Instagram with a childhood friend (F24), as weeks passed i developed a huge crush on her, the woman is amazing in every way possible. I found myself thinking about her more often and trying to initiate chats more or less successfully, i sense that she likes our mini conversations. And we grew more familiar with each other over the span of a couple months.

Problem: usually i dont have a problem approaching people or holding a conversation etc but this situation is beyond my control. We both traveled, are in different countries with a 7 hrs time difference, you can see how that poses a problem with keeping momentum going. She's working while i'm a part timer and pursuing my masters degree, its been really hard finding time except for those cute comments we leave each other or leaving replies on stories, which leads to mini conversations.

Question: how can i go about this? I told myself multiple times to drop it but i'm really starting to like her, it makes me want her more in my life each time i learn a new thing about her.

Recently, I brought up the conversation to ask where we were heading as things were starting to get serious, and it all went downhill. Out of nowhere, he said he didn't know what he wanted, and we should stop talking. I was so shell shocked and taken aback, because his actions had been completely different. I tried to talk about it and salvage it, but it was clear that it was over for him.

Instead, he made me feel so important and loved that I fell for him. I feel so upset and angry, and can't stop thinking about this. I feel like a fool that I let myself be led on and be optimistic.

Hi guys, I'm a 27-year-old man and I've never had a relationship before.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is: I'm 27 and I've never been in a relationship nor have I ever had sex so I'm a virgin. I was very religious up until a couple of years ago so I just missed out on all the opportunities I had in college. I want to start dating but as I described, I have no idea where or how to start.

I live in a semi-religious (Muslim) country so there are no mixed dance classes, no bars, no clubs. I also tried online dating apps such as Tinder and some local apps but Tinder is basically akin to unicorns in my city. Literally, nobody uses these apps here. I don't have any close friends so I can't ask them to hook me up with someone.

I wanted to try a new mixed language class so maybe I could have some luck there but thanks to COVID, they're all shut down.

I don't really care about sex at this point, I just wanna have someone in my life and I'm afraid my lack of knowledge or courage to try will lead me to die a lonely death.

In other parts of life, I'm okay, maybe even confident. But as soon as dating comes up, I freeze. I don't know what to do or where to even find a date and it's seriously making me have some dark thoughts about my life.

Hi! So I have been chatting with a guy ( met on Bumble) , for a few weeks and he sounds okay. We matched on Bumble &amp; then shifted to Whatsapp. He has mentioned in his Bumble profile that he did his bachelors from MIT ( not that it matters). But I am very apprehensive about the whole thing cause I couldn't locate him on Facebook/ Linkedin or any other social media. He said he deleted social media cause he wanted to focus on his job and a side project ( building some website). Also, while we were chatting I found not he is prone to committing grammatical mistakes ( eg: a for 'an' , "" these 'makes' ( instead o 'make') etc.. stuff like that). Also, both of us belong to non-english speaking country , still I would expect a guy who graduated from MIT to be reasonably good at grammar, right?

Otherwise, he seems fine, we spoke over a call last weekend ( he wanted to have a call) and he sounded okay. Not much of texting though, cause even I am not much of a texter, but he ensures to send me a 'good morning' text or something of that sorts everyday ( pretty consistent). This has been the trend over a month. We haven't met yet as because of work from home I am at my hometown now. Is there any way to check if details provided in the Bumble profile are true or fake? Is there any way to check the alumni list of MIT? I just don't want to be a victim of cat-fishing.

Whenever I show a dating app profile to a girl i'm friends with, or even when i get it reviewed online on  reddit and photofeeler, I usually get comments telling me my photos and profile are good, however a common piece of feedback I get is that I need to show my teeth. Personally speaking, I wouldn't say my teeth are bad, but I'm not used  to smiling with my teeth open in photos. I had really gaped teeth as a kid, and I wore braces throughout my teens,, so i kind of got used to smiling without them in photos. I don't have bad teeth, I would say their only a bit small, but nothing that would scare anyone off. A lot of the photos which I have reviewed photofeeler (which don't have my teeth showing) I get high scores and comments like 'I would date them' and 'great smile'. Where else on photos in which I have my teeth open I get comments like ' He looks uncomfortable in this photo' , 'He looks too young/timid'.   


I'm just wondering is it neccessary to show teeth on dating app photos. I dress pretty well, I'm in good shape, and i try to style my hair for all my photos. Can these things all compensate the facts that I don't show my teeth in my photos. If not, how can i find a way to genuinely look more relaxed and confident showing my teeth , without using any effects/filters. I try and use whitening tooth paste and wear a mouthgaurd when I sleep to prevent my teeth from widening apart.

6 weeks ago I met a guy (50-year-old) through a dating app while he was on holiday in my city (a 2-hour flight from his home) and we got on extremely well in all senses - it was so easy to be together.  He seems honest, although he has a charming personality, and very quickly he opened up about his past in a way which seemed to surprise even him.  We didn´t speak about what the relationship meant to us, but we did say we would meet up somewhere in the near future. He´s also just taken on a massive new project at work, and he´s absorbed in it.

Meanwhile he´s blowing hot and cold. Despite my prompting  two weeks ago, he still hasn´t come back to me with a plan when and where to meet, although he said that he definitely would, and that we should see each other as soon as timing permits. He contacts me himself every few days if I don´t contact him (sort of cautiously knocks on my door), replies enthusiastically when I contact him, even sent me a photo of his extended family a couple of days ago, and indicates he is thinking about me. 

Some background: he is separated from a wife who continues to make his life hell, and before the summer he got dumped by a woman he had been seeing for some months. I think he is pretty scared of getting hurt, which perhaps explains his mixed messages. He´s also still active in the dating app, although not sure to what extent. 

Does this resonate with anybody? Really not sure what to do - I cannot bring up the topic directly since he´s very not into talking about his deep emotions. So I am simply acting normal, when we text. I simply can´t get him out of my mind, so that is not an option at this moment.  Am I being duped?

We didn’t break up, and for what he said he loves me and we’re doing this for us in the long run.

It is the 4th day of no contact and it’s already unbearable to me. On the one hand I want to respect his space since he needed it, I don’t want to be overwhelming nor I want to be perceived as too clingy or needy of him (I already told him many times, before starting NC, that I don’t want us to break up because I love him and he has my support). On the other hand, I am scared that if we respect the almost 3 weeks NC, the relationship is going to break for how hurt we might have been feeling…

I don’t want to be pushy nor needy, but I don’t want to lose him and maybe NC ends up directing him into that direction since he was already doubting. I am trying to not think about it, but how can someone not think about a person they care for.

I know he must be super busy since he’s having some life changes at the moment and also focusing on his studies (as he should) but maybe that makes him not think about me as much as he should in a NC period… and at the same time, it seems NC is way easier for him than it is for me.

When we met for the first time we immediately clicked and talked for hours during the party, we almost didn't talk with other people that were there until the end of it.

I asked her phone so we could continue talking and in the next day we set up our first date. It went amazingly well almost too well to be true, we grabbed some coffee went to a bookstore, ate some ice cream and had a pretty long walk in the park which ended with a very passionate kiss.

Yesterday we had our second date and it was incredible. We had dinner in a restaurant she suggested that had amazing food, after that I drove her home and we kissed inside the car for so much time that I can't even say if it were hours or minutes because it passed so quickly. While we were kissing my Elton John playlist kicked in with those happy and romantic songs in the background, and we both cried and laughed together, it was insane.

I never had an experience like this, I feel this is too crazy that I didn't even know this girl a week ago but now I feel such a strong connection with her that I never felt in my life and I´ve been in quite a few serious relationships. She even said that on our first date: ""I can't believe we didn't even know each other 48 hours ago and we had such an amazing first date as if we were together for years"", and I feel the same.

I know this is a happy story but I can't help but feel quite overwhelmed that it's going THAT well, it seems like there is a catch you know? What the hell is going on? My heart rushes when I think about her.

She wants to set up a third date tomorrow in the movie theater, but I don't know if we are taking things too fast or we should just enjoy the momentum and get on with it.

What do you guys think? Am I being too cautious or is it that I can't accept that after lots and lots of unsuccessful dates someone finally show genuine interest towards me and is not holding back a inch or playing mind games with me?

I want to thank everyone for their lovely comments and constructive criticism.   
It was such a surprise for me to see this post blown up. I just wanted to gain some insights but you guys took it to the next level. Thank you so much for that!  


I want to adress a few things tho. Yes! Confidence is important. Especially in the dating scene. Many people commented that it doesnt matter how you look and yes. Thats true.  


However, in the past people said how ugly I am, how ugly my eyes are and mocked me for my looks. Even if my best friends said Im good looking, I was still scratched and hurt by the others. Which ultimately lead me to this post. I wanted neutral opinions about how I look and you gave me that. Thanks for your lovely comments! Really! You blew my mind entirely.  


I tried to answer on every comment since I wasnt expecting it to become that big of a deal. The next day I had 350 + Messages. So I decided to make a follow up post to thank u all!

I've considered myself too old for anybody to find attractive since I was 22. Considering my age with something that got me jumped at that age, you can see why I think like that. I really want to find someone but I live in a horrible rural area that is quickly turning into a ghost town. Every single business is shutting down, people are leaving, and I'm one of the few inhabitants left. There are maybe a few hundred people left here now. Give it a few months I might be one of the only people left. The place I live in is an absolute nightmare. I never would have moved this place if I had had any choice in the matter at all. This town is Hell on Earth. I don't have any friends or family due to me coming out not sitting well with anybody. I'm worrying that's going to set up a lot of red flags.

I am not doing well with the complete and total isolation that coming out has done to me at all. I'm not okay with the fact that I will probably never have friends or a partner ever again if people have told me that that means that I'm going end up alone. Because people don't want to be around lonely isolated people who are not okay with being lonely and isolated. All my life because of what I am I have felt locked out of society. I see people with their partners, friends, family and it's like it's some whole world but I can never join. I am actually very jealous because I'm never going to be the guy hanging out with a friend or two watching a movie on Saturday night. I'm never going to be the guy who since Christmas with his family. I'm never going to be the guy who is out there playing baseball with his son. And I think I will definitely never be the guy living in the city in an apartment with his boyfriend. I will always be on the outside looking in because I I'm not straight, heterosexual, I'm physically disabled and visibly deformed from it, and I'm a very bitter person with PTSD.  People like that always end up universally hated. Like me. In case you didn't know, you are speaking to the most hated man on the planet right. Ever since I came out everybody treats me like I have the plague.

 And I'm not okay with not being allowed to join that world. I want to be allowed to rejoin Society even though I have to go see. Even though I'm severely physically disabled. Even though, as I'm sure you can tell by the way I am typing this that I am severely intellectually challenged. I'm not an introvert like everybody else. Everybody else I know is completely okay with living out in the middle of nowhere not seeing another human soul 4 months even years on end but it's driving me insane! I don't do well in complete isolation and I start doing not so well after 2 months in a horrible place like this. So many people tell me that they would trade the world to have my life. They can have it, I don't want to live like this. I hate living here! I hate places like this more than anything in the world. This redneck lifestyle does not agree with me and it never has. I want to go to the city but I will never be able to afford to move there.

 It's also extremely hard to live like this because I am physically disabled and I cannot work. This is a very unfulfilling life and I wish that someone was there. But considering my background in the fact that I don't like coming home to an empty apartment day in Day Out people said that I'm out of luck.

And if I’ve ever wanted to have casual sex before then I’m no better than any of them. First of all, there is a difference between having a few one night stands in your twenties to learn about sex, and looking for casual sex to the point of lying to the women you meet and telling them you want a relationship when it’s clear that all you want is sex.  It’s pathetic and manipulative. If I wanted to have casual sex with a guy as a woman, I would also probably sleep with them the first date. I’m going on some dates with men where at times going on several dates with them only to find out that all they want is sex even if they don’t “make a move”. They don’t listen to the things I say, maybe they say sexual things over text, etc. Its obvious. I am in my 30s now, usually people go out and have sex and meet different people in their 20s and get an idea of their likes and dislikes and have fun and try to settle down after. I’m not saying that it’s bad to be going out and having casual sex in your 30s, it is bad however to lie and deceive people to get it . People should be putting their profile on tinder and it shouldn’t say “seeking relationship” if that’s what they really want, or it should be discussed on the first date that they want something more casual 

One of these dates I went on earlier this year I was sexually assaulted on a date after I got in a guys car to talk more after the date seemingly went well on a cold winter night. He stated he was looking for a relationship and then shoved his hands down my pants while I was in his car after I repeatedly said no. My bad for assuming that the guy had good intentions, and I let my guard down. So anyways, I went on a Christian dating site after some people here were recommending I do that  after I said I have had experiences like this and after I said I was looking for a man who didn’t engage in casual sex at this point in his life and was looking for a relationship . I talked with a guy on there and met up and things went well on the first date and then on the second date he shoved his hands down my pants after he kissed me in a PUBLIC shopping mall after we ate dinner. I pushed his hand away and texted him that I was really disappointed in his behavior, especially since I had told him about my bad experiences with men and them trying to have sex with me right away to the point that I am getting assaulted on dates. He made several excuses for his behavior. At first he said that he gets rejected a lot by women (he is not the best looking guy but I gave him a chance because his personality seemed awesome and we had similar interests as well as because most men I have met would try to have sex with me right away), he said that he thought I would friend zone him if he didn’t make a move, and that I wanted him to satisfy me (in a public mall dude ??). 

So anyways there doesn’t seem to be very many men on Christian  mingle and this was my first experience from the site . I feel that if I continue to go on these dates where stuff like this happens I am going to become a bitter traumatized woman who hates and distrusts men. I mean I already feel like this already because of my experiences but I had hope that there were still good men out there. My hope is dwindling. I am also afraid of getting sexually assaulted on a more serious level like rape. On our first date the Christian mingle guy said to me “I can see how, with our fucked up society, a beautiful woman like yourself is still single in her 30s”, and it really makes sense . And then he totally fucked it up  after realizing himself why there are so many beautiful great women out there choosing to be single because of men like this . I don’t understand men and I don’t think I ever will. Is it that hard to go on fucking tinder and look for someone who is looking for what your looking for?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1051525,public,self,Christian mingle sucks dating sucks in general,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3b6d8/christian_mingle_sucks_dating_sucks_in_general/,all_ads,6,,,,

Since then, we've been seeing each other multiple times a week and doing fairly intimate things like cooking together, having sleepovers, meeting our respective friends, etc. I really like her: she's smart, funny, creative, and intrepid. We have very fun sex. But sometimes in between our dates, or even when we're together, I find myself internally freaking out a bit.

I've tried to distill what the root of this stress is (we've talked about our relationship goals and are on the same page) and I think for me, the agitation I'm feeling comes down to a number of things.

First, it's feeling out compatibility. In spite of all the ways I enjoy being with her and the get-together habits we've already adopted, I feel like I sometimes run out of things to talk about with her and my conversational skills become clumsier and weaker. Also, there's a bit of pressure here because our mutual friends and family are thrilled about us getting together. On paper, we would appear to be a great match, and there is some real chemistry! But the operative word there is ""some."" I'm not sure how deep it runs.

Second, I feel torn about wanting to get to know her further by spending more time with her (she's indicated she'd like to see me more) and also wanting to conserve some more time and freedom for myself. Sometimes, even in the wake of a really nice date or sleepover, I'll feel a bit relieved when I'm going back to my place.

During the early weeks of our dating, I chalked this up to standard early relationship anxiety. But it's been well over a month and I'm still feeling intermittently churned up: this week it's been especially noticeable (We're going on our first overnight trip together soon.)

I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced a version of this and whether it subsided with time, or if it necessitated more intentional action. I don't want to cut the cord prematurely, but at the same time, this feels like more stress and doubt than one should ideally be experiencing when getting to know someone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1051538,public,self,I [33M] really like her [34F] but I'm kind of freaking out,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3bdoi/i_33m_really_like_her_34f_but_im_kind_of_freaking/,all_ads,6,,,,

If you want a meaningful connection, todays apps actually deprive you of that. 

I find women attractive constantly on apps. Please, tell me, how the hell am I supposed to make conversation with you off of a blank tinder profile?

It's basically saying that's what your personality is.

Nothing. That or you lack the simple ambition to even fill out a few hobbies, which I'm not sure what that says about you.

Back in my early 20s, I had OkCupid. You had to fill out a long series of questionaires, and I could figure out if a girl and I maybe had chemistry. I would then message her with a pun of some sort based off of her hobbies, try to be funny, or send her a long message telling her all of the things we had in common. It WORKED.

I have no way to do that now. I can't even guess that well, it just leads to bad conversation and weird talks. I actually still get dates off of tinder, but the people and I do no click.

I rest my case.

I am in need of some advice. (also forgive me if I misspell something English is my second language)

Background: This summer I (m25) had a small fling with a girl (f25) who worked at the place I did, we started out a friends, but it developed into something more by the end of my working period (we spent a couple of nights together). And I might have fallen a little bit for her, but we mutually agreed that nothing more serious was gonna happen, because she currently out traveling and Busy finishing my degree. 

Now onto the place in which i need advice. She will sometimes DM me on instagram a little out the blue, either by sending a picture/video on DM or react to some stories I have posted. Now staying true to what we agreed upon this summer I am keeping my distance, but not talking to her is killing me. 

So can I text and ask if she wants to stay more in touch? or should I not?  Should i start by casually reacting to some of her next stories? and what does it mean she sometimes DMs me? Is it wrong to assume that might to keep up contact? 

what do you guys think? any advice is appreciated and thanks in advance.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1051572,public,self,Staying in Touch?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3bsyz/staying_in_touch/,all_ads,6,,,,
