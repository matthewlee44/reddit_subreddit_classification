I'm talking about my character. With most women I pursue, I end up telling them pretty soon on that I'm attracted to them. But almost always I end up I the friend zone. I just give off a brotherly aura or something. And I'm fine being friends with women. I actually prefer it to men, because I feel I can let my gaurd down more. But this fucking sucks when your wanting a relationship. 

I don't want to change who I am, because I like me. I don't want to be this whole macho guy, nor do I just want to show women I'm simply interested in sex (which is something my friend keeps saying I should do).

So their business model is to: (1) pay the top model men to stay there, which (2) lures in women who use for free, which (3) lures in average men who pay desperately to keep their business alive?!","I just watched a video on YouTube talking about how Tinder pays the absolute best looking and most desired men to stay on their app with free upgrades and special features. The comments had lots of guys confirming they had experienced this as well. They all said they had also been given free upgrades and special features to stay on the app.

This then clarifies the totality of Tinder's business model:

1) Pay male models, celebrities, and Hollywood looking men to stay on the app by awarding them all the bonuses and special features they can provide.

2) Use these men to lure in women, who will likely also not pay for anything, but rather use for free.

3) Use the women to lure in normal and average looking men, who will then have to pay just to be seen by the women or stand a chance of even a conversation - **this is the only source of Tinder's income**.

Is this not the most fucked up rundown? I always knew dating apps were fucked up. I didn't think it was anything so deliberately warped. I always thought ""women are the bait Tinder uses to make men pay."" But that's just one layer. There's an even bigger layer of baiting happening above that. 

The 6'+ white male models they are paying to use the app are the primary bait and the women are secondary bait. 

Then, only after that system is working and sustained, do they make any money from the desperate men who come after. I feel like my mind just got raped. I knew I was a chump ever paying them a cent.

We talked until we closed. After we finished we both said that it was nice meeting each other and that was that.

I’m a boy in middle school (14). theres guy I’m friends with and i might have a crush (also 14)on i don’t know if its because i haven’t experienced much romance in my life or a real crush ( i believe thats called a squish). I also can’t tell if he reciprocates or not. we also have a mutual friend who used to have a lithoromantic crush on me, and might still. I don’t want to make the wrong move and offend my interest, and I’m sure if our friend still has a crush, its going to get grizzly. 

Notes of maybe attraction: Usually comes up to me in hallways between classes and such. Seemingly tries to get my attention. Always says “Hi” like hes surprised, when i pay attention to him. Jokes around with “are you gay?” Jokes. And has started to prefer me over some friends.| Are these just normal things that friends do? 

How do i: tell if it’s reciprocated, and then first Warn the friend, and then flirt back.

‘Ok idk how to fully explain this so I’m going to give it my best shot - 

I (18F) have a best friend (18M) whom I really really love (platonic) but BUT but I (think?) I’m at a stage where I’d like to date someone even (mostly) if it’s casual and really we’re very compatible imo. I have had feelings for him in the past (it was a very short phase and I told him and we moved on and anyway that was too early in our relationship).

Last night he asked me while we were playing one of those talking card games - “if I asked you out right now, would you say yes?”. It was so out of the blue - but it’s not like I hadn’t thought about it before. The time I told him I had feelings for him, he didn’t want to do anything about it and then I examined my liking towards him and realised I wouldn’t really want to date him?  

Anyway, the point is, I said “No, because you’re a bro now and there’s no coming back from that” or something like that without missing a beat (????) and now I am reconsidering it; because although I’m not crushing on him currently, it’s definitely not hard to see myself with him. We’re one of each other’s closest friends right now and genuinely I spend sooo much time with him already. Plus I am slightly possessive over him and like honestly I would be upset (inwardly) if he was dating someone else rn and not in the jealous way but just the ‘best friend dating someone’ way? Idk how to explain and idk if this is a problem/toxic?

My reasoning is that we could just try it out and see how it goes, take it very very casually. Because I already am very attached to him and he is to me as well I think, and I genuinely think if we stop dating, it wouldn’t ruin our friendship simply because like clear cut whatever?

Please helpppp should I even ask him about this?’


————-

A few things I’d like to mention is - I think at some level, if not at an obvious one, I do have feelings for him that are not platonic. I wasn’t able to admit that to myself in yesterday’s post.

I talked to him about this last night andddd he said he wanted to try something like this out as well. And it wasn’t awkward or anything BUT idk what to do know like idk what I’m supposed to be like? Do I just let everything stay the same and not force anything?

I went on a date with a guy that went pretty well but I ghosted after it. I haven't been on the market for a relationship because I have been focusing on myself and school so this came kind of out of nowhere. We matched on a dating app months ago and randomly met up a little while ago. He is attractive, has a great job, and is super smart. He was very respectful the whole time and only hugged me which I am so not used to. I tend to avoid situations that could possibly hurt me so I stopped answering him. 

I can't stop thinking about it though! I feel like he is some dream man and that I don't deserve to be with him. I can't get over the fact that he is much smarter than me, went to a better school than I am, has his life together and is somehow still interested in spending time with me. I am spiraling down a tunnel of what-ifs before a second date. I also am feeling bad that I just didn't reply to him asking to see me again. I wonder if he thinks I just don't like him but I being honest with him would be embarrassing.

Whereas someone normal like me with a basic account living a humble yet fun life gets to know a man on multiple dates, grow fond of and care for their well-being, and yet that man just keeps clicking the like button on all these people who don’t even know they exist?

To be clear, I’m not asking “why isn’t he liking my posts as much” because that’s dumb, social media likes don’t mean anything in a relationship. What I am asking is why waste life energy physically clicking “like” on all this junk meant to make these people richer while completely ignoring the nice pretty lady in front of you?

About a year ago I met a girl in one of my college classes and there was an immediate connection. We just hit it off and everything seemed to be going well. We got lunch a couple times, talked frequently and all seemed perfect until I found out she was seeing someone. I had told her how I felt and this is when she told me she had a boyfriend.

Fast forward to present day. We’re still great friends and she is an amazing person overall. She’s kind, thoughtful and so caring towards me as a person. We talk frequently and get together from time to time. She knows I still like her and is very considerate of that. She doesn’t talk about her boyfriend around me. Obviously I try to remain content in my role and making her happy is all I want to do. I’ve kept myself open to other girls but I just haven’t hit it off with anyone yet. Obviously it’s hard seeing someone you’re crazy about almost daily and then seeing her with someone else. It’s not that I’m not rooting for her relationship to end. It’s also a bit heartbreaking.

I’m not a real religious person but certain things keep happening that haven’t before. I’ve never had it seem like someone is trying to tell me to keep her in my life. She’s someone I see a future with and maybe I sound crazy but it kinda feels like she’s the one. Should I step away for a while and create some distance between us?

26,qb2vv6,1634613907,I have made the decision to not interact with anyone who is in a relationship because I don’t like the emotions I feel when I do.,"I feel extreme sadness and constantly asking myself “why not me?”

I always hear about how women who are struggling with fertility issues should avoid being around pregnant women or ones with newborns and even told that it’s okay to miss baby showers and such or ignore pregnancy announcements. They are encouraged to just “no” to these things and not put themselves in situations where they may be exposed to triggers. Okay so why can’t the same logic be applied to a girl who’s been trying very hard to find someone she can have a meaningful relationship but just has had the worst luck possible but then looks around and sees she’s one of the very very very few who has this bad luck and everyone somehow found someone that works for them and makes sense in their life? 

I recently declined my cousin’s wedding invitation (who’s the same age as me) and used work as an excuse because I honestly don’t think I can hold it together. I’m happy she found her match but all I keep thinking is wtf why or how haven’t I?? My sister who’s 2 years younger has been in a relationship for four years and my parents are happily married too and I have stopped going to family things where I am the 5th wheel, like I’m just fucking over it. I want my person too! I deserve it! Honestly everybody does. 

Sure I’m probably isolating myself by avoiding everyone since everyone is coupled up, I don’t have any single friends or cousins, it’s just me. But honestly I prefer this to torturing myself in social settings and bringing myself to the point of crying even. I’m tired of feeling less than or less valuable because for whatever reason nobody wants me. Let me say that I don’t actually feel this way about myself but when I am around couples it triggers these thoughts for me. 

I do sometimes think about why I’m single and I take some accountability. I am very picky, I’m aware of this. But I’ve seen even some of my pickiest family members miraculously find their match and it’s amazing because it gives me hope but just hasn’t happened to me and like I said, I’m sad about it and getting impatient.

A lot of women seem to see good/nice guys as being people that use niceness in a divisive way. They use the sensibilities of women to get over on them.


Because of this types of man, women become indifferent to nice guys and go for the guys that show the most character. They go for the guys that ooze charisma and have the 'open book' type of personality. Women see them as being more genuine than a guy that is just nice.


My issues with that is that the face that a guy shows doesn't necessarily indicate his true character, especially when extremely charismatic guys can still be just as fake. Or they can put on charm to get closer to women.

37,qb3ox0,1634616869,"It's really a roll of luck, time, place, and effort.","I grew up as that ""hopeless romantic."" Super involved with school work and had little social activities with friends outside of school. Never dated during high school actually; I did have a date to the prom, wonderful night that ended with a hug and silence days after. I felt rather dejected from ""romance."" I yearned for reciprocation, but I became indulgent on the idea of being alone for good, not with resentment but with contentness. That void of contentness was poured with the countless interactions online on message boards and chatrooms. Some times such loose connections became temporary flings that eventually lost its lust when realizing I was trying to have 'relationships' with other lonely people whom shared similar feelings of despair. Late night chats weren't really out of love for each other, merely mutual pin cushions, stabbing each with our poor mental states. 

It's easy to trap yourself in your own world of sorrow. You read endless articles and watch video after video related to mental disorders, trying to find ways to figure out the faults and how to possibly fix or cope. No, this is not a ""mental disorders are not real"" kind of statement, but simply how someone like myself 'grew' into a poor state of mind without professional assessment while functioning in society. 

I had to remove myself from certain people and literal places to give myself time to process. The chaos from those that make your life miserable stifles positive growth. If you face some kind of toxicity, know that the longer you dwell with it, the longer it will take to start the healing process, even when you make the effort, the choice, to get out of dreadful headspaces. 

For those that struggle to find that special person, you find yourself in these subreddits, I'm just a little reminder that there's no magical spells or words of wisdom that will instantly conjour yourself into that ideal relationship you seek. It's simply a matter of time, luck, and the right place. For some, it's easier to find, for others, longer. When I finally took a seriously tough, psychological decision to move out of my parents place, unsure if it was the right move, it definitely took time to reflect and talk with others with more heart. Many nights sometimes left me laying on the wooden swing bench of the university I was attending, wondering what the hell was I doing? When I will find the happiness I want? 

Over time, I just let myself grow into my own person, let loose from the heavy influence that held my mental well-being behind. I pushed myself to interact with new people, meet them at various social functions. Even if such friends were temporary semester/class friends, I figured I would eventually meet good friends, or even someone worth dating. I simply had to learn how to be social despite it going against what I used to be; shackled by ones cold thoughts, sitting, laying, waiting. 

Despite never had dated early on when most did, it was simply one semester where I met my current Fianceé. I cannot really give advice on how to ""woo"" your special interest, as yes, there's the basic social game, but beyond that there is the nuance that pairs with their interests, goals, hobbies, etc. The tricky part is seeing how much these qualities line up between two people. Sometimes in can be apparent real quick, and other times it may take some time to really get to know the other. Luckily for me, she was my ride home from night classes. I did not have intentions of dating but simply making a friend. Our conversations ranged from humorous, personal, and everything in between. The more we spent together, the more I felt attracted to her. Three months later we were officially dating. 

Now, over three years later, I have been living that happiness. We both love exploring new places, trying new experiences, and also know how to have our separate hobbies while being supportive and encouraging of each other. We feel like teammates that we can always rely on. 


This was very long winded, I know. I mean for this text to hopefully reach to someone that wants and may need to hear beyond ""it will get better."" Because while it is a surface level platitude, it can feel like it's grossly dismissive of your unique struggles. For me, what helped the most, as I mentioned prior, was to first change your environment. Second, take advantage of your new found environment by going against the standard you held yourself at for so long. Thirdly, as frustrating as it sounds, let time and luck run with you as an active participant, not as a passive observant.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb3ox0/its_really_a_roll_of_luck_time_place_and_effort/

It's weird because the chats will go well and I'll meet a guy in person but then he doesn't ""feel a connection"" to me. 

I used to think it was bs, so I started waiting and telling guys I'm waiting before going past 1st base. Then it still happened where guys even chatting on the app with me will ghost me and I'm back to square one. 

It was the same on bumble and tinder, and it was annoying because at least on tinder I could tell myself it's because they're just out with another girl that puts out. If I had slept with them I would tell myself they just want to fuck as much as the can in one lifetime with as many girls as they can, it's about the thrill of the chase for them. But when I guy I haven't slept with just says there's no connection, it makes me think it's me after all. 

How do you mean, no connection? You seemed pretty connection when you were sucking on my neck earlier. And then after when you were rubbing your hands all over me, and then when you spent the next 3 days texting me nonstop. So what is it? You just found something better? The girl you really wanted finally texted you back? Or were you just faking it to get laid and then you felt bad you'd be wasting my time?

But then I had it happen to me where I was the one who didn't feel it. I've been talking to this girl on snap for about 3 weeks or so. I swiped on her because one of her pics on tinder was really cute but I was never really all that into her. We chatted for a bit, did a video call where I helped her with school, then the weeks started to go by. 

I just don't feel it for her. The more we talked the more I realized she isn't my type. I didn't think I had a type, but I'm just not into her personality. Maybe that's what the guys who say it to me feel. It just confuses me because I get showered with compliments from them about how good I look or how awesome I am, how sweet, how hardworking, whatever.

It's rough and it's discouraging. Idk what to do anymore. I don't think I'm ""trying too hard"" I just want to get to know someone that I'm attracted to, see where it leads, make sure we're on the same page with what we both want abd possibly start exploring bodies. I can't just hook up with people, I'm not into that.

Well, got over the hump of the first date and I think it went pretty well. We went to a fairly casual cafe/Chinese place (when I originally asked her out I said “I’d love to take you to get lunch or coffee” and we never really specified which one so I just went to a place where we could get either lol) and talked for a little over an hour with hardly any dull moments. Before we left I said that I’d really like to spend some more time with her and she said she would like that. 

I’m terrible with coming up with date plans, the first date is the easy one to come up with an idea, but second date is where I’m struggling (plus unfortunately I haven’t gotten to this point in like 5 years 😬). 

Anyone have any ideas? We’re both college students in tough majors, me engineering and her architecture, so we don’t have a ton of free time (the only reason why we ended our date today was because she had to get some homework done before a class she had in 45 minutes). So anything that could stay in a college budget and schedule would be good. 

The only idea I had was pumpkin carving but I wasn’t sure if that was too intimate for a second date and I’m not totally sure how I would even “pitch” that to her. Same deal with going to a pumpkin patch or something similar. But if y’all think I’m over thinking this let me know.

As such, my hours are completely different. It's literally the opposite of everyone else. On weekdays, I work half-days from late afternoon to night. My weekends function essentially like weekdays, except worse as I usually work from morning until night on both Saturdays and Sundays.

I can count on both my hands the number of times this year I've met people for purely social functions, so when it comes to dating... I feel like I'm going to end up as one of those people who will only start after retirement, and I can only hope that retirement comes early, or I'd be dating in my SIXTIES. Luckily, I've been working on that and I think I can get it down to my FORTIES, but it's never a sure thing. By that time, I'm probably going to be completely unwanted in the dating space.

Any ideas on how I can get out of this?

I should preface this by saying for multiple dates we were pretty romantically charged(making out and whatnot), we were pretty engaged except when he would text on his phone randomly which I didn’t think much of. After a while he started saying he loved me and I felt the same because we made a strong connection. I pop the question 2 times if he would want to start a relationship. He said both the first and second time he would have to think about it. But after the second time I asked I went to his car after we arrived at a food place and saw it there he had sent a shirtless picture in grindr.

I then just thought leaving then and there. When I told him what I saw he didn’t deny it and claimed it was for some fun and that he uses it to make connections. Now my expectations or what I think of them to be is when you start getting romantic or use the word “love” that carries the idea you’re exclusive and some heavy weight. Which I told him about and he brushed it off. After we got food I didn’t talk to Ed for 9 days until I reached out again and he asked why I wasn’t talking for a while. 

I made it clear I felt like I was a side piece and that I felt it was kinda of disrespectful that he was just sending pictures to other men while saying he loved me. He countered with saying he didn’t mean to offend me since he using love pretty loosely with a lot of people and that doesn’t mean we are dating. I told him that with that understanding we are in two different places and that we need to just be friends then.  He then says that’s fine and asks if we can still cuddle and kiss to which I said 
“Ed, I don’t hate you but I sure as hell do not want to get physical with you
I reserve that for people who want me and I don’t even cuddle with my friends”
Which I felt like he wasn’t even listening to me.

He became very apologetic, said he regrets his words, but can't change them now. The issue is, he kept saying how sorry he was and how terrible he felt until I said it's ok we all make mistakes. He then said, ""Most men would have left her, and I'm not like them"" which... seems like a pretty bad sign.

He also apologized for that. I'm not sure where to go from here. I feel like I trust him less, seeing I could potentially become the person he complains about to other women, and also... it just felt off. Wrong. 

Should I drop this and give him a second chance? He did apologize, and people can grow to regret their words or actions, but it was pretty instant.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qb569s/he_talks_badly_about_his_exs_is_this_a_red_flag/

I (24f) have been seeing a guy casually/fwb for a few months. We have sex and hang out at home and initially agreed that going out on dates and constantly calling/texting was not what we were wanting. I’ve recently been thinking more about wanting to be in a committed relationship where I can go on dates and consistently see and talk to someone. I can’t see myself building a relationship with the guy I’m seeing now since we started off casually just meeting to have a good time. I don’t have feelings for him like I have had with previous guys I’ve actually dated, but I am having fun when we’re together. His job and lifestyle also does not give him much time to give a girl he would be dating. 
I want to go out on dates and meet new guys with the potential of a committed relationship but I also don’t want to risk ending things with the guy I’m seeing now. I guess it stems from being afraid of ending up alone if nothing pans out. I would also feel bad to any new guy I would be meeting if I’m still seeing current guy.

76,qb7dtf,1634633307,My non-girlfriend had an open relationship while we dated half a year,"English is not my native language, an apology for my mistakes,

I need to air this out. I recently fought (M 26) and got away from my ""relationship"" with a girl (F 25) with whom I dated for almost half a year, the reason for the fight was because I asked about the status of our relationship for the third time. 

After a brief reconciliation, I found out that this girl has an open relationship with a boy who previously gave her money and things that she needed. Also she said that she didn't wanted to have a relationship with me because she didn't know if I ""was worth it"" to leave all that behind. I always told her that I didn't liked open relationships and asked her kindly to always be honest with me.

We practically behaved like boyfriends and she constantly told me that we were almost boyfriends, that she only had things to think about. Sometimes she even bring up the topic of moving in together and having children one day.

It bothers me very much that she did not tell me from the beginning that she had this other person so that I could choose whether to stay that half a year or go with someone who does want to have a serious monogamous relationship with me.

I know that I shouldn't expect anything from anyone and that no one owes me anything, but I just feel very annoyed that she didn't tell me her real status and that she expected me to fight that other guy to ""show"" her that I was worth it.

If you read all this, thank you. I know that I also make a lot of mistakes and that she doesn't owe me anything, I'm just venting. I will try to be better in the future.

I’ll be honest, the spark hasn’t ended well with others, otherwise I wouldn’t be in this predicament. So maybe it’s not something I should chase, based on past experiences.

M28 here and I’m okay socially but I fail
to notice a lot of things and overthink. Haven’t really dated or had a serious interest in relationships for a few years so I have a tendency to miss things.

Met someone F27 at a mutual friends party. I was hammering down drinks but we ended up talking for a while and she exchanged instagrams before leaving. Just a nice party conversation about who we know and who we are etc.

Met again the next week with mutual friends at a bar. She dmed if I was coming and gave me her number too ( I didn’t ask). During the group conversation our friends who are a couple talked about their relationship and she mentioned she was single and got out of a long term relationship about a year and a half ago. I was again too hammered to notice any body language or social ques but my friends seemed to notice she me was close to me. She dmed me and my friends to get home safe and we had a back and forth conversation about the night before for a day and I haven’t spoken to her since. 

Im interested but am I overthinking that she maybe interested? If so what do you think the next move is? The next time I’ll see her for sure is next month at another party. She does post on her Instagram so should I take the shot and slide in or wait till we have a chance to meet up again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qba6o4/am_i_overthinking_or_is_she_just_friendly/

94,qbacgd,1634646041,should i tell her?,"I'm in high school and i like my classmate, we've known each other almost for a year. I'm just afraid that she's going to reject me and if this happens everyone in the class is going to know, even teachers...so will get super embarrased. I was watching her all this time, hoping that she would show me some signs of liking me, but results were negligible. Except some moments like eye contact...
as i know from other sources she broke up with someone not long time ago and she is looking for relationship. What should i do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbacgd/should_i_tell_her/
95,qbaef7,1634646252,I'm beginning to worry my partner and I aren't sexually compatible.,"I've (26 M) been with my partner (23 AFAB) for a little over 5 months now. I'm honestly in love with this person. They're so caring, smart, capable. I adore everything about them, but our sex life is just... disappointing.

When we first started dating we'd be intimate every time we met, with a lot of experimenting, long foreplay, kinkplay, all the stuff I love in a relationship. I was so happy because normally I date people with a much lower drive than myself. 

As we've dated longer, we've both been put under a lot of personal and financial stress. Both of us were really fucked over by the virus financially, and now we're indebt graduate students working in a pub for less than living wage. We've also discovered that my partner likely has undiagnosed ADHD. These factors combined have ruined our sex life. We've gone from 2-3 times a week to 1-2 a month, with a two months where we weren't intimate at all (this was before we discovered the ADHD).

I've been trying my best to be patient and supportive for the last four months, but the quantity hasn't recovered and the quality has become very vanilla with me doing most of the work and always initiating. I always make sure they climax first, and do my damndest to slowly work up to initiating so it's never out of nowhere.

We've talked about it, and had many conversations on how the ADHD and the stress are affecting it, how we'll work together to make this area in our relationship work, but I'm really starting to worry that we're just not sexually compatible anymore. Maybe the first month was a fluke due to lockdowns and a new relationship.

I don't want to leave them, I love them dearly and I've never been with anyone like them. But I'm starting to feel more sexually frustrated in a relationship than I did single.

Any advice or anecdotes would be heavily appreciated.

Tl;dr Sex life is a bit shit due to stressful conditions and I'm not sure what to do or how much longer to hold out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbaef7/im_beginning_to_worry_my_partner_and_i_arent/

99,qbb9vs,1634649230,Why do men with no children get automatic hate for saying they prefer not to date single parents?,I mean seriously as long as they’re not disrespectful about it then it really just is a preference. Someone on my social media yesterday said that they prefer not to go for them because ultimately they would want the experience of having and raising their first child ever to be shared rather than being with someone who’s already experienced this all once before already. Personally I think that’s very reasonable but even still it seems like just the fact that a male would even voice that preference made certain women we all knew from school take it as an insult and get super mad.
