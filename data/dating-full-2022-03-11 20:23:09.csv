Before that I was in a tumultuous relationship with the mother of my son.

Anyway, I work in a very male-centric field and there are no ladies at work. I'm not good at approaching strangers in public and starting conversation as I can be kind of shy. So where do I go? I tried online dating and it seems the only conversation I get is what I'm talkin to a bot or scam artist.

So I've had plenty of matches and have been told that I am cute but, when I try to engage in actual conversation I get short or no response. I tried talking about their interest oh, I tried letting them talk about themselves. I tried to keep things light and I tend to try to make them laugh. I'm serious about finding a relationship but I understand that trying too hard can scare them away. Them being women.

 M37, I support myself, own my vehicle, pay my own bills, I have pretty typical taste for people my age I think. I like good food, good music, comedy, video games and scary movies. 


I literally just want to get some know someone, then meat for drinks or dinner and a movie or even breakfast and see where things go from there. I'm really struggling to click with people who are supposedly online to date.

I posted this a couple of weeks ago ( or maybe 3? ) on trueoffmychest, and I was downvoted to oblivion by everyone, and attacked. Not that it hurt me, but I hope this is a better sub to share this.

I live in France, my son is 22 and last October he moved to another city to go to University. His friend stepped up his game as soon as my son was out of the picture. Believe me, I feel something intense in my chest when I think about this whole situation.

He started off with some minor, small compliments. I didn't respond negatively to that. Actually, I encouraged him to open up more. We keep in touch through Telegram, or Kik. He does have my WhatsApp number, but if I talked to him on Whatsapp, he could easily show our conversations to my son. He would never do that, but I wouldn't want to put myself in a vulnerable position anyway, I want to go to bed and sleep peacefully at night. When I talk to him, I'm careful about what I say. I speak in a way that would make it hard for anyone not involved to identify me by just reading the conversations.

He genuinely seems to like me. It's not just the fact that he praises me,  it's the way he says those things, and his attitude about it. I updated my profile picture a couple of months ago, he said something along the lines of *'' you look like some Hollywood actress from the 70's or 80's. You're a rare beauty. ''* and sometimes when he looks at my pictures he goes like *'' use this one on social media. You'll get so many likes. ''* it's funny, but it's cute how he carefully looks at all my pictures and then chooses which one he likes the most. He also asked if he can save them. He would have saved them without my permission anyway, but again, it was cute.

I tried to test his level of interest, I told him to talk to girls his age, he said no, I told my coworker ( she looks decent ) to pretend to be available.. and he ignored her altogether.

He talks about my persona too, not just my looks, which is very important to me. I obviously like it when a man finds me attractive, but I want to be appreciated as a person as well.. I don't want to make it sound like he compliments me every minute of the day every day, but he says: *'' you have a degree, you have a career, you dress in a very classy way, you're well-spoken. Girls my age don't have all these qualities. . ''* and then, believe me, I'm not trying to use him and his words to compliment myself, I'm only reporting what the things he says.. *'' a beautiful mother like you is every guy's dream. I feel so lucky to be talking to you. ''* He jokingly calls me mum at times, lol

He's been hinting that he wants a relationship with me, not just sex and fun. He seems to have  romantic intents. He wanted to kiss me by the sea  at the sunset 

I want to make this clear: I'm not starved for male attention at all. It's just that I genuinely enjoy his company.

I don't really have an actual question, because I still don't know what my endgame is.

I'd feel like some random chick his age if I slept with him. This is also the reason I rejected his kiss. I wasn't expecting that attempt though and I didn't have much time to plan my reaction. I've been thinking about it and I think that a kiss should happen,  after talking to him for months. 

 I almost thought I wanted to tell my son and make him accept it, until I realised I don't want him to know anything about this. I didn't **truly** consider telling him, but I considered that option, and I realised that I still wouldn't him to know even if he was okay with it. I can't imagine saying *''I'm hanging out with him tonight, see you later.''* the mere thought of this makes me completely uncomfortable.. it's just not an option.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163313,public,self,I enjoy talking to my son's friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tc0p3g/i_enjoy_talking_to_my_sons_friend/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

I'm not the man who good things just happen for. 
I'm not the man who doesn't need to change everything to be loved.
I'm not the man who will ever be loved, no matter what I do

I'm not the man who gets to be loved. 
I'm not the man women pick for anything but being ""besties"" 
I'm not the man who'll get to experience intimacy. 
I'm not the man with a huge group of friends.

I'm the man who JUST wants to be held. 
I'm the man who JUST wants to be okay. 
I'm the man who just wants to die.

Now after living as a man for a while I can say that’s a bunch of shit. We’d all love nothing more if we could regularly open up about our feelings and continue on with our lives as normal. That kind of support sounds nice. But that’s just not how it works for men. Every time I’ve opened up about my feelings and difficult experiences with a woman has spelled the end of them seeing me as a romantic prospect. I won’t speculate on why. But that has never had a happy ending. And it’s not just my love life that it is forbidden for me to be honest about my emotions. It’s pretty much every part of my life. I’m supposed to just turn my emotions off. No one wants to hear about my sad story. A man’s sad story. A man complaining. It’s a good way to be shamed by anyone.

We didn’t speak for a couple years and then he hit me up during June 2021 and randomly asked how I was doing. We spoke briefly and he told me he was spending time in Hawaii over the summer for vacation, then we went our separate ways again and then he hit me up again in January of this year, just out of the blue. He asked how I was doing again and told him I was fine…blah blah and we went our separate ways again. February he hit me up another time asked me how I was again and the same conversation occurred before we said our goodbyes. About a week after that, he messaged me and was like, “Hey, I haven’t heard from you for awhile, are you okay?” And I responded with, “Yes…why do you ask? We haven’t really spoken for a long time.” Well he responds with, “I’ve been thinking and I kinda have old feelings for you, I’d like to start over and get to know each other if you don’t mind of course.” I didn’t have anything else to do, so I told him we can try to get know each other once more if he really wanted to do that and then see where it goes.

Things seemed to be going great, and I had a feeling the way this person acted was different from others I had been with in previous relations, in a good way. I really liked spending time with him, hanging out, having long conversations, going on adventures. I really enjoyed the time. But in February I decided to ask him if he was seeing other people, and he said NO. That kinda gave me the impression that this had the potential to go somewhere because I was also not seeing anyone else. I can see where I might've screwed up though, being too trusting too fast, going out of my way, baking for him, driving him to the airport before his trip, giving him a haircut. 
Fast forward to a few days ago, he got back from a trip to Vegas. I asked him the usual stuff, how was it? Did you have a good time? What did you eat over there? What all did you see? Questions of that sort. We talked on the phone some and he wanted me to come over. We didn't have sex or anything, just layed in the same bed. But something felt kinda off. 
I didn't want to look on his phone, but it was there and unlocked. I decided to look on it some in the morning time and I found a lot of different numbers and messages that were pretty sexual. He fucked someone in vegas, brought different people in his bed, etc. I was surprised, maybe because I wanted to believe him when he said NO. Why couldn't he just be honest? Why did he lie about that? If he was honest from the get go, yeah I wouldn't have stuck around. But why make me believe something that's not true? I suppose I'm just upset about it and in need of some advice. 
Later on the day of finding out, we decided to have a conversation about it. I asked if he had used protection, if it was going on since we first me up, if he got anything from fucking other people. I just wanted to understand why he lied, and he said he didn't want me to leave. But when I think about it, I was of no importance.

We went to an exhibition, got dinner, talked and walked around, a good date then he asked me back to his. I went to his, we drank, talked more then put on a movie, then we had sex (I will add that I was on my period so I wasn't exactly expecting p in v sex that night but he said he didn't care) it was good sex, more gentle and intimate than I thought it would be, nothing I'd experienced before, I also almost finished and that's never happened with another person before.

We kept messaging eachother, talking just as we did before, about a week and a bit after I asked if he wanted to meet again and he said no, he said he had no desire to, he said he had no interest in meeting more than once from the beginning though he said otherwise before. I thought he at least liked me a bit, maybe just as a friend but no. Why did he keep texting me like nothing was wrong? After a lot of ask why he didn't want to see me again or what was wrong with me and a string of bullshit answers he told me that because I had mentioned that I'd previously struggled with anxiety and depression (all said before the sex) that he didn't want me because of that. It's a big part of my life that I've had these issues which I have greatly improved on and overcome so many problems they have caused me, I'm now at the most stable and happiest I've ever thought I could be in my life so it's not an issue anymore, it even feels insignificant now that I've had these problems. I'm so unbelievably hurt that that's the reason why, I was wrong to think I could so easily talk to him, wrong that believing someone who can talk so openly about themselves will accept you if you do the same. He said he was past that part of his life where he dated people with depression. I feel used, I feel so stupid, I feel betrayed by him and myself, I shouldn't have let the sex get so intimate, there's things I only like to do with guys I really like and trust and I did those with him, I can't take that back.

I hate it. I always seem to fall for girls who really like me as a person, and love being around me, and who there is a little bit of a spark with. That initial spark usually grows and grows in my mind until I fall head over heels and they, for some reason, can’t reciprocate. One girl just plain didn’t feel the same, one girl is my best friend who has a long-term boyfriend, one girl I was extremely close with and I fell for her knowing she was bisexual, but who shortly after realised she had been a lesbian and just felt pressure to be into guys.

This isn’t a ‘I hate women and I always end up in the friendzone’ post, but more me asking why the fuck I always fall for people who I can’t be with. It’s a me problem for sure. The thing is usually when I initially fall it seems like it’s possible; that friend who has a boyfriend wasn’t dating him when I initially fell for her, that friend I have who is into women was initially very flirty with me and didn’t fully understand herself until later.

And when I fall, I fall hard. It feels amazing when it seems to be going well and heartbreaking when it doesn’t work out. The hardest was my best friend; getting over her took me months, I didn’t eat right for a good couple of weeks when we talked about it all and she didn’t feel the same. Every single woman I fall for is genuinely a great person who I always end up on good terms with; I’m at least friends with all of them and usually I think I fall for the connection which is clearly there, even if it doesn’t turn out to be a romantic one. It doesn’t happen too often, and life seems kind of dull and boring in between these crushes, but when it hits, it hits hard.

Right now I’m crushing on a girl from work and I can feel myself falling the same way. We have very similar interests, we laugh a lot with each other, we love being around each other, we’re very emotionally open about shit that’s happened in our lives, and it seemed like she was even pursuing me since she even suggested we grab drinks together a few times. We message quite a bit and when it’s going good I feel on top of the world. But I know it’s doomed. She’s hung up on another guy, she’s got a whole lot of other shit going on, and it seems like she’s really not ready to pursue anything romantic. Things are never awkward between us when we’re together, but she can go from messaging me asking if I want to grab a drink, to ignoring my reply when I set a date, to not answering me for days, right back to messaging again out of the blue and suggesting that drink again, usually after we’re on shift together and flirt all night and clearly have an amazing time being with each other. It’s like she feels good in the moment, wants to pursue it, only to get scared and back out when we don’t see each other for a bit.

It’s never simple. Every time I like someone it’s the same kind of ‘half interested’ thing going on and there’s always some reason it never develops. I’m 23 now, still a virgin, still never had a relationship, and I feel like I waste so much time hung up on people who can’t give it back. I’m fed up of liking people way more than they like me back. But when I meet someone I connect with, like really connect with, it feels too good and I become such a hopeless romantic. I think about them constantly, I try fix their problems for them, I’m always there for them emotionally,  we have a great time together and inevitably I end up heartbroken and alone until I’m ready to fall for someone new.

It’s just the same cycle. I genuinely wouldn’t take back meeting any of these women; they’ve all had massively positive impacts on my life. That first girl who just wasn’t interested, she was really kind to me when I felt most alone in school. That girl with a boyfriend is now my best friend. The friend that’s a lesbian now, she helped me be a lot more open and we really connected emotionally and were able to be honest with each other about a lot of things we usually aren’t. This girl right now is one of the kindest and most giving people I’ve met in my life, whereas I’ve been emotionally closed off and always scared to be vulnerable, and the fact she’s so much the polar opposite of that has opened me up quite a lot and I love that I can just be completely myself around her while having an amazing time and teasing the shit out each other.

But just once I wish it was easy and I met someone who was also crazy about me. I’ve definitely grown as a person with every new major ‘romance’ in my life, but it just a always seems so hard too and while I’ve learned from all of it, the lessons are always pretty painful for a while. I probably wouldn’t swap the good times and sense of connection for anything, and they add so much to my life, but I wish just once it would all work out. This current crush feels very much like a ‘right person, wrong time’ type deal; there’s pretty obviously a mutual attraction there, but she just isn’t in a place to pursue it and it makes her seriously flaky, probably because of her unresolved feelings for that other guy. It might not be dead yet, but I just know I’m probably gonna get hurt here again.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163328,public,self,I’m so fed up of falling for people only to find the feelings are unrequited over and over and over again,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tc4f5m/im_so_fed_up_of_falling_for_people_only_to_find/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

This mainly manifests in my own dating history. 

Right now I'm attracted to any other race except for my own race.  I grew up in a country that was prominently white and also moved to another country that is prominently white as well. Most of the time my family and I were often the only black people in town, however, I also lived in communities that had more black people in them. 

Growing up whenever there was another black guy people would ask me if I liked him or comment on how good I would look with a random black guy, or they would assume I would only date black guys. It still happens to this day and I think this caused me to have a dislike toward dating my own race because I felt pressured to. I think I have always liked who I liked regardless of race because I remember when I was younger I had crushes on black men however ever since there was this expectation from black and white people alike to date within my race, I had an aversion to the idea. Also within my own friend groups, I was usually the only black person and there was always a pattern of people dating each other except for me. 

The issue is that only black men really pursue me. The only guy I have been in a relationship with was white and before we dated he too assumed I was only into black guys, so he almost didn't pursue me until I made my interest really obvious. 

I always felt like guys from other races didn't like me, so my low self-esteem was compensated for whenever a guy from another race showed me the slightest bit of interest or attention. 

I tried so hard to get rid of these notions but I don't know how to fix my own internalized racism and it makes me feel so awful because it's really unfair of me to disregard someone as a potential partner because of their race.

So I’m guy who has just been dating this girl I met on tinder a few times now. First time we had lots of wine at a bar m, got along well and she stayed over at mine which was fun. I was curious about her so asked her on a second dated. The second time we spent the day walking around the city being spontaneous and it was also fun. O made an effort to plan a bit to make this a fun day. I’ve enjoyed getting to know her so far, but of course it’s early days so still questioning it all.

After that she was off to Spain for a week. Before then we discuss casually making dinner together at mine when she’s back. When she arrived back she asked when we should do it so I suggested Saturday night and it was arranged.

Friday comes and she asked me if I’m available  to have a quick drink as the sun is out here. So I meet her for an hour or two after work. We talk about a quite a few things, but also how she was thinking about going to this particular club tonight. But also a lot about tomorrow cooking dinner, what to make together, taking about having a lil party together after (last time we played records late and it was fun). We are basically planning a fun night together.

Then later tonight I get a message saying:

Would it be really rude/insensitive for me to go to [club name] tomorrow after our dinner tomorrow?

After her arranging the dinner date, us talking and planning it, chatting about playing records together and partying etc, she’s gone out with friends and they have said they are going to a club now on that night. So now she’s asking to leave after eating to do that instead of sticking around a bit. The message in itself felt a bit of turn off to me, it’s bizarre she questions me if this is maybe rude or insensitive. I don’t think myself I would ever rearrange a date that I cared about like that unless it was something really out of my control.

I’m in two minds right now. Call it all off cos the vibe just doesn’t feel right. Or tell her to go to that club and we can maybe have a dinner another night.

I saw that this girl is reacting with emojis hearts/funny faces to many messages that I sent to the group, but hell yeah this is cause I'm a funny guy in my opinion and I say something funny often, so this can't be a 100% sign that she likes me or something :)). The problem is that I don't know how to proceed because I don't know what I should say, I can talk with her in private and ask her out or something but it's a little bit strange and in case of a refusal it would be strange due to the fact that we see each other in the group quite often. Regarding the signs, as you will probably ask me, it is difficult for me to realize because she is extremely shy and sometimes she seems to be anxious when she talks to her girlfriends in the group, but this is in the real life. I really like her, but I don't know how to do it. It would have been easier for me to talk to someone I didn't know before and who I don't see often.

We went to the same high school but she was two years younger than me, and we were really only acquaintances because we were on an extracurricular team together at one point in time. Fast forward around 7 years and she reached out to me over instagram to say hi. We got talking and caught up over DM’s and had a really great conversation. She’s a grad student currently and said she was going to be back in our hometown the following week after I had asked her. She then said we should grab coffee and catch up. That turned into making plans to grab breakfast at a diner we both knew.

Overall, I thought it went great! We both laughed, told each other about what we each were up to as far as work was concerned. We talked about movies, music, hobbies. Everything seemed to gel in terms of having things in common. There never seemed to be a dull moment in our conversation. I had ordered a dessert and we shared it on a single plate as well. I paid (though she did offer), and walked her back to the bus stop. I asked her to text me back when she got home so I knew she got back safely, and she did.

A few hours later, I asked her when she’d be back in town next and she said she’s back at the end of every month and will also be back for the Easter Break. I then told her I’d love to take her out on a date!…to which she replied that she was flattered and I was a great friend…but she isn’t looking to date or be in a relationship anytime soon.

Okay…so clearly I feel as though I misread something along the line. Rejection “usually” doesn’t bother me…but something about this just felt different. For the first time, I really truly felt a connection with her. I did reply saying that I understood and I wished her all the best…but I feel like I want to reach out again. This is something I’ve never done before and I usually cut my losses.

I’m wondering if it is worth my time to text her near the end of this month saying something to the effect of: “Hey XXXXX. Hope things are going well up in XXXXX. I just wanted to throw this out there, I know you’re probably gonna be back in the XXXXX area here soon so if you’d like to hang out without the social construct that comes from being on a date, I’d definitely like to see ya. No pressure, let me know - I’ll be around.”

Obviously the end goal would be to get out of the friend zone but how likely is that? Certainly unlikely if I don’t try at all…but then again I never have. Has anyone ever done something similar and gotten positive results? My mentality going into this would to think of it more as a “fun strategic hangout”…but maybe it’s a lost cause? Again, usually I cut my losses but this time I feel different about the whole thing for some reason. I value my time and yet I also don’t want to let an amazing person like her go just like that.

I don’t what I’m looking to get out of this, but I just wanted to tell my story somewhere I suppose.

I (27M) recently went out with the most amazing girl I have ever met via an online dating app. She ticked every box I could possible think and more. She made the first moves, she is so beautiful, lives nearby and is completely nerdy like me. We went on 2 dates and we vibes together like no one I had every been with. Everything was going great until I noticed a shift in her texting behavior and my heart sank. I knew something changed and I was convinced I messed it all up. Well, a few days later, it turns out her ex wanted her back, he apologized for how things ended and she went back to him. She apologized to me, but I am absolutely devastated. It’s as if my life had so much more joy and meaning than I thought possible to feeling just empty inside. I just can’t help but shake the fact that I may have found the one and lost her, even though it was completely out of my control. I can’t even be mad at her, because I get it.

I literally was poking fun at people catching feelings/ falling in love too quickly like two weeks ago and then it happened to me. I’m just at an absolute loss. I’ve always compromised when dating people before knowing that no one was going to be everything I wanted, but she actually was and I just can’t go back to not having someone be fully compatible. I feel like she has ruined dating for me and I just don’t see a way forward. Like how do you meet someone so similar and then just move on. I don’t think I’ve ever felt love before and I don’t know if that’s what I feel.

I was already so jaded at online dating apps for how predatory they can be, but this just really sours me and is making questioning if I should just give up. I wish I could just forget that this last few weeks ever happened… I feel like I’ve had a hit of dating heroin and I can’t go back. Like what am I supposed to do? Go back to dating people who barely have anything in common with me just because I find them attractive? I’ve already worked on myself and I was happy, but after this it’s like the life was sapped out of me. My dating options are also slightly limited as I don’t live directly in a major city, but I do live in a decently populated area and I really don’t want to move or do long distance.

There was a attractive ELA teacher that I jokingly flirted with in the beginning of the year. 
Throughout the year we grew closer and she seemed to really care about me. Eventually she started to touch my ass and chest (and do the same to another student, although she was a female student)

I never made a move on her and I regret it to this day. Whenever I see cases of hot female teachers being arrested for sleeping with their male students I feel so envious and bitter that I didn't get to experience that. 

I messaged said middle school teacher on Facebook. 
I'll try to give a summary of how the conversations went. 

She said ""hi (my name) is that really you?""
I said yes and asked how she'd been. 
She said good and asked how old I was and if I graduated high-school.
I said yes and asked her about her life and how she's been doing at the new school she's been working at. I told her that I lost my job but I'm looking for a new job at petco because I like cute animals.
I tried flirting a bit like saying that I missed her and she was my favorite teacher.  
She asked me about my life as well and telling me about hers. 

However she kept texting less and less and the time between her texts kept increasing. 

She hasn't replied to my last message in a few days and I feel so disappointed. 

What did I do wrong?

After having another talking/dating phase fall through, it's been a rough day mentally. Dating is tough, and I haven't been the luckiest guy in the dating world lately. All my friends and loved ones are blessed to be with a romantic partner that is everything they both want and need from a relationship. I understand that no relationship is perfect and that each couple has their own set of obstacles to contend with, but at the end of the day, they are exceedingly happy in their relationships and have found their lifelong partners. I want so badly to have that. I understand comparison is the thief of joy, but it has become increasingly hard to be positive when you don't have that while others do.

From the time I was a boy I always wanted to find a woman that I am completely enamored with to marry and start a family with. I could say that I am content with remaining single for the rest of my life, but I would be lying to myself. I don't want to be single for the rest of my days. I want to have someone to love and be loved by. The ""love yourself"" advice is valid, and I do love myself and I love my friends, but as much as I value self-love and platonic love, they will never be an adequate substitute for the romantic love I have always wanted. Dating is hard and it seems like it's increasingly getting harder.

I will be attending a friend's wedding soon, and one of my closest family members recently got engaged. I don't begrudge them at all for their happiness. It's very heartwarming seeing them find the people they want to spend the rest of their lives with. It's still a bit hard, because I often worry I may not find that. Being alone during things like a global pandemic or a night at home after a hard day at work gets depressing. Coming home to an empty apartment while my loved ones have someone to wrap their arms around at night gets lonely. Part of me feels bad for even thinking about my loneliness when I see the happiness of those I am closest to.

Nobody owes me a relationship, and I truly hope everyone who has ever decided they don't want to pursue a relationship with me finds someone that fulfills their every need. It's just that always struggling to establish a relationship with someone I am into and being so easily disposed of does start to weigh on my emotional health.

My reasoning is that you want the date to be somewhere public, you want it to be short-ish with the option to extend, you want to meet at the venue so that neither person is relying on the other to get home, and coffee/a meal gives you the opportunity to sit face to face and talk (which is why a movie is quite possibly the worst first date) and this also gives you the first tiny bit of insight into how compatible you are: do you enjoy the same types of food?

Wanted to get females opinion on this one as asked friends and they are divided. 

Here is the back story because it may be important. 
I dated a girl last year for 7 months, it fizzled out, she reached out again start of this year and we have seen each other twice to walk our dogs. She gave off a few hints after the first time that she seemed interested (little bit of sexual flirting trough chat) but I wasn't sure. After the second time, i was interested in trying to start something again, so after a few days I asked her out.

She said she was sick, and getting ready to go on a trip in a few days. But I said to let me know when you get better and we can arrange something then to which she responded positively.

I sent her a text a few days later asking how she was and she replied (now looking back on this I think it may have come across as needy). Note: we had a few text exchanges but the last 3 times I had initiated, she responded, I replied again but got nothing back.

I  waited 2 weeks after that and hadn't heard anything from her so I messaged her  how she was and if she was free to get together in the weekend.

Her response was that she has been well and only got back 4 days ago from her trip, and is actually leaving to go overseas the next day to visit friends and family (she had told me about this but I didn't realise it was this soon.) in her message she said,
""I was thinking of you yesterday actually :)"", along with asking me how I've been and general chit chat.
I replied to her questions she asked me and I  told her to have a good trip and that well catch up once she gets back, she didn't respond to that one.
 
Would someone who knows I am interested in them (or women in general) say
""I was thinking of you yesterday actually :)"" as a passing comment, or as a way to bring me down gently after asking someone out twice? A family member thinks so.

Would it be best for me not to reach out again until she decides to, seeing as how I have already asked twice and initiated the last few times?

My Ex - Elle
Saudi Girl - Tara

I apologize in advance for the novel, I just felt this situation requires a lot of important context to get the full scope.

My [M31] girlfriend [F31], Jaime, and I have been dating for 5 months now, but she happens to be very uncomfortable with a friendship I have with another girl [F28], Tara. Admittedly, this other girl (Tara) and I did for the longest time have romantic feelings for one another, but the twist is that this girl lives in Saudi Arabia. I have never actually met her in person, but I’ve nurtured a very strong friendship with romantic feelings for about 8 years with her. No, we’ve never been in a Long Distance Relationship. When Jaime and I started dating concretely, I let Tara know that from now on her and I would remain platonic online friends only.

As I mentioned earlier, I’ve only ever been in one exclusive relationship in my entire life and it lasted about 5 or 6 months (back in 2014). I had one toxic, unstable and ‘open’ relationship with someone, Elle, for 4 years or so that I recently put an end to. The problem is that when I first started seeing Jaime, my current gf, I was also flirting with my ex Elle, and even had talks of sleeping together. When Jaime found out, she was naturally very upset by this. 

I don’t want to make excuses, and I owned up to it fully. This was ongoing until about 2 and a half months into Jaime and I meeting each other. Until that point, we had never talked about the nature of our relationship. But the more time I spent with Jaime, the more my interactions with my ex brought on guilt. So I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I interacted anyway. However, when final push came to shove, I decided to step away and I put an end to my toxic interactions with my Ex completely, so that I could focus on building a relationship with Jaime. This was about 3 months ago, give or take.

Unfortunately, the damage was already done and, already being someone with trust issues, I had just delivered a heavy blow to Jaime’s trust toward me.

Since then, I have had no further contact with my ex and have been absolutely more than happy building something with my girlfriend.

However, now her trust toward me is very very low, and she already has trust issues to begin with. Now enter this girl Tara whom I’ve been very close with for 8 years. It needs to be said that since I started dating Jaime seriously, I’ve put an end to all flirtations or romanticisms with this Saudi girl Tara as well. But we remain friends, and I’ll send her some funny memes from time to time, or we’ll discuss political or cultural situations in Saudi as we always have, only now minus the sexting and exchanging of nudes.

Tonight, Tara happened to ‘like’ one of my posts on Instagram and it made my girlfriend really uneasy. This is where I’m turning to you, Reddit. Because I need help knowing how to handle this.

I’m a libertarian at heart. I always have been. Flirtatious by nature, and very open. On a scale of ‘how jealous are you’ I’d probably rate at about a 3 out of 10. My girlfriend and I have asked her past lovers their dick measurements for shits and giggles. Err, umm… for ‘science’ 👀. She still receives the odd dick pic from one of her bum chums in the past on snapchat and she’ll show me and we’ll have a fun kinky giggle about it.

I’m really really lax when it comes to this stuff. In fact, this guy in question even rated higher than me on the ‘best sex ever’ list (yes, we also make funky lists of our past sexual experiences). You may find this all very unhealthy or unstable, but I want to insist that I’m okay with it, and my gf enjoys that side of my libertarian nature. We actually have a lot of fun making these lists and asking for dick measurements of the men she’s slept with.

I’ve done tremendous progress teaching myself how to be loyal, how to be exclusive, how to be in a relationship and be a good boyfriend. I’m still learning, and it isn’t perfect and I know that my libertarian nature coupled with my lack of experience in relationships makes a very volatile cocktail for someone who has trust issues to begin with, and I don’t know how to help that.

She doesn’t trust me because of the incident with my ex, she always had trust issues to begin with, and now she’s jealous of someone I’m very close to, but have ended all flirtations with and who lives on the other side of the world. I’ve tried my best to correct my behaviours and gain her trust back, but I also feel like I’m constantly walking on egg shells.

I want to say… I really really love my girlfriend. There’s a reason I’m trying so hard, and it’s because I feel she’s entirely worth it. I feel what her and I share is something special, and it’s something i’ve never experienced before. So please, I ask humbly, try to keep the ‘get out of this relationship dude’ advice as a last resort. I am not looking to break up with her.

TL;DR: my girlfriend doesn’t trust me and is jealous of a friend from another country I’ve had romantic feelings for for several years in the past, and I am too inexperienced in relationships to know how to handle it appropriately.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163356,public,self,Girlfriend Doesn’t Trust Me - What Do I Do?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tcaqbp/girlfriend_doesnt_trust_me_what_do_i_do/,no_ads,0,,,,,,
