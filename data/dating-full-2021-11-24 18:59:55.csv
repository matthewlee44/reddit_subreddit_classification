he initiated all of the romantic gestures and i never made him feel forced into a relationship or anything, i always made sure he was 100% comfortable and he never complained about anything. A couple days ago (a day or 2 into the relationship) he told me he loves me, the next day i confronted him about it saying that i felt he was taking it too fast and that everytime i would say i love u it seemed to make him uncomfortable, he said he had no issue with it and told me hes so happy that hes with me, even saying “no im not uncomfortable, im amazed, flabbergasted if u will”. ive given him multiple chances to tell me if there was something wrong so even if he was too scared to bring it up i always initiated conversations and stuff. 

he took my virginity and in his breakup message he said “and youre also like concerningly sexual” - ive always made sure everything was 100% consentual and we never did anything out of the ordinary. he ended up blocking my number right after he sent me that message and the only reason why he ended up unblocking me was because i called his mom extremely upset and i was very confused as to what just happened because it was so out of nowhere and out of character for him. 

i care about him a lot and im very confused, he said he felt forced to be in a relationship with me but i dont know how true that is because hes always initiated asking me out on dates and stuff. I used to have feelings for his best friend and i used to talk to him about his best friend, although i liked both of them, i acted on the one with his best friend first because i thought he kinda thought i was annoying and was uninterested. he told me he doesnt know why and that he just has an uncomfortable feeling and doesnt feel comfortable continuing this relationship with me. while we were arguing he brought up how he thinks i was using him as a rebound to get over his best friend but i really wasnt and i genuinely like him a lot, and he said he doesnt believe me, we went too fast and im pretty sure he thinks hes a rebound. 

we decided that were still gonna be friends but i realized i dont know if i want a friend like that. he said he lied about how he felt towards me so im very skeptical of everything and my feelings are very hurt.

We quickly became close and tried a relationship which unfortunately lasted few months because it was our first ever relationship and instead of trying things slowly we were okay to just end it peacefully with warm feelings.

Since then till present days we've remained super close with each other - we both share things that we would never share with someone else, friends even joke that we act like a couple when outside together.

Well, there is a little problem - since 2019 she is in strange relationship with her boyfriend. I won't go much into details but he has good job, lives alone, arrogant,selfish and bipolar. They had a lot of arguments and 3-4 breakups - 2 of them were super serious and she had thoughts of leaving him since she couldn't endure his childish attitude.

Anyway, since he is really good with manipulating ppl - she got back to him for the 4th time. Here is the thing that really gives me a little bit of hope - at a party few months ago, she've shared to her close female friend that during the healing period, she really enjoyed my ""grown"" personality and she would love to give me a second chance after she forget about that guy but as I've mentioned - that never happend.

Last month, while on a birthday party, we were out and we had a talk about some random crap and I've asked her if that was actually true - she confirmed that she had this on her mind. We go out once or twice a week - she even came to my apartment few days ago and we cooked together, played games and watched a movie - we always have an amazing and fun time together and I can easily say that I am 1000% sure that if she wasn't with that guy - she would've gave me a second chance already.

Also, I want to point out that she's not the type of person that will use me for attention or just to hang with someone while her bf isn't there for her - she literally proved many times that I can count on her and that she would help me for anything - no mather what.

Average looking, ok with hygiene &amp; clothes. I work remotely from home and have nice salary.

Have problems with getting girlfriends.

I  was pretty shy and silent from the childhood. And I had a mindset from  childhood that it would be hard to find a girl which will love me. I  don’t know why, but I had such a thing in the my mind.

In  the past I had two relationships which were lasting for half of a year  each. It was ok, but the first girl went to another country many years  ago, other was little manipulating what I became tired to tolerate.

But now I have insecurities which interfere me from meet with new girls.

The thing is I live with my mother. And I think it’s a turn off for girls.

I work and I can afford a rent in my town in theory (but yeah, it will be kinda expensive though).

But here comes another thing - my mother has strong anxious &amp; sometimes she has anxiety attacks.

She  was anxious as well when I was a child. I couldn’t hang out with  friends alone till \~12 yo and my mother was calling me every 20-30 mins  to know where I’m. I felt awful pretty often because of that.

It  became better when I grew up, but such things like messaging every  40-60 mins to know where I’m became a tradition (she has such anxious  about grandma and other family members too)

When pandemic began &amp; some events in her life happened, her anxiety got on a new level.

Due  to anxiety attacks it became hard to go outside for her (not every day,  but sometimes it happens). And she became more anxious about me as  well.

We went to many doctors  &amp; she takes medicines, but it makes only slighter better (like it’s  ok now to go outside for her, no such big attacks and etc).

Honestly speaking, hew anxiety creates inconveniences for me as well. She understands it but can’t do anything with here.

I work, earn money, I do much of house work &amp; self-service as well.

But nevertheless I’m afraid of being viewed as some «mama’s boy» in the eyes of girls.

Like,  living with mom and getting in touch via messenger every hour to make  sure everything is ok. I think it's a big turn off for everyone.

It makes me sad &amp; creates some kind of insecurity/complex.

I don’t know what to do with that.

I want to meet girls, go on dates, have &amp; give hugs, warm, kisses and etc.

But I think nobody will like &amp; understand me due this situation.

(known her for 10 years, she even has a kid that I, if ever given the option would treat as if he were my own son. Her baby-daddy wants nothing to do with either of them, so he basically forfeited his right to his kid, not to mention he left her for someone who was younger, and still a minor). This extends to anywhere I move, I spent most of my teens travelling across Canada, and still, no one was interested.  
I had a relationship once, for about 6 months (off/on-again relationship that stretched across 2 years.)   
She refused to pretty much exist (wouldn't clean, wouldn't do dishes, always demanded stuff e done for her so she never had to leave a chair in the middle of her living room, never wanted to leave the house, never wanted to go on dates. etc.)  I was 20 at the time. (she threw me under the bus, because I wanted to go to film school so I could get a job that made me enough money, we could've been happy. Instead, she literally jumped on our roommate at the time. And admittedly probably to this day, still slanders my name behind my back even though SHE cheated.) 

I never found anything before that point, so it took a long time to recover (meanwhile she has a new guy every couple of months). And yet, there's me, the healthy one of that relationship, and I've found nothing. I don't get approached, and when I even remotely show interest. They clam up and don't talk to me. I used to be told I'm a late bloomer and I'll get them when I'm older... exactly how old is older? I'm tired of being single.    
 I can strike up conversations just fine enough, talking has always been a strength of mine.   
Yet so far as I can tell from how I'm viewed. Im only an option if I'm the only one in the room.  
I'm not unattractive, at least I think.   
The women I grew up around I can kind of excuse, just cause they knew me while we were kids... but when you move 1310km from home and still no one is interested after 8 years living in a city where biases shouldn't come into play... it just doesn't make sense.   
Nor is any of this helped by the fact, that even me being the oldest of four children, all my siblings outpace me in pretty much any aspect of life (career, family, home... even if we came from a broken environment ourselves.

He also asked her if she can clean his apartment the same day she went home after surgery... this is absurd.**

   Well, everything remained like that until end of 2020 - he dumped her because he didn't feel happy being with her. She was literally destroyed mentally - 2 months she was dead inside, no will to live. Me and her friends were also really sad because of her but also happy that this jerk is out of her life. Well, sadly after the 2 months, he contacted her that he wants to talk with her - and with his manipulation skills he got her back.

   Two weeks ago, a friend of her shared a lot of things with me about them - she had thoughts of leaving him because of **the things I've said,** she've also shared that she really loves me as a person and that she had thoughts of talking with me about a second try since time isn't problem anymore (after she gets better after the last breakup).

   Few days ago, she asked me if she can visit me, cook together, see how's my cat, play video games together and driver her home if possible. I was literally dying from happiness. We had amazing 8 hours together. While cooking, I've asked her if the things her friend told me were true and she CONFIRMED them. Also we made a plan to go out together in the upcoming weekend.

I'm a guy in my late 30s, and I don't have anyone I trust to share this with. 

Its a been a long time since I've tried dating, and calling me rusty is like saying the Titantic just needs a little polish. I was also very overweight until this time last year. So I still think of myself as an ugly fat guy.

I made an okcupid account last week. And I've gotten some likes with it. In fact, a lot more than I expected, and from people that my mind says are WAY out of my league. But I've yet to a start a conversation with them. 

Every time I try, I get overwhelmed by feelings in equal parts excitement and doom. I can't believe they meant to swipe right on me, and once they actually look at my profile I'm sure they'll immediately change their mind. I don't know how I should start a conversation. I don't know how to continue it once I have. And most of all I'm awful at flirting. And if we did meet-up I'd would probably be a nervous wreck. Then I put down my phone because it's too much.

I even responded to someone I wasn't attracted to, had no common interests, and had a completely different energy as me. All in the hope it would clear some of the rust off. It felt nice to be pursued and exchange flirty texts. But I had trouble sleeping that night because I felt like I was leading him on. We've not exchanged texts again, and honestly I'm a little relieved.

""Suck it up buttercup"" comes to mind. I know I should just start, and see what happens. Then get better the next time if I screw it up.

 I wish I had someone to share this with. I've been building friendships over the past year, but its not easy. At my age people are pretty secure in who they have in their life, and are cautious about adding more.

Last week, I downloaded tinder and other dating apps again and met with a guy who super liked me in the first few hours.

Since our conversation was good and I was leaving to visit my family for a few days, we both agreed to meet at his place that night. I was not expecting it to go that great and it actually ended up going really well and we didn't go to sleep until 4am (no sex btw.) One thing I hate that I did was be very vulnerable with him in a short amount of time. Mind you, he is a counselor and I enjoy being asked deeper questions and conversing about deep topics with people so at the time I didn't mind. I think this made us very close to the point where he did say ""I like you multiple times in the night. Yes, I took that with a grain of salt but the feelings you feel when you like someone were there.

During the night he suggested I meet his friend and her boyfriend for ice cream the next day if I could and I agreed since I had no plans other than packing for my trip. I go and meet his friends and he also compliments me and tells me I look really cute on our ""date"" and we end up going back to his place to watch tv shows for the rest of the night. 

So the next day I leave and preparing to get ready for my flight and a few hours after I'm at my destination he texts me saying that ""he doesn't want a romantic relationship right now"" and that ""he wants to be friends because he enjoys my interpersonal style and our conversations"". Im putting quotations because that was verbatim. 

Out of serious curiosity and wanting to know why so I can understand some flaws I may need to work on, he tells me certain phrases I said like ""oh darn"" and when I joked with him that sometimes my voice sounds like a sexy child when I'm tired (which he laughed at hard and obviously I wasn't serious) he just couldn't get over it. He also mentioned that he was not physically attracted to me because I look like a childhood friend of his (we did have sex the second night I was there and he said he really enjoyed it). He really did want to still be friends and he also told me ""let's just act like we met on bumble bff"" . 


Obviously rejection in general is difficult, but I'm just confused because for the past few days I have known him it just seemed like none of these were issues and he complimented my looks pretty constantly. If anything I think it's fair to say I wished that he told me these things previously bc after such deep conversations it does affect me a bit. I'm not mad or angered by it but I guess because I just wasn't expecting it my ego is a bit bruised. Are my feelings valid? Am I overreacting?

The last time we talked was months ago. I confessed my feelings to my bestfriend and they weren't reciprocated. He called me the following day because he noticed I unfriended him on all my social media for space. He was really hurt. I told him I needed space for my feelings because and he was sort of opposed to it and came up with excuses like ""maybe its your abandonment issues?"" ect. I reassured him it wasn't and I needed space because it was hard being around him. He told me hes still my friend and he still cares about me and he'd be there for me whenever I was ready. I remember hearing him sniffling over the phone and just him asking me questions about how long I'd been feeling that way. I lied to him, I said it was only recent that my feelings developed but the truth was that I'd been struggling with my feelings on and off for the entirety of our friendship. I didn't want him to think he'd hurt me or was responsible for my choice to back away now.

The last thing he said to me on the phone was ""I love you"" and I took in a platonic expression because we've said it before to each other without romantic intentions like ""I love you dude"". I just said goodbye and hung-up. I couldn't say it back to him with him now knowing how I felt and I would've meant it romantically. 

I've tried to reach out to him since then. I invited him to an event I was hosting months later, and he said he was busy. Or I'd ask him if he wanted some of his stuff back and he said no. And we've seen each other in public but we both ignored one another. Now I can't help but wonder why he chose to say he loved me after I told him how I felt when he didn't feel the same way.

Everything had been going so well, I think falling in love takes time, much longer than 3 months. I think he got cold feet even though he was the one that wanted to be official. He put a lot of pressure on the situation and panicked and here we are. TBH, I kind of think he was catching serious feelings and that's what instigated it. His actions certainly suggested so and he was extremely emotional about the breakup although I wasn't at all.

I don't think getting cold feet means he's a bad guy or that we're poorly matched. Relationships are hard and his only other serious one was extremely abusive. I think it just triggered him and it's something we could work through once he's out of panic mode.

I still really like him and I'm very proud of how I handled the breakup. I was calm and rational about it and I have not contacted him since. This is the first time I've ever handled a breakup so well and did NC immediately. What I'm hoping will happen is that now that the pressure is off, he'll be able to really see our relationship clearly and realize that he didn't need to rush things so much. I'm trying to give him the space to do that. Or, if I never hear from him again, NC is the best way to get over someone.

Have you ever successfully used No Contact to get back with an ex? Especially if it was a similar cold feet situation? How long did it take?

I have actually used NC successfully for previous relationships, ones that were much messier than is and it's always worked. Even after I didn't do it immediately and acted pathetic/needy first.

Maybe 5 girls and 8 guys or something like that. This event was nearly 8 hours.

One girl motioned for me to sit by her. She looked right at me and laughed when I made a joke but that wasn't enough evidence for me. Then during a game she kept scooting closer to me until her face was like right next to mine. She kept explaining games I hadn't played to me. At one point her knee touches my knee. During this time she's talking to everyone else too, but she's looking at me probably 4-5x as often.

2 or 3 hours in she's doing this thing where she's touching my knee with her knee. And I'll occasionally readjust because I didn't want to seem like a creep and move like 1 cm away. Thinking that many people have trouble with spatial awareness. After 5 to 8 times of that she scoots closer and leaves her knee touching mine and just to troll and test the waters I just leave it there for like 30 min.

Then I'm freaking out because I'm like, there's no way someone could be so dense that they didn't realize their knee has been touching mine for 30 min. So either she doesn't like me and enjoys being extremely close to me, or she likes me.

So then for the next 1-2 hours I'm trying to figure out if I like her or not based on her personality but as far as I can tell nothing really changes. Her body language still seems focused on me and it still seems like she likes me but I'm still not sure.

Then we all talk for like 1.5 hours and we're all going around getting to know each other. And then for the rest of the night she tries to be on the complete opposite side of the room and pretends like it never happened.

I'm 90% confident that if I brought it up she would deny it either out of embarrassment (does like me but is too embarrassed to admit) or because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings (did like me but now doesn't).

I eventually tell my dude friends, who don't know these other people, about this story and they say that the girl might've been doing all those things on accident. I'm like how in the world would someone not know that they are doing all that. However, I have met people that will constantly run into people while walking or standing and not notice (and it baffles me because I'm so aware of personal space).

I was planning to take her with me to grab some food then go to an art museum downtown, then I dunno if things are going well ask if I could kiss her? Is that dumb? I figured I'd ask just to make sure she was okay with it right before instead of making her feel uncomfortable in case she's not into it. The most I've done was dance at a friendsgiving party with her, albeit we were both super drunk but it was pretty fun n we were both laughing n stuff.

We matched on an app, talked for a couple weeks, met up and hit if off pretty well and he wanted to be exclusively dating by the 2nd day (also the 2nd date). I asked to slow it down and said that I didn't want to date exclusively yet, he was fine with that but wasn't interested in seeing other people himself (I went on one date while we were talking and realized I didn't care to go on others). So fast forward two weeks, we've probably seen each other 5 times already. We sleep together, basically talked about exclusively seeing each other but I still felt a little insecure about him leaving me after we'd slept together (I know this is something I need to work on!). I go on an international trip the next day. His texting decreases and I'm not getting responses. I'm feeling used, hurt and just pissed. I end up hooking up with someone random - which is something I've never done before. I get back from my trip. He's texting me again. So I approach the topic of how I didn't hear from him. We exchange screenshots of our messages and turns out HE WAS TEXTING ME. I just wasn't receiving them because my SIM card was a piece of shit. So I tell him what happened and how I had felt. He was very surprised and needed time to think. A couple days later he says he was worried that he may feel uneasy about the fact that I slept with someone so quickly years down the road and he rather not take the chances - basically what I got from that was it bothered him so he wasn't ok with continuing to date. Which I completely understood so we stopped talking. Overall, super mature conversation.

Now fastfoward a couple months. I'm still thinking about him and miss him?? Should I reach out to reconnect or just let this be since he already said he wasn't ok with what happened?

I'm 25 years old, and by all rights shouldn't have trouble with this. I'm taller, handsome, have a full life otherwise with many friends and family I talk to regularly, I have a good job that gives me a good lifestyle, I have no end of interests and hobbies to talk about, ranging from the iconic to the incredibly obscure, have lived a life not wanting for adventures and varied experiences, I'm not an older virgin, having had sex many times, either in hookups or in short-lived relationships, while I was a bit socially awkward in my teenage years, I've put in a lot of effort to become incredibly charismatic, something that all my friends, family, coworkers, and acquaintances have noticed the change in, and before anyone wonders, I don't only go for women with model looks either, in fact I tend towards more ""unconventionally attractive"" types. 

By all rights, finding love should be childishly simple for someone like me, and yet, my life feels like an never-ending parade of rejection, shaming even, even when it doesn't make sense.  *Especially* when it doesn't make sense. I'll explain further. After my first real relationship broke up in the spring of 2019, I took to the internet, because above all, I'm paranoid, I didn't want to misread someone in person and make them uncomfortable. I get no end of matches, for all the reasons I mentioned prior, but getting past a first date, well, that's been nearly impossible, and the problem seems to be something about meeting in person. I'll elaborate.

After that first breakup, I had several single dates that didn't go anywhere, I didn't really talk to anyone after a date again, I only got rejected or ghosted, until the summer of 2020. Around then, I started getting second dates, but the common thread was that they were all virtual. I had a girlfriend briefly, but only through video calls, and I broke things off with her, then I'd gotten a few 2-3 date stretches that were only virtual dates or virtual calls before they ended. I went on another in-person date that felt awkward for other reasons, and so I thought nothing of it. I thought I had broken from whatever faux pas was keeping me from advancing in relationships. I was wrong. 

I'd found another relationship, that started virtual, and eventually became in person. The thing was, it had been three months of virtual dates before we met in person, and only two weeks after that first meeting, she broke things off with me, and while I didn't see it at the time, I wonder if going in person was the whole problem.

The impetus for all of this was just last week, I went on a date with a girl who seemed more interested in me than I was in her. Even while we were talking leading up to the date, she seemed so utterly and thoroughly sold on me specifically that she insisted that she wanted me at her place now, even though I couldn't go at that time, and even the day of the date, she actively invited me to start the date early because she just couldn't wait. I came in thinking that she thought we were already dating and that meeting in person was more of a formality than anything else. 

The date itself seemed to go perfectly. She was practically eating out of my hand, offering me a bit of her drink straight from the glass not 20 minutes in, and everything we talked about seemed to prove we were even more compatible. We changed location for dinner, and it only got better from there. It went without saying that we both wanted to meet up again, and actively made specific plans (time, date, location) together. We kissed as we left, and promised to text when each of us got home. By that point, I was coming around to seeing her as I was convinced she saw me. When I got home, I was met with a text from her, rejecting me. It wasn't an ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" either, it was a specific statement that, in spite of everything, she saw no future for us. Confused as well as crestfallen, I asked why. I simply couldn't understand how that could be said after everything that was said and done before and during the date. She never answered. 

Obviously, I didn't expect her to be ""the one"", but even then, I had every indication anyone would ever need (including some details I left out), both actions and words, that this was going *somewhere.* Despite, that, I still failed, and in the aftermath, I reviewed every person I'd dated in the past two and a half years, 22 in all, and not a single one besides my first girlfriend did I ever see in person twice, and I would have done a second date with all but two of them (those two wanted to see me again, but I didn't). The common thread to anyone I had a second date with was that it started virtual. I don't understand this either; I strive to be respectful and clever on dates. I'm sure to do something compelling, a museum, a quirky venue, anything to break up the monotony of ""dinner and a movie"", and with location changes and activities to bond over every time. I offer my hand and don't object if my date doesn't take it, I ask to kiss, and only if I really think my date genuinely does want to and the date itself went well and I think there's much chance of her wanting to see me again, and I make sure I know where the boundaries are and don't go near them. I genuinely don't know what's going on. It feels like I do every last detail 100% right, and despite that, it never goes right. I feel like I'm cursed, like I'm fated to never develop a lasting relationship ever, because even the strongest signs lead me back to square one. This last experience is just the straw that broke the camel's back, being rejected after being given every action and word anyone would ever need to be sure I wouldn't. 

I feel defeated now, hopeless, like there's nothing left. It feels like I'll never get better at this, that I'll never find someone because there's just something about me, specifically in person, that screams to almost every woman I've met in that way ""never see this person again"".

We're both in our late twenties and he says he's not in the right place for a relationship. I wasn't either when I met him, but I really like him now, so I would consider it. But even without that, I'm having a wonderful time with him and enjoying it. However, I'm pretty scarred from my last relationship and have some trust issues and suffer from anxiety and I'm anxious about him just meeting someone he likes better and disappearing.  
I've told him that and he said he ""wasn't looking for someone else"", which I took as a sort of reassurance that we are (at least at the moment) monogamous.

That was the background

He's not a type to go around liking girls' photos on social media and rarely does it, at least from what I've seen/heard.   
However, recently my best guy friend showed me some girl's profile because he always shows me girls he thinks are cute and he did it from my phone and lo and behold - there was the guy I'm seeing liking a lot of her pics. I'm not proud of this next part, but that sort of prompted me to check out some of the girl's profiles that he's following. And he doesn't like most girl's pictures. Basically, it's just my photos and photos of that one other girl.  
And since I'm insecure af and have body image issues and think she's much prettier than me (my best guy friend who was there when I had that moment of doubt and scrolling and is usually very objective - i.e. tells me when he thinks a girl is prettier than me, basically told me I'm crazy - like yeah she is beautiful, but not more than me), I'm worried that she's some kind of dreamgirl for him and he's only seeing me because I was interested and she wasn't. I basically constructed this whole narrative in my head where he thinks she's gorgeous and just thinks I'm cute and available.  


Now, writing it out, it sounds crazy, but I still need to ask - Should I be worried? Is liking pictures on social media a thing guys do without thinking or something they do in hopes a girl would notice them?  


I should probably mention that both she and I post kind of artistic self-portraits that have a similar vibe to them - so maybe it's just that, that he likes that kind of photos. It's not like he's liking half-naked mirror selfies of a bunch of girls, just photos that could pass off as art and are actually pretty good photography, regardless of how a girl (me and her) in them looks.   
Am I reading way too much into this and he just thinks ""hey, nice photo"" instead of ""I would totally dump Affectionate-Soup for this girl"" lol?  
Guys (and girls) of reddit, help lol.   

P.S. I would ask him, since I do ask about things that make me insecure. But while I did see that girl on accident, the rest of my checking if he likes other girls sounds (and probably is) kinda crazy, so I wouldn't like to admit to that.

Hope y'all are having a great time. I would appreciate some advice here.

About me - 31M, Location - Washington DC, USA. I am having a bit of a problem converting my first dates into second dates. I primarily use dating apps(Hinge, Bumble and Tinder) and usually have no problem getting matches and getting first dates(I always try to be closing in on a date and making plans since I am not good at chit chatting over phone). In the last month, I have had 3 dates where I really liked the other person and would've liked to see how things progressed further, however on each occasion, after the first date, I was told they wouldn't be interested in pursuing any further as they did not feel a romantic spark. I am actually grateful to them for letting me know that but I would like to work on myself and see if I can create that romantic connection.

I usually ask them out on a weekend brunch at a nice place and always show up on time. Should I be asking women out on dinner/drinks instead of weekend brunches as daytime activities might be seen as platonic? Should I turn the conversation more sexual? I always try to follow up brunch with a possible museum visit/mini-golf if things go well but usually my dates say they would prefer doing it next time and then a few days later when I text them asking about their schedule for a second date, I get rejected.

I have a decent job and work for one of the top technology companies. I take care of my body and physically I think I look fine since I have no problem getting matches. I am not yet frustrated with dating as I have a very high patience threshold in life, but I would like to improve my game. Any tips would be appreciated.

Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1129392,public,self,How to convert a first date to second(and possibly more) dates?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1j67x/how_to_convert_a_first_date_to_secondand_possibly/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Things were going really well, but he’s just been very inconsistent about texting me back lately. We texted for a full month before going on our first date, and he used to be really good about texting back within a few hours, but after a couple dates in, he became kind if inconsistent. It’s especially gotten bad over the past few days. 

For example, 2 days ago, we were mid-conversation making plans to see each other soon and possibly go on a day trip together (it was his idea). Out of nowhere, he stops responding. I finally reach out to him today (I was too scared to say anything earlier, I didn’t want to look desperate or like I was demanding his attention) only to be met with “Hey sorry I’ve been busy the last couple days.” No mention of the previous conversation or the possible plans we were making, just that he’s been busy. This isn’t the first time this has happened either. Normally, I would’ve given up and just let it die off by now, but there’s something different about it this time. When he is texting back, he’s so nice and adding onto the conversation, and our chemistry in real life is really great. He has told me that he really likes me and when we’re together he’s so kind and gentle with me, I don’t understand why he’s been like this.

Well I’m not a dummy and I know that if you send out a text (mine was “setting up a second date”) and you don’t hear back they are usually either dead or not into you. In my case it’s been a full 24 hours. 

The date was great we went out for drinks and a few shows close to each other. Had great conversations and a lot of mezcal, she invited me to her place after and we made out a bunch but she wanted to take it slow. I obliged and we talked a while, cuddled, made out and fell asleep with each other and all that. Morning was more cuddling and talking and kissing a little. We talked about hanging out more yadda yadda. 

She asks me to text her when I get to my car (left her place around 12p), and to take a picture of my cat when  get home blah blah. So I get home, send her my cat and we have a little chat about it. I take a nap, she texted me and we text a little while about how we feel regarding all we drank and whatnot. 

So..I don’t text her for 2 days and I do a follow up and tell her about a second date plan idea. It’s now been a full 24 hours and I haven’t heard from her. I know it must mean something was off that I’m not aware of but still…

Can’t tell if it’s my heart breaking or an ego bruise. Did like her, felt great around her, but it also caused me to introvert into what might be wrong with me and that whole dwindling spiral you can get yourself into.

I was sad and so upset I had lost all of my freedom.  I had moved back to the hell hole I thought I had escaped. It was a place that reeked of poverty and losers quite frankly. I only made it out the first time with my wits and scholarship. My loneliness and depression consumed me so I decided to swipe. Don’t hate me for swiping during a pandemic but I did. It’s how I met the most amazing man, the love of my life. I didn’t expect a relationship with him but it developed so quickly. We were both just so honest and vulnerable with each other. We celebrated every monthly anniversary, introduced each other to friends, talked about our future kids together. Not only we’re we perfect for each other sexually, but we also had each other’s back emotionally. Unfortunately we both knew our relationship would be cut short because before it even began we promised each other that after I graduated I would get my big girl job, get my own place, and become hella rich. Well I did…I got a great job offer, rented my first place in a major city, and started making bank. We tried to make it work but we both knew he would only hold me back. He only has a GED an no ambition. I fought hard to escape poverty and I felt like he would pull me back. We’re both still so in love with each other. Was it right to break up? I know that I’ll find other guys easily, but I’m afraid I’ll never connect with another on that level again.

I need your advice. Now I don’t have a ton of dating experience. I was in a relationship for several years and during the past 4 months, I have been on 4 first dates.

This recent man and I met 6 days ago after chatting on Tinder for a couple of days. The man is amazing and wants all the same things out of a relationship and life as me. But with my little dating experience, it’s hard to tell if he is going too fast or if he is genuine and what I am looking for.

First off, he deleted all his dating apps right after our first date, which was only coffee for an hour or two. Now I personally wasn’t going to delete them, but I also wasn’t going to message or date other men because I got a good impression from him. 

Second, he suggested going exclusive (AKA dating status) after 3 dates (also 3 days). I thought it was cute and agreed, but now wonder if that was too soon to determine that. 

He seems to also talk about our future a lot. We already know we want the same things in life, but given that it has only been 6 days since we met, not sure that it is appropriate to be talking about our future kids, staying over during the week, buying a house, etc.

I just deleted Bumble and tinder (again). I think the algorithm figured out I'm undesirable, like it always does, and moved me to the bottom of the queue quicker than usual. My self-esteem was never high to begin with, and now I'm ready to give up on it. If I could reprogram my brain to be asexual, honestly, I think I'd fucking do it. I'm angry at myself for caring so much.

What bugs me the most is that it seems like all the women who are *not* eligible think I'm attractive. My doctor told me I had good features when I was a teenager (she was an older caucasian lady). Just last week I was talking to an older woman, and later on when she was talking to my mother, and figured out I'm my mother's son, she said ""Wow, he's your son? He's so cute!"" A couple months back my sister told a friend of hers who just got married that I'm single, and asked her if she knew anybody that was looking to meet a guy. My sister's friend asked to see a picture of me, and upon seeing it, apparently said ""he's cute"" with a surprised voice, as if she was expecting me to be ugly, since I'm single. 

I've got more stories like those.

But it doesn't matter, because *nobody* wants me! No-fucking-body. Dating apps don't work for me, and I can count on one hand the number of times a woman has flirted with me in person. You know how at the beginning of Die Hard, Bruce Willis bumps into a hot air hostess, and she smiles at him sensually? THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME! Never. I would kill for that to happen. Just a goddamn smile would send my self esteem through the roof.

Could my pictures be that bad? Or am I just ugly, and people tell me (and my family members) that I'm attractive just to be nice? Because I swear the next time my sister or my mom or *anybody* who is not sexually interested in me tells me I'm attractive, I'm going to explode and scream that they're full of shit.

For all the ladies out there, what makes you like a guy's profile? Is it because I don't post any shirtless pictures? I could do that. Under the light, at a certain angle, I've got abs lol. But I tried that last time I downloaded Bumble and it didn't work. I guess I'm not toned enough to pull that off.

I don't know. Sorry for the long pity-infested post. I just wanted to vent. I know there are more important problems in the world than some guy going nowhere on dating apps. I just wish I was 21 again, an age where being single (and a virgin) wasn't so depressing.

In my experience, every girl that I become attracted to, it always seems that I'm the right guy but always at the wrong time. I find someone I find worth putting all my time into and being happy with, then there's always something that happens that they have to pull away, whether it be their own issues or someone's forcing their way into their life. Ill spend a month or two talking to them daily and enjoying every conversation, I'll start to get feelings for them and then they're gone. All I want is to have someone care and love me for me and to be able to give them the world. Yet I'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The initial plan was for an hour or so but ended up more like 8 hours. Two hours into that I did tell I was attracted to her to get it out of the way. She told me she wasn't really looking for anyone to be interested in her because she's recently just single but we hung out and talked for another 6 hours after. I thought I picked on physical cues she was interested, lots of nervous playing with her hair and frequent on and off direct eye contact. (At work she would seek me out, stand real close, more direct eye contact.)

So I waited a day and a half to try and contact again, wasn't sure what to say because I'm terrible at this. I sent a text that said I enjoyed hanging out and talking, and I was sorry for just throwing out I was attracted to her but it helped me be less nervous after and I hope it wasn't weird. Have not heard back since, but seems to be a pattern. 

It kind of feels like she's playing games, I know once when talking in a general sense she claimed she needs to be woo'd. 

Unsure how deal with this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1129446,public,self,"Not sure if a girl is playing games or not, or if I maybe did something wrong... or she has no interest.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r1m32c/not_sure_if_a_girl_is_playing_games_or_not_or_if/,no_ads,0.0,,,
