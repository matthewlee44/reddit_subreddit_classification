I’ve been struggling financially, she is very well aware of this. I’m a single dad, I pay all my own bills and I have a lot of medical bills lately because I’ve neglected my health over the years and am in the process of taking care of everything. Money is going to be tight for the foreseeable future. 

The woman I’m seeing lives with her mom and they split the bills I believe but she has no other expenses and she’s very frugal. She has a lot of money saved, tens of thousands. She says she doesn’t care what we do, as long as we spend time together but then she wants to go do all this stuff that costs more than I can afford. She wants me to drive, pay, buy her food, etc. a big part of my love language is gift giving so I would LOVE to be able to do all this stuff for her but I can’t, I barely paid rent this month.

A bit of backstory, I am a 20M that is studying medicine (English is not my language so any mistakes pls ignore😊) and I am having troubles in dealing with a girl.
I got rejeceted early this year and only this semestre I felt like my feelings were subsiding and my mental was growing strong which I was really happy about. BUT then as I started to push back she started to connect with my new group of friends which she was jealous at the time, and NOW she is a part of our social circle (And she basicly ditched her other group of friends). She even started to connect with my hometown friends (I am not from the place where I am currently studying) and she is arraging all kinds of plans for us to hang out like the begining of the year when we bassicly spent all time together and its driving me crazy beacause my feelings are starting to rise again and I am becoming really anxious because I dont know what to do now. It seems as if everyday that passes by she is more and more in my life and I cant really do anything about it. 
So I want to know what you guys would do in this situation!! Any help and advice is aprecciated, thanks for listening!!!😊",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pz7wt9/how_do_i_get_over_a_girl_that_is_in_my_circle_of/

I have never felt so self conscious about the number of men I have slept with as I have on this sub. My late husband and I had the conversation around the time we moved in together. At the time I had slept with about 25 other men, which he found remarkably low. He had slept with 60 odd men. Both of us had engaged in casual sex and, indeed, we started with casual sex ourselves. We both had exes who stopped counting somewhere in the 100s. 

As I said, i have a first date tonight. I doubt we will be discussing how many men either of us has slept with but, from conversation, we have both engaged in casual sex and are open to that while looking for a more long term situation. I doubt either of us cares - I prefer a lover who knows what he is doing and most men I know feel the same.

She luckily said she loved me back… but that we should take it as it comes. We hugged and agreed to take it as it comes, so that we wouldn’t be rushing into a relationship. We’ve only known each other for about 2 months, so I completely understood. It’s been about 2 weeks since that night in Berlin and I’ve had such a hard time knowing how to act around her. I feel so lost and confused because one night we’ll be really close and play fighting or cuddling, and I often feel like we’re about to kiss but we don’t. The next we’ll barely talk and she’ll be hanging out with her girl best friend all day, so it’s hard for me to approach her. It’s been kinda on and off like that for the past 2 weeks now. She’s also bisexual so I’m not sure if they’re just friends or maybe something more. I’ve seen them kiss each other on the cheek and cuddle but that might not mean anything.

Fast forward to our 4th date and it was awesome. Amazing sex and communication and excited to see each other in the future when leaving.

So last night she tells me that she slept with another dude a couple weeks ago and hooked up with one more at a bar also. And that she plans on seeing both of them soon. She knows that I may be feeling her more than she is feeling me at the moment and told me she still wants to hangout but we should cut back on the texting everyday since we’ve been literally texting everyday for a month and see each other in a couple weeks.

18,pz9w4w,1633100679,Be real with me - do I have any chance at all?,"I am the most unlikable person I know. I am a trans guy who is thinking of detransitioning because even though I am heavily dysphoric I really don't need anything else that will make it difficult for people to relate to or like me. I am bisexual which has been a huge issue in all of my relationships because everybody automatically thinks I'm some kind of cheater. I have a very severe scoliosis and you can tell right away there's something wrong with me. I have a pectus excavatum and severe asthma. I am unemployed but I live on my own and I am on disability and SSI. I do not own a car. I am also in my late twenties but I look like I am still in high school. Also short, five foot two and that alone got me rejected even when I was presenting as female because my partners would say they felt like they were dating a little kid. 

To this day because of my height and my young face the only people who show any interest in me at all are chasers and men who are in their fifties at least looking for someone fresh out of high school. 

Even pre-transition I was very masculine looking and I had a male body shape and no boobs. And I'm going to be bluntly honest - I have a terrible personality. I am shy, anxious, everything I like is thought of as being very lame (cats, anime, painting, crystals, horror movies, emo music, numetal,  camping, urban exploration and graffiti), and I'm very cynical. I also have ADHD and I am so forgetful people have mistaken my ADHD for a manic episode and decided to dump me because of the old don't stick your dick in crazy thing. They don't understand that this and the hyperactivity comes from ADHD and that my doctor refuses to medicate me for it. The only thing I can say that I have going for me is that I have a good face, I'm at healthy weight, apparently really good at sex, some people say I'm funny, and apparently I am at least somewhat intelligent.

Another issue is that I have an extremely high sex drive. I had this issue even before I was on testosterone. Most of my partners found it to be gross and off-putting. Someone who doesn't have a dick isn't supposed to have a super high sex drive you know? And no, I don't sleep around. My body count is only 3. I also have very masculine mannerisms, even before I transitioned and it put most people off. I'm competitive, I'm as strong as most cisgender men despite my height, people say that my voice sounds very condescending even though I don't intend for it two and I sound like a smug know-it-all, and people have an issue with how assertive and dominant I am. I actually am not confident at all but people say that I come off as being off-puttingly cocky and that it makes me come off as really abrasive. Not to mention I'm a huge extrovert and all of my exes had a major problem with that because the fact that I wanted to hang out with a couple of friends a couple of times a month caused major jealousy. Basically my entire personality needs replacing and I'm your stereotypical  ENTP-T minus the cheating and mindgames because I don't believe in that kind of garbage.

I have a type. I like clean, charismatic kinda pretty men in my age range who are respectful of me. I'm not into pushy hyper-aggressive macho types which are mostly all I can attract. I had one guy who was definitely my type who seemed to find me highly attractive me until recently and then he noticed my ADHD symptoms of anxiety, disorganization, hyperactivity and forgetfulness and now he thinks I'm bipolar and manic. 

He mistook my symptoms as a manic episode and since his ex was bipolar and it scared him off. He thinks I'm batshit crazy. As a matter of fact my stupid 80-hd alone has also gotten me turned down by the majority of people I have shown any interest in because they don't think I had ADHD or issues with hyperactivity, they think I'm just a complete lunatic. If I could convince my doctor to put me on something for it again, I think I would be doing a lot better. I used to be on Vyvanse and I was doing pretty good. But they took me off of it and I don't know why. And I can't convince them to put me on anything else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pz9w4w/be_real_with_me_do_i_have_any_chance_at_all/

21,pzagpc,1633102400,Recently became single from a long relationship. Dating no longer interests me. Should I be concerned?,"I (30M) was in a relationship for many years.  A few months ago it ended somewhat badly, which is reasonable to be expect in most cases I suppose. To my knowledge I am not stuck on my ex, nor am I bothered by how it went down. It was somewhat of a relief tbh. When we separated, my friends were psyched for me and encouraged myself to “put myself back out there” and/or “play the field”, etc. 

I’ve even had girls interested in me. When one of my female friends heard, she basically told me she was coming over and asked me what I wanted to drink even though I never indicated I wanted to drink at all lol. Since I’ve been single I’ve been wholly disinterested in dating and even sex. It just seems like a lot of work for something that’s not really worth it. I’ve just been focused on finishing college, advancing my career / socioeconomic standing, etc. 

I thought after a few months I would be excited or at least motivated to date but it’s been about 8 months now and I’m still not interested. I even met a girl who I thought is cute and cool. I considered getting to know her a bit better and I suppose I have on a platonic level. She’s shown signs of interest and I’ve definitely gotten signals that she at least wants my attention. But even with that I find myself not caring enough to do anything about it. 

I frequently run into these scenarios where attractive women show interest in me and I often leave them disappointed, frustrated, or even offended in some cases it seems. I do daydream about sex as much as any other person but it’s just so much easier to go home and take care of it myself. I don’t have to worry about anything other than what I want, and I don’t have to spend any more time / energy on it than I want to. 

At first I felt this was a really great thing because I’ve never been so focused, productive, and effective at managing things &amp; making progress. I just find myself waiting for someone to evoke my desire enough to pursue a “connection” as Reddit experts would likely call it. But I am starting to wonder if I should be concerned about being too comfortable with isolation and/or enjoy it too much. I am considering just forcing myself to actively date to prevent isolation from becoming too prevalent even though I really am loving being alone.

Dating apps are most likely the easiest thing to use since most people use it. However, I’m scared of using it from the creepy stories you’ll hear. Like people using it to prey upon others. 

I’m already kind of intimidated with dating a bit since I have seen and read stories of men who get violent when you say no. I met my first boyfriend in college and we were friends a first. This worked for me since i’m a demi sexual, but it’s hard to meet people like this now as a graduate in an office where you can count the number of staff in the company with your hands.

33,pzbxn3,1633106733,Does my bf [m26] have a horse 🐴 girl fetish? Help.,"I’ve been dating a guy for around a year now. We met on Tinder. It was my first and only Tinder date (so far!). I felt like I hit the lottery. 

For some context, we took things slowly. For the first time in my life we did not sleep together before being officially in a relationship. 

After a few months of dating, we friend request each other on Facebook. Come to find out we have a high number of mutual friends. 

Upon looking through this mutual friend list, I noticed that not only are most of them women but most of them are horse people. As in, people in the equine industry. 

I thought it was unusual that so many of them are fellow riders - people I know at least tangentially. 

Horses have quite literally saved my life and I started riding as a way to reconnect with my emotions. It is a safe place for me. 

When I have confronted him about how he knows so many horse girls, he said he met most on Tinder but did not end up on more than one or two dates but still remained friends. 

Fast forward to this week, my boyfriend tells me that he wants to head up to New York for the weekend to hike with a friend. He provided me with full disclosure that this was a woman he met on Tinder years ago and that this woman is also a horseback rider. He will sleep in her spare bedroom. 

I trust him not to cheat. That being said, there’s something that doesn’t quite sit right with me and feels a little gross knowing that I was just another horse girl from Tinder. 

He has never been in a relationship with these women (there’s at least 10 of them) except for me. 

I should mention that he himself is not a rider and has no involvement in the industry. 

Am I wrong for feeling fetishized? Is fetishized what I’m feeling? Should I be worried this is a pattern of unhealthy behavior in him? Am I overthinking this?

No, he’s not asked me to wear leather or smack him with a crop in bed. Lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzbxn3/does_my_bf_m26_have_a_horse_girl_fetish_help/

41,pzchdl,1633108302,"A year after going on a few dates with one of my best friends, here's where we're both at","This is really just a story and I'm not looking for advise or anything. I hope y'all enjoy!

Last summer, I (M,22) went on three dates with one of my good friends (F,24) over about two months (longish distance).

We had gone to college together and were in the same close friend group. She graduated two years before I did; last summer I was heading into my senior year. I had asked her out when I was a sophomore and she was a senior. She said no, and we were able to quickly move on and still be good friends. I was never going to ask her out again.

In March of last year (pretty much during the time the world was shutting down), we hadn't really talked for about 8 months. She randomly called me one night when I literally needed someone the most. I was in the middle of an emotional breakdown and felt like I had nobody to talk to about it. She was in a weird spot too, and we talked and processed stuff, and it was good. We stayed in touch more after that.

Two months later, I had small wedding to go to. I spontaneously asked her to go with me the night before because I wanted a friend. She came, and it was really great! We spent the whole day together, including an hour car ride and some time with friends after the wedding. It was great to see her; again, I had no other motives or intentions besides going to a wedding with a good friend.

Three days later, she called me and told me she was starting to catch feelings for me. We went on a date shortly after that. We lived 2 hours away from each other at the time, so it was probably about a week later. It was a great date! We ended up going on two more that summer. I really liked her and I thought we'd end up being together.

She called it off after the third date.

She said I did all the right things and didn't do anything wrong. She was definitely physically attracted to me and thought I was really great. She just didn't have any romantic feelings for me. That hurt. A lot. That was a few weeks before college started again. I was seriously so devastated. I couldn't really understand how all of that could be true and she just didn't feel anything for me. We would still text occasionally. She wasn't really hurt at all, so talking to me didn't bother her. I thought I could still talk and be friends with her, but eventually I just had to tell her that I couldn't be friends with her fro the time so I could heal and move on.

Then in January, I moved to the same city as her. I was finally in a good place to be able to be friends with her again, especially because we still had many of the same friends in the same city. I texted her and said I wanted to be friends again. She was more than happy to be friends again.

She was single at the time, and now she's dating a fantastic guy, and I couldn't be happier. We've been able to hang with friends together and have serious conversations about things (like people we're interested in dating, etc.). I'm truly grateful for her friendship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzchdl/a_year_after_going_on_a_few_dates_with_one_of_my/

For example I’ll be walking with my friend and the same for him but then I turn around and he turns around to look at me too, and today I was sitting diagonal from him so I could see him in the corner of my eye and he was talking to his friend and both started looking at me??? it’s been happening since the moment we laid eyes on each other. He smiles at me etc and has strong eye contact. Like this isn’t even in a narcissistic way I promise I just don’t know how to explain it properly. Anyways here’s the problem:

We have a mutual couple of friends and let’s call them Annie and Debbie. So Annie and him are quite close and I feel like he likes Annie. She calls after him a lot and he talks to her and he always seeks out Debbie. He knows I’m friends with Annie and Debbie because he talks to us when we’re all together but when he sees me alone he just stares not approaching me. He and Annie would look good together she’s way prettier and funnier than me. He added me on social media but hasn’t popped up. HE IS A YEAR YOUNGER!!! Which I’ve never dealt with before, I’m quite submissive so I tend to gravitate to older guys.

I picked up my food and let the other employees know what’s going on and they said he comes by almost every night. By the time I left, they were standing outside the restaurant and she yelled at him one last time before walking in.

They don’t need protection, we live in a developed  country with police, army and national guard. 


I believe that’s why the divorce rate are so high and are initiated majorly by women, they get nothing by being married to men, they already have the money, the relationships ( friends, lovers…), the attention being cared of even without being attached to someone.

57,pzebsj,1633113766,To all those who are insecure about their penis size. Don’t be :),"

I know lot of you are insecure about your penis so I’m gonna give some light on why you shouldn’t be insecure. And I’m talking about all sizes cuz I’ve met some dudes with the biggest. One of them was huge and he told me he wished he was bigger and I didn’t really understand why cuz if it was it would’ve probably went up my cervix. I think a big problem about sex is pornography and our sex education. Please don’t compare yourself to men in porn :( that’ll just make everything worse. Also don’t let the women who suck shame you get you down sex is so much more than the size of you’re penis and to the ladies who have dick shamed men SHAME ON YOU YOU ARE WHATS WRONG WITH SOCIETY.


Want to know something? Most of us can’t orgasm from PIV alone.

I’ve been with guys with small, average, and huge and wanna know what? When it comes to being with the bigger dudes they think that massive shlong is all they need to bring to the party and at the end of the day your cervix will hate you. Being huge can be a curse. I’ve seen the outline of a dudes boner and I became very VERY afraid and got the hell out of there.

Im gonna talk about the big guys first. I know you must be proud of you’re member down there and good for you if you are but you can really hurt us if you are not careful and just because you’re big doesn’t mean you’re talented in bed. Make sure you do lots of foreplay on us first so we can get as wet as possible. There are many sex positions and I think for big guys doggystyle is one of the best IF YOU ARE CAREFUL, AND USE LOTS OF LUBE. Missionary is a great position but not with my legs on you’re shoulders I’ll hold them myself. Also reverse cowgirl is good because I have more control to how much dick goes in me. Also big dicks are harder to give blowjobs it’s not always fun and if I give you a bj I expect you to reciprocate and eat me out fair is fair.

Now I’m gonna address the little peeners. When it comes to smaller guys I have a bit of weight advice for ya. You may think you have a small dick but if you’ve got some pounds on ya those lbs in the pelvic area might be hiding some extra inches and if you lose weight you might see those inches I’ve known some guys who have lost weight and I noticed that their dick was bigger than it was before. With a smaller dick try putting a pillow under her ass when you are doing missionary because you can give her that full feeling this has worked for me plenty of times and it feels great. But before you put that dick in her please please please do lots of foreplay as it makes us really want you and beg for you. Now every girl is different but I love it when my neck gets sucked, kissing all around my breasts, pinching my nipples, rubbing circles around my nipples, kissing all around my belly, rubbing softly down the side of my thighs, kissing and sucking my thighs, I love being eaten out and fingered you gotta grove the clit lots of attention. Whoever you are with ask her what feels good to the clit and listen. Communication goes a long way :) also cowgirl is a great position. EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT.

And now for the average dudes :D
If you are average then you are literally most men. Small and large are the minority. I’m going to be honest I believe I have had the best sex with guys who are average. So please don’t be ashamed that you are average and never EVER compare yourself (this goes for small guys as well) to a massive dick remember what I said at the top. For average the scissor position is great look it up and learn how to do it. For this size doggystyle is amazing because it’s not to big and not to small and if she has a big butt spread her cheeks for more insertion or have her do it. Cowgirl and reverse cowgirl are a great positions for this size. Oh and btw if you want to do anal bigger really isn’t better for that average and smaller is better in that area.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzebsj/to_all_those_who_are_insecure_about_their_penis/

68,pzf3r6,1633116040,I just don't understand what went wrong /:,"I was at the mall with two of my friends when I bumped into this girl I had a crush on in high school. She was standing in a book store with 2 of her friends. This girl has always stood out in a crowd to me, she has literally the perfect physique and genes and is a perfect 10. I talked to her a bit in HS but it didn't really go anywhere but I saw my opportunity and worked up the courage to approach her. She was standing in the Psych section with her friends holding a copy of some Abnormal Psych book, seemingly skimming through. As I walked through the aisle she was in, Belinda Carlisle's ""I feel free"" began playing through the store speakers. I was immediately very viscerally shocked at how beautiful she still was. It was intimidating. She was wearing a chemise dress in double-faced wool by Calvin Klein. One of her friends noticed me approaching and made eye-contact with me. She was wearing a wool knit dress and jacket with silk faille bonding by Geoffrey Beene, the other friend is wearing a symmetrical skirt of pleated tulle and an embroidered velvet bustier by, I think, Christian Lacroix plus high-heeled shoes by Sidonie Larizzi. She looked as beautiful as another time I ran into her while out on the town when she had worn a black strapless sequined gown under a wool crepe tailored jacket by Bill Blass. Her friend smiled at me and nudged my crush, who then looked up at me and smiled politely. I matched her smile but didn't over exert myself so as to not seem too interested. 
""I've heard that that books sources aren't too credible."", I started. Her eyes scanned over my torso, seeming to observe and appreciate my apparel. I was wearing double-breasted wool and silk sport coat, button-fly wool and silk-trousers with inverted pleats by Mario Valentino, a cotton shirt by Gitman Brothers, a polka-dot silk tie by Bill Blass and leather shoes from Brooks Brothers.
""Well, I'm really only looking to cite some of the literature this author referenced...""
As she continues speaking, her voice trails off into a distant, unintelligible warbling as I begin to worry in my head about my appearance; Is my hair slicked back correctly? Is the tension in my suspenders optimal? Did the wax-polish finish on my horn-rimmed glasses reflect ideally in the stores lighting? As my internal dialogue berates itself, she continues speaking then abruptly stops; apparently she had asked me a question. 
""Yes, well that's really, very quite nice."" I responded blindly. 
""... What?"" She retorts, seeming to confide in me that she didn't understand my response. I have a tendency to be a bit too esoteric in social settings and courting beautiful women is not an exemption; an unfortunate by-product of my vigorous intellect.
I allow the silence to linger on for a burning micro-second, letting the non-conversation stir in its own nothing so the stagnation process feels all the more intense. I'm quite honestly very enthralled by the vacuous nature of her half-hearted response; I can feel the rejection coming soon and become aroused yet mystified. Another few micro-seconds crawl by when I finally decide to quell her social hunger with a response, ""I'm in touch with humanity..."" 
I can basically telepathically feel her own pulse revolting away at itself, thundering around inside her veins. She's probably in love with me at this point but is not happy about it. She begins to drone on again about some forgettable details about the book and some paper she's working on, so I distract myself momentarily by thinking about what my friends are wearing at the moment. My friend McDermott is wearing a woven-linen suit with pleated trousers, a button-down cotton and linen shirt by Basile, a silk tie by Joseph Abboud and ostrich loafers from Susan Bennis Warren Edwards, which is moderately tasteful. My other friend, Van Patten is wearing a double-breasted navy blue blazer with mock-tortoiseshell buttons, a prewashed wrinkled-cotton striped dress shirt with red accent stitching, a red, white and blue fireworks-print silk tie by Hugo Boss and plum washed-wool trousers with a quadruple-pleated front and slashed pockets by Lazo. I find myself unable to concentrate on my internal monologue because the monotone wall of noise escaping her mouth is acutely satisfying and entrancing; I think I am in love. Apparently, as I was covertly enjoying her speech cadence, she had said goodbye and began to walk away. I hardly noticed as I spotted a hot, blonde hardbody approaching from my Eastern flank. She was wearing a bicolored suit of wool and grain with passementerie trim by Myrone de Premonville and velvet ankle boots. Her face is identical to the girl I had just courted so I permit her my attention for a moment. As she passes from my right to my left, the gait in her step seems to stutter for a microcosm of a second; she is possibly flirting with me. Our gazes meet as she passes, not even smiling but I know she's attracted to me. As she leaves, I can't help but wonder what could have gone wrong with the other girl. Fearing that she may have possibly not have been into me, my pain becomes constant and sharp. There is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzf3r6/i_just_dont_understand_what_went_wrong/

76,pzfqvy,1633118029,Wow... I got stood up.,"I (35f) met (30m) on a dating app last weekend. We immediately hit it off conversation-wise. A lot of things in common, great flirty rapport, etc. I asked if he had social media (ya know..to verify he was real) he said no he hates social media, which is not a red flag for me at all. Fast forward a few hours and we moved to text. Nonstop. Like real, deep conversation all night. I eventually wanted to move to a phone call but he didn't seem to want to but rather text me persistently.. Lil strange. After a week of texting, I suggested we meet up. He was love-bombing me nonstop for the past few days. Telling me he feels so close to me like we've known each other for years...can see himself dating me for real yada yada.

So I suggested a drink last night and he said he was down. He gets off work late so I said if he wanted to raincheck I was totally fine with it. He said no he really wants to meet up and I was off today so I didn't mind the time. He doesn't confirm with me a time to meet up all evening and I asked him when I should start getting ready. You know....because I want to have enough time to do hair and makeup and look cute and all. Nothing. An hour passes by after he got off work and he finally says he's going to hop in the shower. I then proceed to text him again, let me know when you leave your house because that should be enough time for me to do the finishing touches and meet him. Nothing again.

At this point, I'm just waiting around in limbo wondering what the hell is going on. Finally, he says I'm driving I should be at the bar in 20 mins. Around the 20 min mark, I call him. NO ANSWER. I am getting super anxious at this point and annoyed as hell. 40 mins later I call again...nothing. I text him that I will just go to bed and forget it.

He then proceeds to text me 15 minutes later.... ""I'm here."" Stupidly and semi guilty (eye roll) I start driving toward the bar. When I get there he doesn't answer my text or call after I text ""I'm here now too."" He says he thought I was going to bail on him so he called a friend to meet him up at the bar.... ???

I said okay well I'm outside, where are you. (since we never met in person before) NOTHING. Silence. Then he asks me if I have a charger. I reply, ""no."" At this point, I just park and start walking in. I don't see anyone in the bar that remotely resembles the pics I've seen of him and he's nowhere to be found. Call again......NOTHING.

I at this point am LIVID and embarrassed as hell. I really thought we had a strong connection over the last few days and was not sure wtf happened last night. I sent a f\*\*\* off text and that I was pissed and riding back home and he still hasn't responded to me. I am DONE with online dating. This happened to me after I took a LONG hiatus from dating too. Which is the super upsetting part.

NO, I will never speak to this kid again...but what the hell was that? It was a complete 180 from the guy I was talking to all week. The same guy who opened up to me about his family problems....etc. I thought I vetted him well enough. (i.e. tons of voice texts on Imessage, candid photos..)

I have some childhood friends who are brothers. We usually catch up every several months via video call and stay in touch through social media. We were video chatting a few days ago and one of them had to log off. His brother stayed on to chat with me for an additional 2.5 hrs. We have a lot in common... We're both in design careers and have some other overlapping values/interests. Last year, I happened to apply for graduate school in his city but didn't go because I couldn't afford the tuition. Meanwhile, I had always known that he hated his city and wanted to leave, so when he finally got a new job with the opportunity to work remotely indefinitely, I was happy for him. 

He's planning on moving soon to try out a new city since he can work anywhere. At one point in our conversation, he said that he hadn't dated anyone in the last few years because he had been laser focused on leaving the city for good and didn't want to have a reason to stay.  However, he said that if I had come to his city for graduate school he wouldn't have minded staying there a bit longer and would have taken me out. Which idk if in this context he's just saying, ""yeah, I'd show you the city!"". Before we logged off, he asked if I would come visit him before he moves away.   


Ummm yeah so anyway... I'm confused. Is this him just being super friendly? We don't actually talk THAT often so I was surprised to hear him say stuff like this.

I used to be in a relationship for 3 years (we are no longer together, but that’s a story for another time!!) and I find that I am definitely a lover girl. I love the intimacy, the trust, the security, everything about it, I just love love! 😂 

But these days it almost feels like the single life is being forced upon us ladies and I don’t like it. It’s completely fine for some of us to want to be single and date and to focus on other aspects of life, but for some of us that’s not the case. I’m kinda tired of having the whole “stay single and love your self/love yourself and then maybe someone will come around” shoved down my throat everytime I scroll through social media. Like yea that’s cool and all but what does that have anything to do with me wanting a man!? 😂

I also kinda feel like it’s being more and more normalized to just be alone and to be like “f-ck men”. I just don’t agree because listen…. This lonely life is not for the weak!! This is the loneliest I’ve ever been. I have absolutely 0 friends, no boo, I’m not even actively dating right now lol but that doesn’t mean I’m not deserving of a healthy loving relationship and a set of great friends.

92,pzh5dm,1633122378,Advice on my situation?,"To start off this relationship is supposed to be casual, or at least that’s what we both said. So this girl I hooked up with like 2 years ago, matched with me again after I got on tinder again, we hooked up and I couldn’t cum but I thought it was fine. Before we met up the conversations were really fluid and had fast responses typically, after we met up she did say that she would like to see me again. But the energy has changed since we met up, I’m still pursuing and trying to meet up. But I feel like she doesn’t want to. She did get a new job, and has started school, so maybe she is just really overwhelmed. Here’s a link to the past week or so, and I just feel like she’s giving me fuck off signs, am I looking too far into it?

She usually liked to banter and talk shit but now not so much.

As men always have a tendency to have to defend ourselves majority of our life that’s all we had to do to show that we are strong but when we have a good woman come along we keep the same actions and required tendencies in life to keep a strong 

But then not understand that she might not be trying to harm or attack us but she might not understand that she’s hitting triggerpoints so it’s up to us to let her know what is good and what is wrong to do so we can treat her how she needs to be treated as a good woman 

And women must understand that a man is very hard to open up once he opens up that’s him showing love and respect because a man that never opens up In a long committed relationship is a man that does not feel safe and respected",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzhcnx/let_me_know_what_you_think/
97,pzhm5n,1633123847,How rigid are your preferences or deal breakers?,"The people I know seem way more willing to compromise than the responses I have seen here. 


Many women might say they don’t want to date a guy shorter than 6’ but if they meet an attractive 5’9 dude in person they vibe with? Totally fine. And if the guy is 5’5 but is exceptionally accomplished in his field and/or has a high net worth? Height no problem!  


Many guys say they are all about 50/50 and cheap casual first dates. However when they match with a totally stunning woman they treat it as a once in a lifetime chance and would desperately pull out all the stops to impress her. Fancy restaurants, gifts and of course they insisted on paying. I have even seen guys who claimed to be child free for many years suddenly changing their minds if they think the single mother woman in question is worth it (extremely beautiful, successful, great personality, widow or no drama with ex etc). 


And of course people sometimes do fall in love with someone who is totally not their type. 


Personally I’m into very fit women and only swipe right for that. However If I end up meeting an overweight woman with a cute face in person (originally). If she makes me laugh harder than never before, is also ambitious and successful, and she’s interested in trying to lead a more healthy lifestyle I’m not going to rule her out. 



I also prefer women who are educated and very accomplished in their careers, and again might swipe left on apps. However it I meet a woman in person and hear about how she’s so passionate about doing work for an important cause I might be swayed too.
