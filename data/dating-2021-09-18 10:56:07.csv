1,pqp9mn,1631981472,"Asked a girl out for lunch, she said that she's busy but asked if I was free later. What do I do?","Hey, I've never had a girlfriend before and nor have I ever been on a date, so I'll give a little backstory. (It's a long post, sorry about that :D) 

I'm a student and I met a girl at one of the orientation events last month and we hit it off. We exchanged numbers and starting texting each other and used to text fairly regularly. However, most of the times I had to initiate the texts, but she used to respond with detailed responses. This was the first sort of red mark ,as I've seen in other posts that if she does not initiate texts that means that she may not be interested in me. Anyway, we use to text each other like this for the past month.

Finally last week I decided that for the first time in my life I was going to ask out a girl. So I texted her and asked if she was free this weekend, and whether she'd like to go for lunch. She replied that it sounded like a good plan and that she'll let me know. So yesterday I texted her again to confirm if she's free and she replied that she won't be able to make it this weekend. I replied that its okay, no worries. She replied with a sorry and asked if I am free one of the weekdays. She said that she usually has lunch on the campus and asked if I would like to meet her then. 

What does this mean? Does she not want to go out on like a date with me and just wants to meet as a friend? Sorry but as all of this is new to me I'm not sure what this means. I would love to hear your inputs on this.

P.S. I haven't met her again after we saw each other for the first time, it's only been via texts after that. Also, if I text her again to ask if she's free on that weekday next week, would that seem desperate?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqp9mn/asked_a_girl_out_for_lunch_she_said_that_shes/
2,pqpgeo,1631982100,I thought I found a date but I think he just wants to play tennis.,"Yesterday I (28F) was in Timpson to get my key cut. The way the guy (29M) behind the counter looked at me, I thought he was checking me out and i thought oh he's good-looking. 

As he was cutting my key, we were talking for ages and (I thought) we were flirting. I've been single for five months, our interaction was the first time I felt flirty and felt (what I thought was) strong sexual chemistry with someone. We talked about where we grew up (in the same area), where our families are from (the same country), where we live (nearby), our hobbies, etc.

He said he loves tennis. I said I've just started tennis lessons. He said we should play sometime. In my mind, because I thought we were flirting, I thought this was a gateway topic for a date.

We carried on (what I thought was) flirting, the sexual chemistry getting stronger. Then I asked if he was single and asked to swap numbers. He seemed pretty happy about it. We left it in good spirits.

Last night we were messaging. The conversation was flowing. I was so happy cos I've been struggling with online dating so I thought yes I've finally found someone! I mentioned that I have a tennis lesson in the morning and he said, ""Let me know when you want a 1 on 1!""

I thought a tennis match is a really weird first date.

I told him when I'm free this weekend and he said he's busy all weekend but he'll give me a shout when he's free.

No effort in arranging a date does not seem keen at all. Is this because he thinks he's found a tennis partner rather than a date?

At this point I was getting frustrated and confused, thinking what the fuck is going on here? So I left the ball in his court, told him exactly when I'm free next week and told him to let me know when he's available.

His reply? ""You will have plenty of time to perfect your game.""

I don't think he ever wanted a date. I think there's been a huge misunderstanding and that he just wanted someone to play tennis with in his spare time.

I mean, I did want a tennis partner to practice with anyway, but this isn't what I thought I signed up for.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqpgeo/i_thought_i_found_a_date_but_i_think_he_just/

Is she cheating or is there a lack of communication at play?","So I met this girl through a friend group and while we didn't immediately click there (we're both quite introverted), she left me space to proceed and ask her out. So I did. Our first 2 ""dates"" were basically going hiking with our dogs under the guise of our dogs socialising, though we spent quite some time socialising ourselves too. I really enjoyed spending time with her, but we kept it pretty casual and friendly. No much flirting here. Then at some points she started talking to me more often, but still quite casually (like asking about my dog who recently got sick as an excuse to talk to me, or wishing me luck on my upcoming exams) and I took the chance to ask her out on a real date. She accepted, we went to see a movie, after which we sat on the beach and talked til dawn. That's where we both confessed to each other that we like each other and from that moment on, we were full on making out and cuddling. 
Our conversation kept flowing nicely, so far everything has been great, but I didn't really feel like asking her to be exclusive yet- I'm scared it could be perceived as rushing things, or being desperate/needy. We've only been going out for a month or so. 
Today I went with my friends out and met a mutual friend who was surprised to hear who I was dating (I told him she was my gf), because apparently, another guy considers her his gf. From what I figured, they've been dating before we went on our first date. He's currently out of town so she hasn't seen him for some time (ie she hasn't seen him from the time we went on our 2nd doggy date and to this day, he's still out of town) and I have no idea where exactly do they stand. Did they have an exclusivity talk? Is she cheating on him with me? Or is she trying to date both of us at once?

* 1st girl from FB group - an average Bulgarian girl looking for fellow Bulgarian man abroad. Talked about how her mom wants her to marry soon (lol), a typical office worker complaining about her job.
* 2nd from Fb - slightly nutty Bulgarian Sandra Bullock-lookalike that seemed to be on ADs or something. All went well until she realized I'm *younger* than her.
* 3rd &amp; the only one from Tinder - a blonde American gym addict that lived in Vienna and was looking for a quicky, realized irl I'm too skinny for her, acted too bossy and that was it. If I could turn back time I'd have not shown at all!
* 4th Slovak brunette with blue eyes (from Fb) - everything went fine but she was talking about her Ex Mexican bf all the time. It seemed like I attracted only gym addicted women looking for beefed up meatheads or bored 9-to-5 multinational office workers so I decided to stop dating.

That blonde American was the only date from Tinder I've ever landed. I also dated some other girls but they just became good friends, all from Fb.

(there’s been instances where she’s been like I want him to help me when I help other girls with random stuff ) … 

greeting me, asking questions and offering food sometimes… and I sort of dismiss her Idk why i always play hard to get at first or what

We started the course at the same time (January) and in the mean time we became friends and talk to each other during the days we have class but almost never talked during weekdays or whenever we aren't in the classroom.

She is a very interesting,  intelligent and pretty girl and I really want to make a move but I'm quite nervous and shy to ask her out (I already got her number since we are in the same Telegram group).

Second semester started about 3 weeks ago and this new teacher elects a class representative every week. He picks a number from 1 to 27 (the number of students in this classroom, by alphabetical order) and this person has to bring something interesting about Korea (a curiosity, a dish, sweet or a gift) in the next class (and also greet the teacher and the other students before the class begin) after that the teacher will ask the current representative to elect the next, by choosing a number.

I am the next representative and I thought about giving a gift to her (a small Korean calligraphy practice book) but not directly. I already know mine and her number, and I would  tell the teacher to give the book to the next representative that I would have to pick.

I just wanna build a fun and engaging situation to talk with her like, you know, ask a few days later if she likes the book and whatnot, and eventually ask her out but I don't know if this is too obvious or awkward.

It was Saturday so it wasn't crowded (it also made my approach easier). Anyway, I stumbled upon this talkative (she was talking to her phone) cute-looking girl and I decided to approach her when she hangs up. In the meantime, I build some courage to do it and after a few minutes, she hung up so I decided to approach her in a moderate speed and I said “Hi, how are you ?” 

G: “I’m fine. What do you need ?”

Me: “I just wanted to say I that you look cute and would like to get to know you?” 

G: “You know, you are disturbing me, right? ” (she had this slight disgusted face) 

Me: (she was preparing to leave) “No, I’m sorry I didn't mean to disturb you, I was only trying to get to know you. “

G: “Do you always harass women that you don't know like that? “

Me: “I didn't mean to harass or disturb you. I’m sorry. “

Then she picked up her bag and left without saying anything. I don't know if my approach was flawed since I barely approach women, but I didn't think it would label me as a creep. Se could only say “no, thanks” and I’d say that’s ok and move on. But no, she decided to go ballistic. Thank god it wasn't crowded. Otherwise, It would be a lot more embarrassing.

So she asked if I wanted to kiss her and of course I did, we ended up kissing outside the venue and she took me to a seclude spot where things got a little intimate (something I feel a little guilty for, we we too drunk, I feel like I should've insisted on ""no"" when she offered), and then she had to go... But she did give me her number while we were talking, and I really want to get to know her better while much less inebriated (though I fear that's the only reason she was interested)...


So, do I text her, ask if her hangover is as bad as mine? She seemed to like my self-deprecating so thinking of saying something along the lines of ""been spending my day trying to find a hang-over cure while doing the cliché thing of panicking if it's too soon to text!"".

I spent a lot of time with this, basically as much as I could. Tinder, badoo, language groups, mutual friends, I did everything. In this period I managed to date 18 girls, but the results are terrible.

I had sex with 1 of them that I was seeing for about 3 weeks, and there was another another one that we liked each other a bit but she came to the conclusion that not enough, which I dated for something like 1 month. Everything else was just waste of time.

At this point, there is no other way to loot at it, but I'm desperate, and I feel like this is impossible to achieve. All the energy and time that I put in this was worth nothing, as the girls keep just rejecting me. I don't live with my parents and I am in very good shape (although I'm short, but this is impossible to change).

I know being desperate decreases the chances even further. But how else am I supposed to feel? Once you have learned that you don't have a girlfriend because girls don't like you, rather than because you are not trying, what can you do? This is not how it works with my friends, either they don't want girlfriends or are not trying, or try and find one in something like 3 months, or even do nothing and they appear. I did nothing for 28 years and the result is the same as doing everything I can.

When the morning of the date came she said she couldn't find anyone to watch her kid and asked to reschedule. I of course said I understand and agreed to reschedule.

After that she's been all but ghosting me and I'm afraid I missed some signal and am now looking desperate and annoying. Neither of us had said anything for like 3 days after agreeing to reschedule and I sent a joke and she responded and apologized and said that she's been super latey. I said something like ""If you're ever less busy let me know and we can work something out"" and she said she would. 

That was almost a week ago now that we last said anything and my plan was, initially, to just not say anything until she hits me up first but now I'm wondering if thats the best move.

31,pqr7l3,1631987919,how to get a second chance,"I met a girl at an event. We spent around 20 hours in total just talking to each other over three days. First on a 7-hour trip back to her city where I had some business planned before we met - we all had other plans for that trip, instead, we just melted in our talk... then over two separate meetings, she offered/agreed to show me around. Before the time of my departure home to a different country (it's all happening in Europe), we met for the last time. 

I told her about my feelings, but she said we ""don't know each other for long enough"", it would be ""difficult with"" me - I'm indeed very much dedicated to a thing I'm doing, but so does she, we are in the similar sphere - and did not agree to kiss when I offered or to any commitment in the future. I offered her that I stay in the city for a while and we can spend more time together but she did not express interest. I invited her to come to my town, but she just said nothing.

At the same time, she said she ""very much like me"" and ""it is much fun"" with me. During our last meeting, she offered to show me more of the city, initiated walking for 2 hours back to her house in the end, just hugging and disappearing from the doorway.

She is crazy, but me too, and I would very much like to be with her.

After a week, we are just texting each other, but she does not want to have a video chat, does not want to discuss my possible visit to her city. I'd go to her city just right now, but I feel it all might be fruitless - then I ask myself why to go if I just meet another doorway?

I met G outside the bar and we started chatting as we walked inside to get drinks, me thinking it was going well so far. We grabbed a table, sat, and talked for maybe...8 minutes tops. Admittedly, our conversation wasn't incredibly fluid at the beginning, but I figured that it's just because a lot of people take time to warm up to each other. At a certain point, she cuts me off in conversation with this short monologue:

""Listen, MrBenjaminDanklin. I'm doing this new thing where I try to prioritize myself and not care about anyone else, and I gotta tell you, I've been talking to you for 10 minutes, and I know I am not the girl for you. I have some friends at the bar that I'd rather be hanging out with, so that's what I'm gonna do.""

*That is a direct quote*

She picked up her half-full drink and disappeared into the crowd, just like that. I looked down at my half-empty drink, stirred it for a moment, got sad, then downed it and headed out. Full time spent together, probably 12 minutes.

Am I supposed to be grateful that she was so upfront with me? Should I be like ""YAS QUEEN I LOVE YOUR CONFIDENCE""?!  I know that first impressions matter a lot, but I always give first dates at *least* 40 minutes of my time so we can attempt to find a connection. I didn't sign up for speed dating.

Matched this guy on tinder, we’ve been speaking constantly for a few days before casually meeting up for a drink.

I believe physically I'm totally his type, photos are pretty recent and clear, height disclosed, few innocent sex jokes from both of us during chat, both openly expressing mutual interest. Clearly a match in my eyes.

Neither of us had Friday night plans so I asked him out for a drink to which he agreed and we went to a pub where we had one drink followed by a walk in the park. Conversation was fluid and we seemed to click.

Asked him if he wanted to come back to mine and hang out, but he said he was pretty tired and wanted to go home (it wasn’t even midnight). He kept saying how lovely I was and he had a good time, thanked me for going out with him. We said goodbye at the train station with a hug, not a kiss ( I'm not so big on PDA plus I wasn't sure whether he was keen).

I know this is frowned upon in the dating scene, but I sent him a message to get home safe and he replied we should 100% do this again and that he just needed someone to chat with and hang that night cos he’d been feeling pretty lonely, since he’s only been in town for a few weeks.

Just so confused as how to read all this.

I have a pretty tragic dating history, most of the times never get past 1 or two dates or one night stands, never had a boyfriend. I’m a fairly good looking guy, not a fitness model but take care of my body more than most people I believe I’m just nice, and maybe that is off putting to most people, but I just can’t seem to change or work around that, or maybe there's something else happening.

Sorry in advance for my writing skills  and the length (English is not my first language)
 
She left her boyfriend definitely 5 months ago (Saying that it was just ~fling~) and I have been talking to her for about 2 (We we’re following each other on Instagram then her sister followed me and I actually discovered for the first “real” time her profile).

At campus she asked to be placed next-doors to me even if we have never seen each other in person.

When she started talking about “friendship” I sort out “shot her down” on that term and then she said she was deeply saddened, then she had hopes I would become her friend and grow to understand her more etc…. That she was excited for the incoming new year 

After sort of clearing the misunderstanding she said a classic list of “nice” things:
You are very attractive but not only your looks
But also your personality - intelligence - charm
That she finds me very kind and complimentary
That she is very lucky to have met me 

I splurted out something like so is there a reciprocate feeling?
She replied saying that se has a great affection for me 

On term of looks I consider myself a little over average she on the other hand really looks like a model (the only “defect” is that she is short) 
And more importantly she is actually more book smart than me (at her HS she was the top student)

We essentially have the same hobby and interests only that again she in same of them is also better than me (not that it’s a bad thing)

We have only been doing some facetime video calls (of about 2 hours)

Before college begins again we have decided to visit each other hometown

He has a really demanding job and for the most part, actively made an effort to make time for me despite his busy workload (he's a lawyer). For the first 2 months we saw each other once a week and then 2-3x per week. Things were going great, I thought we had a good connection and we were really attracted to each other. He told me that he really liked me and wasn't talking to anyone else and didn't plan on it as long as things were going well between us. The past few weeks have been insane for him, he was moving apartments and trying to balance that with his job. So we hadn't seen each other in a while and he had been apologizing about it but his texts were still pretty lengthy and enthusiastic, which is why I'm so confused. 

Fast forward... to today he asks to facetime me and I had a bad feeling in my gut. Tried to stay positive going into it but when he called he said, ""I'd much rather have done this in person but with my job I don't know when I'd be able to see you next. I've had a lot of time to think about this over the past few weeks and I don't think that I see a future here. I plan on moving sooner rather than later and you're moving abroad to get your masters and I wish we had been able to see each other more and would've wanted more communication from you"". I was like ""I wanted to see you more too but you were busy and I'm not as busy so I was kinda just basing it around your schedule. If you had wanted me to communicate more then you could have told me and I would've made an effort to be better at it (I told him that communicating for me was hard but I was actively trying to be better at it)"". I asked, ""If I had been more communicative, then would that change things?"" he said, ""well maybe but I also just think there are other factors like with us not knowing where we'll be living/ending up in the next year"". THEN he brought up his ex and was like, ""This might be unfair to compare but my ex and I were so in love and we were together for 5 years and I just don't feel that or see that for us"". I'm like how the eff are you gonna compare a 5 year relationship to us when we've only been dating for 3 months?"". I also told him that in terms of communicating and wanting to hang out, I had asked him when I could come visit his new apartment and he didn't reply to that message and he was like ""oh sh\*t, you did? I didn't see that text, now I feel like an a\*\*hole"". So to me I think he wanted more communication from my end maybe in terms of me asking when we could hang out. I know I haven't been so great at that, I think I get worried about always being the one to ask someone to hang out because I don't wanna scare them away. I said, ""I just feel like this is all coming out of left field, I felt like we had a good connection and it seems like you're self sabotaging yourself by focusing on things that are out of your control and I'm not saying these things to convince you to stay with me because I can't change your mind but it just feels like self sabatoge"". Then I said I appreciate you letting me know and I wish you the best of luck.

I am absolutely gutted. I really REALLY liked him, I told him that I wish that we could continue seeing each other. I didn't cry over facetime, I'm so glad he didn't see me cry.

57,pqsuzw,1631993485,How Do I Make Things Right?,"Yesterday evening after I had gotten off of work and stopped by at my ex's house to drop off stuff so I don't have to look at it, plus I have a boyfriend that I am completely happy with, so it doesn't make sense to keep that stuff. After I did that, I went to my house and then to meet my boyfriend at work when he gets off because I barley get to see him and wanted to visit him. When I got there, he had asked me what took my so long and instead of saying my ex's house, I said I stopped at my house.

Now the reason I had said this was because we were already resolving an issue and I didn't want to start another one at the moment. I had planned on telling him this morning that I had stopped by over there but before I could say anything, he asked me if I had stopped there which was weird because I never even told him yet. Of course I did not lie to him and I said yes that I did and I told him why but now he is super upset and no matter how many times I try to apologize or reassure him, nothing seems to work. I even called him to tell him I love him but his response was nothing and I asked why he didn't say it back and he said ""it's hard to say that to you right now"" 

I am so lost because I did not mean to do anything wrong and I hate him being upset. I even looked at things from his perspective and I get it, I should've told him at the exact moment but hey I make mistakes. I was planning on visiting him after work today with a gift I was waiting to give him next month, and just hope we can talk things out but I need advice on what I should say, do, or even any comments that could help me move forward with this would be so so much appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqsuzw/how_do_i_make_things_right/

80,pqud38,1631998647,How I Became A Cyber Stalker: A Cautionary Tale,"TL;DR: I’m a psycho.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. What follows is the tale of how I became a cyber stalker. I created a fake tinder account. My last relationship was created on tinder and she was the literal devil incarnate. The relationship was an absolute nightmare, chock full of emotional terrorism, physical violence, and once I pulled the plug, stalking. There was a period of time when I was afraid to leave my home. She also created fake Facebook and tinder profiles to get me to talk to her. I’m not telling you this as an excuse for my bad behavior-I simply want to explain the backstory and lay the groundwork for what lies ahead. 

I haven’t dated for 2.5 years. In that time, I’ve had flings but nothing more serious. Lately, as a result of some serious work I’ve been putting into myself, I decided I’d like to see what was out there. However, due to my past experiences with my ex, I wasn’t really ready to put myself completely out there. I wanted to be an anonymous voyeur, if you will. So, after receiving permission to use a friend’s photos, I created the fake account. The profile wasn’t terribly popular, I received 100+ likes in about a few month’s time, and I didn’t often match with anyone but I did have some solid matches. Usually, I’d start the convo by saying something witty that referenced their profile, they’d either respond with something witty themselves which led to some back and forth banter that eventually fizzled out or I didn’t get a response at all. No worries, right? It’s just tinder, plus I wasn’t really serious about any of this. It was nice to practice flirting again in such a stress-free environment.

Then I matched with a girl who, on paper, checks all the boxes. We engage in some light banter over the course of a few weeks (like one message from me followed by a small response from her 4 days later, followed by a response from me 3-5 days later type of thing), until one day she decides she wants to engage in a more serious dialogue and responds faster. I was stuck in an airport at the time due to a tropical storm causing days of delays to me getting home so I had nothing but time. What transpired was us connecting in a way I haven’t connected with anyone in a long, long time. To be honest, I had given up on finding meaningful connection with anyone ever again. But this woman was amazing and I was excited about communicating with her. Then she, naturally, wanted to meet outside of tinder. And I of course had to come clean that I was a catfish.

I wrote her a very thorough apology, gave a small explanation why I did what I did, and told her I hoped this didn’t affect her in the future because I thought she was awesome. I also sent her a link to my Facebook profile so she could see that I was a real human and not some bot/troll. She never responded. And friends, this is where I went completely insane.

Blinded by the rejection of her not responding (I truly thought that once she saw my fb profile, she’d still want to meet up because we had a good connection) I went completely off the deep end. Through our discourse, she’d told me her name and her Instagram handle. I found her on Facebook and wrote her a message, expressing interest in still meeting for a drink. I let that stew for a few hours and then came to my senses. WHAT WAS I DOING?! So I deleted my entire account so the message would be wiped. Yes, deleted my entire 17 year old account. That’s how embarrassed I was. You’d think it ends there. Oh no, friends. It does not. Then I found her on Instagram and wrote her yet another message. I let them simmer for a few hours before I again came to my senses. I deleted my Instagram account as well. Not disabled. Deleted, so no record of my misdeed could ever be found. I reflected for a long time on this behavior. Why did I go so fucking crazy?! Is this actually who I am deep down? How could I ever expect to find love acting so shitty? I sat my closest friends down and told them what I’d done. Every embarrassing detail. I learn best through shame, and I can’t remember a time when I was more ashamed of myself. And I suppose that’s the point of why I’m doing this now. I want your criticism. I want you to shame me and tell me what a fucking idiot I am and how I don’t deserve to find happiness with another person. Tell me I need therapy, and to hit the gym, and for the love of god stay off of tinder. Because a terrible part of this is that I want to do it again. I want to create another fake profile just so that I can connect with someone. It was this emotional high and I want to feel it again. I guess I don’t like me, I don’t feel comfortable being me. Rejection is easier to swallow when the person being rejected isn’t actually you.

As an update to this poor girl and the literal worst part of this whole thing, I actually checked her insta not too long ago to see if she had mentioned anything about being stalked. She changed her handle. My bullshit did not go undetected. I traumatized some poor unsuspecting human for no reason. And now I have to live with that.

So I've not really done dating apps and I hear Hinge is especially selective and I'd like to know how often your average guy gets a match (or whatever it is) on Hinge? Should I have had at least one by now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqus66/how_often_should_you_be_getting_likes_on_hinge/

85,pquvnu,1632000399,Why do situationships always seem to hurt the worst when they end?,"Was seeing a guy casually for about 3 months. When I asked him where things were headed and if maybe he’d like to make things exclusive with me, he got super defensive and upset with me. I mentioned I had standards after a certain point of seeing someone (which I also mentioned in the beginning) and he just turned the table on me and said I was being controlling and pressuring him and then blocked me on all platforms. 

Granted, I am happy he blocked me because it saved me the drama of doing it myself considering his horrifically immature response to simple questions like “where do you see this going” and “would you ever see yourself committing to being exclusive in the near future with me after having been casually dating for 3 months?”. I mean who doesn’t know by then if they’re truly interested in someone? Am I silly for thinking or having even brought that up?

There were other red flags I decided to overlook because I wanted to see the best in him and see if we could grow together as we got closer in time. 

Despite all of this, knowing this was more his loss than mine, I feel so deeply saddened that he was able to block me and discard me so easily. Why does this hurt so badly? We weren’t even exclusive and I’ve cried everyday since he blocked me. I feel like I have to mourn the loss of someone I’ll never speak to again. I also hate feeling like he’s off happy living his life while I’m broken up by the thought of us never speaking again. 

I feel like sometimes these situationships hurt the worst because we never got to see if we had any real potential. It’s like the dreaded what if’s that are haunting me. I hate it. 

Does anyone else struggle with this too dating in today’s world? It beats me up a lot. Seems like with all the online dating and social media it’s easy to be discarded and forgotten. 

TLDR; how do you best cope with the aftermath of a situationship ending, especially if you didn’t want it to?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pquvnu/why_do_situationships_always_seem_to_hurt_the/

89,pqv68e,1632001393,Does being younger as a guy make up for women's standards or something?,"I have this friend who is 39. She is attractive and gets lots of guys of all ages interested in her. Normally, she has standards. She wants a guy who is good looking, has his shit together, good personality, similar interests and, importantly, is genuinely into her and doesn't just wanna hook up.

Lately, however, I've noticed that my friend is (although not openly admitting it) into this 23 year old guy in our social group and is desperately but covertly trying to get closer to him. This, however, is a guy that she has nothing in common with(he is all about gaming, internet culture, weed, all things she has nothing to do with) and does NOT have hit shit together(low paying job, no car, rents out a spare room in a mutual friend's place). As far as personality, he is confident and very intelligent, but he is kind of uptight and doesn't have a sense of humor, which are things she does not like at all normally. And most importantly, he has shown pretty much ZERO interest in her. It's pretty clear that if he ever had any interest in her, it would be just as a causal hook up. 

It's super weird to me, because from what I've seen, with guys closer to her age or even 10 years younger, I am pretty certain all of these things and much less would be deal breakers. There is even this 31 year old guy she's met who is probably better looking than this guy, makes six figures, has more similar interests/lifestyle and actually right-swiped her on Bumble. But she wasn't interested in that guy, even just to hook up with. So what's the deal? Does a guy being 16 years younger than her as opposed to 8 years younger than her make him a catch?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqv68e/does_being_younger_as_a_guy_make_up_for_womens/

91,pqvhlv,1632002485,Never dated someone before I’m super scared,"So I’m a 19 years old Guy and I’ve never dated someone in my life, I would say that I am conventionally attractive and overall people seem to be interested in me but usually I end up shutting it down because I’m really scared of intimacy. I’m on the autism spectrum and while I don’t mind getting my head scratched or general skinship I’m super uncomfortable with most things beyond platonic cuddling, I’m not a virgin and I’ve been with several people I just don’t know how to make the Jump into causal intimacy. Hell I can flirt great but the second they flirt back I back off and I don’t know how to stop, I can’t tell if to them me being awkward is cute or something or maybe I’m not making my boundaries clear enough. I have this whole idea in my head that one day I’ll find someone who is okay with my quirks and understands how I’m uncomfortable with PDA.but also since I’ve never dated someone I don’t know if that is a deal breaker for relationships. Any advice on how to gain confidence or disclose to people I’m new to this? Some extra information is that I’m bisexual, I’ve actually only been with women I’m really intimidated by the prospect of being with someone because I haven’t before.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqvhlv/never_dated_someone_before_im_super_scared/

She stopped talking to her ex boyfriend after we started talking bec it was really toxic. We've talked about it before how he was a good friend to her and how she misses him. I supported her through and said its okay to miss someone like that and we will get through this together. Last week, just after moving in she texted him asking him to meet (which i was okay with) and told me about it. I said its fine you can meet him and see if it works out as friends. Then she told me that they were really intimate with each other and there is too much energy between them so if they meet something is bound to happen. They have decided to meet less and keep distance but they are meeting on this Monday i guess. I asked her what is the point of it then and what if it affects us and she just said then it would be bad and she can't let that happen. I want to trust her on this but i feel like she herself doesnt trust her. I don't know what to do, i really want to understand her but i dont know what to say.

95,pqvpcg,1632003254,What I’ve gathered from dating: Lessons Learned,"Here’s my advice to women dating men:

• Men ONLY care about your looks and sex appeal. 

• Men do NOT care about your finances, your degree(s), your career, your career aspirations, your net worth/status as long as you look good to them. 

• Men will approach women they find attractive and have friendly interactions with her. 

• If a man is concerned about anything other than your looks and sex appeal - he’s not into you. 

• 90% of a man’s attraction to you is from your looks and your body and how much he wants to sex you. 

• 10% of a man’s attraction to you is how easy your personality is for him to get along with. No man wants to be at war with his wife or want to come home to drama constantly. Be easy to get along with. 

• Women, do NOT treat your man like he’s one of your girlfriends, which means no sharing girly gossip with him. If a man prefers to gossip with you instead of doing physical/sexy stuff with you, he’s just not that into you. 

• Men of means are happy to take care of you financially as long as he finds you attractive.

But now I (21M) think I'm ready to go back in, but I don't think I want a full on emotional attachment kind of relationship. I really wanted that few years back, but hey here we are.

I don't think sugarcoating what I want will help anyone so I'll be just blunt here even if it puts me in the wrong light. I just wanna have casual relationships and explore myself and live a little.

I'm not exactly... hot. But I've been told I look cute and people like being around me and I feel the same with them.
