We had been talking via text for a few weeks prior to the first date. Initially I found her a little “wishy washy” she seemed very high interest right off the bat when we spoke on tinder. Then when the conversation moved to Snapchat her replies became very slow and she occasionally left me on read. But then she sometimes we would talk and she would seem high interest again. This is why I took 3-4 weeks to actually ask her out because I was getting mixed signals. When I did ask her out she said that I took a long time to ask her and she agreed to the date straight away and was very eager to meet me. When we went on the date we had dinner and some drinks. And she seemed very high interest the whole course of the date. She ended up staying over and we had sex. And I noticed between dinner and going back to my place her interest seemed to drop a little bit. She went from being very friendly and feminine and talking in a way that made it seem like we had some sort of future togethor almost to acting a little cocky almost as if she’s better than me. I didn’t take much notice of this until the next day when I analysed the whole night. I’m not sure if I failed some shit tests or did something that came off desperate but it’s clear her attraction for me dropped a little bit. But we still had sex anyway so clearly she hasn’t completely lost interest. The next day when we woke up she seemed a little more distant. I drove her home but she said she would like to se me again. 

After driving her home I didn’t contact her for three days. When I did text her she was still friendly and playful but her replies were a lot slower. I asked her out on another date the following week (2 weeks after the first date) and then again the week after. Both times she gave me vague responses like “I’m doing this but I might be able to see you after I’ll let you know” she never let me know and after trying to make plans with her twice with no prevail I gave up and stopped contacting her.

Examples like bank accounts, Next of Kin and many other things of that nature. It’s really weird because me and my fiancé are from pretty well off families but my mom wouldn’t be financially supportive of me because I’m married. (She will still  be in my life but won’t financially support me)
 For context I won’t be getting married till 2024 and I’ll be 22-23 when I’m married so I’ll still be in school however my fiancé will be out of school  and working. I’ll basically have no money while my fiancé will most likely have a job and be financially supported by his father. We have also talked about me moving in with him now and either doing college online or not going to college  (which I really don’t want to do) and have me take care of the house while he makes the money. We have agreed to get a prenup so none of our inheritance money is touched (I know prenups only protect the money you had BEFORE the marriage.)  

My main questions are 

how will money work if we both are working and how will a divorce work in that scenario?

How will money work if I’m not working but taking care of the house and he’s working and how will a divorce work in that scenario?

If we move in together before the marriage I most likely will be living with his family until we find a place after we’re married how will housing work and what happens if we get divorced?

How does insurance work for married couples? (I prefer this question be answered by a gay/lesbian individual) 

How does next of kin work?

The last time I saw her before today was 12 years ago before I move out my childhood town.
We were very close at that time, we spend countless time  together... Weekend, vacation all-day long playing, laughing around her house, sleeping together...

But one day just before middle school my parents decide to move out and I've got to say goodbye to her...

 I've loved those days I've spend with her but at that time we were only friend because as a child I wasn't even thinking about her like that but by growing up with those memories, I developed a huge crush on her and I thought a lot of time thinking over and over about her...

We've lived our life appart for 12 long years without taking contact with each other. When we were child that was difficult because we didn't have phone to talk and even when growing up when exchange short message in highschool but we were to far from each other to meet up... I didn't take the time and I didn't really make the effort to really reunite with her.

Maybe I was afraid to see that she'd become complete different person ? Maybe I was a bit bitter that she didn't send me a message in 12 years ?

I don't know and I don't care because yesterday I've met her at that bar in my childhood town... She got the same cute face but with a little piercing in her nose, a little bit of makeup those long blond hair i didn't see for years, a little badass tattoo on her arms and the body of a beautiful young woman, she was stunning. I approach her table, I pronounce her name and immediately she smiled at me with a surprised face and we started to discuss. 

We only talk about those years we spend together and our old class... Not much about ourself, I guess we've lived to much thing in those 12 years, where could we have started ? I left here because I got to meet up with friend and I was completely blinded about that short moment I've spend with her.

Obviously I got a enormous crush and immediately texted her when I got back to my home, saying that I was really happy to reunite with her and that if she wanted we could grab a drink and talk more, She agreed and proposes to do that the next week. 

Tonight I go to the same bar to meet a friend and we run each other again. I invite her at our table and we spend a quality time together again, I was hooked on everything she say, every laugh, every smile I wanted her to look at me do badly. Normally I'm social and very confident with others even stranger but right now I was going dumb, I couldn't speak a word and I got that feel that I wasn't interesting enough... We leave with my friend saying goodbye to her and her friend and even after several minutes, hours she was in my head and the same feeling of beeing super dumb.

Right now I don't really know what to do and I'm kinda scared to fuck that up... 

What are your advice for me ?

I had this amazing LDR with a beautiful girl. We both liked each other and enjoyed a lot talking to each other. I thought of moving our relationship to the next step(asked her for a crop top pic or pic that showed tummy area) but that backfired on me as she was hurt and broke up with me, she left me only one option of messaging her, blocking me from everything. I tried to convince her but of no use as she said we had no future together. Angry as I was at her for not forgiving me ( this is the 1st time I messed up badly) I thought things will get better. She still cared for me but sometimes send me rude, hurtful messages like forget me, u broke my trust etc. So I waited for another couple of weeks while we both asked for each other's health and she said the hurt will get better and everything will be fine after some days u will heal and that we can't be together. More than 20 days passed since the incident but there was little progress in getting back. So I got angry too much, thinking how much I should wait and she was treating me badly but in fact, she was caring a bit and needed some more time. I send her a rude ,bad and angry msg, then she replied with a horrible angry msg and blocked me everywhere leaving me no method of contacting her. I felt horrible, guilty, bad, anxious and uneasy.

Fast forward to a week after that she sent me a msg saying sorry because of all the hurtful things she said in the msg .She told me to not reply to her msg, this was her last msg and she wont be looking forward to any msg from me and she wants to end things on good terms. Good Bye.

I don't know what to do, I feel so anxious and uneasy. Help a guy out, can I do anything to get her back?

I feel like I have lost a jewel or something important and it was my fault.

I have started u can say no contact to get her back but it is very tough , people give me advices like work on yourself but i am dealing with exams right now so i am not able to do much but a lot of my time goes in checking things like how to get her back and i miss her so damn much like all flashbacks come , my mind automatically goes there , i dont know what should I do ?

I know things like it might not be the right relationship , i am trying to cope up but I remember the promises we made to each other , she was supposed to visit me in a few months , i miss the msgs the voice notes , i can't even msg her because she blocked me everywhere and try to delete everything about me , I don't even know how is she doing like is she hurting or she is normal or anything?

However, sometimes, I  want to be more open to start experiencing things and take charge of my sexuality especially before I am ready to settle down. 

The main drawback is that I am a virgin and I was hoping to wait for the right person in a committed relationship that I can trust to experience things with - especially for the first time. But I am having no luck finding anyone I truly connect with. 

All that seems to happen with people I become interested in is ghosting, bread crumbing and people not willing to wait till I'm ready to hook-up. Since most at my age have experienced this already. The furthest I have gotten with someone is 4 dates. I  struggle to romantically connect to people, I'm afraid that I will never find anyone i truly love.

After my first kiss I got attached to the guy. Another person, the one I talked to for the longest - we held hands, we made out and I slept over at his house a couple of times despite not having sex. I definitely got attached to him from just that. He ended up bread-crumbing me and being in and out of my life for months and eventually ghosted. It hurt. This is what makes me scared of hooking up because I am terrified of getting attached, feeling used or not good enough to be loved/chosen.

But at the same time I am an adult human being, I am 24, I want to have fun and have sex and curiosity gets to me. Maybe if I go into things with a different perspective (not hoping for a relationship) I can overcome getting attached? I'm just so scared of getting hurt.

I (mid 30s male) honestly wish I could just put down the bottle once and for all. Maybe one cup of wine on a lovely weekend evening at a music concert or over dinner is plenty for me. But what always brings me back to drinking is the fear that even saying I don’t drink will make women think I am lame and boring. I live in a city where dating revolves around bars and drinking.

How do you know when it’s okay to speak to women you don’t know?

I’ve mainly been using dating apps and I’ve accepted I’m just too ugly for any of those to do anything for me. I think my only hope at sex or a relationship at this point is to try meeting women in person again. I stopped because I had some pretty harsh rejections and now I want to give it one last shot before I decide that I wasn’t meant for women and either give up or try guys.

I don’t want to make any woman uncomfortable, and I really don’t want to make a fool out of myself. I have tons of girl friends and they have made it clear to me when a guy they’re not attracted to comes up to them they think it’s creepy. I don’t want to come across as creepy, but I doubt any woman will think I’m attractive just by looking at me.

Another issue is that since I’m living back home during the summer months, I don’t really go out all that much. I go to the gym and run everyday and that’s really it. I see women at the gym, but I feel like it’s an awful idea to talk to a girl at the gym. Like worse than even looking at a girl on the street.

There were so many reasons for that mainly because I didn't develop the social skills until after college. I can write an essay about this but that's not the main point.

Over the past few months I've researched about dating and even the use of dating apps. I saw a lot of comments about making yourself the ""prize"" to women or making yourself of great value. I also saw them talking about how you gotta be settled with a good income job and be socially smart. I've always felt bad for myself. It's not that I don't have the confidence. I do but I also fear about not being able to provide value and not being sure whether women will accept that I'm not a guy with great social skills or a settled income. I felt like I was always ""behind"" in dating value when it comes to comparing other guys. For dating sites while I haven't created a profile, I saw lots of complaints about how guys can't land dates because they are often overlooked from other more valuable ones.

Then yesterday I went to a dating coach's zoom call and explained my situation. They said that you don't have to worry about the negatives and just focus on the positives. It's about having more confidence right? All this time I've tried to think about the barriers of what I'm missing. I mean I do have a lot of positive values to provide even if it's not great looks, income, top tier social skills, very fit, etc. Pretty much this Zoom call started to change my mindset and maybe after all those negative values aren't holding me back right? I really want to get into dating and I'll certainly use my positive intangibles.

First off, thank you for taking the time to read this high school dating nonsense. This is about two people: M17 (me) and F15. The primary focus of this post is the female, whom I shall declare as ""Claire"".

I've known Claire for five years. We go to the same school and do a sport outside of school together, and I've always caught her staring at me. Just last week, we decided to become ""friends"" after a long time of ONLY her saying hi to me and waving at me.

I realized how precious Claire was to my life because she makes me smile every time she waves or says hi. She also ditches her friends during lunch and other free periods to spend time with me in the library. This has been going on for a week.

At the library, she's always sitting RIGHT NEXT TO me and putting her foot on my chair. She's also very touchy and puts her face close to mine (while twirling her hair constantly). Whenever we're talking, she rambles on and on...

Claire also asks me what classes I have last period and has waited outside my classroom during the final two days we've seen each other.

In terms of texting, we're both pretty new to that stage. We're always awkward over text and can't seem to put our feelings on to the words. But, I recently told her that I like someone, but never specified it was Claire.

Recently, I've been pretty busy with virtual college programs, so I had to skip school this week (6/7 to 6/11). We can't meet up outside of school because her parents are concerned about a potential relationship. So, I woke up early and waited in front of school for her (a few hours before my college program started).

So we met up this morning (6/11), and conversed for around 5 minutes (because her classes started soon). She asked me excitedly who I liked and I went forward with these two actions:

1. I patted her head
2. I said ""It's pretty obvious, no?""
3. Gazed into her eyes for 7 seconds

Claire looked at me with a blank face (lol I couldn't tell because of the damn masks). I then told her to have a nice day, put both backpack straps on her shoulders, and to work hard on her homework this weekend.

Before we met up this morning (6/11), through text, I told her that I would meet up with her briefly at school that morning. She then said to not text her over the weekend because she has ""a lot of homework."" I thought this was odd because before her parents didn't allow her to meet up with me, she asked a few days ago if I wanted to hang out with her at the park this Saturday (6/12).

If y'all are lost reading this post up to this point, Claire told me to not text her the morning AFTER telling her that I have a crush on someone, and BEFORE patting her on the head.

So, here are my questions (why does this feel like a word problem LMAO):

1. Is there a chance she has feelings for me?
2. Why tf is she taking the weekend off suddenly?
3. How shall I proceed to drop hints or officially confess to her?

I'm pretty hesitant in having a relationship with her because she told me she recently rejected someone she used to have feelings for (which I'm assuming means that she's not ready for a relationship??).

I'm very dubious...and nervous...

Please help...

I dated this guy for about 3 months, and he pursued me hard. It was the most romance I had felt in a long time, and he treated me really well, and made me feel very admired. Everything felt magical with us. He told me he loved me, and that he was mine, and we spent more and more time together. I had FULL confidence he was totally in it and sticking around. Suddenly one week I felt like he was distant for some reason, and I happened to be having a rough week anyway so it was weighing on me a lot. He suddenly asked for space, we didn’t speak for 2 days, and then he invited me over to talk, to tell me he’s not ready for a relationship, because he doesn’t feel like he’s his best self yet, and would want to be his best self for someone like me, and he has work to do on himself. It was so abrupt, I didn’t see it coming at all. He is an extremely anxious person, but I expected that to manifest more in the way of doing whatever he could to keep me, I certainly didn’t expect him to be willing to let me go. He told me he will reach out in a couple of months and hopefully we can get a drink and catch up and perhaps reassess things then if I’m still single.

I’m thinking, this is probably BS but obviously don’t call her out.

She goes, oh do you want to end the date now, I can still stay till it closes till 12 (30mins). I told her that I’d be up for that but if she had to go I understand , so she says that she told her friend she’d leave at 12 so we can spend the last 30 mins

Anyway 30 mins passes she books her taxi and then says I might be free tomorrow or day after. I hadn’t said a word about seeing each other again because I thought it was dead. So I told her that could work but I have a few things going on I’d give her call in a day or two and we can sort something out . 

She’s pretty cool, I’m dating a few other women atm so I’m not as hung up as I would be otherwise but I don’t get it. The date was dead when she first mentioned her friend and the last 30 mins were actually quite good mostly because I was completely detached.
