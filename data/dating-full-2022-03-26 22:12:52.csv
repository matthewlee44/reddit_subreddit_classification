He’s currently doing residency to be a doctor in the US and based on our conversations, he’s very busy and sometimes I wonder if he’s getting enough rest and sleep. Anyway, I live in Europe and the other day, he just told me that he booked a flight and will have two days here (because he’ll have those days off).

How it started: We stayed at the same hostel and that hostel organized a birthday party when they learned it was my birthday. The hostel staff took everyone bar hopping. On our way to the bar, when I found out that he’s an emergency medicine doctor (not sure if I’m phrasing this correctly), I joked that I hope he makes sure I don’t end up at a hospital just in case I end up drinking a lot.

[Backstory: I ended up at a hospital here in my city months ago because I passed out on dinner party (didn’t eat enough hehe it’s a rare occasion)]

He just agreed and I didn’t expect that he’ll deliver. At the 3rd bar, after accepting too many birthday drinks, I started falling over and he volunteered to leave the party with me to take me back to the hostel. He didn’t drop me off at my room (it’s at the 3rd floor) and we stayed at his (first floor), let me puke and clog his sink, and sleep in his bed. Very wholesome.

The day after, we explored the city together and eventually had sex. No alcohol involved. After Istanbul, traveled in Madrid for a couple of days. Had a great time and then it was time for him to go back to the US. We’ve been talking everyday since.

So sorry for the long story but I just want to know if he likes me or he’s just into traveling and just good timing that he scored a $300+ roundtrip flight. I like him a lot and would love to see him again.

For guys, what will make you want to travel to see a girl again? (I can’t travel to the US yet because my visa appointment will only be on September next year and he knows this) Do I need to plan something with him? Ask him? I also don’t want look like I am demanding. I just want to see him because I like him a lot.

2. We have a great date
3. We have others dates and get to know each other well
4. We get in a relationship

After step 2, if everything is good during the date do you reschedule during the date? After? 

During step 3, at what point can you bring them for a home date? Before or after hooking up? If acquaintance are introduced (if going places chance are that someone I know will be there), what do you introduced them by? A friend, a date, another title?

I'll start off by saying I'm a trans woman, I'm 23 years old. I'm dating another trans woman, we're long distance and live in two different countries. The only problem is... I've realized I don't love her anymore. I don't feel much for it anymore. Don't get me wrong, I still care for her, but mostly in a platonic way. I love her in the same way you'd love a cat, or family, or your friends. Just not passionately. 

I've felt this way for a while, and the truth is I just don't want to hurt her. I know eventually I need to break up with her, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. 

But what I want so desperately is true love. Dating just as a guy is hard enough, so I keep going back and forth thinking I need to detransition, because let's be honest.. a lot of girls probably aren't going to want to date a trans person. And I know many people say never change for anyone, but I feel the alternative is I'll have very little chances. But, I can't bring myself to stop, either. 

I had some relationships before this but truthfully I feel like everything's gone hill since then. And I'll admit it, I was toxic in one or two of them. Since then I've gotten much much better and fixed myself I think, but I can't help to think I blew my chances. 

Another problem about me is how hard and how quick I become attached. I'm extremely obsessive, to the point where I don't think I'm normal. When I'm in love that person will be all that I'm thinking about of every second of any day, I'd do anything for them. Which is normal, but I think I'm so passionate I scare people away.

Back in high school, I (22F) met this guy (24M) one time through a mutual friend. It was a quick meeting and was like 16 at the time. We got each other’s instagram and twitter, as kids do. Since then, which was like 2016, he has always always swiped up on all my stories on snapchat and instagram, implying he things i’m pretty and always asking to hang. I curved it like every time or just said thank you because I just didnt want to get to know someone new. This went on from 2016 to now.

Present:
I moved to another state, but am visiting our hometown for two weeks because I’m moving back during summer. Last week, he messaged me, as he normally does every so often as mentioned, and I decided to say eff it and just meet up w him. I ended up going out with a friend to get a drink or 2 and I went to his place after. We hung out and talked for like 2 hours, did have s*x, and he asked me to spend the night. From there on, we started texting all day, we went out for sushi the next night, and I slept over his house for the following 4-5 days consecutively(and we didnt have s*x or anything. Literally just had sleepovers and watched movies and like relationship-y cuddly stuff).

3 days ago, he asked me to get breakfast the following day before he went to work. I woke up, got ready, and he didnt wake up in time so we didnt go. He invited me to his house after work instead at that point and I said sure. Then the night came, he got off work, and he said he was really tired from work and was about to fall asleep so I didnt go. this was thursday night. 

He had to go 3 hours away for the weekend for a family function (left on Friday) and asked me the night before if I was still going to be in town when he gets back bc he wants to see me again and I said I’m not sure (because I didnt book my flight) and that i really liked hanging out with him and want to continue doing so if i can. he said the feelings were mutual. 

 and since then, he hasn’t texted me or checked in or snapchatted me. 
I snapchatted him a selfie on friday while at the gym, he left it on opened. I texted him later that same night and said hi and he hasnt responded. it’s saturday evening now. that was the last thing that happened.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now in our 5th year of college (both took a year off to work an internship at the same company during COVID) and about to graduate in a matter of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say we've done a lot of things together, mostly (70%ish) school related since we were doing the exact same program and in all the same courses. I'd call her my closest friend, though not sure if I'm hers which is I guess where most of my mental issues are coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

Being in a STEM program, naturally most of the people she hangs around are dudes, so I can't help but feel like I'm just another one of the dudes and I'm catching feelings for no reason. She sometimes gets slightly touchy with other dudes but not really with me as far as I can recall. Lately (since about 7 months now) we've been sitting on Zoom calls 3-4 nights a week studying together or just chatting (in addition to spending time together in-person at school). And then those usually carry on into text conversations until 1am or 2am until one of us passes out.

&amp;#x200B;

On one of these calls we were talking about a grad trip that we had already booked with like 4 other friends (on which she's rooming with another guy friend from her high school days and I'm rooming by myself since I booked later than everyone else). Eventually I said something about perhaps seeing a particular city (separate from this grad trip) I've never been to before and asked her when was the last time she'd been. She makes some comments about her memories from that place and I casually ask her if she'd want to see it again (not sure why my brain was doing here). But then she goes and looks up plane tickets and realizes they're quite cheap. Pulls out her schedule and despite having research work she's committed to during that time, checked if I would be available during some set dates. Since I won't be starting my new job until a few months after graduating, I have tons of free time during that month. She proceeds to book the trip. 99.999999% sure it's just going to be me and her. I haven't booked the tickets yet but have told here that I will book them soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to tell me that I'm Captain Oblivious here, but I'm honestly not sure - is she into me? She's special to me and we spend a lot of time together over the years of being in school and have a lot in common. I personally consider her my best friend since I spend the most time with her (and enjoy it) out of any of my other friendships, but just not sure if I should go about making a move cause I sometimes feel like I'm simply another guy friend which is a natural consequence of being in a STEM program (and don't want to make things awkward by revealing feelings, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

I've never dated before, so she would be my first girlfriend if I made a move (and if she said yes, of course). Over the years of being in school and hanging out with her (admittedly a lot), SO MANY people have asked me if we're dating or not, to which I simply respond 'no'. On one occasion it was mentioned by someone when we were both sitting together and I remember her saying 'ew no' lol but idk if she actually mentioned it or was just trying to brush off the questioner. She also gives me creative birthday gifts that play on our past conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you’re seriously telling me I haven’t been able to find anyone since? It’s like the universe is telling me I can’t do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30. Social anxiety is something I deal with but not that much of a contributing factor. Around a yr ago, I took a 6 month break from dating apps.

It's a bit personal but here we go. All the pain in my life caused by men since day 1:

(1) My dad often cheated on my mom and they divorced when I was 12. My dad left me and my mom alone in a foreign country and we had just about enough money to live a normal life. (Thankfully)

(2) I was molested by a 50 year old man when I was 7.

(3) My first boyfriend used me for sex, recorded us having sex and showed all his friends. He tried to get me to sleep with his friends too. I thought we were in a relationship but he was just using me. I was too naive to see at the time. I was 15.

(4) My first ""love"" aka first time I felt a connection with a guy, told me he didn't want a relationship and left after a few weeks of a casual thing. He got into a relationship for 3  years shortly after.

(5) A guy I really liked was sleeping with a girl who didn't want a relationship so he started ""dating"" me to make the girl jealous so she wanted a relationship in the end. He ghosted me and I saw the pics on fb shortly after. It was hell because I had liked him for a long time.

(6) After the above happened, I decided I didn't want to spend my life alone and die without ever having a boyfriend so I ""settled"" for a drug addict who I thought was into me aka a safe bet. Turns out he was cheating on me with his ex. The emotional kind of cheating too. She lived in romania and the only reaosn they broke up is when he moved to another country. So he still loved her. When I brought her up, he would physically abuse me. Yeap. Strangle me etc. I couldn't face being alone so I stayed for far too long in this abusive relationship.

(7) I fell in live with a guy I worked with. He kept giving me mixed signals. He got fired in the end and one drunken night, he told me he loved me. I said I loved him too. Then he ghosted me. Blocked my number when I reached out. Never spoke to me again. I was devastated because I had been in love with him for 2 years.

(8) Above guy's brother matched with me on Tinder and them two set up a date with me then cancelled last minute twice. Must have been some kind of game for them.

(9) I met someone on Tinder recently who seemed really nice and I thought finally I would have a relationship with someone I like, but he suddenly wasn't talking as much. His texts were a little late and finally he ghosted. Turns out he has met someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Maybe a life on my own would have been better than all the pain above. I know people have it worse but there are not many people around me who have never been in a proper loving relationship and I am really sad because I don't think I will ever see that.

since breaking up with my ex in early 2021, i have had a lot of one night stands (i was being a bit chaotic after a long period of a boring relationship), which is fine as i was also fine with casual things. but after a while you do start to wonder, why DONT these men text me the next day? we have a great, long date and after having sex - nothing.

i’ve tried not sleeping w them on the first night, tried being forward and making the first moves, tried being more laid back to let them come to me. and it still never progresses.

i grew up quite ugly (lol) so had to develop a personality and i get told often im funny and that’s always been a good trait of mine that i value, as humour to me is everything. im a natural talker but also a really good listener, so i can lead convos but also am engaged with what people say. dates can never really be boring for me because i can always lead the convo even if the other person is more shy than i am. i have many great traits, along with being a literal model previously so i get so confused as to why no one ever really wants me for anything more than sex.

i’ve even had amazing sex with people who compliment me loads but then never really see me after once or twice. it’s so confusing for me! why bother complimenting me and being super cuddly and intimate etc if you have no intention of seeing me again?

i used to be quite insecure and i’ve worked hard to recognise a lot of my good traits, and i know my worth and really try with this but after X amount of the same thing happening, it does start to get to you and you wonder why this happens? 

i’ve come off dating apps because they’re seemingly pointless for anything other than sex, and i’ve also tried just not focusing on men and doing my own thing but they seem to come to me.

i’m typically not really looking and they come to me, reel me in, make me like them and then leave? it’s so frustrating because THEY pursue me! i try to not bother with men but one i find attractive will draw me in and then just…. ghost me or fade out the convo and meet ups before nothing again.

what on earth am i doing wrong? how do i fix this lmfao and do other people have this issue?

my friends are all in long term relationships and i just feel so confused as to why it never really works out for me.

Fast forward to a couple of years later, I’m working my usual job shift and he drops by. He asks me if I’m single. I say yes. He then follows up the question by asking if I wanted to go out on a date with him. I say no but only because we’re in the middle of a pandemic and I’m a bit uncomfortable going out due to COVID. I reassure him that there could definitely be a next time and I’d go if the pandemic subsided. 

One night, I’m scrolling through IG and his profile shows up on my suggested list of people to follow. Hence, my question.. should I request to follow him?

It’s been on my mind for a bit. Thoughts of how I should go for it because he was the one who prompted his interest first. Thoughts of how weird it would be of me to do it.

I've tried various dating apps, but didn't have any luck on them and actually had a few negative experiences on there. I live in a small town area, and nothing interesting ever goes on here. I'm not in school and have been homeschooled my whole life, which really didn't help me improve my social skills. I took a college class a few months ago at a community college, but it wasn't a very interactive environment at all. Everyone seemed to stay in their lane, and I know I could've took initiative myself but I felt weird approaching guys there because I don't know how it would be received. Plus 60% of the guys there were either with a girl or too young.

 In general, the idea of approaching someone I find attractive terrifies me. I know that I need to get over this because I can't wait around for other people to make the first move, but I'm terrified of getting rejected, finding out the person is taken, or whatever awkward/embarrassing situation that will happen. I'm a 3/10 at best, and I'm worried about anything I do coming off as creepy/gross, even if I just smile at someone. I don't look better with makeup, and it seems to make me look worse.

 I just wish I could get into healthy relationships as easily as my friends/everyone I know. It hurts sometimes, being the only single person in my life and longing for what they have. It makes me wonder what could be wrong with me/what I could be doing wrong. I know it's important to have good self-esteem before trying to date, but the thing is that I am fine with myself overall. It's just that in this area of my life, I feel insecure. I know I'm not entitled to a guy and if nobody ever wants to be with me then that's alright. It's just if I could improve my situation and potentially find someone, I would like to. Any advice/feedback is appreciated.

I don’t keep alcohol in my house. I grew up with an addict and that’s just not the kind of lifestyle I want to live. College was a big struggle for me for this reason. Anyways, I’ve turned down a lot of guys in the past due to their partying/drinking lifestyles. 

But I recently started dating a guy that seems a bit more laid-back. He’s older than me, in his mid 30s. Done with the partying stage of his life. However, lately I’ve noticed that he’s been drinking a lot more. Maybe I just didn’t notice it on our first couple of dates or maybe I didn’t notice it until I started hanging out at his house. The last time we had a date, I told him I was not drinking and I kind of wanted to this deep conversation of why. He was very supportive and respectful which a lot of men aren’t, but then at the end he of course threw in the “but I’m not going to join you lol.” And of course I don’t expect him to but he then proceeds to drink three beers over an hour. Maybe that’s average? We go back home and watch a movie on TV. He opens a bottle of wine and pours himself a glass. He pours himself several more over the course of the movie and finishes the bottle. We put on the Netflix show we watch after the movie ends. Then he opens a bottle of whiskey or bourbon, not really sure, something that was dark brown and smelled horrific. He than drink two or three glasses of that. No mixers. And then I start hearing him snore behind me like a lawnmower. In the middle of the TV show. He insists that he’s awake whenever I shake him and ask if he’s OK. But then he just falls back asleep again. This is the second time this whole scenario has happened. It happened the last time I spent the night at his house as well. Is this a bad sign that he could have an alcohol addiction? He told me himself that he’s not a big drinker but he was literally going back to back with glasses of wine and whiskey/bourbon. And I could taste it on his mouth every time he kissed me. 

I understand people not wanting to stop drinking just because they’re around somebody that doesn’t drink but I’m not sure if I should be concerned with his amount of consumption. Not to get too dark or depressing, but it just reminded me a lot of my mom and how she would pass out on the couch growing up. Any advice on what I should do?

We are kind of long distance FWB but have talked about moving closer if we get serious to date. This hasn’t happened.

He was so responsive. We have similar goals and ambitions for life. We clicked so well in our conversations. We do have a significant age gap though. He always discussed marriage and this was something I wanted too. Since he discussed it so much I was surprised he had never been married before. 

He is flaky though. This has always been a habit of his, where he doesn’t call when he says he will but it’s gotten worse the longer we have known each other.

Lately I’ve been thinking that I might have way too romanticised view of dating. When I like someone I only like them and they are basically the only person I think of. Same would be for dating I would only want to chat with one person at a time. I don’t like the idea of keeping options open and talking to multiple people at the same time. But these days it seems like people treat it like that and would drop you if someone better comes along. I also have this unrealistic idea that the first person I’m with is the one I’ll always be together with. I constantly imagine this perfect guy who likes all the things I do and we do them together. We will grow old together and do all our first together like dating, travelling. The older I get the more unrealistic and naive this seems. It’s not like I have many options at all to begin with. But I still think my standards aren’t high it’s just this idea of wanting the first person I’m with be the one I’m with forever. I can’t seem to let go of this idea because it’s what I always wanted since I was young. I have 0 intrest in dating multiple people and the thought of it seems so daunting.

She was in a relationship for a while but is currently single. I wanted some advice on asking her out/not asking her out (I’m not trying to confess feelings because that’s too much). She’s been a good, considerate friend, I value that tremendously and I ideally don’t want to lose that friendship. I’m also so hopelessly into her that I don’t know if I can continue staying silent. 

Crucial to note that I’ve had this feeling for a while now that she may have a very mutual crush on me and has tried signaling that in different ways, but I’ve never been comfortable asking (of course, as she’s always had a bf and probing would be weird and inappropriate), and she’s not always easy to read. It’s still all confusing to me. But that’s one of the major reasons I’ve kept my crush alive despite her always being with someone (again, until recently). 

Here’s the thing. I suspect for a variety of reasons and just as a sense from being around her lately that she’s aware of my own feelings. I’m bashful and tend to wear crushes on my sleeve a bit, and I’d honestly be surprised if she didn’t already know. We also haven’t been talking as much as we used to, but I wonder if that has more to do with her still focusing on herself post-breakup while having to navigate my possibly noticeable crush rather than a loss of interest. 

So…is it even worth the risk in asking this person out at some point in the future? Or if she’s into me too and knows how I feel, would she not just inevitably come to me and ask me out? 

I want to be careful with our dynamic here and not be the one to make the move if it’s not my place. I also don’t wanna be passive and miss a shot if I actually have one to take (if I do shoot it still wouldn’t be for a minute).

So, there’s a classmate of mine that i really like. 2 months ago, she broke up with her boyfriend. 

In the meantime, we got closer. We started hanging out more and more and it was then that i started catching feelings for her. She even says i’m handsome and kind of looks jealous when i hang out with other girl friends of mine. But she showed me her ex’s stuff ( she keeps it in a small furniture ), and she said “now i’m ready to move on from my ex”. That same night, i caught her looking at me various times ( she still does ).

We went out today, with some other friends ( one of them is a close friend of her ). She said she saw she was about to cry because a song that was being played in the pub remembered her of her ex.

What can i do?? I was planning to tell her on our trip to Rome, but i guess i should move on and try to accept the fact that we’ll probably never be together.

University is on break so I figured she was just on a flight and couldn't respond but how hard is it to just say ""hey something came up, talk to you later"" especially when you've shown interest to this person and they've shown interest in you?

I'm frustrated and a little disappointed.

I really like her a lot and I want her to be my girlfriend but I feel it might be too soon.

We’ve been on 3 dates in 3 months. I know it’s not a lot especially after 3 months but we’re both very busy and it’s hard to match our schedules up. Plus in the first month she was having family problems and now in the last month I’m having family problems so that’s taken away time as well. We also work together so I see her at least 3 times a week at work and we talk there too. We also text a lot.

Other than that when we spend time together it’s amazing. We’re so alike and so different at the same time that I feel it just works. We’re there for each other and it feels like she really cares about me.

When we had our first date she told me she didn’t know how she felt about me and that she wants to go slow because she wants to do this right and plus she’s never been in a relationship or been with a guy at all (this ties into that we haven’t kissed yet, yeah I know). I feel though after 3 months I think she does like me but she’s never verbally said it so idk.

We’re both introverts but even though I’m a lot more introverted I feel that Im gonna have to bring up the talk or else it’ll never happen.

So is it too soon to ask her? Even though we haven’t been on many dates I feel I’ve gotten to know her enough that I want to be with her. I’m not really sure what to say though. I was planning on having this convo on our 4th date. Any help would be appreciated.

then he got this new job. a very hard job. he would be working hard hours. going to culinary school in the morning then right after working at this job until night. he wouldn’t answer texts or calls, he even stood me up with explanation. when i told him i was just gonna move on (over text) he said “my life is in chaos and i haven’t had time to think, and i haven’t even had time for myself” then i told him to reach out when things get better. He never responded to that so i asked him if he would reach out and he never replied.

So, the man (30) I (27) have been dating for 8 months. We constantly messaging, talk on the phone for a good hour and a half every other day and try to see each other every week (we're both busy with work). He has told me everything about this job, his family history, his struggling relationship with his dad, his view on how religious he is, his ex's and what he did wrong. He also talks about his perception of himself as a man and caregiver and how he really wants to make partner at his job. He has also told me he loves me (albeit it was just him him texting me 'I love you' twice while he was drunk). We haven't had sex yet but make out and touch each other whenever we see each other. We haven't DTR but he has talked about us being parents and has made jokes how we would argue when we're husband and wife.

I've been a little more guarded with my feelings and haven't been as vulnerable to him due to my past ... which is also the reason for this question. At most I've said I like him but haven't expressed that he means a lot to me.

We instantly had great chats, spoke on the phone for an hour the next day, and met up in person for a dinner date that lasted 6 hours and ended with just kisses. We started seeing each other regularly. He told me he always dated with a purpose and told me about his future requirements and what he wanted. This aligned with what I want in a partner. He told me he wanted to see me exclusively, and I said I needed some time to think, I like him but don’t want to fall into things so quickly which he agreed. Once I agreed to be exclusive, he met my siblings, we slept together, would spend nights together a few times a week, he even gave me an access card to his building’s parking lot (anyone who lives in a big city will know this is a big deal!). His work schedule is demanding and requires a lot of travel, which he warned me about and I said is fine as long as there is communication and we talk about any issues as they arise. He was consistent, despite travelling throughout the work week. I am not someone who expects to text throughout the day, so I was happy with him showing up as he could. I think work started affecting his mental health, he had to cancel his holiday back home because of a project and had to keep travelling despite having an injury. This is when he started pulling away. I told him we didn’t need to have elaborate plans, and that I’d be happy just hanging with him at his place. Last time I saw him, I met his siblings at his apartment (after he cancelled on going out with me). The weekend after that, he was stressed and cancelled all his plans (including one with his friends) to stay at home because he was in a bad place. He cancelled on me, which I found frustrating since he cancelled on me the weekend before too. He opened up to me about how unhappy he is right now in his life around work and that it consumes him. I thought we had a good conversation about that, but that is the last time I’ve heard from him. 

Logically, I know it’s not personal and that he’s in a challenging space. But to ghost someone who you’ve asked to be exclusive with? I am beyond confused, and have expressed this over text with no response. 

Should I consider it over or wait for him to come back? I feel like I’ve been quite understanding, all I need is communication. This feels extremely disrespectful, but then at the same time I’m concerned about his mental health. We agreed to be exclusive, so I’m wary of forcing myself to move on. He’s ignored a few messages, so I’m not going to call him. He comes online on WhatsApp, so I’m not gonna show up at his place as he clearly doesn’t want to see me (as much as I’m dying to check on him).

I’m inexperienced in dating and what a woman exactly want, so I feel like this is a polite rejection because in my male perspective, that’s what I would do if I’m a female. This is in US for cultural reference, if it’s matter. 

Me: hey, do you want to have some sushi next week ? ( because I know she like sushi) And maybe go to see Batman after. I know this cool theater that is pretty nice. 

Her: I’m going home on my 3 days off. I’m sorry. 

Me: no, worry. Where is your home at?

Her: about 2 hours away. 

Me: do you wanna go any other time that you’re free? 

Her: I’m not sure just yet, I’m just getting over a break up.

Me: sure, sound good. Take all the time you need. 

I, of course, will continue to be casual and nice to her. But if someone, especially any female, here can give me  some insight on is this a polite rejection or I should ask her out again in 2 weeks? 

This decline is kind of hurt, so if there is a big chance that she just being polite and not outright saying “not interested”, I kinda don’t want to feel it again. But if there is a chance that I  may pull it through, I want to give it a shot because I think she may worth it.

So, what do you guys think. Is this a polite not interested or I should try  again in 2 weeks?
