I (28F) met this great guy (30) on a dating app about a week ago. When I first saw his profile, I immediately thought: Wow this guy is so handsome, I probably won't stand a chance. I almost swiped him left because of this but eventually was like why the hell not and was pleasantly surprised when we matched. We've been having great convos and have a lot in common so it's going great. We've also decided to meet up irl next week.

Now the thing is, I have a lot of difficulty falling in love and being truly attracted to someone. I only ever did so once before and at that time I too thought the guy was 'out of my league' to use those terms. Turns out he thought exactly the same about me. So eventually we had quite a happy relationship for some years but ended because of reasons.

Anyways, back to this guy. So I asked my friends for their honest opinion concerning the league thing. They were a bit amazed by the question and said we were equally attractive (me even slightly a bit more attractive which baffled me to hear) and certainly on the same playing field. 

Could this possibly be a good sign concerning the chances of irl attraction ? This is kinda the first time I really click so well with someone while thinking he could be unmatching me any second because he suddenly realizes he could get 'better'. But he doesn't. 

I'm just very nervous for the meetup. After having a lot of failed first dates where it turned out there was no attraction whatsoever, I really want this one to work out.

I’m also open to advice and suggestions. 

I (26F) haven’t dated that much since the lost of my husband three years ago. But I have met a few men and they all needed some sort of help. 

The first was 31 years old and divorced with one daughter. I am a firefighter and he told me he was police officer with his own place. After about two months, he was already ready to talk about marriage. Even though I really liked him and he treated me well, this still struck me as a red flag. Soon after the love bombing, he kept trying to get over to my place more and more and stay longer and longer. He would also offer to pay a bill or two but as a landlord, I knew the law and knew not to accept any money from him. I became uncomfortable with this and stopped inviting him over. I also noticed at he would always try to eat my food or hint at me buying him food. I decided to do a bit of digging and found out he had lost his job and his pension. He had also lost his place and the home he took me to three times was his mother’s home. When I told him, he tried to get me to let him live with me. Hell no. 

Guy number two was 28 and had two children. After three weeks and 5 dates, we established exclusivity. Then he revealed that he had lost his license and asked me do the leg work with the DMV to get his license reinstated. When I agreed to help, he then asked me to contribute $20 or so a week to paying off some fine required to get his license back. He also asked me to help paying his phone bill. I ended that relationship. 

I then met another guy who played the sympathy card. He was depressed, his brother was killed after we met, then he got into a car accident and needed a loan for a deposit on a rental. 

I also have friends who always ask for help as well. I meet these people in all different places. The supermarket, at work, etc.,  not just dating apps. I’m not really a generous person and I always say no. So I’m not sure why I attract these people.

I'm here mostly to seek some advice.

I've been in a relationship with this girl for a bit less than 3 months (I'm bisexual, a girl dating a girl). Let me start with the fact that I'm very insecure and suffer from depression. I tend to feel sad or mad for things that might not be exactly the way I've made them look in my head.

So my (ex?) girlfriend usually works at two places and drives a motorcycle for hours when she has free time (its her fav hobby or w/e). She usually drives the motorcycle during the weekend and works during the week. 

However, I told her that I need some time with her which should be outside of our houses (since she works late hours and its work from home). That means  I want some intimate time with her during the weekend. So she actually gives me a slot of a few hours during one of the weekend days (she spends the other time working that said day) and spends the next whole day riding with her friends. I obviously felt kind of bad because even when she gives me those few hours doing something outside, its usually spend with her friends. I said a few times that I want it to be a private, intimate time, but i still don't feel pleased. Usually we'd spend 1 to 3 hours alone, then again some friends would be invited. Of course, she would ask me beforehand if that is okay but the fact that I explicitly said I want ALONE time with her and she still does that makes me annoyed but I realized that she's really busy so i guess there's no other time for her to hang out with her friends.

So, yeah, I tried to be ok with that. Tried to be ok with the fact that she is not the type of person to give me reassurance even though I need it. I got used to the fact that she isn't very cuddly and so on.

However, there's this friend of hers. 

Initially she told me she doesn't label herself as bi/straight/gay and so on. Just that she hasn't been with a man in over 10 years. But there's this guy, I'd refer to him as X, that she is CONSTANTLY texting. I have even seen him texting her stuff like ""where did you go, why aren't you replying"" and so on. He's the guy she spends her days motorcycling with. He apparently even gets mad at her for not being available sometimes during the weekends as she has to work  or do something else. He even lent her his car since hers is being repaired for over a month now. 

The thing is, she has been telling me that he used to like her and ever since I came into the picture, he has been acting strange. She invited him a few times to hang out with me and her friends and the guy has always looked at me in a very weird way. Didn't even bother to say ""hello"". Eventually, the second time we hung out, I noticed that while he was joking with her, he placed his hands on her thighs and arms a few times. Obviously, I got mad and went home and told her that this is a bit too much. Well, apparently there is nothing wrong in her eyes. I brushed it off.

A few weeks ago, me and her got in a fight and she went out. Later that day, she told me she went to ride her motorcycle and she lied with whom. The day after she wanted me to hang out with her, the guy and another guy that she rides with (that second guy has been telling her that her and X would make a great couple). So while we were on our way to hang out with them, she told me she was mad at the second guy for something and I asked why she went to ride with him yesterday if she was mad at him and jokingly told her that she's a bad liar. That's when she told me she actually lied to me and she was actually riding with X. Then she proceeded to tell me that he probably doesn't like her and that she wasn't actually sure and so on. Just making excuses.

Well, today I was supposed to go out after work (I went to the office) but decided to go to my (ex) girlfriend's place. (I didn't let her know I was coming to see her, wanted to be a surprise) and lo and behold, mr. X was there. She was working at that time (talking to clients), so it's not like I walked over them doing something. It's just that she mentioned everything else she has been doing today but kind of forgot to tell me she had this special guest. So obviously, I furiously left.

We got into a fight an hour or so ago and I said that I can't be with someone that lies to me and hides from me. But in her eyes, I'm the wrong one since he is one of her closest friends and that she hasn't lied to me nor that she has to tell me whatever she is up to or with whom she is.

To me it feels like the end of the world, being this is my first long term relationship. Its also not helpful that i have anxiety so everything feels so extreme and like this is going to be the rest of forever even though i know thats not true. 

Alot of it, is to do with communication. He avoids negitive emotions or expressing what he doesnt like in fear of being a guy whos always nagging me or asking who im talking to ect... but i WANT to know that. 
I dont find it to be wrong to ask who im talking to if im on my phone or whatever. Ill do the same out of curiosity not to start a fight  
I told him you know your my boyfriend you can ask me whatever you want to know and ill tell you. Thats how it should be. I told him i actually miss those conversations because i felt closee to him and knew my limits with what he likes and doesnt like in general. 
But hes not from a good healthy evionment and hasnt had many good relationships. So it doesnt come naturally to speak how he feels because it always caused trouble so hes quiet just to keep things peaceful. 

Then i feel like hes not good at wording things and i usually end up feeling not the greatest. 
He tokd me he almost had a 3some and it was supposed to be a funny story but i was like no its not....and he got mad at me for feeling lied to when hes told me he doesnt habe an interest in that sort of thing. 
I personally have a fantasy of a 3some but its with two guys...but id be reassuring after that statement with ""its a fantasy i have but i dont expect it from you"" or something. Because my whole issue was before we where offical i asked if hed ever want that. He says he doesnt. That he was just single and desperate at the time but i need reassurance. Iv had guys expect me to just be a girl thats down for anything when im not interested in women the way their not interested in men. I always found it gross i guess how its just expected. 
Yeah im kinky but i have certain likes and dislikes. 
The worst part is when i flipped the script on him where i was like ""would you find it funny if i almost fucked 2 guys? "" he said he doesnt want to know anything iv done sextually without him. Double standard?? 

I just dont know how to get him to be a postive communicator. I mostly feel blamed for saying anything becuase he is usually defensive and im not sure exactly how i could help if at all. Any tips would be great.

Her parents live here and she been here most of 2020/2021 because she was able to work remotely ( but her company wants her to go back to office in September ). Funny thing is that her mother and my mother work together and reason why we met is because her mother wanted me to meet her.

I don’t know if her mother wanted to set us up or just wanted her to have a friend to go out while she was here, and that’s why I am on the edge. If this was a girl I met in a different contest I probably would have made a move. Her mother always asks about me, and told my mom that her daughter thought I was nice and had a cool accent when we went out for the first time.. and she asked her daughter if she was texting me ( I know all of this because that’s what she told my mom). Ah also she jokingly said it was a good match also because her husband and me work in the same field..

But I wanna get into the girl more. We went out a few times and we planning to go out couple times more after she comes back from her vacation and before she moves back. She is really cool when she texts me but this can also be she just wants to be nice. The last week when we out before her leaving for this vacation we texted almost every day.. one morning at 8 am she sent me a funny tik tok, and that was cool because I thought that meant she was thinking about me when she woke up.. or she also sent me a meme on IG. We went to the fair and she asked for a pic together and she took it or she wanted to buy 2 similar shirt ( one each) there to remember  this day.. she walks really close to me and in fact many times we literally bumped to each other shoulder to shoulder. Or lastly we shared our foods ( she literally took a bite of my ice cream cone or we shared our ramen once) and she mirrored my action once ( I turned off the A/C in the car and rolled the window down and sticked my arm outside and she did the same). I don’t know if those signals can tell me something or she is just trying to be nice.. also she has a lot of friends a”male friends and this could be how she acts with everyone. 

I was thinking next time to ask her if she is single ( even tough I know the answer) and based on how she reacts try to be more physical and see how it goes.

It kinda felt like dates when we went out, and what we talked about ( like favorite food, music, favorite cities, favorite book, or even if I’d like to get married one day or who do I Live with and where. She also showed me the pic of her new apartment and of her best gay friend ).

Met her on bumble about a year ago at the start of the pandemic in the spring. We talked a bunch and went on a few outside dates and were super compatible. Started dating in September after she moved back to college making us closer in terms of distance and made it official end of October. We were dating pretty seriously and met each other’s families. During this time I was finishing pharmacy school and was doing 40 hours of rotations a week plus working another 30ish operating cnc machines in the evenings. In January I started supporting myself financially by playing poker once casinos opened up. I was getting exhausted with my work schedule and only could see her after I was done work at 10 pm or weekends. Poker allowed me to make my own schedule and I was very successful making around 18k in 2.5 months. I did not tell her about this at first because I wasn’t pursing it as a career but rather as a short term gig until graduating in a few months. However she was aware from early on that I enjoyed playing poker so it’s not like this was completely new information. So she confronted me about it eventually in late January after noticing my snap location a few times. I explained everything and although she wasn’t thrilled with it I think she tried to understand that it wasn’t straight up gambling and it was ok for a while. 

Breakup: One weekend early March I decided to make a trip down to Atlantic City rather than my usual Cardroom. On the drive back next morning I was rather sleep deprived and ended up getting in an accident by nodding off a second and swerving into the median. Car needed some work but I was fine although that seemed to be the final straw for her. The following week she tried an intervention on me telling me I needed to see this therapist and I needed to stop. I was pretty ticked off by how the therapist had made a diagnosis and recommendations without ever speaking to me first. I was willing to compromise by cutting down the amount of hours I was playing but I wasn’t willing to stop completely. We said our goodbyes through tears and that was the last time we saw each other. I reached out a few more times often while a bit drunk but stopped around early May. 

After about two months of no contact she reached out to me this week. I’m on vacation for the week so wasn’t thrilled to have to think about this all week. We have one phone call and have been texting. Tells me she misses me and asks if we can be friends. I say ok but am pretty hesitant bc why now if nothing has really changed in terms of why we broke up. I expressed my general hesitancy, say it will be hard to be just friends, and asked about her expectations. She says can we not put a label on anything whether it’s friends or something else. She just can’t be putting labels on things atm. All she knows is that she misses me. But doesn’t want to think about the future rn. She also asks to meet up at this point which I agree to and we also agreed that we are not having sex. However I feel like it is inevitable especially if we continue to meet up. I would appreciate some advice or insight as I’m not entirely sure what I want to do in this situation.

I ended up joining bumble and hinge and have since matched with a bunch of people. I have gone on 5 dates so far and have second dates for all 5. 

My problem is I have serious, serious problems going out with 1 person. After the first person, I thought right, thats it, I really like you, you're the one, but had already committed to the other 4 dates because I didn't think I'd get that far.

I ended up going on all 5 dates, so now I'm seeing 5 people, (I'm planning on telling them about the other 4 on the second date) but my major issue is I have no clue how to narrow down my dates, and whether to stop talking to the people on bumble and hinge that I have not arranged dates with but still talked to. 

This is majorly weird because I've never been in a relationship nor have I dated people before, I'm not necessarily looking for anything but nor am I just fucking around, I just thought I'd see what is in there romantically and if there's anything I like.

Firstly, it's full of sketchy almost model like people with funny names.
Secondly, women get everything free while men have to pay for everything.

If you text someone they rarely reply, and even if they do it quickly dies. If you match someone, they always pretend they didn't see that. Once again, you won't get anything out of it. 

Those features that are free, are pointless. So the first half.of users are fake profiles, and the other half are very undesirable people which you can message. As if there was some sort of ranking system who's worth using as bait or something.

The profiles I've seen were very unnatural and so were the people.
I mean, come on. Why on earth would models and successful people waste nights and days on a dating app? No, not going to happen.

Is there even a legitimate way to find a mate online? No matter of convincing will sway my beliefs. I don't care if you were successful. It's not about equality. It's about domination at this point.

I found my current date/""partner"" just 2 weeks after I joined Tinder, and even though I dated 3-4 other girls in the meantime, I stuck with her, and we've been exclusive for the past 2 months now. I live in a small town, so partners are pretty hard to find here, especially for guys.

Sex is simply amazing, her libido is off the chart. Plus, she's attractive, she's funny, she's intelligent, she's nice, caring and affectionate...  but I feel like I'm not in *love* with her. 

I have a hard time finding out *why* exactly. Is it because of my ex? I still think about her (I don't feel sad or anything), even though I now realize that we weren't compatible anymore.

Or is it because the girl I'm dating has a personality that I'm not attracted to? She's pretty much the opposite of my ex : My ex was very calm. Low-energy, yet fairly extraverted and loved to have 1 on 1 discussions. The girl I'm dating is very expressive (her voice and mannerisms, mostly), but she's somehow introverted and isn't really that good at engaging deep conversations. On the other hand, she has a very good sense of humor and talking to her online is really fun (I work FIFO 14/14, so it's ideal), she's amazing with kids and would be a A+ mother, she has geek interests (ex did not), etc.

I'm pretty much confused right now. Part of me thinks it's because of my ex, and part me of thinks it's because of her personality. I really have no idea, and I don't want to hurt her.

I had a bad relationship where we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, but the guy put his friends, male and female, on a pedestal. If I made a friend upset or uncomfortable (intentionally or not) he would get defensive and demand I apologize to them. However, if a friend made me upset or uncomfortable (also intentionally or not), he wouldn’t push for them to apologize, and wouldn’t comfort me. It was still my fault for getting upset because “he knows his friend didn’t mean it” and I was just being overly sensitive. We also had problems with one female friend of his, who I wasn’t allowed to meet when it was only her and my ex hanging out.

Despite his reassurance that she was just a longtime close friend, I strongly suspected that he cheated on me with her one night, when they hung out to buy decorations for a party, then decorated his house, and chilled afterwards until midnight. At every instance, my ex did not want me to come over to hang out and meet her, not even after they were finished decorating. The cherry on top is he told me he loves his friends, but doesn’t love me and is not in love with me. I should have seen all of that as a huge red flag. 

That constant treatment of feeling inferior to his friends has caused me to harbor a lot of trust issues that are finding their way into my new relationship. That past relationship made me crave someone to treat me as special, because I instead was being treated as a friend he had sex with. And sometimes, less than a friend.

My current boyfriend tells me he genuinely loves me, but that he loves his friends too. The problem lies with that my boyfriend says I am special to him, but I don’t feel like I am special because he tells his friends he loves them. I want to be treated as special, because I treat my relationship partners as special too. Hearing that he loves his friends makes me question the nature of our relationship: is sex and sexual attraction the only thing that separates me from a female friend? I don't want that to be the only distinction.

I have close male and female friends, but “love” for them has never crossed my mind. I’ve always thought that the word ""love"" was reserved for family and romantic partners. By my logic, I don't feel love for my friends, but I do care about them a lot and would help them if they asked. Love is a special term for me. Obviously you should only tell someone you love them if you're genuine, but I feel like because my boyfriend tells most, if not all, the people in his life he loves them, then it just doesn't really mean anything to me anymore. I have many people who I care about, but few I genuinely love.

My boyfriend has a close female friend who I'll call Sara; he tells me he thinks of her as an older sister. But if he does see her as a sister, I don't know why he can't understand that it makes me uncomfortable and uneasy to see Sara comment ""my love"" on his Instagram photos, or when she buys him clothes, or when I found a postcard she sent talking about how much she enjoyed their ""movie date"" and wants to do it again, because he says ""that's just what good friends do for each other."" My boyfriend says I shouldn't be afraid of him cheating because Sara has a boyfriend of her own. Maybe I could understand buying clothes, but in terms of platonic feelings or relationships, I'm not tone deaf because I have a brother and male friends. I wouldn't call either ""my love"" or call our hangouts a date. And maybe I'm just weird, but if I was Sara's boyfriend, I would find it suspicious if I saw my girlfriend call another guy ""my love"" and apparently went on ""movie dates"" with him.

I don't want to control who my boyfriend's friends are, but I also don't know how I can accept being in a relationship with a guy who ""loves"" all his female friends as much as he loves me, it seems.

My boyfriend has suggested that my perception of friendship and love is flawed, which may be true, as beyond just providing emotional support, none of my friends have done as much for me as much as his friends have done for him. However, it's still hard for me to change my stance. He essentially has told me that this is a part of his identity that won't change; he feels genuine love for a lot of people.

While I do feel uncomfortable, I know a large part of it stems from the trust issues I developed from my past relationship. We've had several discussions about this topic already. I still want to attempt working through this with my current boyfriend, but I don't know where to start. I appreciate everyone who read the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - I have a hard time understanding, feeling happy, and coping with the fact that my current boyfriend loves me, but also loves his friends (male and female.) Because he loves all of us, I'm afraid that the only distinction I have is that my boyfriend has sex with me.

We don't work together a lot and at first we didn't talk much but as of late when we are in each other's company we get along well and have good conversations. I'm kinda socially awkward but om this day I was being confident and was making great conversation. She is kinda shy too but more confident. She is pretty but not to the point where she is out of my leauge.
Some of the times she would bring up stuff about other people and their relationships and how bad they were together.  This last time she brought up a girl who also works here who is mad at her because a guy she went on one date with like a year ago who used to work here texted her again and asked her if she wanted to go on vacation together as friends. I know, very weird. But somehow this girl found out.

So we talked about that and I supported her and said it's not her fault and agreed that the guy is weird etc. Well she went on to say sometimes the guys she's been with get too clingy and that she doesn't like it. But besides that we talked about a lot of things and I made her laugh and we talked about movies and books a lot. We have very similar senses of humor and we have a lot of similarities. Well I brought up the fact that I'd be leaving in two weeks and that I found a new job, she asked where and I told her. It's a better job and pays decently.  I decided since we were hitting it off so well that I would ask her if she wanted MY number or my snapchat to not put her in a uncomfortable situation. She said she doesn't use her snap a lot so I should give her my number. I then wrote it on a piece of paper and said something along the line of "" I don't just give this away to anyone."" She said "" wow I must be important huh?"" And laughed. I smiled and said  ""Something like that"",  but kinda panicked cause it seemed to off went so well and said well ill probably give it to a few people before I eave. I listed a few guys and then stupidly said a girl who works their who is really attractive but is only my friend.
I saw her the next day but only briefly as their were a lot of people coming and going, she works day and I work swing shift. We didn't say much. But a few days later when I was at the point where I assumed she would not text me, she did. The following Tuesday about 4-5 days later. We had a decent conversation but somehow got stuck on the movie subject again. Our last message was about a movie I saw on Netflix that was bad because the ending was stupid. She said she watched the trailer and won't watch it because she was afraid of clowns. I said that I think you watched the wrong trailer because the movie doesn't involve clowns haha. But I told her about my fear of clowns as well. So the conversation ended kinda naturally, it wasn't like she didn't respond to a question or anything. 

This was nearly 2 days ago now and she hasn't responded. She mentioned she is going to part time here and is starting a new 2nd job somewhere else. I have a little over a week left now here but haven't see her at all this week, which isn't that uncommon. 

My question is do I wait this out not text her until she texts back to not come across as clingy and weird like the other guys? Was it just a symphathy text so it wouldnt be awkward if we saw each other and she didn't text me or does the fact that she even texted me mean she was interested? Do I need to make it more apparent that I'm interested in her and maybe ask if she wants to do something ( see a movie, go out to eat?) Or should I wait until it's closer to when we wouldn't possibly be working together.  Should I just try to talk to her in person?

[This post follows on from an incident 2 days ago - see link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ofxcne/sent_screenshot_to_my_date/h4fvkhk/?context=3)

Basically, I've been on 2 dates with this girl that I have been set up with through a mutual friend.

Date 1 was great, we agreed to see each other again, and we marked Sunday evening to see each other. We had some drinks, then agreed to grab a bite as we both were having a great time, held hands on our walk back, and just had an overall nice time. When i texted her the day after the date, she offered to meet up early in the week, or otherwise tell me asap if she can do Sunday because her parents/brother were visiting. I usually see this as a bad sign, but in any case, she messaged me the next night and offered Tuesday/Wednesday as she was having her parents over.

Date 2 was set in stone for Wednesday night. We had a 2 hour dinner, and at the end, I invited her to come hang out with me and my puppy on the weekend. She immediately said yes and would message me to organise when. I then jokingly mentioned how an idiot friend mentioned a theory about how when girls say 'I'll let you know' they never do - she laughed and said I should tell him he's an idiot, and she re-confirmed she would message me to organise.

Now in between date 2 and right now, the incident above happened. I sent her a screenshot of our conversation, which was intended for our mutual friend who wanted an update. The screenshot had nothing that would be deemed private. She doesn't text a lot, is very short/forward with everything, so our messages were just setting up logistics / saying we had a good time on the date. Nothing else.

She ended up replying to my message with a **crying/laughing emoji** and said '**its ok**'. I didn't reply as I have previously initiated conversation and whilst she reciprocates, she clearly is not a big texter (our mutual friend confirmed this too). She's very brief with her responses, takes hours, and we haven't texted a whole lot between dates, just because I don't want to come off as over the top.

It is currently Saturday afternoon at 12PM, and I have yet to hear from her about the weekend. I obviously know her plans for the weekend, and she knows mine. I'm a bit of a planner, and like to organise. I guess not hearing from her is giving me slight anxiety (which I know is my problem). Our mutual friend has given me the advice that I am overthinking every single detail and trying to plan this out, and just need to chill.

So my question now is, should I still be waiting for her to message me about this weekend? Or should I reach out myself now? I guess if she hasn't messaged me by know, I should know. If I message and ask, her response or lack of may also answer my question. I'm only holding out hope as the last time this happened, she let me know and reached out. This time she hasn't.

Any advice?

So me (19M) and my friends went to Florida for a week, me and my other friend met these girls at the pool and we hit it off pretty well especially with my friend and the girl he was talking to. I will call this girl who I was talking to um... Casey (17F.) So me and Casey had a bit of an connection just with a couple of minutes meeting each other, things were going really well. Later on that night we hung out with just the two of us and we got to know a bit about ourselves and during our conversation she was talking about relationships and how she had a weird history with it, she mentioned that she was talking to someone back home (remember this because this is important) and I accepted that we were just going to hang out throughout the week and that's fine. 

As the days go by we start to like each other more but we knew we weren't going to see each other again after this trip, it was a little frustrating but I was able to manage my feelings. Now a few days past and me and my friend snuck these girls out to come over to our house that were staying at. We started to watch a movie and eventually my friend and his girl left to go into another room, me and Casey started to drink (well I had 5 cups before she came over) and the drinks weren't strong but it was enough to get you a little tipsy. One thing led to another and we started to make out and dry humping each other and she came while I didn't so she tried to get me off by going down on me. She didn't get to finish because we were interrupted unfortunately. 

The next day I went up to her and she talked to me about how she forgot most of what happened last night and I explained what happened but I thought it was weird how she just forgot about it because she only had 2 cups of alcohol that wasn't that strong. She went on about how we weren't going to see each other again and how she was talking to someone (like I mentioned earlier) but she let it get that far and she offered to just be friends like we were before. It was an awkward night as we were watching a movie together and it was weird to even make eye contact. Tomorrow is our last day in Florida and she kinda messed up my vibe, I didn't go to see her because of happened the night before. I talked about what went down with my friends and we came to the conclusion that Casey was lying about forgetting with what we did which made sense. 

Honestly I think she did that to cover it up when she goes back home and talk to the guy she mentioned. This irked me so much but eventually I got over it, I spent my last day with friends all day without contacting her. I kinda feel like an asshole for doing that but it is what it is on that. I don't think I'll get a chance like this again in a very long time but I'd rather had it happen than not. Anyways that's how the cookie crumbles I guess.

But yeah, I've done the online dating thing since I was 18 (I'm now 26, going on 27) and had probably a total of 4-5 dates from it, none of which led to a 2nd. I've been in one semi-serious relationship in my life with a girl I worked with in-between that. At that time in my life though, I worked in food service where there was inherent social interaction. Currently, I work from home and my job is very very independent, so there's really not any such interaction with anyone whatsoever other than my supervisor. Point being, I've started 0 relationships from online dating. It sounds like this isn't a totally unique experience. 

Anyway, the general rule seems to be that dating comes from participating in social activities frequently and just meeting women organically, but my whole life, I've just never been a ""friends"" person. I don't mind being by myself, and frankly, the idea of having more than a couple of friends has always been very overwhelming for me. Besides, like I said, I'm going on 27 years old, which might be young in the grand scheme of things, but it's a bit old to change something like that. I also don't want to just socialize just so I can meet someone. At this point in my life, I just want that special person, and that's it.

Being the way I am, you can imagine I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable just approaching a stranger at a supermarket (from what I read, this isn't a very successful approach anyway), so I guess I'm just wondering what my other options are, or if I should just make peace knowing that it's probably just not gonna happen for me? Not trying to be a victim here at all, just want to know if there's anything I'm not thinking of basically. Any advice would be appreciated.

He was quite responsive &amp; was often cracking jokes and seemed enthusiastic to have a conversation so that was awesome. After a couple of days we began chatting on Instagram. We would chat day &amp; night. 

One thing I noticed was that he never seemed interested to talk about deeper topics.. he was just constantly cracking jokes &amp; poking fun. He kept calling himself “annoying &amp; asked me to be ready to be annoyed “. 

One day somehow we stumbled into a convo where he said he just got out of a huge messy relationship &amp; how he doesn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings moving forward. I said I understand and that we would both be honest about how we feel moving forward. He agreed. 

After about a week of knowing him, we met up casually (not a date just a brief meet up) we just sat in his car the whole time. The energy was kinda off. I felt so nervous &amp; self-conscious. He even said that I seemed too serious. Anywho, he ended up revealing a lot more about his breakup and he said that he is only looking for someone to talk to &amp; be friends with. He does not want a rebound. I was super disappointed &amp; I could feel my whole body shiver. I told him my goal was to form a romantic connection. I told him I’m not looking for commitment but atleast that we should be looking in the same direction. 

After that he became pretty distant &amp; aloof, and I started to panic. After not hearing from him for 24 hours, I texted him. He said that he was ignoring me, and then followed it up with “kidding” . At this point I was posed and told him I felt things were off. He agreed they kind of were. I ended up telling him that I’m not comfortable to continue talking if I’m looking for a romantic connection and he just a friendly one. He said he understood and that he can’t make any promises and feels he needs to get clear with his head first. He also kept telling me that I am too good and that I deserve to live according to my principles. We ended with good by and good luck. I then unfollowed him &amp; removed him from my Insta too. 

Anyways… I’m confused whether I did right or wrong. Was I right to set my standards and walk away when they weren’t being met ? Did I dodge a bullet ?

I’ve had plenty of good conversations but unless there are clear signs I won’t make a move. 

This girl would not stop talking and was at the counter just standing there and keeping the conversation going, my coworker said that even her friends were annoyed that she kept talking to me. I was like she’s cute why not ask for Instagram, I asked, she gave it to me and we continued the conversation for like 5 more minutes, but I found myself turning red bc I’m just behind the counter so I felt like a little cornered lol.

She told me she was leaving Sunday and she left, said bye, but hasn’t followed me back so maybe I read things wrong. And my supervisor was happy for me and he’s like around the same age as me so he was just hyped for me. 

But now I’m wondering if she doesn’t follow me back I’m going to feel sort of dumb, but like I’ve gone out with customers before in other jobs so I sort of know when to make a move if that makes sense. Idk I just was so nervous even though I’ve asked out a bunch of girls before, but I didn’t cross any boundaries right.

Before we got into our relationship, he mentioned a time when he had sex with another girl. He didn’t tell me many details, but just the unique nature of it (it was at his work place). Honestly at the time it was fine because we both talked about that sort of stuff. It wasn’t a long term gf he was with just a hookup. 

Now, we’re in a relationship of 7 months. That story, out of a few others kept popping up in my head since we’ve gotten in a relationship. I wanted to know more but now that we’re together, he would feel weird about it. This particular story popped in my head a few times recently and I kind of wanted to know more. It was just a hookup and not one of his long term gfs or exes at the time so it didn’t really bother as me as much. I’m a virgin so I’ve never really had those experiences. 


I asked him to tell me about that time in the office. He asked why &amp; if I was sure and if I would get mad. I told him I wouldn’t and I genuinely didn’t think I would. I was curious. He said he felt weird telling his girlfriend about a time he had sex with someone else but did it anyway hesitantly at first because I asked.

So, he told me. In great detail. The story took an hour to tell. I was expecting a 10-15 min summary. 
I honestly wasn’t expecting that much detail. Some parts, I was actually getting turned on hearing about. Is that weird? I wasn’t turned on that he was with another girl. Just the scenario of what was happening if that makes sense. When I thought about the fact that it’s him with another girl, it made me kind of sad. We haven’t had sex and he’s a lot more experienced than me. So I’m sad that certain things he’s done with her and other girls, I wanted to do that with him. But he’s experienced it already.... 
idk. I kind of wished there were some things he hadn’t done so he could experience it with me for the first time. But I can’t change the past. 
Idk why I asked him honestly but now I can’t get it out of my head. I feel slightly bothered but idk if I have any right to express that I am or that I’m sad because he asked me to make sure I wouldn’t be mad/sad. 
Any thoughts or words of advice on this, and how to get it out of my head? Also is it weird if I got a little turned on by it? 

tl;dr - I asked my boyfriend to tell me about him having sex with another girl and now I feel slightly turned on and sad/bothered by it. Idk what to do.

Edit: we’re both Muslim so having sex before marriage isn’t allowed and also looked down upon. I’m a virgin and also we are in a long distance relationship. There have been many times where I’ve wanted to have sex with him but we couldn’t because we were apart. So us not having sex in the first 7 months doesn’t seem that odd or off to me. Immediately having sex in a relationship is not something I want for myself, so I don’t see it as him not wanted to have sex with me.
