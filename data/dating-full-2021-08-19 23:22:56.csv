So I matched with this girl last week on tinder and we started talking. Starts off with basic small talk and then she eventually tells me that she‚Äôs from Mexico (which I thought was super cool) and is going to language school here from August-December. Her English over text was okay not amazing but good enough. After texting for a few days I ask her on a date. She happily agreed to it and a few days later we go on our first date. 

We meet at our meeting spot and I approach her, we greet and have a hug. Right off the bat she‚Äôs super talkative. No awkward small talk at the beginning or anything like that. We walk about 10-15 minutes or so to the restaurant. Have dinner which went well, good flowing conversation, laughs, etc. Then after dinner I had asked if she wanted to walk around a little more and she enthusiastically said yes. We walk along the waterfront of the city, which looks great at night, she seemed to think it was cool. Still good flowing conversation on the walk. I walked her back to her train station and had planned to go in for a hug and tell her that I had a lot of fun and that we should see each other again sometime soon. But she beat me to it lol. She went in for a hug and after said ‚Äúthis was a lot of fun I really hope to see you again sometime‚Äù before I could even say anything. And I responded with something along the lines of ‚ÄúI had a great time too and we can definitely see each other again‚Äù. This was on a Sunday so I mentioned Friday but she said she was busy on Friday (which she mentioned during our date but it had slipped my mind bc Friday was my only day available for the coming week). So I said ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs right, then we‚Äôll plan something for the next week then‚Äù and she said ‚Äúit sounds good‚Äù. Her speaking English was decent, she definitely speaks it better than writing it.

Since the first date ended she‚Äôs been super slow responding to texts. She didn‚Äôt take too long to respond after the date and the next day but has gotten slower and slower over time. I asked her if she was going to be free next Monday or Tuesday and she responded saying ‚Äúyes I think so‚Äù and also said ‚Äúhello‚Äù right after (not sure why, maybe because she‚Äôs still learning how to communicate in English). Hours after that I said hello then asked if she wanted to get ice cream and walk around the local park afterwards on either Monday or Tuesday. It‚Äôs been over 24 hours now and no response. 

Another thing to add is that I‚Äôm not looking for anything serious right now. More something casual since I‚Äôm moving next year. But I hadn‚Äôt told her that yet. I‚Äôm thinking maybe I should tell her because maybe she thinks I want something serious and she doesn‚Äôt want something serious. Or maybe she just isn‚Äôt interested anymore. I really don‚Äôt know what to do bc I really would like a second date with her.

I need some advice. 

I got married young (at 23) and divorced 3 years later. I'm about 2 years out of that relationship and very very happy.

There's a lot too it but my relationship with my ex was horrific. He was extremely abusive and I suffered a lot of trauma from it. It was a terrifying and awful experience I never thought I'd escape but somehow did. After a lot of self work, therapy, etc I finally started dating again about a year ago. I've healed from that but of course the damage will always be there. 

I recently met an amazing guy 3 months ago - he's honestly the man of my dreams. He's so kind, loving, and everything I'd been hoping for and more. 

I'm thinking that it could turn into something serious, and I really want to tell him about my past. We haven't really talked about past relationships (he's in his early 30s), and I haven't brought up the fact that I am divorced. 

I know I probably should have brought it up sooner and wish I had, but here I am and now am wondering how to disclose it the best way. I'm over my ex and moved on, but of course no matter how much work I've done on myself the trauma from the abuse in that relationship will always be there in a sense and it is difficult for me to talk about no matter how much of a better spot I am in now.

Been together for 7 months and we love each other lots. We have a lot in common and are happy being together.

I currently run a business and have been doing this for a few years now. Since last year, I‚Äôve also been doing buying and selling cars with my business partner.

Since I met my girlfriend, the longer we‚Äôve been together, the more we seem to spend time together.

We live 2.5 hours away and she usually comes to me and we go halves on a hotel every week. Usually it‚Äôs 2-5 nights a week that we do.

It has drained a lot of my money and I‚Äôm starting to see the effects of it as I‚Äôm feeling a bit poor.

My girlfriend is very needy and requires a lot of attention. She has minor mental health issues with anxiety and just feels really comfortable when she‚Äôs around me.

My business partner today has told me he feels our car sales have been slowing down recently because I‚Äôve been too busy with either my current business or spending it with my girlfriend. He says when I don‚Äôt spend time with her, I‚Äôm working trying to make up for the losses for when I was with her and not working.

He was suggesting maybe we should stop doing car sales as it‚Äôs not working as I‚Äôm too busy with her or working my business.

He works 4 days on and 4 days off by the way.
She currently has been given less hours at work so only works 2 days a week.

I forgot to mention - I‚Äôm still living with my mum and she‚Äôs living with her dad. I‚Äôm welcome round hers but when I‚Äôm there, I can‚Äôt work.
It‚Äôs awkward for her to come round mine so we avoid it.

I like doing business with my business partner but also like spending time with my girlfriend.

I do feel we waste a lot of money in the hotels and that I give her too much of my time.

It has been 20 days this month so far and I‚Äôve spent 11 days with her already. We‚Äôve recently booked another 5 for next week.

How many times a week should I be seeing her?

My girlfriend and I have hit it off really well  and have a solid relationship up until a week or so ago. 


She returned 2 weeks ago from her home town and moved back into her house here in state for college. 

When she got back she just wasn‚Äôt her self, something was off. She wasn‚Äôt really excited to see me, and the communication has just been really off for this past week. Leaving me really worried that she was losing interest in me. 

So she went out to breakfast with some of her girlfriends (which I didn‚Äôt know about, which is fine, I just had no idea). I thought I saw a guy with her so I ask if there was something else more going on, which she of course denied. 


I hurt her really bad, I had no idea how bad I just fucked up. There was no reason for me to think that, I had no serious intentions behind it. Not even hooking up, just seeing someone else.

I‚Äôve been getting the occasion text message for the past 4 day, I‚Äôve been doing everything I can to try to make it right again  but to no avail. She says she needs time which is alright with me , it‚Äôs just killing me I can‚Äôt try to help.

Met a 34yo man on hinge with the ‚Äúopen to children‚Äù or ‚Äúwant children‚Äù filter on. The sub text being that we‚Äôre both looking for something serious. He‚Äôs hot, great job, nice home, smart, treated me with a ton of class.

After our first date the texting was fun but revealed a couple things:

He‚Äôs mentioned my age multiple times exaggerating me being older 

He‚Äôs not on social media and isn‚Äôt into it (initially red flag for me but seemed like a positive in terms of his need for validation)

He isn‚Äôt aware of cultural things like memes or even a lot of music within genres he likes. Can‚Äôt keep up with cultural references that you‚Äôd pick up from a decade online. 

But he knows about insta models and their weight loss teas

And the price and language of OF. He‚Äôs interacting with women on OF. 

He doesn‚Äôt date much, claims he rarely meets someone he likes enough for a second date. Presents as a bit lonely and vulnerable. 

Been very flattering and showing me a lot of attention. I keep a distance and have good boundaries so I noticed right away when I started craving his attention after just a few days of his texts. 

In the past, I would‚Äôve figured that I was safe to feel this out for a while and see where it goes, but I know now that if I‚Äôm being love bombed I could lose control over my feelings/ego.

a few months ago i did meet someone online and we didn't have any of these problems. we clicked right away and we talked everyday for 2 months. unfortunately we never dated because he moved to a different country :( but it was so easy to talk to him and i enjoyed it a lot. is that how it's supposed to be? and why is that not happening more? is there something i'm doing wrong or is it just that you click with some people and not others? if it's the latter, what are the odds that i'll click with someone else like that again... i know that's an impossible question but that's never happened to me before and i really hope that wasn't my only chance :(

So a girl at my job messaged me about a work social event I was running, one thing led to another &amp; after some witty banter I gave her my phone #. We then proceeded to text throughout the week (two different convos, stretched out over 2-3 days each). I even asked to schedule a call Sat, she initially agreed: ‚ÄúLmao sure you can call me on Saturday :)‚Äù  

I end scheduled a surprise trip that Saturday to see my best friends; I asked if she could reschedule. I even offered to set aside an hour but she playfully insisted I spend the time with my friends.  

But when I ask to reschedule, she hit me with a variation of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy‚Äù and didn‚Äôt give any time to reschedule. All of a sudden, she lost interest. Tried starting another convo the next Tues, was incredibly dry &amp; completely changed in tone; I stopped bothering after the second reply.  

In our 2 conversations, these signs convinced me she was flirting:  

-matched the amount of messages I sent &amp; always replied quickly (30 min or less during the daytime, 10 min or less at night)
-used a healthy amount of emojis &amp; LOLs/LMAOs  
-asked me about me (what I like to do, what I studied, etc)  
-told me about her outfit, when I asked if she was out &amp; about she sent me a selfie of herself  
-when I made a witty remark at one point, she replied ‚ÄúüòÇ‚Äù That‚Äôs cute haha‚Äù  

I‚Äôve asked friends/family for insight and I‚Äôve now had two different people tell me she was just being friendly. Everything my gut was telling me was saying she was into me, not even in a wishful thinking sense. Now I have zero idea whether I can trust my own instincts, and zero grasp on what‚Äôs true. The disparity between what I‚Äôm seeing and what others have seen is driving me absolutely nuts.  

I‚Äôve already made up my mind that I‚Äôm not gonna try, don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable for her sake and my job‚Äôs sake.

For the last month, conversations had been 1 sided. We weren't dating exclusively, but I was tired of feeling like I was making the first move all the time. We did have a date planned when this was going on (didn't even know if she would accept Bc of the less communication but she did) but had to cancel because she fainted a couple days before. Yeah, that happened, she posted on social media about it so I know she wasn't lying. 

She would give me a lot of attention for a girl not wanting anything serious. Commenting ""üòçüòç"" on my Instagram pictures, FaceTiming me a lot, texting me to be safe when she knew I was out, texting me in the morning wishing me a good day when she knew I was stressed, and showing a lot of interest. 

She's 20 and I'm 23. After she had been giving me so much attention, I asked her where we were at. She said she wasn't looking for anything serious at the time, but also said she didn't know if she wanted it casual only or not. She's younger so I understand that she may not know what she wants. 


Our last conversation I voiced my concern about conversations being one sided. She said it was hard to drive an hour to come see me and that she ""needed space from this relationship for a little"". I told her if she wanted to cut ties it was completely understandable and cool no harm no foul, &amp; that if she needed space I would leave her alone. Told her I didn't want any energy wasted on either end. 

Her response was ""I've said it so many times now. I just want space rn. Thank you."". I didn't bothering replying, and I haven't talked to her in over 2 weeks. She's been traveling a lot and seeing her friends. She's still in school too. 

I want to test the waters in a couple weeks and see if she's down to talk again. By then it'll be over a month of no contact. She removed me from her private Snapchat story after our last conversation but still views my stories and follows me on everything. I haven't tried talking to her at all. 

Last time we saw eachother, she showed me a cool canvas to hang on my wall  I'm actually going to get it because it's dope as hell. I wanna send her a picture of it since she will recognize it and gauge her vibes. 

Last conversation didn't end well. Maybe she was frustrated with me since I kept asking for clarification. I don't know if I should appologize or not. I've never been in this situation before and want to be flirty and casual about this. 

Yes i am an ISFP. I got cheated on in my last relationship and still working to fix my issues from that before I get into a relationship with someone else. I've been seeing a few girls since this but I miss her company. Not sure if saying I miss you Is too much.

I (24F) had recently been on a date with someone which turned out to be the most horrible date I have been on.

I am giving him the benefit of doubt however that being said I do have my doubts which I don't want to affect how I feel about him before even going on the date. He proposed to meet next weekend and I told him it would be better if we video call first before the date because I don't want to waste my time or his and end up feeling shitty about myself (the last date really lowered my confidence which I am working to build up again).

I want to date and fall for someone which hopefully means I‚Äôm not aromantic since I don‚Äôt want to be but idk if I could just be incapable of love. I‚Äôve had crushes but never really on someone I was actually seeing. 

I know I have time but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never find the right person who also wants me, or that I‚Äôll never overcome my dating anxieties which are getting in the way. I can just easily see myself repeating these patterns until suddenly all my friends are married and I‚Äôm still a relationship virgin. I also have absolutely no idea how to find someone outside of apps. I haven‚Äôt been asked out by someone not from an app since that guy in high school.

We met on Tinder and have discussed for a week on Snapchat - he asks questions, we joke around a bit, I get good vibes. He lives close to me.

He‚Äôs currently studying in a police department school, so for that reason I feel fairly safe getting into his car for a chill ride.

The reason **I proposed a car ride for a first date** was simply because:

- covid has gotten worse where I live, don‚Äôt want to go to coffee shops etc
- car rides are nice: we can chat about surroundings &amp; it‚Äôs chill
- we both live in a suburb, there‚Äôs not much you can do except walk in a forest, and it‚Äôs cold and rainy here every day

I'm sure this topic has been done to death but I want to ask for some specific advice.

Just before my area went into lockdown a few months ago, I (23F) went on a date with a guy (24M) I met through OLD. There were already some restrictions at that time, so all we did was go for a walk and get dinner. I had a great time talking to him and I'm quite sure he did as well. 

We haven't been able to meet up again since. For the first month or so it didn't matter; we were chatting every day, sending eachother memes, nudes etc. The last few weeks it has kind of tapered off. Sometimes I will initiate conversations, and he replies, but I feel like he's lost interest, or else we've run out of stuff to talk about.

If that's the case then fair enough, but I feel like if we were able to see eachother in person we would still be getting along really well, having a great time etc. I'm a very active and social person, but I have very little dating experience.

Thought it the show, I make a few jokes/comments and she laughs. I suggest we get closer to the stage to hear and she agrees and we get with the rest of audience. 

Intermission happens, so I go help her as an excuse to better talk to her, and she welcomes it. We laugh a bit more, then she brings up she as a boyfriend.

Mostly from his friend since he was the better looking one but you know just superficial stupid thoughts I have since I'm not used to interacting with the male species yet I try to rationalize and tell myself that it's a very dumb thing to do to be so aware of how men in the room perceive me. I can say this week that it went away and I don't really care about the other guy anymore like he's cute but he doesn't talk all that much and can't really be interested in him so it doesn't matter, but I don't know about the guy I mentioned you, he's not ugly but he's really not my type (If i actually have one which I'm not sure since my type only applies to celebrities and not real people but idk) he's very charismatic, i like hearing him talk, he seems smart and we think similarly. Lately I thought a lot about him, tried to look at him when he wasn't looking, really pay attention to whatever he said, would daydream a little about talking to him even though I could do it without a problem but that's the thing, I don't ever feel nervous around him which leads me to think that maybe I don't actually like him but I consider other reasons to think that I could be wrong or it wouldn't be that easy to figure out.
1- I'm a very numb person and don't react strongly to situations or feel strongly about people.
2- Lately these unbothered state just seemed to become even more normal to an unhealthy state so I'm guessing I shouldn't rely on my feelings all that much these days because I'm barely able to recognize them and I was never good a it to begin with.
3- Perhaps I do like this guy but just really want to be friends with him and nothing else which wouldn't be hard to believe since I'm not really looking for a relationship or anything serious, besides he has a girlfriend and that doesn't really bother me and I'm trying for the first time in a long time to enjoy of friendships that I wasn't able to build in my high school years.

Don't know what you guys think, is it possible to like someone while not being nervous around them? I consider me being so clueless about it has to do with the fact that I used to crush on guys more when I was younger without knowing why and now being 18 I probably don't find any logical reason to be nervous around guys that I can easily communicate with and I'm pretty sure romantic feelings don't stay the same and end up evolving with age.

I saw him messaging other girls like he used to message me and my insecurities are getting the best of me. He explained that they are friends as he is trying to collaborate with new artists (he's a guitarist).

I feel stupid that we are going to France together next month. I don't know what his intentions are with me anymore. We've been dating for 2 years now and I just feel like he is waiting for someone better to come along and dump me.

I'm just in a rough place. I tried to call him to talk about our issues and he was apathetic on the phone. I got upset and said I can't be the only one who cares in this relationship. He told me to let go that he's been texting other girls and it was nothing serious. Just friends or new people to create music with. We ended our phone call without resolution and I worry that our plans for travel will get cancelled. I was looking forward to this trip but I want to build a long lasting relationship with him. I feel like I'm just pushing him away with all my nagging but he doesn't see how he's hurting me. 

I've always wanted to make music with him but he picked apart my singing and chooses to work with other girls. I even introduced him to my friends that sing and now my friends see him more than me. I lost my best friend once she met him. 

I feel lost and dumb for having more emotions regarding our relationship than he does. The only time he shows he still cares is when I threaten to never speak or talk to him again. 

Has anyone experienced this before? Does it get better with time?

So I've been seeing this girl for about 7 weeks now. I've stayed over at her house every time since our third date, had sex several times, met her roommate and other friends, shared incredibly deep and personal things. I even had my own toothbrush at her house that she had reserved just for me. We have an incredible amount of similar interests and values. Everything seemed to be going in an amazing direction and I was thinking of broaching the prospect of exclusivity with her. However our last date didn't go so well at all. She's undergone an extreme amount of trauma throughout her life through only having abusive past relationships, family emotional/sexual abuse, and neglect from her siblings. When I went over for our last date I had found out her family had all met up that day without telling her/or inviting her and she seemed massively triggered by this. She was anxious and upset most of the date. Venting to me about her family and how bad her past relationships were. I sat and listened deeply and offered the best support I could. To make matters worse later that night I bruised her cervix during sex which caused her pain to the point of where I almost had to take her to hospital. Luckily it went away. The night wasn't ruined totally however as we shared a lot of stuff with each other and the intimacy seemed to grow. The next morning I left and she still seemed rather withdrawn and I didn't feel upbeat like I had when I left all the 8 dates before. Something didn't feel right. I had initiated most of the dates in the past so I waited for her to reach out. I didn't hear from her for a couple days so I took the liberty to check in and see how she was doing. She replied to my messages immediately however when I suggested a date she said she had work that night which she normally did. However she didn't suggest another time. The next day I checked in again to scope out if she was free for the weekend. Again she replied immediately but said that she had work all weekend and couldn't meet. Which was the first weekend since we saw each other since that was the case. I've left it in her court since, but I'm pretty bummed about it since she's an awesome girl and I feel she may have pulled back because of her personal reasons which I wish I could tell her I'd be happy to support. I never got the chance to express to her how I truly felt about her since we didn't get to meet for our last date. I'd told her I'd liked her on our third date but don't think she knew how much.

Whenever I actually like a girl than I‚Äôll think of ways to sabotage myself and just sort of cut them off before they cut me off I guess. My perspective on this changed COMPLETELY when I went out with a girl I had gone a date a year ago, and we reconnected on tinder and we talked about why we stopped talking. 

I would actually try to avoid her bc our first date was sort of awkward bc we smoked weed, I do remember her saying she had to go home early, and she got a call from her friend and I thought she told them to call her or something idk. I even asked her out again and she said yes, but I didn‚Äôt follow through bc I thought there was no point, and thought it seemed to awkward when it was just me.

Long story short we ended up liking each other on tinder and saw each other for like 2-3 months and she said she was actually salty that I stopped talking to her, which blew my mind. I would‚Äôve bet my life that she didn‚Äôt like me, and I constantly had thoughts about how was the worst date ever and would even mention it to friends when worse date conversations came up.

Then there was this other girl who while there‚Äôs nothing going on between us, something similar happened. I wanted to follow her on Instagram, I found her Instagram, she didn‚Äôt follow me back, and as a result I guess i imagined that she just saw my request and was like ‚Äúewww wtf,‚Äù and ignored me or something. So I guess she noticed I was awkward and weird around her and my friend told her about it, and she said she didn‚Äôt even see it.

She actually searched for my name and later on came up to me to tell me that she didn‚Äôt mean to ignore me, but at that point I was too embarrassed and weirded out about the situation, so now I just don‚Äôt really want to talk to her which I know is dumb. Like I even went up to her and told her that I didn‚Äôt mean to be awkward but that I was embarrassed about the whole thing snd she was really nice about it, but again I still feel embarrassed whenever I see her. She told my friend that she didn‚Äôt think I was awakes about the situation at all so I just feel like my brain and actual reality don‚Äôt match up sometimes bc I‚Äôm so clouded by anxiety.

I don‚Äôt know what if call it, but I guess I self sabotage, and I only feel secure if we already expressed clear feelings or interest in each other.

I ask her out on a scavenger hunt date and she says yes! So we plan out the details and it all seems great. I go out of my way to purchase tickets and all seems amazing.

The day before the date, right before I was gonna text her to see if we‚Äôre still on, she texts me that she got exposed to covid the night before and takes a rain check until she gets a negative test, to which I say sure thing, and to let me know what her results are. 1 day passes.
