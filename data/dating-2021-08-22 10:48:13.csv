9,p9g975,1629651796,To all the short men who blame relationship issues on height.. you could use this.,"cross post from malementalhealth because a convo raised my attention there and reminded me of my past.

I know too many men, mostly Hispanic but also white, dating very attractive American women. I also know a good amount who are short and blame all their issues on it.

Ironic enough, the ones who blame all their issues on it often don’t care about their health, have bad hygiene, low self-esteem, care nothing for self-improvement, are not well groomed, and care nothing of their physique. It saddens me because when I try to converse with them, it’s always if, ands, or buts, doing anything to point fingers, blame and victimize to cover the fact that they are the reason for the results they get.

It’s sad to see men this applies to spend hundreds of hours worrying, blaming, and getting frustrated to the point where they begin to resent women and even degrade them. Women have to suffer from these men’s incompetence and inability to better themselves and face their own problems.

The time most people spend blaming, victimizing, arguing their illogical positions could easily be used to become the person they need to date the person they want.

Too many men have many of these flaws, and the worst part about it is that these men, who honestly are probably a 3-5 on the dating scale at best, have this grandiose sense of self that they really think nothing of only willing to date 9 or 10s.

A lot of the time They don’t study, some don’t work, don’t even Pay bills have a mortgage or even apartment, drive a bucket, don’t have goals, no education, no direction or aspirations and want a smoking hot dime. Not that you need all of this but most Only want to take with no giving. Let’s get real here, some of you need to put down the pron and Hollywood culture expectations and take a look in the mirror and ask, what kind of woman would want this and why? If you’re being honest with yourself and don’t like your answer, get to work, any less is selling yourself short.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9g975/to_all_the_short_men_who_blame_relationship/

12,p9gkdx,1629652752,Overthinking if the 2nd Date went well.,"So I have GAD and my anxiety has been all over the place this week. So our second date was Friday. And we decided to go to a bowling alley. We went to bowl and we trash talked and got drinks when we were there. Afterwards we went and got apps from the bar. The date lasted approximately 2 hours. I offered to call her an Uber from the alley, but she offered to walk me back to the train station. While walking I held her hand and tried to kiss her and she went in for the kiss (but because of our height difference I ended up getting her forehead) I laugh and say “I’m sorry I suck so bad.” While walking back I jokingly ask “Are you sick of me yet?” She replies that she’s not. And then I said that while I couldn’t do a date next weekend I’d be good for Labor Day weekend. She replies that she has work one day, but should be free another. We get to my station and she leans in to hug me and we kiss for a bit. I tell her to text me when she’s home and I promise to do the same. When I get home I text her and tell her I’m home and she replies she’s home too. I tell her I hope she had fun and she says she did. And then before bed tell her that over the past few weeks I really enjoyed hanging out with her and re-affirm that she’s the only one I’m talking to (she told me the same thing after Date 1) and that I was thankful she accepted my awkwardness. I don’t get a reply until the next morning where she apologizes that she fell asleep and re-affirms she likes talking and hanging out with me too.

So all of this points to good stuff just writing it, but does anyone else see any red flags here? I’m in my own head and I feel like I could’ve asked more questions during the date and since it didn’t last as long as the first (3 hours) that means it didn’t go as well. What do y’all think?

16,p9gwd3,1629653793,Sleeping with other people before exclusivity talk while dating?,"TLDR; Beginning to date a girl. We haven't had an exclusivity talk and want to go slow. But I have a FWB who I'll be hooking up with for a couple more weeks.

I've (F) had a FWB (M) for two years while living across the country from my hometown. It's been really fun— I've loved having someone who respects me and I can have fun with no strings attached.

Over the summer, I went back to my hometown with no intention of hooking up with anyone and planned to live another year in the other state (continue school, sleep with my FWB, etc.). However, I ended up hooking up with an old friend and we've been going on a lot of dates for about a month now. During this time, I decided to move back home (unrelated to her). We had a conversation a week ago where I mentioned we weren't together, and she said she wants to go slow (which I want too). We didn't talk about exclusivity, but we're both interested in continuing to date/seeing where things go.

Recently, I just flew back to the other town to start moving and have made plans to hook up with my FWB. Though I'm not sure if this is okay. Technically speaking, it seems like it is but I'm not sure the etiquette. I don't think the girl I'm dating is sleeping/seeing other people and she doesn't know about my FWB. (I'm getting an STI/STD test before I see her again). Obviously, I'm going to stop sleeping with him when I move home.

Mostly I've been wondering because I once casually dated another girl (who said she only does open relationships), though when I asked how she'd feel about me seeing my FWB, we got into a fight where she said, ""why would [she] care? we [weren't] together."" And we ended things the next day. This is why I'm nervous about seeing my FWB or even if the girl I'm dating now needs to know.

How should I navigate this situation? Do I tell the girl I'm dating about my FWB? Is it okay to sleep with someone else if I'm dating someone before an exclusivity talk?

20,p9hh20,1629655506,Did she reject me?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9hh20/did_she_reject_me/

23,p9hkzo,1629655840,Is he a player?,"Hi, need an objective opinion. I’ve been hooking up with a friend for the past three months. Since I ended a relationship right before, I wasn’t and am not looking for anything in that sense yet. He is also in a place where he simply enjoys a variety of people too much to be ready to commit. Both of us knew how the other viewed us hanging out, so we agreed we would tell, if anyone catches feelings. Long story short I told him this week that I am developing feelings for him and that it would be better to return to a friendship without the benefits.
What I’d like an opinion about - has he been giving me false hope/is he a fuckboy if we openly discussed none of us wanted a relationship, BUT the actions gave a bit of a different vibe? Everytime we we’re together, we spend hours chatting, going to dinner, we sleepover at eachother’s places and cuddle, he prepares lunch and breakfast in bed for me etc., we text daily, when I was abroad, he called me to talk for an hour, I even met his parents (ofc as a friend, but he took me to their house). 
On the other hand we have both been having sex with other people in the meantime; because he knows I am also attracted to women, he comments and wants to discuss women we see together, when we are with our mutual friends we don’t do anything physical but they still notice us flirting (so they know, but we don’t act lovey-dovey in front of them).
I am aware of the fact that he clearly stated he didn’t want anything romantic out of the relationship, but our friend is convinced he played me with the way he acted towards me and that I have given him an ego boost by telling him about my feelings, that I have given him a notion of “you are an alpha male” and have embarassed myself with not having enough self-respect.
I know what my stand is on the issue and at the end my friend’s opinion doesn’t matter but I am simply curious what do you, unbiased redditors think about the situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9hkzo/is_he_a_player/

At first she was super into it and really wanted to go out. She loved all my ideas for dates, and was super interested in even coming over to my house because my parents are gonna be gone for a few days. Until she asked my age, I thought she was my age(at most 20), but she turned out to be 25. Immediately, upon me telling her I'm 18, she shut down. Didn't wanna do anything more than be friends and I'm pretty sure she's gonna flake out of me for our plans tomorrow. I really try to be a good person and do what's right, but every time I try and hop out of my comfort zone I get squashed. Throughout highschool people were friends with me at school but if I ever wanted to hang out with they, they'd flake on me, so this is something I've had to deal with a lot. I know I have to just pick up my pride and try again, but I picked this girl because I saw that she was interested in me.

I’ll be honest it felt very copy and pasty but When I didn’t reply she double texted me another sob story about how much she cares for me.

We had met each other a week ago, and things had gotten a little physical.  We had texted all week, and many of those conversations had a sexual undertone.

During the second date, I questioned his intentions with me - about whether he only cared about the sexual chemistry or he wanted something more.  I tend to be quite blunt and honest on dates, and that was something that my date had said he appreciated about me.  But understandably, he became defensive and the rest of the date devolved from there.  He didn't get angry, but things were awkward, and he said he was getting mixed messages and feeling whiplash.  We discussed how much anxiety can interfere with my dating and he opened up to me about his anxiety as well.  We ended the date somewhat early, and he did not want to come upstairs to my home (which was close by) though he did want to continue seeing where this went.  

I texted him this morning - told him that last night obviously did not turn out the way we hoped it to and I'd like to talk more about it.  He hasn't texted back, and I'm not sure if he will.

I think my biggest problem in finding an SO is making the initial move. As a guy, that oneous is usually on me but it is part of what I really struggle with.

There are obvious anxieties. I think one of my biggest worries though is coming off badly or making a bad move that causes people to see me in a negative light. There is also this doubt at the back of my head you know? ""Sure she laughers harder at my jokes than I think is right but maybe she's just being nice and I shouldn't read into it."" ""Maybe she's just waiting for her friends to arrive at the bar it would be awkward to try and buy her a drink."" 

I don't want to be ""that guy"" whose constantly hitting on women and reading into every single thing but I worry I've shifted to the opposite end of the spectrum and a women could be giving me very blatant signs and I'd right it off as being a fluke or inappropriate.

We meet only two times and something click, on our second date I had the most intense and wild sex I ever had with a girl. Despite the distance we keep in touch on the phone, basically texting as lovers without being in a relationship. Also we were dating other people for casual sex. After a while she gets a boyfriend with whom she starts an open relationship, our texting remains flirty but not as intimate. Anyway, two months ago we decide to see each other again for a vacation of a few days where I live. She comes and in those 4 days I fell in love with her desperately. I cannot stop thinking about her, she is my obsession. Apparently she feels affection for me but she is in love with her boyfriend and plus there is the distance so I cannot stay with her. 

Now the dilemma, what can I do to forget about her? I'm coping by dating other girls and hoping so badly to fall in love with one of them. But the truth is that I cannot even touch them, my mind is somewhere else thinking how much I would love to be with her.

38,p9j9kq,1629661016,Need help overcoming dating anxiety [M]," 

Hey,

I've had anxiety throughout my life but I was generally able to overcome it by simply facing my fears, but this time it's much different.

I was always slightly antisocial and introverted. I had trouble making new friends, but once I got relaxed I had no trouble with them.

I recently started dating this girl I've been friends with for over a year, through a mutual friend. I've never had trouble talking to her until I started liking her and actually dating her. This is the first time someone told me they actually liked me and they wanted to date me. (I've never been on a date before, and I don't think anyone has ever had a crush on me.) So, I got nervous hearing that as I thought she was way out of my league. Everything went well until we went on our first 2 dates. I had trouble concentrating and I felt like I was about to vomit before our dates. I couldn't seem to calm myself down, which I usually can.

I went to the first date thinking, I'll relax over time, I'll overcome that by simply doing it. (I didn't). We had a mediocre date as I was scared shitless, and I think she got a negative first impression. The second date was a tad bit better, as we went to a bar and I had a couple drinks, so the alcohol relaxed me a bit. But I was still feeling sick and I couldn't eat that whole day.

I'm looking for a way to overcome this extreme anxiety (I've never felt this scared, and anxiety never had such impact on me and my health). The answer is usually ""face it"", but I've faced it twice and I still don't feel any better.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9j9kq/need_help_overcoming_dating_anxiety_m/
39,p9jadc,1629661087,"Got crazy mixed signals and am still reeling, need strangers to yell at me","I [29M] got out of a longer-term relationship last summer, and have finally re-entered the dating scene. With covid and everything, it's all been through apps, and I've had a few first dates that didn't ""spark"" for either side, and then 3 dates with this most recent girl.

The first two dates we got drinks, and for the third date on a Friday I invited her over to make some homemade pizza, drinks, and to play a board game or two. Each date the conversation had flowed well, the time flew by, laughs were had and I came away feeling really good about it every time. 

We kissed at the end of the second date, and we made out a good amount and were cozied up on the couch for a while on the third. I didn't take it any further than that because she said she moves really slowly and I wanted to respect those boundaries - she also didn't stay the night but was over for a good 6? hours or so. There was the occasional lull in the conversation, but it felt comfortable and not awkward.

The Saturday, I follow her on Instagram, she follows me back (yeah, kinda goofy to make this sound important I guess) - we text a bit through it all. Monday comes around, and I text to ask if she had a good weekend. She says yes, and thanks me for the food and that she had a nice time but that she was missing ""a romantic spark"" that she didn't think she was going to get.

My heads admittedly been spinning from this, because I felt like it was going super well and it was a bit of a blindside. She'd mentioned she hated dating before and that she'd had some bad experiences with it in the past, but I felt like all systems were a go leading up to that. It doubly sucks because she was the first person I'd clicked with and felt like I could open myself up to (and kissed) in over a year.

Is this common in dating?

I have never really experienced something like this, and I'm still kind of reeling about it. I can't tell if I did or said something that just totally turned her off from me, and I guess I never will? But why the Insta follow, why the sudden (to me) turnaround? 

(This post is semi-to get this stuff off my chest, and semi-to have strangers yell at me to not try and get in touch with her because the urge is there to be like ""give me one more chance to figure it out, it's post-covid and we're all pretty rusty at this dating thing"" (but I won't do this))",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9jadc/got_crazy_mixed_signals_and_am_still_reeling_need/

As a [24M] I’ve dated a few girls short-term (3-6 months) and consider myself decent at spotting dating red flags early on. Currently, I am seeing a [22F] from a dating app and we get along really well, though it’s only been about 1.5 months. She’s cute, very mature, low maintenance and seemingly has her life together. 

To date, there really haven’t been any red flags but every once in a while she will casually mention having “anxiety” and often she texts about being “scared” in random situations. (Ex: “I didn’t want to get too drunk at that wild bar since I was scared.”) 

She isn’t on any anxiety or depression meds and honestly seems more confident than me so I can’t tell if she just writes “scared” and “nervous” on texts or if she has some issues. While I can deal with these of course, I dated a girl who was on anti-depressants and that was toxic for us both so looking to avoid. This new girl was in a long-term relationship before so I am not sure if these behaviors stemmed from that or what not.

Ash was a hookup that went wrong. Throughout the night, Ash continually pressured me into having sex with him without a condom. At one point, he got on top of me without a condom and I was too scared to say no. I blocked Ash on everything the next day. The day after, I started talking to Chris. We met on Tinder. We talked about hooking up. 

I told him I wanted to use a condom. He said he was fine with it. I asked him to get tested. I was going to get tested too, because I had sex the day before I met him. He said he would. Then I got scared of being in the same situation again, (guy pressuring me to fuck without a condom) and I unfriended/unmatched with Chris. The next day, I get a text message. It was from Chris. He asked me if I was still interested in hooking up, he ordered a 10 panel STD test. I was still very hesitant. He asked me to hang out, and I said yes. The day we were supposed to hang out, I ghosted him.

He texted me the day after. ""Hey, I'm walking in to get my blood taken. Are you still interested?"" I said okay, but told him something had happened to me a few days before I started talking to him that ""wasn't so great"", and wasn't sure if I was comfortable having sex. He told me he ""figured"" and was ""Sorry that guys made you feel that way in the past. But I'm not that person. I want to show you I'm more than a horny guy. I think you're cool.""

I said okay. But I should have known he just wanted sex, because when I asked him questions, he would answer, but he showed absolutely no interest in getting to know me. I asked him to hang out that night. We hung out. He didn't pressure me. We made out and that led me to giving him a blowjob. Nothing else.

That night we agreed we should hang out again. We set up a day. We started sexting. I told him I wasn't comfortable having actual sex until I got my results back. He finally asked me what had happened, and I told him. Long story short, he ended up blowing me off the next day. I decided it was probably the right thing to stop talking to him.

66,p9l29w,1629666666,Dating after an abusive relationship,"Here’s the run-down…

I exited an emotionally, mentally, and sexually abusive relationship about two months ago. Overall, we were together a little under a year, but it was intense. I loved him so much that I literally let him get away with anything and everything. I’m still healing from the trauma and pain that I had to endure. I go to therapy, I try to keep my mind off things, and ultimately, I’m just trying to keep pushing forward. 

I really want a relationship. I’ve always wanted to get married, or at the very least, have a long term partner. I know I’m very young (only 21), but after failed relationship after failed relationship and now THIS, I’m really beginning to lose hope. In the beginning, my ex buttered me up and told me anything I wanted to hear just so I would fall for him. But he really ruined my trust and faith in people, as well as my overall self-esteem. I feel like damaged goods that nobody would want. I keep trying to go on dates or put myself back out there, but I don’t feel any real sparks when I do. Online dating is becoming increasingly difficult and making me feel worse, but I don’t know what else to do. It’s like an endless cycle of trying to recover and move on, but immediately slipping back into a pit of self-hatred and doubt.

I suppose I just need some advice/reassurance. Does it get better? Am I a lost cause? How do I successfully put myself back out there? I’m open to anything, really.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9l29w/dating_after_an_abusive_relationship/

71,p9lkc2,1629668301,I don't think Im very good at dating. And I'd appreciate some advice on meeting new people.,"**My problem:**
I'm 27 and I really started dating when I was 20.
Ive always been trying. But I average about one date a year.

I know a lot of guys have trouble, but I feel like this must be below average?

Like I try and women I meet just don't seem to want to give me a chance with a first date. It's not that I'm very picky. Im pretty patient and if I'm unsure about someone, I rather go on a few dates and see what I think, rather than turning them down outright, but I never get that far.

Last year, I seemed a bit lucky and met someone where it actually turned into a short relationship. And I lost my virginity then at age 26. And I know that isn't typical.

In person I generally don't meet anyone. I go out with friends and everyone else is out with their friends. The opportunity doesn't really seem like it's there.

On apps, I may get a match or two every month if I'm active on the app every day. But most of the time people don't answer messages. And if they do, after a message or two they ghost me.

So every once in a while this all really bothers me because I feel like at a rate of one date per year, I'm never going to find someone.



**My question:**
Are there any guys that are doing better than this? Be it online dating or meeting people in person?

What exactly do you do?
What works?
How can I get more women to simply consider going on a first date with me?

Im just not sure what I'm doing wrong. But I'm confident enough in myself these days that I don't think it's just that I'm that undesirable. 

I feel like it's probably just that I'm not approaching it right. And that seems likely because I've never been that socially savvy.

I'm open to taking a new approach and would love some advice.



**About me:**
I'm a guy. I'm 27. I'm straight. I'm introverted.
I think I'm pretty average looking. I'm 5'7

I think I'm pretty interesting - I'm a successful designer and I play music in my fee time; won many awards for art and I'm currently nominated for best instrumentalist in my part of the state and have an album releasing next week. And I can talk in detail on most subjects.

Everyone I know regards me as nice.

I know I'm pretty socially awkward - particularly in groups.

I'm also a feminist. And 100% of my friends are women. So I'm comfortable talking to women. Ive heard their side of the dating experience and I make a point to be completely fair and understanding to women.

Also when texting, I'm not a one word answer person. By this post you could probably tell I'm pretty wordy. And I never start with ""hey"".",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9lkc2/i_dont_think_im_very_good_at_dating_and_id/

In High School I was the awkward kid who didn’t really pay attention to girls. In college I was too busy with school and work and afterwards I focused on just getting a stable job with my degree. 
Recently during the mess that was 2020 I moved to a new town. At the same time I made a goal to actually start dating (bad enough I’m 26 no experience and to wait for my 30s I think would be a personal disaster).
Anyways I was wondering if I can get any tips from people who are experience and also from those who maybe were/are in the same boat.

Real quick a few things:
-Online Dating is a no for me it’s the only thing I’ve tried recently and have had no luck. Unfortunately I’m not attractive looking enough to make it work. In the past I have been hit on but I have a strong feeling that it was more due to personality.
-I find it difficult to open up to strangers so a lot of what I tend to do at the very beginning when meeting people is boring small talk (Ik I have to work on that)
-Don’t really go out that much so my other goal is pushing myself.

I have slept with him since and it was great I really enjoy hanging out with him too. Fast forward to the dilemma I have put myself in is now my period has actually come a week early and he is suppose to be coming over tomorrow night as we have this whole night planned and hes staying over so naturally we both know we are going to have sex as well. 
So now I’m not sure whether I text him tonight and let him know that it came really early (hoping he doesn’t question the timeline) and see if he is still keen to come or just leave it till things start getting heated tomorrow when hes already over and then tell him it came super early i can grab a towel…
What would you do in my situation?  🤣 I know im overthinking it and making it way more awkward then it actually is and 100% put myself in this situation but a little unsure on how to approach this…

We haven’t really had a conversation about where this is going between us or if he is seeing other people etc so for him this could be purely casual. I don’t think it is but i also cant assume that its not. Which is the only reason i feel like i should be giving him the heads up so he can decide if he still wants to come over or not because i just feel like its weird inviting a guy over if you are on your period and its purely casual…

So if I were to even tell him prior how would i bring it up and phrase it…

I’ve grown and changed a lot since then became more outgoing, confident in myself, but I’m still hesitant to think that she’s into me. I feel like she’s just friendly but I have no idea. I see the signs there. We never stop talking at work, always joking and messing with one another, we always eat lunch together and share food with one another and even text after work. I’ve been on plenty of dates in the past year, but with her I’m more hesitant. The girls I’ve gone on dates with aren’t the best out there for a future tbh and more of have fun now types. With her, I’m not as flirty as I normally would be or have the cocky attitude I always have and I’m just worried that she’s thinking I’m not into her and that’s why I haven’t even gotten a text from her after the date.

She’s still the same amazing friend I relied on and could be relaxed around when we first met. She works out often, she’s strong and healthy, and frankly gorgeous. 

But it seems like me telling her all this does little or nothing to convince her that she’s not fat and unattractive now. She keeps saying that she’s going to lose weight by eating right and working out so she can look like she used to, and I encourage her in her efforts because I know how much it means to her and it’s always a good thing to practice healthy living, but I can also see how taxing and disappointed she becomes if she puts weight she lost back on or stays the same (she’s studying to be a nurse, so she has almost no time for downtime).

96,p9n6tm,1629673760,Are steroids the only way to have the equivalent physique to a normal slim/fit woman nowadays?,"I think steroid use in Hollywood and on Instagram and dating apps have warped what women think a man who works out and is healthy/fit should naturally look like. 

Examples:

* Jason Statham has been using for years and is buffer now at 50+ than he was in his 20s as a professional swimmer
* The Rock is on major drugs constantly and similarly looks way buffer now at 50+ than he did in his 20s which should have been his peak.
* Zac Efron went on drugs for Baywatch.
* Chris Hemsworth has roided up repeatedly for Thor and is now roiding way beyond even that to play Hulk Hogan.

My gym is loaded with so many steroid users they have a sharps container in the bathroom they change weekly for all the needles people drop off. These guys aren't shy about it. One of my younger friends has had at least half a dozen people try to sell him steroids in the same gym.

Plus online dating only shows women the top 100-200 best looking guys in the city. I had one woman just tell me: ""I’ve matched with so many guys with 6 packs on hinge and bumble that I started thinking that planet fitness was just handing them out."" She said unless I was super ripped a slim woman wouldn't consider me her equal. She would consider one of those guys her equal instead.

Besides my roid heavy gym I never see any men who are that ripped. Yet online, to women, it seems like it has become normal that so many guys are ripped and roided.

If you want to date women who are slim and fit with a healthy lifestyle, is a normal athlete's body even remotely good enough anymore? If you watch movies from the 70s, the ""fit"" guys just looked like normal guys who exercised and ate healthy. They looked well matched to the ""fit"" women who were basically just slim and toned.

Now it seems you need to be injecting massive amounts of drugs to be considered ""equivalent"" to a slim/fit woman. Even most pro athletes wouldn't match up.

I personally don't want to do steroids because I work out for health. Steroids aren't healthy. There is a long list of guys who have done them and developed heart conditions or other problems from them and died prematurely. It goes against the entire principle of caring about a healthy lifestyle.

97,p9n8wx,1629673961,Could I get a few opinions on what the point of dating is?,"Is it worth it? I’ve been single for a few years now. I’m 27m. 

I tried dating a little over a year ago and didn’t have any luck. A few girls said they were expecting me to be taller after I told them my height so it kinda hurt my self esteem tbh, I’m 5’9”, and live in Montana so everyone here is like 6’ and above on average. I went on a few dates though, but I didn’t feel anything, we didn’t have much in common or click personality wise. 

I always hear about people’s drama and being cheated on. I’ve been cheated on and manipulated from 2 partners as well so I know how it is. 

After trying to date for a while with no luck I think I’m giving up. 

It’s turning me kind of cold if I’m being honest. I feel like I already know I’ll never be happy with someone else, so I don’t try. I do love being alone. 

My friends over 6’ can get dates immediately. Which I’m fine with, it’s natural selection and what a woman prefers in general (not everyone I know), and I’m happy for them.

So is there a reason to try to only receive the same outcome? When I date it takes a toll on my mental health.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9n8wx/could_i_get_a_few_opinions_on_what_the_point_of/
98,p9nbcu,1629674186,Scared to fall too hard,"I've (f25) only been seeing him (m32) for a month but we speak as if there's no reason to assume this will end. This feels easier, healthier, and more mutual than my previous relationships but I'm terrified. Planning a date beyond the one we already have planned and causally speaking about the future as if it's assumed has me stressed out. He tells me how this feels different from his other dating experiences and how much he likes me and the reasons why, but I'm TERRIFIED. I want to let my guard down and go head first with the hope it works out but I've never been in a real relationship. I always spend time with the wrong men and end up getting my feelings hurt but this entire situation feels safer. It feels safer but it's still foreign and so scary. What if one of us feels differently in a month? I know those things happen but I've never even gotten to this place before. 

TLDR; Does anyone have advice on how to relax and get excited about someone who shows enthusiasm towards you early on? I always complain about boring guys and now I have someone I'm excited about who's mutually excited about me, and I don't know how to navigate it...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9nbcu/scared_to_fall_too_hard/
99,p9nbo3,1629674215,He doesn’t compliment me?,"The guy I’ve been dating for a couple months doesn’t compliment me aside from calling me hot. I mean being called hot is nice don’t get me wrong but it just gets kind of old, like tell me I look cute or something. And he only ever says I look hot after I send him special pictures or when I’m half/fully naked when we’re together. 

I’ve heard online and from my male friends that guys don’t get compliments very often and it means a lot to them so I try and compliment him a lot (not too often to be weird but when it makes sense). Like when he got his haircut I said it looked great and when he’s naked or even just doesn’t have a shirt on I will say he’s hot too but sometimes I change it up and just say he’s attractive/looks good etc. 

I’m not insecure, I think I’m quite confident so I don’t need validation I just kind of assumed that especially in the beginning that’s a thing that a guy does with a girl? I don’t have crazy amounts of dating experience so do some guys just not compliment girls?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9nbo3/he_doesnt_compliment_me/
