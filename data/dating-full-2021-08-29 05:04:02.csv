She was out on the dance floor while I was talking with her friend, who encouraged me to go out and dance with her. So I did! I walked/danced over, got pretty close in front of her, and tried dance with her. She leaned away pretty quickly and I backed off and didn’t pursue at all for the rest of the night, taking that she wasn’t interested. Its probably worth mentioning that I didn’t really make any physical contact either, especially not touching or holding or grabbing. 

The next day, she (the girl I danced with) texted me and said I had made her uncomfortable by approaching her like that. I felt terrible, and of course apologized and promised it wouldn’t happen again. Going past the flirting boundary to the point where I’ve made someone uncomfortable is my worst nightmare, and in general I’m very conservative/shy in my approach to women as a result. 

So clearly I fucked up by making her uncomfortable, though in the moment I wouldn’t have thought I did anything wrong.

He is divorced (about a year ago) and has two girls. One is currently in the middle of medical treatments. His mom told him he could move in back home to save money and focus on her health (this was before we started dating). Before you ask why we don't live together, I'm simply not ready. As far as I remember, his mom has always liked me and always been kind to me. Recently, I've felt she's been very passive-aggressive towards me. 

She is a nurse and out of the last 47 days, she has worked 44 of them in the ICU for the COVID floor. She's one of the hardest working people I've ever met and I admire her greatly. She has 2 girls in high school-- they are 13 and 15. To help her out, I have picked them up from practice and school and helped keep the house clean and cook. I've even gone to buy feminine products when they were needed after realizing they were out. I don't mind at all and have never minded spending my own money and time on his family. I aged out of foster care, so in a way-- this is a small family of my own. I also believe in being kind whenever possible because I never know what someone else is going through. 

Yesterday, as she was leaving for work, I told her ""goodbye"" and she simply walked out the door, thus not even acknowledging me. I figured she didn't hear me but also took into consideration how she has treated me recently. I sent my boyfriend a text and asked if I had done something to upset her-- he replied and said ""I'm sure you haven't, she probably didn't hear you and is exhausted from work."" I didn't think a second thought of it and went on about my day. Not even an hour later, he came back and explained apparently she was upset. She sent in their family group chat a long message about how it was incredibly disrespectful for there to be people (me) at the house when she is not there. In the past she has told us multiple times there was never an issue with me being there even if she isn't there, I just cannot stay the night. I completely understood and have always gone home no later than midnight. My boyfriend, his two sisters, and brother all defended me saying how much of a help I am and how grateful they are to have me around. She works nights and is gone by dinner time. Her daughters explain that it's nice to have dinner and not have to order food. The mother replied saying it wasn't any of my business to be picking them up from school (I had permission), cooking, cleaning, or anything else of the sort. She continued by saying that there are not to be guests at the house ever, no one is allowed to cook when she isn't there, and if she is there, she is usually sleeping--so no guest over then either. She said it wasn't personal just a matter of disrespect. I mean---this woman had a super messy kitchen, I spent an hour cleaning it--and she actually got FURIOUS that I cleaned it. She said it was an invasion of privacy and an incredibly rude thing to do.

Today we celebrated his grandmother's birthday, she spoke to everyone except for my boyfriend and me. She didn't even acknowledge us or his kids. It was like we weren't even there. Not only was this humiliating, but it really angered me because for someone who said it wasn't personal--it felt very personal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to send her a message or try and talk to her and explain how this made me feel. I don't know if this is a response from overworking or if I had done something to offend her and wasn't aware. But, I'm actually kinda upset about how she handled it. Am I the asshole?

It started so well... a light lunch, a bit of ice cream, some coffee. She seemed a bit intense/argumentative but I'm pretty good at avoiding conflict etc and I managed to keep it light hearted.

She invited me to her apartment which was cute and bohemian, first thing she did was get naked and slide into her little makeshift pool on her balcony so I joined: so far so James Bond - all going very well and we spent an hour or so chatting and cooling in the sun.

She mentioned that she is a massage therapist so I offered to give her a massage (I love to give them) - we discussed boundaries and she was up for it. 

Then she asked a single question which triggered the derailing if this so far very smooth hippie date...

""Have you had the vaccination?""

Wellity wellity wellity: spin the wheel or craziness and guess what the correct answer is...

""Yes of course, I've had both jabs"" - I said proudly...

...that was the wrong answer it seemed because, suffice it to say, I had ""triggered"" her: and for the next hour I quietly and ponderously nodded along to her one-way psychotic ramblings about how the vaccine is going to kill me, how I need to purify my body, how I can no longer give her a massage because I am ""shedding RNA spikes"", how everyone (even those of us who are teachers with Masters degrees in philosophy) who is vaccinated is an idiot.

She had mental health problems I think.

""Perhaps""...""hmmmmm""...""I'm not so sure""...I don't believe you need to be worried""....I said. But eventually I kinda broke... started to get emotional...and before I left I said (tearfully):

""I came here for real intimacy and connection and to give you love and pleasure: and you just can't let this go, you're not talking with me but to me, and neither of us is currently having an enjoyable time - so I'm going to go.""

She was upset and begged me to stay, but since she viewed me as an RNA spike leper I knew it was just a waste of time.

I felt very relieved to be walking home and away from her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,977882,public,self,Hilarious Dating Catastrophe,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdqbub/hilarious_dating_catastrophe/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Since the very first date I always made clear to her that I'm not a very touchy person and I need time to give confidence and open up.

I'm in my late 20s, have never dated before, have confess/ask girls out before but they all only see me as a good friend. I do consider myself an introvert but not to the extent of avoiding people altogether, because I have no problem talking to people. I have a balance group of male and female friends. Have never really met anyone through a dating app before, I did talk to a girl for like a week, but nothing happen after that, but I'm also not a big fan of dating app in general. Anyways. 

Main topic. 

So there is this girl at a bakery near my workplace that I see and chat with pretty often, unfortunately because we are both usually on the clock I tried not to used up too much of her time. However, recently both our workplace have been slow so I've been spending a bit more time talking with her. The last time I talk with her, she mention some things that made me think she might be thinking about me when I'm not around, of course I could be overthinking. Since then I've been feeling more inclined to ask her out.

He is really kind and a gentleman, but so far I think I’ve only liked his attention. I don’t think I’m committed to dating him. There are several red flags, let me start with the one that drew the line for my feelings towards him.

- He is illegal. That is a crime. He lied that he was on a work visa. He texted me he wants to be legal “eventually.” But I’m not sure how long that is. I was also Interested in joining the military in a few years, and I’m not sure he will be legal by then. Our dates would be a waste of time. I also would want him to become legal before we get married hypothetically, but I think he things he can fall in love in an American girl and get his visa. I am also not interested in paying his green card fees and stuff like that. I have a lot of things financially I have to work on myself. He is also naive because he acts like he can have this huge bussiness career. I gave me a reality check and said you can’t even open a bank account now.
- he is everything my parents would hate and my best friend said she’s going to be pissed at me if I don’t end things. My parents are conservative and my best friend is very progressive, both don’t like the idea of him being illegal. I’m an immigrant and we view it unjust to come here illegally. 
- He’s also very poor. Which is fine, I was still going to give him a chance but through texts it seems our plan for the future is different. I want to own a huge house, be financially amazing with several sources of income, and be able to travel. He seems to want more of the cookie cutter lifestyle and wants our own money to help the needy. I’m all for helping out but it sounds he just wants to give oit own money away.
- Issus: he is kind in every way, he has nicknames for me, his voice is adorable, and he is a gentleman. Personality wise I really like him. I am unattractive to his physic tho but I hope it grows on me.

I WANT TO BREAK UP WITH HIM FOR THE REASONS ABOVE BUT HE WONT LET ME. HE KEEPS SAYING THAT IM THE ONE. But like bro, we’ve known each other for only 2 weeks.

I've (27F) only been to 4-5 dates in the last year and a half (I've some commitment issues I'm working on and am generally ok with being single, so I don't really pressure myself to date). 

As title suggests, all the people I went out with only talked about themselves and didn't ask me more than 1-2 questions (some didn't even ask one)... 

Usually when someone says something about themselves, I acknowledge it and ask a question or two about it, and not just to further the conversation - I'm actually curious to know more about the person, considering that we're trying to see if we'd make a good match. 

However, when I say something about myself, they just reply with another story/fact about themselves.

This has legit become a pattern for me. I'm starting to doubt myself and wonder If maybe I'm doing something wrong?? Is this how people communicate now? Do I have unrealistic expectations? 

The worst part is that, while some of these people were terribly obnoxious and obviously obsessed with themselves, others seemed fine overall, but still only talked about themselves. It makes me feel like my date is not interested in me as a person when they do this.

Well the  difference this time  is that most of the times women complain about having small boobs, A or B cups  and even though they are on the smaller side they still  can be really pretty and attractive and they still have them (boobs) , while I am in the minority of women who doesn't have boobs. So yes, I am really self conscious about it even though I don't show it that much or complain about it. I laugh it off and make jokes about in on my own expense because well, I definitely won't cry about it all the times but I am unhappy about it and self conscious a lot.

I made it very clear that I had a boyfriend and he was telling me he had an ex wife he still missed a little. We said we’d hangout with each other another time and he agreed. The original plan was the go to Red Robin get the fries and then a movie. He didn’t see any movies that he liked so he offered to show me judiso (I can’t spell it, karate) moves cause he’s been in a class for years and he grew up fighting so he was going to show me how to beat someone up. I didn’t have any ill intention, after he showed me some moves he told me later when we were leaving he got blue balls from doing that. Then he started to be really open about his fetishes and he tried asking me some personal questions and I answered a few of them. It seemed rude if I didn’t cause he was telling me so much of his past. He drove me to work and afterwards he said if I gave him some money, he’d pay me back, he could show me how to smoke. So he picked me up after work and then I found out he talked about me to his sister. He was really open about being attracted to me but he said there was nothing to worry about, that it happens all the time with girls he’s friends with for the beginning period. He told me he would ask me out if I didn’t have a boyfriend, but he’d still like to be friends with me. He knew the whole time he wasn’t getting anywhere with me. I told him on the ride home that idk if I was comfortable in hanging out with him again, he understood but said it was a shame because he felt good about a future friendship he said he only has a couple close friends and that he gets a similar vibe with me. And I feel really icky about what happened, I told my boyfriend this whole thing over a video. I just didn’t mean for any of that to happen, he was being really nice about everything the whole time saying I respect your boundaries.

We matched on dating app and agreed to meet up on 2nd day. The convo was flowing and we had a lot in common(even went to same uni/same course/ different years). Anyways, we met , went on 3 dates consecutively and he seemed pretty excited. I was getting attracted to him and couldn’t wait for 4th date.. on 3rd date he was acting more warm and touchy , I had no doubts.

Anyways, after 3rd time I started to notice he is a bit slower to respond , but he was busy with exams and stuff (final weeks), then I kept encouraging him and politely mentioned that we should plan the next date and do something different than the prior ones which were mostly us riding in the car and chatting/kissing.

He said he will figure out something but wasn’t really planning anything. Then kind of I started to not message and he also kind of didnt.then he replied to my story , we hit it off again , then I hinted again and said in the end that “Hey if you dont want to see me just say it to me”. He never texted after that , but he keeps following me / liking my pics.

We havent talked since ( which is a month), and I could not help but wonder wtf. I have an urge to message him something , to ask why he acted like this, or just to say why do you still follow me if you clearly dont want to see me again.

I’m 28. I… guess I’m a virgin. That feels difficult to say, but I think it’s true. I was in a 3.5 year essentially sexless relationship. I’m not even totally sure why. It started out with a few awkward attempts that didn’t go anywhere due to a combination of phimosis and what I imagine was performance anxiety, which transitioned into not wanting to even try due to the anxiety, which then was exacerbated by her feeling less and less attracted to me (which I only really found out at the end of the relationship). That was the only relationship I’ve been in. (She was also my first kiss). We met junior year of college, and were together until I was 24.

I’m not unattractive. In fact, at this point I think I’m pretty attractive. I definitely wasn’t when we broke up 4 years ago. But since then I’ve been working on myself a lot. Most notably I lost like 60 lbs (and gained about 10 back in covid weight I’m still struggling to shed), but I also started caring a lot more about my clothes, my hair, my skin. I’m 6’2”, 215 lbs, I have IMO pretty great hair, I think I’m pretty handsome. I don’t think I’m just deluding myself, I get complements from women not *super* frequently, but often enough over the years that I do think I’m reasonably attractive. I’m still carrying some fat, especially around my hips, and while I started lifting more recently I’m still not that built. But I don’t think these things are what’s keeping me from having a romantic life.

For whatever it’s worth, I have pretty well-paying job. I could complain about my career trajectory which has been kinda rocky, but compared to other people my age, I think I’m doing pretty well. Honestly probably really well.

I use the apps, but like a lot of guys I feel like they don’t really go anywhere. I’ve met like 3 people total through the apps, all pre-covid, only one led to an awkward second date. If I’m honest, I guess the date was pretty fine until things started to get physical, at which point I kinda ran away and neither of us chatted after that.

I also went on one date with someone I met through a friend at a party, which just kinda fizzled.

I don’t think I have the best pictures, but I also don’t think they’re terrible. Even if they are, I’m not sure how to like, suddenly become more photogenic. Maybe I just need to put more reps in. But it’s *so* discouraging having invested *so* much time into them and having gotten so little out. It makes it hard to put additional effort in.

I don’t know how else to meet people. I have like, zero game in terms of meeting strangers. Like I feel like I don’t even know where to start. Lately I’ve started going out to bars just to like, be around people, kinda hoping something happens. But nothing ever does, and I just end up going home feeling more bitter (which is what happened immediately prior to writing this).

I have a handful of friends, but no real friend “circle” to speak of, especially since covid. I used to be a lot more social with people from work, but my company is still WFH at the moment.

I don’t know how else I’m supposed to meet someone.

I’ve been going to therapy for a while, and this kinda stuff comes up sometimes (a lot more occasionally), but it’s been like years (months with my most recent therapist) and I’m not sure how much that’s really doing anything.

I’ve been starting to feel more and more bitter about this stuff. For a while I think I just told myself my love life was on pause because of COVID, but lately, it feels like the world is coming back and I’m still just stuck. My feelings about dating range from ambivalence (which I mostly feel like is a defense mechanism) that prevents me from really doing anything, to more active anger when I try stuff and still nothing happens. I’m so fucking tired of nothing happening. (I’m starting to cry a bit now). I feel like I’ve put in so much work into fixing myself, so much time waiting, and still just like, absolutely nothing. I feel so embarrassed about my lack of experience given my age, which I feel like just fuels my anxiety, about how women are going to be like expecting a certain level of experience, and me just feeling like this dumb naive child.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. :( I don’t even really have anyone to talk about this kinda stuff with. I just feel so lost and alone and sometimes I worry I’m just going to go on like this and get old alone without anyone noticing.

And I *know* that getting angry and sad and bitter isn’t going to help, but knowing that doesn’t just make those feelings go away.

I don’t know what I want. I guess some advice, but honestly just someone to talk about this stuff with. ",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,978316,public,self,"[rant] 28M virgin, not sure what to do",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdx0h6/rant_28m_virgin_not_sure_what_to_do/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I have a problem, perhaps someone will have the answer to solve it.


Also sorry for click bait title. 

So, let's start with it. I'm in my 20's, tall, beautiful - honestly a great guy to date, but I seems that I have unreasonable expectations when going on a date with someone - I expect the other person to show interest in me, witch doesn't happen at all, so as result 90% of first dates are the last ones, becouse they don't show any interest in me, they only expect me praising them or something, the other 10% make it to the second date, but usually they are only interest in finances witch is sad - I'm not a atm.

One could aregue that I go on dates with worng people, but I always try to explain other, perhaps they are shy or just bad at texting. Oh given the current situation of dating world - no sex was involved in any of my dates becouse I'm way too shy about it. So the main problem is that I can't find the right person, or should I just roll 20 and push it through get married with someone who is self absorbed just to get some action.

The thing is that I got a rejection. But I am not sure if this is a ""soft"" rejection and I should try once more or I am just lying to myself and I should just let it go.

Yet what's making me hesitate on trying it again is that she literally said afterwards that any other time she wants to come hiking anywhere, that she likes it a lot. So there are my doubts. Should I try again in a week or so? Or should I just move on? Should I let her bring it again? I would appreciate some guidance/feedback.

She messaged me a couple of times and I set up a date with her (today). 

The date was arranged in the city center and it was from 11AM, just casual coffee. 

The problem is that last night I went out with some coworkers and we drank our asses off until 7AM plus some other stuff. I woke up at 11:20, my alarm was ringing for 2 hours already. She was there for 20 minutes already. I messaged her and she told me she can wait. 20 minutes later I met her. 

It was all cool and fun. EXCEPT I was still a bit drunk with afterglow, and went off and acted without any control, and kept talking about all kinds of stuff. Mostly interpersonal relationships and deeper subjects, but I was talking fast and maybe she did not get the chance to talk as much as it was needed. But she was nice and followed my lead, we went for a walk afterward. Then she told me she needed to feed a friend's cat so she went away. 

She smiled at me and said: we'll see each other again (I can't figure out if she was genuine or just polite). 

This girl is really pretty and she is really nice. I don't know how she put up with my shit, after waiting 40 minutes. I did not apologize for anything and acted cool and normal.

I would like to ask her on a 2nd date so I could fix this, but honestly, I don't think she will ever want to see me again.

I'll keep it short.

I have a nice face, but also pretty short (5'5) and at this point fairly obese. I carry my weight well as it gives me this masculine ""big teddy bear"" look (people are surprised when they stand next to me, they perceive me as being taller from a distance). I have charisma and have a vast array of knowledge. I guess I'm also viewed as ""confident"" (very debatable).

But as a whole, I'm not particularly dateable right now. I'm broke, unmotivated, and have been dealing with depression. My weight is an issue (currently working on it) and just don't feel up to putting myself on the market.

The last few women I've been with over the course of two years or so...well, we hit it off and hook up but then I find out that they have boyfriends after the fact. It fucks with my head; I have some theories, but I just want to hear what y'all think. I have much less success with single women. You can argue ""well since you're aware they have boyfriends, you probably become relaxed and your relaxed state is appealing and sexy to women"" but that's the issue; I'm NOT aware they have boyfriends until after the fact. A couple shamefully admitted it to me and sure enough, their insta has the proof. And mind you, these women aren't no duds; they've all been fairly attractive, a couple even a bit out of my league. And their boyfriends follow suit, tall handsome well-off and....*sigh* nice, I guess? (I'm also a really gentle guy so I don't think it's a ""BAD BOY"" thing...)

Does anybody else have experience with this? It is fucking with me and I'm going to start screening women a bit more before I jump right into it.

I’ve had a few hook ups I’m not into and I’m still really crushed by this. I feel like I’m doing all the right things. Great job, friends, hobbies, in shape, I moved to a new city with a bunch of young people a few months ago and I go talk to people at bars and stuff every weekend, I’m on the apps.  I’ve got a few numbers and had one short fling from tinder I wasn’t into in that time. 

Now I’m 29, in a new town, and just can’t stop thinking about my ex. New girls I meet don’t do it for me, and I’m starting to worry that I’ll never find something like that again. I live a full and pretty lucky life, yet I can’t focus on what I’m happy with for long before I go back to wishing things worked out with the ex or I could find someone I connect with like that again.
