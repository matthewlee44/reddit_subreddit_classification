The concept is there, you make of it what you want.

However, I found that men have a way harder time on Tinder and I wanted to actually see and experience how using Tinder was and got inspired by a post on r/instagramreality about a guy that used the FaceApp to make himself look like a woman.

I used Tinder myself throughout the years and sure I got matches but nothing out of the ordinary.

So.. I took 3 pictures of myself and converted myself to look like a woman. Just the usual feminine features long hair, some basic make up and some fuller lips. I completed my profile with some basic stuff but didn’t even put something in my bio.

I swiped for maybe 30-40 minutes and then stopped swiping by the evening I had over 40 matches. Throughout the day I checked on my messages regularly.
Sure I wasn’t picky when I was swiping but I got matched with some fairly looking dudes even! You may be wondering about conversations… I didn’t want to waste time for myself nor for other people so I kept it short. However, a good chunk, around 10, initiated a conversation within the hour or so. Some where original and appealing, most where average (a simple hi or gif saying hi) and 1 was just all around bad that I rolled my eyes upon reading it.

My take away? Yes, women have it way easier on dating apps and the attention/validation seeking that many men seem to pick up on seems obvious. However, that doesn’t mean it’s all sunshine and roses. Picking your way through a bombardement of men is exhausting too. You also get the feeling men just swipe every girl to the right. Because of the above it gets old rather quickly. For men, a deviation from a simple hi or gif seems like a good choice but don’t go over the top either avoid the “Hi beauty” comments (should be common knowledge but then again I got them as a man looking like a girl)

I’m very transparent about not having plans to settle down soon because I love my life as it is.

I have friends with benefits now with women who friend zoned me initially; We continued to take each other out to eat and enjoyed each other’s company until one day something clicked.

All that to say is don’t pressure situations and don’t have expectations. If you’re obsessing over one person, it’s within your best interest to expand your dating pool.

If you are uncomfortable with rejection, you might unfortunately need to get rejected more. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of being friends with someone before you sleep with them, I promise it’s worth trying. I’ve found that sex is better with someone I care about, even if it’s not exclusive.

I (23F) met this man (27M) on Bumble. I'm finishing my last semester of college, he's in his first year of residency (a doctor). We started talking on the app, and right away he asked for my number, moving the conversation to text. He would only text once per day. I instantly got a crush on him even before we met, he was so cute and a very handsome doctor haha! I felt lucky as a college student to be going on dates with someone like him.

He asked me out, and we went and got dinner within a week of matching. I have to say, I felt like before we went on our date I really didn't know much about him at all. His texts were super, super, superficial and he only texted once per day. I thought this was because he was working 80+ hours per week. He is super busy, after all.

Immediately after the first date, he texted me asking if I wanted to come over to his place next time to cook and watch a movie. I said I would love to. I was traveling for the holidays for two weeks though, so we weren't able to have our second date for three weeks after the first date. We did stay in contact those two weeks, although again, it was extremely superficial. He texted me once every 1-2 days, and often it was just a short sentence; we didn't learn anything new about each other. 

On our second date, I instantly got the vibe that he was being extremely flirtatious. He didn't really ask things about myself; rather the vibe was just very fun and flirty. We started watching the movie on his couch, and he started kissing my forehead and holding my hand. I really liked it, and pretty soon we were on his bed making out. I’m a virgin with past sexual trauma so sexy things can be difficult for me. I told him I had sexual boundaries, and he said he wanted to respect those boundaries and make me feel safe. He was pretty assertive/a teensy bit aggressive though with trying to touch my chest. I did have to tell him more than once to stop doing that. When we took a break from kissing to watch the movie he asked if he could put his hand in my bra and play with my nipples. I thought that was a little weird but just thought this guy was super into touching boobs haha.

Once we got up from the bed and I was getting ready to leave, he kept kissing me in very loving ways. He kissed my forehead, put his arms around me, and while we were cleaning up from the cooking, he kept kissing me randomly. I really thought this guy was super into me. He walked me home, and before he dropped me off at the door, he pulled down my mask and gave me the biggest, sexiest kiss ever. I loved it. He didn't ask for a third date though.

We kept texting for a few days after this second date. Again, the texting was very superficial and light. I really just thought he was a very bad texter. I texted him a few days later asking him to get together again. He took a few days to get back to me (not unusual for him), and he apologized for this saying work was super busy and he suggested a date which would be within 2 days.

I texted him asking him if he wanted to come over to my apartment and I could make dinner for him. He said that he already had dinner plans but would love to hang out after. He asked me if I wanted to just come to his apartment like I did last time. I said sure, although I was kind of disappointed. He didn't seem like he wanted to put in a lot of effort. I asked him what time he wanted me to come over, and then he responds an hour later stating that he was starting to not feel well after getting his COVID vaccine the day prior. I felt really sad; I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I then texted him two days later, asking him if he was still interested. I told him that he had seemed super interested on our second get-together with the kissing, but his texting and this past weekend were giving me the vibe that he wasn't interested. He responded apologizing for his lack of communication and told me that he had an awesome time the last time we got together, but that due to his schedule the next few weeks with his residency he didn't have time to hang out and ""give me the time and energy I deserve."" He also said ""But I hope we may be able to hang out in the future"". This was three weeks ago. I haven't heard from him since. I just don't understand why a guy would be so sweet and give me loving and caring touches and kisses on a date, and then just never want to see me again. What did I do wrong? Was it me or was he just not looking for a relationship? I'm definitely looking to have a serious relationship with someone, but I had never stated that to him. In the beginning, he had seemed like he was willing to put in effort because he biked to a restaurant that was super close to my place on the first date, but then the effort got less and less. He had seemed so eager to see me again on the first date, but after the second date everything dwindled. What happened? Some people have suggested to me he only wanted sex, but if he just wanted sex, why not just ask a random girl on tinder to come over? Why meet a girl for dinner and cook with her if you’re just looking to fuck?

Fast forward three months later, we end up matching on Bumble. I reach out via text to tell him “Hey, I saw we matched on bumble, how have you been?” and he literally just never responds 😢 I could cry so hard right now. I wish he had thought our kissing was wonderful and wanted to do it again.

It seems that I only attract women that are kind of uncertain of

I’ll give a couple examples. I’ve been friends with this one girl for years. We started hanging out again, she would come to my house and cuddle with me on my bed and caress my hair. While cuddling, she would even let me rest my head on her breasts. 
In public, she even suggested that we hold hands out of the blue. Long story short, she told me she found me very attractive but would never see me as anything more than a friend.

I'm an 18-year-old male living in the US, and I wonder how being of average height will affect my chances in the dating market. 

During high school, I wasn't really into dating; I mostly kept my nose in the books to get into a good college. This wasn't necessarily for lack of interest from others. In fact, a few girls liked me, but I didn't have time. I just had a minor fling with one girl, but nothing came of it. Now that I'm about to transfer to another college for my second year, I hope to see what dating is all about finally. COVID kind of stopped me from meeting people this year :( 

I'm going to lay out some facts about me to give some context. I don't mean to brag if I come across that way; I just was to give you guys a clear picture of who I am. I'm above average in appearance--I was offered a job at Abercrombie in my early teens--I'm going to a top 5 undergraduate school for finance, I'm a published writer, I work at a mortgage bank, I have a 4.0 GPA in college, and I have given a few political speeches. Despite my accomplishments, I worry about how my height will affect my dating prospects. 

Across social media, I always see girls talking about how they want a 6-foot guy. I'm only about 5'9.5""-5'10,"" so I don't fit that ideal. Admittedly, my height has been a point of great insecurity for me. I feel like I fit the mold of an ideal man in most categories except this one. 

In fact, that one fling that I mentioned before ended when a girl cheated on me and said that she liked another guy better than me because he was 6'1"", and I was--at the time--about 5'8."" Needless to say, it made me feel a bit self-conscious. Although, when I left her house, she told me one thing: ""Don't worry. You're a great guy, and you'll find more girls in the future."" 

So, I guess my question goes along with that. Was she right?

I’ve been seeing this woman for two months. Everything is basically good. She’s bipolar, I’m traumatized af but we make it work. Our reasoning: we’ve clearly never har ‘normal’ work for us, so we do our own thing. 

As is to be expected, she has ups and downs. She scheduled an appointment Sat afternoon/evening, but baded on her texts and langague, I was 99% sure she’d called. She’s introvert and depressed, and being intimately familiar with the two, I give her space. Sure enough - she cancels. ‘Baby... I need a little time.’ I figured oh well, to be expexted - sure, love!

This morning, I was a little after-high on rivo so I stepped my morning text game up. Nothing creepy - just sweet. She replied good morging with 3 hearts. 

Fast forward ~2 hours. I’m bored, and I happen to have a driver and time, so I go to the plant shop to buy an orange tree for her (just for lulz) because she wanted one. Heres what happened:
@OP: takes a snap of flower place door
@her: you there
@op: yes
@her: why❤️
@op: you’ll see..
@her: ...
@op; sup?
@her: nothing
@op: seriously, sup?
@her: nothing
@op: ❤️❤️
@her: I feel like we’re in different places, and I don’t feel this is right for me (both 180 opposite positions of what she state)
@op: dafuq? Talk to me?
@her: can we be friends?

I have no fucking clue what just happened. I’m besties with her kid and going to her moms place in 2 weeks. No warning no nothing...

It’s a long one so buckle up. 

About a month ago I went with my sister to visit her boyfriend, and it just so happened the boyfriends brother was also flying into town to visit. I kid you not, first look at him and I was hooked. But just knowing that siblings dating other siblings could be a mess, my sister said he was off limits, which of course made me want him more. Also some backstory, he’s living across the country but came out to visit/ work remotely for awhile. Also was informed he was recently divorced, not sure how recent. My sister also went through a divorce so I’m familiar with the life chaos it can bring, though I know everyone is different.

Anyway, we’re all having a great time visiting and there were a few moments there may have been an opportunity to do something but I didn’t. We leave to come back home, and I’ve had him on my mind and just like seeing him and hanging out with him, good conversation, laughs and all the feels. 

They recently just came up to visit the weekend and I was legit looking forward to it all week. Things were way too fun this weekend and there was a night where we definitely connected but just went to bed separately. The next day, good times showing him around. I know his brother would love to have him out here in California and I think we’ve all been trying to show him how awesome it is out here. It would be fun, I live with my sister and living with sibs is pretty awesome. 

So later in the night it’s just us enjoying a few drinks on the couch and watching literally all of the jackass movies and things are happening. Like I’m low key giddy because we’re snuggled up, his arm is around me. We look at each other and he leans in and we kiss and are making out and we decide to go to my room, but again I didn’t just want to have sex and that be it. I like him,and didn’t want it to just be that. We were super giggly just going to bed and sleeping next to each other.  I liked looking over and seeing him next to me. 

They had to leave this morning and I’m still just stoked haha. This was a vent and a half but it’s just on my mind.

Heres where it gets a little douchey lol, basically I told her I had covid and that I would let her know when I would get better.

And I’m thinking of saying that I had like covid complications (idk if I should say that I had to go to the hospital or something) but the ironic thing is that I do have a scheduled appointment with a doctor to check out my lungs bc when I actually did catch covid, I had chest issues after. So there is truth and lies mixed in between what I’m saying but I figure like I tried to go out with only one girl at a time bc I thought that would be the right thing to do, but looking back it was a wrong move.

I don’t regret it bc I really was super into the other girl at the time but like if you were a girl snd a dude followed up with you a month later would you still go out with him?

I know it’s deceptive and manipulative but I purposely didn’t message her that much and said that it would be bette to talk in person, so I feel like there’s still like the cliffhanger in a way to get to know each other.

So I’ve been dating someone for a few months now. I think it’s going really well. 

However, they make SIGNIFICANTLY more than I do. Like extremely higher. I didn’t think it would bother me at first but it’s starting to give me anxiety. She knows she makes much more, but it’s still making me feel insecure. Like, can I from a financial perspective do this? Maybe she doesn’t care. 

Just curious if anyone else out there is in this, and how they made themselves feel more comfortable and confident. I really like her, and I don’t want this to be an issue for myself.

The most rude people crawling out of the woodwork. My luck is so bad nowadays that I put up with this BS longer than I ever would otherwise. But I just wanted to vent about something I notice lately with people, and others I talk to the same thing. This experience is the epitome of this sort of thing:

I (in my 30s) met this guy online recently, early 40s - who was very impatient to meet IRL. Even though he lives 5 hours a way. That is still right now not entirely surprising because I know the pandemic makes everyone stir-crazy...

But here is what really pissed me off. I'm a musician, I added him on a social media page, where the first thing is a link to my music. We actually met on a site dedicated to this very topic itself! It is underground and hard to find people who listen to this stuff, let alone even play this music. But he never even tried to listen to it. Not once. Never even asked about it, nothing. Even though he is clearly someone who is all about that same music, specifically. But he never brought it up whatsoever...Like it did not even exist. The second thing is that - The first phonecall he made, we started talking about music and I asked him if he played, he answered. When I started to in turn discuss a little bit about my own project, he actually said ""Ohh shit, my friend just showed up can I call you back?"" *and hung up.*  Normally I'd end it right there - Well in fact, I would have the second he never acknowledged anything I did. Not fucking worth it. Not even for sex. But sometimes we get desperate..

We did talk again and he also called another day, I was basically in the process of telling him in a manner of speaking I'm just not interested, when he said he was going to drive here because he just wanted to meet IRL, and he went on about how he was looking for a partner, and even said some nonsense about how he'd eventually like a woman to move there with him, in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere. This is all weird, and frankly worrisome. I figure he's just super desperate to get laid. 

He said his friend drove him here. We had dinner, but he realized there was no open hotel nearby for him to stay (he already knew he could not crash at my place). He even asked me if I knew anyone who could pull some strings to get him a deal...And it was all extremely brief, there was almost zero conversation. Before he was all excited to talk about deeper matters, made it seem like he would actually be interesting...NOT. He vaguely asked if I wanted to go back to the city there with him, ""But wait you have to work all the rest of this week?"" he said. I reminded him I did, and that I had to go back that night if I wanted to go to work the next day. It takes time to get there and I don't even drive myself, because of an eye issue. Which I already told him about...(Shouldn't even matter regardless, there's busses that will go). He scarfed down his food and before you could blink an eye he hopped on the next bus back to the main city. He texted me the next day saying he was going to some bigger city in this area, and then some BS about teeth straightening techniques...

Honestly, people like him just piss me off and I wasn't excited about anything - I am just lonely and having a hard time, been through a lot, haven't socialized in ages - and just wanted to see what would happen if he came out here... I'm not that hurt, just annoyed as hell I wasted my time at all. But wtf was that even about??

The last time I was really single and actually looking none of these apps really existed so all of this is new to me and I have no clue what I’m doing. 

I joined tinder to get my feet wet. I think I was being too picky because I was not getting any matches so purchased tinder gold after I got over 100 likes just to see who was liking me. Found some interesting prospects and even some who seemed compatible based on their about me. So I started swiping right on a few who had already liked me. 

And this is where I’m just baffled and confused. Several of these guys initiated messages to me after we matched. None of them were elaborate but just a Hi or how are you doing? I would reply back and ask how they were doing then...nothing. They go dead silent and that’s it. 

I do not understand why they message me and then don’t respond back when I message back. Is this some type of game or am I supposed to give some super elaborate response? It’s not like they give me much to start with in their initial message. I can definitely keep a conversation rolling but it’s like I’m not even given the chance to get to that point. 

Alternatively there are some I messaged first and from their lack of response I can infer they aren’t interested and probably just mass swiped and hit me. Why they just don’t unmatch then is beyond me.

I'm here to tell you that I have been bettering myself since my last relationship (a year and a half ago) and have pretty much not found shit.

I'm in college, I have joined clubs at school before COVID, I have decided to go on to law school, I have picked up numerous new hobbies, I'm now learning a musical instrument, I have had a gym membership, and I am constantly going and doing things AKA getting out of the house. I have done online dating, gotten lots of matches, found absolutely nobody worth even going on a date with. I have reached out to girls I somewhat know and follow on Instagram, and again, half the time I don't even get a response.

It's nothing to do with looks. I'm 6'1, in decent shape, slim-cut, well-kept haircut and physical appearance, not a slob, not fat, symmetrical facial features, etc. I get compliments from time to time and I was even approached by and dated a girl for a while in Fall 2019. I know I am not ugly and in fact, I suppose I am slightly above average.

I don't think I lack confidence. At times, I am overconfident. I believe too much in my own abilities sometimes. I am generally a more dominant personality, but I don't really take charge unless I feel like I need to (establishing my position in a group, getting a group to work towards a goal and stay focused, etc.) I'm usually the captain of my sports teams, if that makes it any clearer.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm at a fucking loss. I have tried and tried and tried and tried. I have tried for a year and a half. I've been on a few dates and even ""hooked up"" once or twice, with plenty of other opportunities to do so that I have rejected or chosen to not put myself into the situation. But I have not found anyone worth actually dating. The girls I know would make good girlfriends refuse to even respond to my messages, and the online dating game just gets more and more degenerate and bad for my mental health as I go on. I go to bed every single night wishing things were different but having no clue what to do about it and if you've never been in that position, it's a terrible one to be in for such a prolonged period of time. I thought for the longest time if I would just keep ""bettering myself"" and staying on track to be successful and reach my goals, it would all work out and the things I wanted would materialize. That shit is a fairytale. Nothing has materialized, I've found nothing that I've wanted, and in fact it only seems to be getting worse. People say to be happy before you look for a relationship, but the thing is that no amount of improvement or happiness with OTHER AREAS OF MY LIFE will fill the void that I feel in this area of my life.

I use dating apps and I don’t know what it is but there’s just no chemistry for me on the first date. I’ve been on a couple where it was so bored it became painful uncomfortable. Others have been ok? Nothing worth talking about. There was one were it was ok but the guy was a bit of an asshole the whole time, just really condescending and saying thing like you’re “um interesting” or “that’s unusual” we bonded over food and coffee but he was extremely pedantic and I’m not verbose when verbal, I’m a better writer than I am speaker and I know I came off a little odd. We talked about coffee so the next day I was getting a really unique cup of coffee and I sent him a picture of it and he was like wow “i would love to try that.” And then we just never spoke again.

So I never text a guy after a date, am I supposed to? One of the boring guys texted me days later but I wasn’t interested. I never think to make the move after a date. I’m a newb with dating but I’m 30. 

I also am a terrible flirt in person, I don’t really make any moves or get romantic, it’s a first date it feels too soon, but then it feels to much like a friendship hang out. I’m not naturally a hugger so I don’t even go for that, but most times they’ll reach in when I’m walking away (after I say bye ofc) and then it becomes obvious I wasn’t trying to hug let alone kiss and I feel so awkward. I’ve  been  in too many situations where guys get super sexual super early before even knowing me as a person and I get extremely turned off so I really don’t know how to overcome this platonic feeling first date. Like before even meeting a guy once he’s talking about how he wants my lips on his dick and he’s hard blah blah I’m like dude we haven’t even met (this has happened a lot) so I am extra cautious to get too close physically with others but clearly that isn’t working.

Although we didn't speak to each other that much on the day because we were both working, by the end of the event she handed me her number on a piece of napkin - which I thought was really bold and cute. I texted her the same night and a few days after we decided to meet up again for some coffee and just had awesome conversations about everything.  


Since then, we've pretty much texted everyday. Some convos are great, flirty, sarcastic and others are just one liners in which I can empathise with because I am not a great texter to begin with. I like her a lot but since our last meeting in person (3 weeks ago), seems like she never has time to hang out. I do understand that she's busy due to university, studies and her part time job. I also have work full time and casuals on weekends. We plan on catching a movie at an outdoor cinema this week but seems like that plan is about to get cancelled to because of the weather.  


This is my first time ever doing things like this. I've never dated, never been flirty, never been in a relationship and hence, I have no idea what to do, what I'm doing wrong or whether or not I'm expecting too much. I'm definitely interested, but I'm not sure if she is anymore. Which is fine... but I just can't seem to gauge the situation now. Are we friends? Are we dating? I'm too afraid to ask because we've only known each other for so long and have only met ONCE.

A lot of how we respond in relationships may be relative to our attachment styles. At the very basis, a secure attachment is someone who has an easy time with effective communication and is open to emotion and intimacy. 

For those who are anxious attachment styles, you might find yourself thinking that ever single thing wrong might lead the relationship to end. When your attachment style is activated this may lead to protest behaviors and may be attributed to a fear of rejection or abandonment. I.E.You might feel like your partner/SO/person you’re dating is taking too long to text you back and 300 possibilities goes through your head. You might worry something is wrong and you might have to breakup and can’t find someone else better so you attempt to re-establish connection: texting calling excessively, withdrawing, keeping scores on how long they take to text etc. 

For those with avoidant attachment styles you might use your “free spiritedness” and “independence” as a way to put off intimacy and closeness. These are deactivating behavior. Despite wanting closeness you might have a hard time expressing your wants. You suppress your needs and keep your SO/partner/date at arms distance. You’re scared, you want intimacy, but you’re scared. At this point you’re convinced that you’re better off alone and that you’ll be single forever. 

When you mix and avoidant person and a anxious person, this might be really hard because one craves intimacy and the other craves space.

So, I've been seeing him for a couple of weeks, we took things very slowly, only kissed on the 6th date or so. When we finally did get closer, we were super touchy and couldn't keep our hands off of each other. We have great physical chemistry and basically had sex with our clothes on as well, so a lot of dry humping and just in general a lot of touching, kissing, it was very sexual without us having sex. We are both really attracted to each other, I know this and we talk about us having sex soon but he just wants to take his time.

He was also getting really shy whenever I tried to get a look at his penis or would get touchy around that area. The funny thing is: he says that he is a very sexual person and that sex is super important to him. From his stories he has a really high sex drive and also has tried out lots of stuff and is very open-minded. I guess he just goes all crazy whenever he does feel comfortable with someone. Again: I would love that. Of course I would want to date someone who gets crazy for only me and isn't someone who sleeps around.

It just is so rare that I start feeling like there is something wrong (maybe with his penis?). And I don't understand why us dry humping and being super sexual with each other is okay but then sex would be something he needs time for? This is a bit contradictory for me. He also said that he usually only sleeps with women when they are in a relationship or when he is completely drunk. Do you have any clue what could be going on here?
