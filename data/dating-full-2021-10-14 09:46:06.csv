So I meet this girl early June, we hung out twice and slept together and then she went back to her city for the summer. We stayed in touch like once a week until she came back in September.

Early September we went on a great date and had sex. After that, I went back to my city for  a week and that’s when it all started to go downhill because I guess I contacted her too much out of fear of her forgetting me or something. So, when I came back I invited her over for dinner and we had sex and everything but her interest in me clearly had dropped.

And here’s where I messed up. Three days after that date I was so certain about her not ever going to contact me again(which makes no sense, it hadn’t reached that point at all), instead of letting her breathe for a while and wonder about me I told her “Hey, I think we both realize it’s going nowhere but I would love for us to be friends”
To which she replied yes, of course what else could she reply?

But now, looking back I realize I made a huge mistake because I don’t genuinely want her as a friend so that’s a bad place to start a friendship, if we hang out and I feel like she has lost all romantic interest in me (which would be understandable after asking her to just be friends) I probably won’t ask her to hang out again,etc.

So, out of egocentric behavior because she wasn’t falling in love with me in the pace I wanted, and out of neediness I’ve lost a girl I liked very much and we possibly ain’t gonna be friends because I assume she’s weirded out by the whole thing.

I am having a hard time accepting I should just move on because I feel ashamed and I really liked her, but is that the only option?

Possibly the woman's guard is up, possibly it comes off as if I'm in a hurry or desperate, and possibly my best personality features may take more than one interaction to shine. 

I'm thinking now what would be better would be befriending them for a bit until they get to know me/my personality better and vice versa. Many of the overtures I do get from women are those I am friends with. Unfortunately, I'm not attracted to them for one reason or another. 

My concerns are this:  
1) Coming off as inauthentic - Is the friendship real if I'm attracted to them?

2) Getting friend zoned - if we start off as friends that could be all they ever see me as.

The night before we met we were talking about how I hated my neighbor for having late parties blasting music till 3am and stuff, and I'd call non-emergency PD to have them knock on their door to lower the volume.

The next day, couple hours before our meet-up I texted him and asked if he's upset or something wrong and did he still wanna go out etc, and he said something like ""I don't think we're a good match"" and that was about it. 

Part of me think that he probably likes to party till late too or he thinks I'm a Karen of calling cops (although it's non-emergency) on my neighbor etc. But the other part of me think that my neighborhood is not the nicest neighborhood in town and we have no men in my household so I don't wanna go over there and get in trouble and stuff(I also talked to the neighbor in person couple times but they still doing it). 

Also, it does hurt my feelings and self-esteem being rejected couple hours before our meet-up, and I'd rather he said so right after our convo than have me hanging till the next day to be disappointed. I didn't reply after that ans deleted all the messages and even his contact from my phone.

Couple days went by he texted me with a hi or how you doing, which I didn't reply. My mind at that time was like wtf dude, you rejected me and now it's a fresh start??The for the next couple days he'd constantly text and see if I reply, which I ignored. Finally I replied a single ""What"" sunce it had been a week of him texting me, and he said ""how you doing"" and I just blocked him.

I had planned our date, we chatted all weekend and things sounded good until Monday when he just didn’t answer for a whole day.

There's this were awkward feeling that they don't know what to say how to interact with me. I've seen many white women I have found attractive that they can go up to guys of their same race and have not a problem talking and starting conversation with them. Then when it comes to me it's like they're waiting for me to start conversations or ask a question. It's just an awkward feeling.

 I think maybe it's because they weren't raised around people outside their race and if they did interact with black people it was only through clubs at school such as sports. But when when it's just trying to get to know someone of a different race it's difficult to interact with them.

Let me tell you a bit about my dating history. 

I didn’t have my first date until I was 22 and I only went on four more dates until I met a guy named “Mark” last year. That was first real relationship and it only lasted for five months.  

A few days after I broke up with Mark, I met a recovering alcoholic on Hinge named “Luke” and we became fast friends. I fell so head over heels for Luke that if he had asked me to get him a diamond ring, I would have scoured the ends earth to find one for him!!! I would have done anything for this guy as long as it was legal and safe (and a part of me still would!). But he fell in love with someone else and I nearly had a breakdown over it. And despite everything…..I still keep in touch with him because he is still an amazing friend and an absolute angel.

In August, I formed a bit of an acquitanceship with a coworker named Steve. I took a bit of a shine to him and yesterday I gave him a note that pretty much said: “Hey, you seem like a cool guy and I would like to get know you better so I was wondering if you would like to go on a date.” I even included my phone number in the note in case he wanted to reach out that way. Today is my day off and I still haven’t heard from him. So, I guess it’s safe to assume that he’s not interested. 

And also……before anyone tells me that giving him a note was cringey….please understand that asking somebody out in person is extremely anxiety inducing for me and that was the only way i felt comfortable with taking such a risky move.

I talked to Luke crying about it and asked what it is that I am lacking. He told that he doesn’t think I am lacking anything but i don’t buy it. After all, if that was the case then why did he chose someone else over me?

I am just at my wits end. I just want ti know what it’s like to love and be loved and feel wanted, needed, and whole.

Throughout the 3 years, I wouldn't say our relationship is smooth. We would have little misunderstandings here and there. Its mostly caused by my anxiety, making me panicky and always resorting to him as a safe blanket. I was also clingy which would make him uncomfortable sometimes. Meanwhile for his side, he'd often get jealous when I hang out with someone and would punish me real hard verbally when I am in my anxious period.

Its hard for me to cope because i always care and have feelings about me. Heck i would even sacrifice my preference or my demands just to make him more comfortable in the relationship.

Recently I decided to check in. Because the truth is, I've really been loving getting to know her. I love the connection we share, our goals and trajectories. I feel very seen and wanted by her. So I asked her if she was ready to be exclusive, because I am. 

Initially she felt pushed into a corner, like she was given an ultimatum. I had to explain to her that it wasn't me trying to pressure her or stress her out. I just have immense feelings for her and couldn't not share. Also that we're both just existing as single people and are free to do whatever. 

Unfortunately, she isn't quite there (yet?). She affirmed her feelings for me and that she just needs more time, and moves slower. 

I can't help but scale back a little from where I stand with her, and am heavily considering opening back up to dating other people. No hard feelings and she can find me if she wants.

I reach out and ask if everything is ok, whereas he says not quite, but says he want to see me soon! we talk on the phone and it sounds like he got a lot going on (issues with his parents), and he had also been thinking about us... whatever that meant. We hang up and I blame his absence on the personal issues. But I'm feeling confused because he says he wants to see me soon, arent doing anything the next day, but doesnt reply to my invitations about hanging out. So I confronted him about that, and if ""thinking about us"" meant that he meant we shouldn't see each other anymore. We talked on the phone again earlier and he confirmed that - he wasnt feeling chemistry/connection. Maybe it was because both of us aren't good at talking together...

So I'm left here, very very confused. Everything was fine up until 2 weeks ago! I just can't believe I'm SO bad at reading people? Or if hes a really good actor? Maybe it was something else but he wants to be nice so blaming chemistry?

So I've been at home most of the time for the past 2 years, only going out every once in a while for grocery trips or for occasional errands that i cant handle from home. I havent been on a proper meet-up with a guy for 2 years.

Until recently, i've been chatting with this one guy that keeps wanting to meet up. I've been giving multiple excuses along the lines of not wanting to go out because of the pandemic cases and all that, and I swear he should've already ghosted me by now, because thats just how the pattern is with all the guys i've talked to during the past 2 years: guy asks to meet up, i decline because i do not want to risk getting covid from some random date, guy slowly disappears over time. But this one is still here, idk I feel kinda bad.

The thing is, I'm actually very nervous &amp; afraid. Again, I havent done this in a loooong time. And the thing is, I'm afraid I'd look different from my pictures. I havent uploaded anything new on insta for the past 1 year. I've also had clear glowing skin my entire life, but recently I developed acne on my cheeks, which leave some rather terrible marks (redness, pigmentation, also some texture). I feel like my insecurity (my skin condition at the moment) is making me put my life on hold. I dont feel confident enough to meet people with my skin looking like this. Sure, I have my trusty L'Oreal Infallible concealer (wonderful concealer, btw, 10/10 recommend) , but idk 😭

I’m really not proud of myself on this one, and need your opinion :(

So I had a really nice date with a guy that lasted over 12h. We were supposed to only go brunch, but ended up spending all day together walking in the city, hiking, eating ice cream by the city port and talking at a park.

Anyways the following day I had another first date with someone else and we really clicked, even more than with the previous guy (later on I understood it was only physically, after a few dates it was hard to even hold a conversation with him).

Now the thing is the first guy I went with asked me on a second date, but since I had a better connection with someone else I wanted to let him know with a thoughtful message. I waited a bit too long and my anxiety kicked in, I never sent that message and basically ghosted him ☹️

I really feel awful about that, it was a really sweet guy who was looking for something serious.

Initially we started off with she having a crush on me and leading to us making out. We only spoke to make plans to meet (once a week maybe) but overtime we got emotionally attached and started talking a lot more.

A few goodmorning/goodnight texts and a few memes in between and calls every other day (for 1-2 hours minimum)

However, recently in the past few days, our talk seem a bit irregular. They seem a little bit dry (even though there's romance and flirting involved).

I call her every other day but I got the feeling there are moments of ""what should we talk"" after a while. I asked her ""Do you think the excitement of talking has died down a little?"". She said ""A little bit because we meet (twice a week) and we already share everything what's there to.

In the past I've been in relationships where we talk for hours on day (in the initial few months of honeymoon stage) so the feeling of excitement dying down made me a little worried.

However, whenever we do meet, the passion is definitely there. We can't keep us off each other.

My question is ""Does keeping the frequency of talking a little less healthy for our relationship in the long run?"" Or the fact that there's a slight feeling of excitement dying a sign for me.

One thing I'll mention is both me and my girlfriend are introvert. Even if she doesn't talk to me, it's not like she's talking to someone else. She mostly stays at home and prefers sleeping or working. She says not talking to anyone gives her mental peace.

How often do people talk in relationships? Am I contributing to the excitement dying due to excess contact?

Me (35 F) and him (36 M). It was a long distance two different countries relationship. It started out with just talking and casual keeping in touch, not much. Then after some months it felt like this could go somewhere. It got a bit serious. We got exclusive.

My mistake was when I kept asking him to come on video calls he refused saying that he was too shy and I kept feeling like nobody could be too shy. But I didn’t push hard for him to come on video. I completely agree it was very stupid of me to keep carrying on without knowing the pictures I saw was of the same guy. I trusted too easily and didn’t do background check because I felt why would someone stick around for 1 year and more and lie about who they are.

I finally came to US and when we were about to meet, he video called me and I saw him for the first time. Till now it was only on pictures. I was honest about everything. Hell broke lose when I saw him on video. He was some other dude. When I confronted him about it, he said he wanted to tell me if it got real. By the time it did, it was too late and he was scared to lose me. He mentioned that he only used some other dudes pics and shared when I insisted to send his pictures. Everything else was him. At one point his WhatsApp picture was also the other dudes pic who I thought was my boyfriend :( .

How do I believe anything he says. He didn’t tell me who that guy was in the picture when I asked. He feels guilty for doing this and said it was immature but I don’t honestly know what to do. Yes my fault I didn’t ask for video calls but I always thought he is an introvert and is shy. I personally am someone who isn’t a video call person either but I never lied about anything. 😢

I have blocked him. I waited for 1.5 years to meet him and when it was about time this is what happened.

I wanted someone to know. I seriously don’t know if I should reach out to the other dude and tell him his personal pictures are being used. I found who that guy was with reverse image searches. But it turns out he is already married from a couple of years. Apparently my so called bf and this picture dude were friends. I don’t know the details but I’m not sure if I should reach out and tell him that it’s an identity theft as in using pictures of him. But now knowing that he is married I don’t want to disrupt anyone’s married life. On the other hand I feel if I don’t speak up it could happen to others too…

On the second meeting I took her to a gallery and we went through it talking about the paintings and such, she accepted my request to take my arm and after we left the gallery we held hands and got an ice cream. After a short walk we sat on a bench and made out for a fair while, this was about halfway through the date. Then we walked around and kissed some more and I played her some music since we happened upon a guitar shop. Then I walked her back to her university campus, during the walk back she stopped to initiate a kiss many times so I assume she’s rather interested in me. We also both agreed that we’re not looking for casual sex or anything like that during the date. 

We’ve got plans to meet again this weekend but I’m unsure if I should bring a gift at all? It turns out I missed her birthday by a bit over a month (it was in august) and I joked around saying I’d buy her something as a belated birthday present to which she said that’d make her feel quite shy. 

Anyway she’s a foreign student and may be returning home by early next year if she can’t find a job over in my country (that’s the worst case scenario), that paired with the fact that we both know what we’re looking for from each other and also the fact that I just missed her birthday tells me I should get her a gift. Nothing major I was thinking a cute pendant or something along those lines. 

Do you think it’s too early to do so? If she does end up leaving I’d like her to have something to remember me by but I don’t want to come across in a bad way at all. What are your thoughts?

But the fact is he tells me he likes me but pulls up rules he set for himself like to not date anyone under his age gap (as he prefers older women) and to not date people who have been his friends exes. But the reason I'm distraught is because of these rules it seems even if in the future I went and made the money financially to get to be with him he would reject me their.

I normally don't worry as much about getting catfished on Hinge because unlike Tinder or Bumble, there aren't as many fake profiles, and the ones that are look really obvious. This person used pictures of a woman who was not overly attractive in the way that screamed ""FAKE PROFILE!"" but attractive enough to get a guy's attention, and their conversation skills were normal and fluid.

I was suspicious that something was off when the person wanted to text on one of those texting apps rather than exchange numbers, but I did so anyway giving them the benefit of the doubt. They shared a few more normal pictures throughout the day -- nothing weird, but also asked if I had any more, too. I sent two that barely even showed me due to distance or angle just to be safe. They then suggested we video call later on that evening on Google Hangouts. When I went to Hangouts, their Google profile picture was a picture of them, so I again didn't think much of it. However, then came the excuse: ""I need to setup my Macbook. It's been awhile since I did that."" ""Sorry, give me a few more moments. I'll call you."" And then they never did. 

At this point, I decided to screen grab their profile pictures and do a reverse image search. It led me to a single result off Pinterest, which then led to an Instagram account of a public profile that had enough followers, but wasn't like some sort of influencer. The name and location on the profile didn't match the Hinge profile, and at that point, I saw the person had unmatched me there. I'd been catfished.

Today, I went back to the text app to find the person, and lo and behold, they had edited their profile there to include what I am assuming was their real picture. She was actually a he, and by he, I mean an old creepy, non-smiling man who looked like some sort of sexual predator. I was disgusted and felt so violated. Luckily, I still had pictures they had sent me of the fake person, so I took all of that information and contacted Hinge to file a report with them.

Not sure if I should try to start something with her as the shared flat is rather small and I'm afraid it could get awkward quickly if it doesn't work out, being stuck in the same household.  

So I (M24) am about to move out from home for the first time in the first week of November. I found a room in a shared flat with three young women roughly my age.

One of them, let's call her S, however, seems to be particularly intrested in me. LIke, I've met this person two times this far for a couple of hours so obviously it's early to conclude everything, and she seems to be rather extroverted and talkative in general, but this still seems to be more than general curiosity or politeness.

We had a sort of roommate casting two weeks ago and due to various reasons, the two of us ended up alone in the kitchen while the others were all busy, and we just ended up talking for like four hours (although I originally planned to just drop by for a short little basic chitchat to introduce myself). Anyway, as the conversation carried on, she seemed to be inching closer all the time, we had some genuinly nice ""deep talk"" about rather personal stuff, and I noticed she kept slowly sliding her feet towards mine but jammed them back every time I accidentally looked down. Also seemed rather surprised but happy when I offered her a hug at the end of the night.

Fast forward to this week, I made a spontaneous visit to my future flat to discuss some stuff with my predecessor. As we were talking in the kitchen, S comes in and visibly flinches (with a shy smile) upon realising I'm there, and for some reason apologizes for not texting me in the past week.

I do have to admit that I also think she's kinda cute.

But I'm also rather inexperienced when it comes to dating, so maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part as I may be just glad that a woman is giving me her attenton. Do y'all think she's trying to signal she's intrested?

Even though we were distant we continued to text for a couple of weeks ... she confessed that she really liked me, I did the same.

I tried to get over her,  however,  every night i found myself looking at her insta and looking at her pictures I still had saved  on my phone. I thought this was not big of a deal, I tried to meet new girls, hoping I could forget her.. Despite having chances I never conlcuded anything with new girls, and my mind kept going back to her.

My girlfriend felt I was too focused on that and she wasn’t getting enough attention or affection from me, and we would usually get into fights about it. The demand was heavy on me bc I simply didn’t want to put effort in but I didn’t recognized that at the time

I really wanted to focus on getting myself right and I felt that it wasn’t fair for me to stay in a relationship with her, when I’m not giving her what she needs, she was an amazing gf but I decided to break things of with her bc she wasn’t going to leave but I explain to her why, and she understood. 

When I made that decision I was prepared to lose her, if she moves on however fast i wouldn’t regret it. A month has gone by without communication and I had time to reflect on all the things I was doing wrong and learned that my struggles wasn’t caused by being w her so I reached out and she was happy to talk to me. 

After some time we discussed if we wanted to retry things under the condition that we haven’t done anything with anyone else. If she has I wouldn’t want to get back together. She told me no and I haven’t either. Then a month has gone by and everything was so good and we love each other again. That’s when she told me that with the first week of our break up she slept with this one guy one time and I believed her and took time to process it then I find out from someone else that it was multiple times which socked me even more and her reason is bc she didn’t know if I was coming back and was feeling sad. 

I don’t blame her at all for what she did bc She didn’t do anything wrong and I was prepared for that at first, but after a month of spending time with her, rebuilding our relationship and then finding that out it shocked me not only did she kept that from me but she bent the truth about the story as well and idk what to do and what makes it harder for me is that it was one of my friend, I would’ve been fine if she told me from the beginning bc I wouldn’t have tried to work things out and walked away but now I have all these emotions for her and idk if it’s better to move on or try to get over it and stay.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1066917,public,self,"I broke up with my gf and within that first week she slept with someone multiple times, I told her we can try to fix things under the condition that we haven’t done anything w anyone else so she lied then told me 1 month after",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q85r4l/i_broke_up_with_my_gf_and_within_that_first_week/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

So we ended up going back to hers, we didn’t sleep together but make out and passed out ahah.

We woke up, spooned and cuddled for like 4/5 hours, chatting shit, messing with eachothers hands, playing with hair, her laying on top of me, few kisses here and there.

Like from this point it didn’t even feel like a date, felt like being with the gf and hanging out.

I then had to leave, as I’m walking out she hugs me from behind, quick goodbye kiss and I go.
