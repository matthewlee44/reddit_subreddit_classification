1,s1ba0p,1641902272,UPDATE: I (25F) thinks the guy (27M) I’m dating did something inappropriate while I was asleep.,"**Trigger warning mention of assault

 [previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtiaf5/i_25f_thinks_the_guy_27m_im_dating_did_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

First off thank you to everyone who commented. I learned so much and felt validated and supported. You all are wonderful.

Now for the update. It’s been a over a week since H boldly confessed to sexually assaulting me whenever I was asleep. As some suggested I did tell our mutual friend who set us up what happened. She felt extremely guilty but I assured her that it’s not her fault and H likely had all of us fooled with his nice guy act. She has been by my side 100%. 

I talked to my therapist about the situation. He confirmed what many of you all stated that this was in fact assault and that H’s behavior when being confronted about this was a major red flag. I’m increasing the frequency of my appointments for the foreseeable future. I don’t think I have fully processed what really happened but I know I need help. 

I really wish that I can say things have been on the up and up but truthfully I am drowning. Since H confessed I have been experiencing crippling insomnia. I use to be able to sleep like a log anywhere and almost immediately. Now I’m lucky if I can even get more than two hours of light sleep. I’m so fucking angry he took this from me. 

At first I wasn’t going to bother with reporting H. However, I quickly changed my mind when he immediately began harassing/stalking me. Myself and mutual friends blocked him on everything. But every day I have been getting multiple private calls and H has left gifts/notes asking for forgiveness. Sunday H showed up at my church. A church I never told him the name of. A church that is not his denomination and is near my parents(whom he has never met) so more than 45 minutes from his home. All he knew is that I never miss service b/c of my family. This scared me a lot. I am meeting with an advocate my therapist connected me with later this week that will help me move forward on pressing charges and getting a restraining order.

It’s been 9 days since my last interaction with H at my apartment and I have gotten at least 5 blocked calls a day. You guys were so right. I feel stupid for letting things get this far and just disgusted with H’s impact on my life. I’m so tired, I feel defeated and I just want everything to stop.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1ba0p/update_i_25f_thinks_the_guy_27m_im_dating_did/

I'm a soon 17M, and go to same school with this girl. Today I asked her to play sports with me on Saturday(she agreed to it beforehand) because I wanted to have meaning time with her in my birthday. She didn't say no, she said I'm not sure, I got bunch of tests coming up, but it sounds fun and I'll let you know. She additionally said I know that my friends would also love to play volleyball. Do you all know what is she meaning? So after that I said OK..... Since it was in crowded school, I didn't do it but I'm recently so stressed about me and her, so I really wanna express my feeling that I like her.

3,s1bslv,1641904112,Men deserve flowers to!,"Bringing a flower for a man on a date goes one of two ways. 

One (The least common in my experience) they get annoyed or feel emasculated and in that case? Why would you want to date them? Why would you want to be with someone who's masculinity is so fragile that they are offended by flowers? 

Two (Most of my experiences) They look confused for a bit and then light up. They tell you how they've never gotten/expected to get flowers. I've seen six foot tall men carry a single flower so gingerly like it's the most precious thing in the world. I've seen bulky biker type men try and sneakily glance at the flowers with this look of bewilderment on their faces. I've seen young men new to dating look like they are about to cry at a single small gesture. I've watched men try to learn how to carefully press or preserve flowers even though we decided not to date because it was their first one ever. I watch some of them them immediately soften up, like it's a single small pinprick that just drops their armor. Going from a rough ""I care about nothing"" dude to melting butter. 


A lot of men, they expect to chase a woman and be the one who has to prove themselves, they rarely expect to be wooed themselves. They come into dates expecting to shoulder the load and under a lot of pressure to act just right. Take some of that load off, show that you are just as invested in a gentle way. Make them get to feel special for a bit. Normalize bringing flowers to men. 



I think the strongest relationships are the ones where both partners still try to woo eachother occasionally. Not all the time, life settles down when you've been together awhile, but you should never stop trying. Your partner chooses you every single day. Don't forget to remind them why they make that choice. 



Don't give your partner time to doubt that they are loved and cared for, remind them occasionally. Do a little something to brighten their day. Dote on them a tiny bit occasionally. I've been dating my partner for a year and I still brush his hair and sneak him flowers because I want him to know he is always loved.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1bslv/men_deserve_flowers_to/

I’ve been talking to this guy for 4 months online now daily. He lives in the US, I live in Asia (important point for the following), but we’ve never met IRL. We met on social media randomly and it led to us chatting daily on Snapchat. We might meet some day. 

This morning he sent me “I wish you could cuddle with me rn” snapchat (he does that quite often when he sends me a good morning message), so I replied and we both playfully talked about me laying in his arms he said he’d kiss my forehead etc.

Then I just said absolutely and he said  “love you (my name)”. I asked him is it a common thing to say to everyone in the US culture, and he just said “no what do you mean”, 

I explained to him that for me “love you” is something you say only to family members or someone really important in my life. 

He then proceeded to say “That makes sense. Well then I don’t love you haha”

In the beginning of our chatting history he wasn’t affectionate much and only later started complimenting me and even confessed how badly he’d like to meet me.

12,s1dkvj,1641909710,Current Relationship Cultural Struggles - Help?!,"Hi everyone! I'm a Filipina American (F19) currently in a relationship with another Filipino American (M20). I can speak almost fluent Tagalog, but my partner can't really speak it. Since I'm starting to become an adult and I've been in my healthy relationship for 3 years now, I started thinking about the future and what I would want in a long-term relationship that leads to marriage. (Too early?)

Eventually I'd want to marry someone who can speak fluent Tagalog as I can, so that we can pass the language down to our kids. My current boyfriend isn't all too invested in the Filipino culture as well, and that's one drawback that I've kinda had in our relationship. I've talked about his disinterest in the culture, and he understood where I came from and tried to be more open about it (but honestly, selfishly speaking I feel as though I'd want a long term partner that has a better foot in the culture than a surface level understanding).

My problem now is what to do. I love my boyfriend, but he doesn't quite fit the bullet points of what I look for in a husband. Maybe it's too early for me to think this way, but I don't want to extend our relationship on if I know he is not the man for my solid future.

She hasn’t in the past couple days 

Here’s the story:

Can things get worse or am i just overthinking?

So my girlfriend (21) and I (24) have been seeing each other often which is good i like it a lot and I'm getting to know her a lot more. She lives in Nuevo Laredo which is across the border for me I live in Laredo, Texas so it's not much of a big deal. The relationship is still new and we’ve been official since November but have been talking since august.We had plans to watch Season 2 of Euphoria Sunday(yesterday) and also to make hot dogs for us while we watch. So anyways on Saturday night she asked me ""So we're seeing each other till tomorrow then?"" and I told her its however you want because she was going to a party she had to go to for a close friends kid's birthday party. So I told her I don't mind seeing you I can go for you if you like but if you want to stay at the party and hang out with your friends then that's alright. She later on said oh okay and later on that night she told me ""hey so I decided I'm going over"" so me all excited looking foward to her she messages me to go for her so I'm waiting about a block away from the border she gets in my truck and is MAD. She told me the guy's that work at the bridge made her throw away her food that she brought for me and her and also ingredients that she brought for the hotdogs. She's upset and obviously embarrassed because while all of that happend she sorta held up the line. I felt really bad because she didn't have to go through any of that and during the whole night we were watching a movie and she just getting on her phone and we weren't holding hands like we usually do or the usual stuff so i know she didn't feel good and i tried talking to her but she didn't want to so I didn't want to bring up what happend then when we went to bed she told me ""hey tomorrow can you drop me off early i don't think I'm going to stay here all day tomorrow"" so fast foward i drop her off the car ride is quiet she makes small talk and so do then. Then i wait till noon to text her just to give her space and asks how she's doing. We then start talking like nothing happend but i messaged her and told her that i was sorry for what she had to go through and I want her to feel more comfortable talking to me because i do care about how she feels and what she thinks and she just said that every thing that happend has nothing to do with me and it's not my fault and that she just likes spending time with herself which confused me because i feel like she doesn't know how to express her feelings. We're still texting but i don't know if maybe she's thinking if crossing is worth it anymore since she had to go through that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1do92/she_hasnt_called_me_babe_nor_any_of_the_usual_pet/

17,s1e1sj,1641911052,"I think I may be more invested than she is, but I cannot tell! How to proceed?","Hello reddit. I (26M) have gone on 4 dates with a woman my age. I cannot tell if I am more invested than she is or if we have different communication styles and she is slow to open up. I do not want to end up dating someone who likes me less than I like her.

On the dates she matches my energy very well. She is a great communicator, we get along, I like her sense of humor, she asks good questions, she is kind, and she almost always has initiated the conversation about the next date. 3/4 times she either slipped in the idea point blank for the next date or just straight up asked to see me again before I could, including on our last date. We talked on the phone once too in this month of knowing each other and she was very engaged and tried to drag out the conversation, in a good way. These are the good signs.

The following signs that make me wonder. I think they revolve around her communication preferences and the pace she wants to go, rather than her interest. I am not 100% certain of this though and worry this is an imbalanced thing. We do very little texting, she openly has said she is not a big texter. I am always the one to initiate texts about plans and have done the majority of the planning. That may be a gender roles thing. This isn't huge but I feel like she doesn't care too much when we are planning. 

We also have yet to kiss, she has turned me down for one, and her body language is very closed off so I don't make moves. I asked her about this on our last date and she said she is just slow to open up and be affectionate. She also mentioned a bad relationship where a guy didn't respect her boundaries. I don't know the detail but maybe all of this is just about her being cautious. 

But anyways, I want to communicate with her more in a way which respects that we are casual, though neither is talking to anyone else. I also want to respect that she wants a slow pace. I don't know if that is best to just be light hearted for a bit, or if asking direct questions is the better move. I am afraid she is uncomfortable with directly addressing the direction of us dating, so I don't to overwhelm her. That is the stress, I think we need to communicate more directly and often, which she seems to be a little more hesitant to do that and may think it be a deal breaker. Or at least that is what I am afraid of. The communication issues may all be solvable if I just approach appropriately. But does it seem like she just isn't into me like I am into her?

TL;DR: I am dating a woman who wants to go slow. That is okay, but we are going so slow that I think we aren't communicating enough for how long we have been talking. I want to try to make things work, but am afraid that addressing the issue would be too much for her this early on. That may all be in my head. Is she just not as into me as I am into her?

19,s1eiyd,1641912334,Can I love an EX for good if I behave like a needy nice guy.,"I (M21) have exited a relationship with (F19) around 1.5 years ago. It was mostly my fault for her dumbing me, because I was acting like a little girl. From then on until now, I haven't tried to get back together with her cause this was our try number two. I decided she is not for me and she is very immature, and I shouldn't have gotten in a relationship with her in the first place during this time.

 From time to time she still reaches out to me, calls my mom, asks her on the street about me, gets her mom to call my mom from time to time to ask her about ""business"" related questions. 

This is somewhat manageable, because I delete my Instagram DM's when she sends me something so I don't even bother reading it. Also I don't really care cause I live in my university campus now and not with my parents. Also I told my mom to ignore her, which she does a pretty good job of.

The problem is she wants to move to my university to ""pursue her dreams"". Next year we will be living in more-or-less the same building. And we will see eachother on campus.  

I have tried everything to cut contact with her. Ignoring her, saying to her directly that I don't want her. Every time I tell her to get away from me, she says something along the lines of ""if you wanted to talk/get back together, you can just ask, and not try to get my attention in such ways"". The self-absorbtion of this beatch is unbelievable. 

Can I use the way I acted in the end of the relationship but taken to the extreme. What I mean is to act needy, blow up her phone, say I love her all the time, ask her where she is, if she is with other guys in her company. Stuff like that, to make sure she loses respect for me permanently and won't ever contact me again. 

Being a responsible adult clearly doesn't work with her so I'd like some ideas.

I also question their characters when I see this blatant exaggeration. I want to be supportive, but when I feel like I have to bend (sometimes quite literally) to someone’s insecurity on date #1, I struggle. Does anyone have words of insight (really—I met three men recently and two lied about their height)? The one who didn’t is an inch shorter than me (as advertised) and I was relieved to feel like he didn’t care.

On the last Saturday, a friend and I went to a birthday party, and we met multiple people there. One of them was the girl I'm talking about. We talked, shared drinks, and danced until we moved to another party. At this second party, things started to get pretty interesting. We danced multiple times, and she was close all the time. While dancing, we stood face-to-face multiple times to nearly kiss. All this happened while our common friends were next to us. The party ended, and his friends told me to take her home. I left my friend in his house and asked this girl for her apartment address, but she didn't want to give it to me and insisted on going to my house to continue talking. I accepted.

We continued talking for about an hour. Later, I ask her if she wants me to take her home or if she prefers to stay and sleep. She doesn't want to decide, so she asks me what I want. Of course, I said that she could stay. We laid in bed together and continued talking for a few minutes. One thing that she said is that she never slept with a guy the first time she met him. I didn't know how to take that, so I didn't say anything. Then we cuddled and slept.

We woke up about seven hours later, and I took her to her apartment and arranged a date for the next weekend.

We have been texting for a couple of days now, and we have very similar points of view and interests, but I don't know if I'm a little paranoid or what, but I feel like she is giving me mixed signals. Sometimes she answers my texts even if I didn't end the message, and other times she takes hours to answer, and last night she left me on seen until I say good night.

 It is very possible that it's just me with my overthinking mind, but I want the opinions of others because I like her and I don't want to screw it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1gr4y/i_22m_am_going_on_a_second_date_and_im_confused/

32,s1gtnq,1641918288,"Did my boyfriend want me to say: ""I love you"" when he asked, ""if I had something to tell him?""","So basically, my boyfriend and I have been on and off for two years. We spent the first year as fwb, but generally we behaved like a couple anyway. However, we stopped seeing each other for like 6 months last year, we were off (because of me) and when we got together again, I said I love you accidentally during sex and he ghosted me. Then after that, we didn't talk  for several months (I think like 7 or 8 months, he did message, but I didn't want anything to do w him). I did a lot of self reflecting and realize that was lovebombing that i was doing. 

We both had our faults, so I wasn't really mad about him ghosting me because there's a lot of stuff I need to work on anyway. So we moved past it.  I see this go around as a new start, and I actually want to put in the work to make things good. I'm in a better place not only mentally but in life as well. 

Due to opposite schedules, we don't really get a whole lot of time together. if it is. it's like 30 minutes before I have class and when he's getting off work during the week but that isn't promised.  Or we get one day together, which is the weekend. So I'm generally very affectionate towards him like I feel like I turn into basically a giddy and happy person whenever  I see him because honestly I miss him alot during the week. I try my best to be at my best. 

  
But today, he made the effort to seeing me after work,  we were like talking and I was just smiling and looking at him as I do. He was like ""are you drunk?"" I was like  ""ha, no. the heck"" ""drunk on love?"" then he laughed and was like ""is there something you want to tell me""  and was just looking at me smiling. My mind immediately is like ""does he want me to say ""I love you""?, but I said no in a confused sense. 

But also, I might be petty, but I feel like he should be the one to say it. Like I do feel like I love him and have been wanting to say  it the last time i seen him, but I'm scared to say it at this point out of rejection or if I'm wrong about this interraction lol Like I did lowkey say it in a way, where I made him a playlist of songs that incapsulate the feelings I have for him. 

Like I do want to say I love you to him, but I'm also like ahhhh what if he's not at that level and I just read him wrong? He's generally a shy guy, but again, I feel like he should say it and not me. Should I just say fuck it and say it the next time I see him? Like I don't really mind if he isn't but I do want to tell him how I feel.  but i also, dont mind waiting until he says it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1gtnq/did_my_boyfriend_want_me_to_say_i_love_you_when/

And two of these were students, while I am working. Of all the American women I've gone out with(way more than 3), only one of them offered to split the check. The rest sat quietly and waited for me to say one check when they asked. And this includes American women of all races, even Asian-American women. In fact, one Asian-American woman I went out with told the waiter one check and let me pay it. Another was a doctor and still expected me to pay(I do not make as much money as a doctor).

I can't speak on other nationalities because I haven't dated enough of them to notice a pattern, but anecdotally, I went out with two Latinas and one European woman and neither of them offered to pay either.

It's ironic, because you'd think that with the west being less traditional in terms of gender roles, that American women would be less likely to expect men to pay.

I’m happy for them, but something else is getting to me. I have only been using dating apps since my breakup, and I’m surprised that I’ve never been able to get a date with anyone nearly as attractive as any of my exes from real life. It’s not that my exes are perfect or anything, I’ve just noticed whenever I see a girl’s profile who I would consider roughly in my usual league in real life, getting a match is impossible.

Have I just been dating way above my league this whole time for a decade, or is it just dating apps messing with how people usually match up?

It’s making me think my ex, who I consider gorgeous, will probably end up with a super successful male model after me, judging by the matches my female friends are getting, and it’s making me feel like crap

With the last guy I went out with, he wasn’t a good guy and he honestly broke my heart because he wasn’t as he seemed but also because I really fell for the potential in him. He *seemed* like the guy I had been waiting for.

I cut it off before we would have had sex and I’m trying to be strong in my choice, but right now, I just wish I had the intimacy we had over the nothing I have now. Like the intimacy/chemistry we had physically was so damn good I could cry. I know myself and don’t think I could handle just a hookup because I really want a relationship but right now, I feel so lonely and crave intimacy.

I feel like this post is all over the place. But I’ve just been feeling so lonely lately and been so close to finding love, my heart aches.

I don’t show that I’m attached but I get this unsettling feeling where I’m aware of it. I feel like I could find a boyfriend if I tried hard enough, but that would put me at risk of getting hurt and I just can’t handle anymore heartbreak. As bad as I want love, It seems every relationship I’ve had has only ended in heartbreak and it’s like when I do date, I feel like heartbreak is just an imminent thing.

I'm a 23 year old guy who never has had a relationship and is a virgin. I'm planning on changing that this year.

A couple of days ago I was browsing another subreddit. In one thread people talked about how long after getting to know someone they usually have sex together for the first time. Many people there (if not the majority) said that they usually have sex on the first date because they need to find out if the they fit together sexually.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading all this made me question if I'm normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I'm not going to desire to have sex with a Woman until I have a certain trust and emotional bond with her (before someone labels me ""demisexuall"": This is not about not perciving physial and pychological desires, I'm just a hopeless romantic (At least in my mind, if it's ok to use that term for yourself if you haven't dated anone yet)).

53,s1j75g,1641924177,Is it just me or is it really hard to start a relationship right now?,"Is it just me or is it extremely to start a relationship right now? Just in general it seems (for me at least) that it's extremely hard to meet someone in person especially since COVID happened. 

I have a decently sized group of friends that I hang out with. The issue is that all of my friends who live close to me are in relationships and all of my single friends are a few hours away. Since my friends who live close to me are all in relationships it just leaves me when looking to meet people in person. I don't really want to go to events and what not on my own as I'd much rather have some friends with me. The only issue is that whenever my friends and I hang out there's no one around in our age group; always people much older than us. We've had conversations about how we don't understand where everyone is. Especially since we know people our age who live in our town but no one ever seems to be around. Plus which fact because of COVID it's hard to determine if you're interested in someone or not since everyone’s wearing a mask. Also, I'm not going out as much anymore because of COVID.

Enter online dating. What I thought would be the solution to my relationship search. And nope. At least not yet... Since joining some dating apps back in June I've had very little success on these apps. I'm getting matches but not dates. The three major apps I've been using are Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder (I know tinder isn't the best app for a relationship but I figured it won't hurt to be on it).

Everything went great.  I asked her out.  She said she dated a guy for three years, is now broken up and has only been single for one week.  I blurted out, ""How about I get your number and contact you in a month?""  She loved that idea and happily gave me her number and said to text her.  Now I'm thinking it might be better to do the initial text a bit sooner.....maybe in two weeks or three weeks?  I wrote down her number so she doesn't even have my number at this point.   
 And then I'd just give her time before we actually go out or at least go slow once we go on a date or two.  And potentially even do day dates to stay true to going slow.  My internal tug of war is wanting to show lots of interest, but also respect that she just got out of something and she probably doesn't want to date anyone right now and potentially not for a while.  I definitely don't want to scare her off by pushing my agenda of wanting to date quickly which isn't actually my agenda anyway.  It's just that, as a guy, if I don't show enough interest it can be perceived as me not being interested.

60,s1jqnt,1641925538,It seems like it’s harder than ever for a virgin girl to get into a relationship if she wants to wait until there’s an emotional connection.,"Anyone else agree? It seems easy to find a guy who’s willing to have sex with you no strings attached. But I’ve heard, if you even want to pursue an actual dating relationship, the guy gets a heart attack. 

I’m my experience, I’ve never asked a guy for exclusivity or any sort of commitment. A lot of the guys Ive been on dates with, I just assumed they wouldn’t want to date a virgin because of the whole sexual compatibility thing people seem to care about. And then there’s the other aspect I’m competing with girls who are prettier and are more experienced in bed. So I always end things after three dates by sending them a text or ghosting since I figure they’re seeing other people anyway.

The first guy I liked in awhile, we made it to four dates. He was the first guy I told that I’m a virgin and asked if we could take things slow sexually. He said it was fine and to do it when I’m ready. But we fooled around on the fourth date and I got in my head, thinking he didn’t like me after I couldn’t make him orgasm. So I ended things with him after planning a fifth date with him because I’m looking for something longer term and I wasn’t sure what he was looking for. A few days later, he texts “if you change your mind and want to hang out, just let me know 🙃”

Is this a psychological thing or do you guys agree that finding a guy who doesn’t prioritize sex over connection is few and far between when dating?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1jqnt/it_seems_like_its_harder_than_ever_for_a_virgin/

I’m above average looking, have a stable career, and a range of different hobbies. 

I’ve been on dating apps for the past few years and have been successful in finding people to hookup with, but nothing beyond that. I noticed myself developing an addiction to them, and since, have deleted them because they were getting unhealthy. 

I’d love to meet people organically - in real life - and I’ve tried to do this actively over the years, but I don’t think I was going about it the right way. 

I don’t want to go out specifically to “meet people” because I find that’s cringey and desperate. I want to live my life doing things I enjoy and meet them as I go about my day.

Only issue here is that I’m a massive introvert. It takes me a lot of energy to overcome the anxiety of talking to a stranger. But I want to.

I see a lot of people on here meeting in coffee shops, grocery stores, hikes etc. I want to know from a woman’s perspective, how would you like a guy to approach you if you were in these scenarios?

i then started looking into it online, and it’s just as confusing. some people say that you can’t even broach the topic of labeling things until months into casually dating. as well as that it almost has this implication of forever so you shouldn’t label something that will last for a few years but life might pull you in different directions. i guess i sort of assumed the label didn’t mean too much. it’s just a way of saying you are seeing someone and mutuals enjoy each others time that is romantic and possibly sexual, whatever other terms you agree on. 

i guess i’m just confused and the last time i’ve actively heard the labels was in high school when my friends dated people, so that’s probably an immature way of looking at it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1kmg1/what_does_the_label_girlfriend_or_boyfriend_even/

We have similar level careers/income and shared a common town many years ago so we had that to talk about.  There was great banter as well as some good, deep conversations about what we wanted in a partner and are in complete alignment.

She agreed, we met and our date was awesome.  2/3 of the way through, she asked me what my week looked like sine she'd be near me for work (we live \~45 mins apart) and we made tentative plans for Tuesday early dinner after she had a work meeting.  That just fell through because her afternoon work meeting got cancelled so she was going to go home instead.  No big, it happens.

74,s1l0bh,1641928690,There is nothing wrong with not wanting to be alone.,"There's this movement in the self-help industry that you should be ""happy"" on your own, no matter what. And only after you're happy, you should look for somebody. And if you're not ""happy"" on your own, then you're focus is misguided.  This idea of hyper independence is ingrained in us. Women and men. Women are supposed to ""need no man"". Men are supposed to be these hyper stoic creatures. 

The truth is though that nobody who has really long dry spells says that. It's always people who are in a good position who claim that they wouldn't be bothered. Similiar to people with money who will tell everybody about the insignificance of money. Either that or people who have given up.

Looking for a partner is not about looking for happiness. It's about recognizing that you're a social animal. I'm not buying into the idea that we need to be content alone. Ultimately, we're here to couple up. There's a very old instinct that's driving both men and women to come together.

83,s1luu5,1641930798,"Hot &amp; Cold: A Tale As Old As Time (Long post, beware)","Matched with this girl last month via OLD, one of the big apps. I begin chatting her up, and we move pretty quickly to texting. I'm trying to set up a date, invite her to a show I was playing, but she's too busy, and she'd let me know when she's free. I had no faith she'd let me know when she's free. But I drop it, and leave it be for a week and a half, when I text her to see how she's doing. We begin to gain some momentum, finding commonalities in our culture growing up, and I felt we had some chemistry going, so I ask her out again. She's free one week from now. Perfect. Date set, reservations made, nerves are set. 

I'm only nervous, because this is the first girl in many dates last year that I'm actually excited about. Anyway, we meet at the restaurant and the chemistry is there. She is absolutely stunning, and I know right away, I want to see her again. After dinner, we go for a walk on the beach, and just continue talking. She alludes to setting up a second date, I hug her goodbye, kicking myself all the way home for not kissing her (like I've done and more with previous dates). I just didn't see the opening, and I didn't know if she was ready. 

Anyway, trying to set up a second date, but she's going on vacation for a week, and she said she'd see me when she gets back. I could not WAIT till that second date. I so enjoyed spending time with her. She gets back around New Year's, and we plan a second date. This time, she lets me pick her up in my car, and I had the night planned; dinner reservations (again) and then a nice cafe afterwards. 

And again, we hit it off, and I feel the chemistry is there, and I could not get enough of her. The time flew by. We again, after the cafe, went for a walk on the back, and ended up talking till 2:30AM. I drive her back, and we make out for a good ten seconds. I was absolutely euphoric. 

She tells me to text her when I get home, and I do. She tells me she wanted to continue kissing me. I agreed. The next morning (Thursday), she wanted to see a movie with me, just didn't know which one. She starts school the next week, so I figure since we're both feeling each other, then we wouldn't mind going on one more date before the week is over (bad call? who knows). On Friday morning, I tell her ""we're going out"" (this might have been my mistake, was trying to be assertive, didn't know how she'd take out). But it worked out, because she agreed, and I was going to pick her up in the evening. I bought her favorite flowers (ones that were out of season, but I got lucky), and had the whole night planned. 3 hours before, she said she wasn't in the mood to go out, and if we can do it next Friday. 

I was gutted, of course. But I told her at least let me drop something off for you, because I already got it and it won't last till next week (she had a feeling of what it was). She told me to park the car and bring clothes to lounge in. I was no longer gutted. 

I come over  and she makes us dinner, and we put on a movie. No making out, no cuddling, nothing. You can actually fit a whole other person in between our space on the couch. I was confused. She told me she didn't feel like making out, she doesn't believe in timelines for this or that. And that maybe she got into online dating too early after a recent breakup. But that she wanted to spend time with me and that's why she invited me over, otherwise she would have just grabbed the flowers and that was that. 

She was trying to end the night early, so after a bit of talking after the film, I left, without even a kiss goodbye. 

I. Was. Heartbroken. Where did I go wrong? I'm so confused, why did she invite me over if she didn't want to spend time with me? Maybe she was nervous for school starting next week? Maybe she was stressed about something else she didn't feel like discussing? You don't invite someone to where you live unless you want to see them again, no? 

I got into my car, dejected, and spent the next 48 hours sulking. I text her a day later, thanking her for dinner, and telling her now I have to return the favor by showing off my cooking skills. She was surprised I had any (I don't, but I'm gonna try), and told her let's how school goes and what kind of time I have (with a smiley face). 

I haven't really texted her since then. Gotta play it cool, right? Gotta feel what the person is giving you? I don't expect to hear from her again. I don't know what to do at this point. 

Do I let it go? Wait for her to come to me? Invite her over for dinner on Saturday night? My hopes are so damn low, you'd need to get down on your chest to see it. 

Felt this one was going somewhere, but as usual, the girls I'm excited to see again, are not in the right place to see me for some reason. I've had no problems with the last 5 or 6 dates taking it anywhere I wanted them to go. 

Whoever read this whole thing, I commend you, and I'm not sure why you did, but thank you. Needed to vent.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1luu5/hot_cold_a_tale_as_old_as_time_long_post_beware/

89,s1meav,1641932151,I have a deeper voice than most.,"A little background.
I’m a guy and after hearing that you might be like “Yeah, right! Guys all have a deep voice!” I’ve heard that a lot, but then I call new people and they get scared, make fun of me, or don’t believe it’s my real voice. I usually make an effort out in public to make my voice higher. Recently it’s been a real problem because over the last few months it got even deeper (which I didn’t think was possible). I’m 21 so it’s not like I’m some insecure teen, but it’s really gotten to be a problem.

My recent relationship.
I just started texting this girl after one of my friends gave my number to them. She said I was attractive and she’s really cute and nice, but I’m scared she’ll get uninterested if she hears my voice. Maybe I should try to change my voice? Like in public? Or maybe I should talk to her about it? I’m hoping she’ll be understanding, but maybe not.

93,s1mwch,1641933409,Why date people anymore when they always want things they don't have?,"**From male dating perspective**

Women find a man more attractive once they learn he has a wife or girlfriend, a study suggests.

They think he is more likely to be kind and faithful and, therefore, a good dad, psychologists believe.

Having a partner gives men an “attractiveness boost,” they say.

But women may just be swayed by the opinions of others — and are as likely to up their rating of artworks which others like.

The findings come from an experiment testing the notion of “mate-choice copying"".",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1mwch/why_date_people_anymore_when_they_always_want/

99,s1ncof,1641934570,BF has been financially supporting me - how can I show my appreciation?,"(Aside from the obvious intimate ways, lol) 

All jokes aside, my boyfriend of 2 years has been financially supporting me for the last month or so after I was laid off from my job. 

I’m not used to this dynamic, as I’m usually very independent and have never received support from a non-family member before. But, unemployment has been delayed for months and I had no other options. I needed his help. 

We live together and he has taken care of my half of the rent and utilities. He has provided all of my food/groceries, replaced my car battery when it suddenly died, paid my dogs vet bill when she injured her leg (because of course everything I own had to break down once I lost my job!) 

Basically he is going above and beyond in every direction to make sure I am taken care of. No one has ever made me feel so supported before 🥺🥺♥️ 

I’m close to a new job so hopefully this will
be over soon. But i feel like nothing im doing is showing him my appreciation. I feel guilty. Im of course paying him back after I get hired (I have a spreadsheet of all the bills he’s covered) 

In the meantime I’ve been taking care of the cooking and housekeeping, which feels useless in comparison to what he’s doing for me. With the exception of *intimate* things, what else can I be doing? I can’t think of anything meaningful I can do without money",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1ncof/bf_has_been_financially_supporting_me_how_can_i/
