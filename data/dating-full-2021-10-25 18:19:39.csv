Don’t get me wrong, i have come to realize i do have narcissistic traits but as i recall, i was consistently giving her reassurance and writing her paragraphs about trying to get her to trust me and how happy i was with her, just genuine things that someone should say to their girlfriend/boyfriend. I do admit that I would post on my private story that other people were flirting with me bc i had a jealousy issue and she wasn’t giving me the attention I wanted so I searched for it negatively. Here comes the but, we were never a thing. We did not make an oath to be loyal to each other. Maybe it was a form of miscommunication or maybe she had feelings for other people on the low, regardless of the case, i’m beginning to wonder if this is truly what I did or if it’s just that she wanted a reason to leave.

I met a girl at work. Let's call her G. 2 co-workers of mine said they think she's into me about a month ago and I've been flirting with her here and there. I texted her a few times just for small questions but I remember one time after we hit it off, when I went home she texted me some random thing about her friend (just some shit to talk). So I was like ""ok, she's definitely feeling it."" So I start texting back. We had a nice convo. After that nothing special happens for a while so I try texting her and get dry, quick responses.   
Contrary to this, I had her notice when girls either spend time with me or compliment me. One time another girl from work said I was attractive and G replied ""date him"" right away lol. Another time was a shift with a new girl, where we laughed a lot and had a good time. G told me some time during the shift ""really two love birds you guys are, u wanna date her huh?"" To which I replied I'm not interested, since I was and am interested in G.   
  

I barely get the time to talk with G recently and I want to ask her out when I get the chance. She came by work today and caught me off guard, then left like 5 minutes later. Wanted to go after her and ask her out but chickened out for 30 seconds and then had my other co-worker need help.  
  
I am going to have another shift with her in Wednesday  and I'm planning to do it. I hope I will have the chance. Since I've been missing out on doing it for a while now, I'm getting desperate and thinking about giving her a call instead of doing it face to face, which I want since I want to see her true reaction..  
  
She is 17, I am 18. I know we're young. I just want to try my luck and see how it is. Never had a girlfriend but I have enough social skills to go for one. What do you think? Is she uninterested in your opinion? I just don't see why she would be so dry whenever I text her... Is she playing hard to get?

This makes dating so much less confusing; you'll get a quick answer on whether or not someone is interested, regardless of the billions of variables that might make someone hard to read. This should also govern how you approach dating, texting and is generally how you judge if someone's highly interested in you or has low interest. Here it is:

#The formula

* If you're interested, ask them out.
* If they say yes, they're interested.
* If they say they're busy, but offer an alternative day (read: a specific day), they're genuinely busy but interested.
* If they say no, but only offer an excuse, they're not interested.

That's it. This is the bar that everything else in dating comes back to. Sometimes people are hard to read, disorganised or bad texters, and with this, you'll find out what they're actually thinking. And if you ask someone out twice and they give an excuse each time, you can leave the door open, but you'll know to move on.

#Tips

Generally, keep communication to a minimum between dates. You should only really be texting for that absolute minimum amount of discussion after first meeting/matching with them, and before asking to see them (1-2 days, but not much longer than a week). And then only really to arrange dates. I prefer to ask for their availability at the end of the week, and then work out the details from there, rather than starting off with a specific day and time. It puts them on the spot. If they're interested they'll help you arrange something. Conversely, if they're not interested, whatever excuse they generate as to why they're not free for a big stretch of time will make it that much more obvious. 

There's really not much to gain by texting too much. You'll be wasting time if they end up not wanting to see you. It's also easy to share too much over text and turn them off. Most people's standards are **sky-high** now. Why risk accidentally revealing something over text that might turn them off that they might overwise be willing to look once they know you in person? I'm not talking about revealing any sort of red flag either. For example, many people have interest or hobby preferences which your in-person personality could easily outweigh whatever it may be by magnitudes. But if they have a dozen other people they're talking to it's easier for them to drop you because of a minor nitpick. I suspect this is why so many people fade.

A more subtle but important part of this rule is right at the start - If you're interested, ask them out. You should be trying to do this pretty quickly after you realise you're interested. Waiting so long is just setting yourself up to waste time by potentially missing the window of opportunity. If they're going to reject you anyway then it's done and dusted pretty quickly, and actually opens the door to being friends after. 

#It's absolute

There is one more component to the rule though - It is almost entirely absolute. I bet a lot of people reading this are thinking something along the lines of:

""Makes sense, but probably doesn't apply to my specific situation. They have X reason why they can't meet up at the moment.""

I've been there a thousand times. What you need to realise about modern dating is that people don't reject you outright anymore. It's many more times easier to fade, ghost or give an excuse that leads you on with a small gap in the door. I've heard it all:

""I need to check with my friends when I might be free""
""I need to finish this exam first""
""I'm busy that weekend""
""I've had some bad news that's going to keep me busy for the next couple of weeks""
""It's gonna be hard to find time that's free in the next month or so""

If they're not getting back to you and suggesting an actual time to meet up, they're really just saying no. Even knowing that it's hard to avoid falling into the pitfall of analysing why whatever situation's happening might be unique to you. I've even had people show an extremely high interest only to be unable to commit to making time to see me. As mentioned before, you can try one more time to see if you'll catch the extremely rare exception to this rule, but otherwise leave it at that. It's sad and cruel a lot of communication in dating now is so far removed from what's actually being articulated, but in a dating world where no one's going to throw you a bone, you need something to fall back on to tell you what's actually happening.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1096743,public,self,Dating 101 - The Golden Formula,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfogis/dating_101_the_golden_formula/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I feel like I have a problem with limerence, and it's really frustrating because I want to move on so much. So as context, I met this girl at school two years ago, and I developed a pretty intense crush on her, and confessed to her early on (I before this learned not to let things stretch too long, and just speak up....), which she reciprocated. Then covid comes literally a month later. She still seemed interested into it, but then things went cold and eventually went bad. After one particularly bad argument, I blocked her and moved on a lot.

However, school started, and a month into it I saw her again in person for the first time since covid, and although we smoothed the arguments out, she both apologized for leading me on for that first year, but said she was not interested going forward. Here is where the limerence starts...

I feel like I have two sides. My logical/emotional side is so so done with her- even before I saw her at school again. There's been a lot of red flags, and I know there are lot better people out there. However, emotionally I feel like I can't let go. It comes in waves. I feel like I'll have a week or two when I'm super focused and don't think much about her, and then other weeks it just comes back rather intrusively.

Has anyone experienced something like this, or have any advice on moving on? (Meaning, to add to the article) Should I involved friends who know what happened into this?

As a follow up, how do you meet someone without this happening? I feel like I am learning because since then, I've asked a girl out (and got rejected) without this happening, but any additional advice is much appreciated.

She approached me and we started talking, I don’t vividly remember our conversation but she asked me what my race was (I am south Asian and she is southeast Asian) and stuff like that. I asked for her instagram at the end of our conversation. I texted her the same day we got each other’s Instagram, but all she did was heart my messages, no response. The day after, In class, she said hi to me and introduced me to her friends, since we were in class we didn’t really talk much, we also didn’t sit that close to each other. Then the same day I got introduced to her friends, I texted her again, all she did was heart it again. The text I sent her was a video clip of a video game. The day after, she didn’t wave to me but she just asked me if I finished the work. We escalated from waves to her giving me high fives in class we would only say wassup to each other. In class she sits nexts to a group of girls and they together are very loud. So one day I got the courage to ask the group of girls if I can sit with them, they agreed and I sat with them.

Im 30 years old and a divorced single mom. Pretty obvious why that’s a hurdle.

Im a shy and nervous person. I have social anxiety and have a hard time taking the first step into having a conversation, and the thought of meeting someone in person gives my stomach knots. When I meet people in person organically I am completely different. Im pretty likable over all, as long as people don’t mind my sarcasm and nerdy hobbies.

Im very nervous about intimacy, I’ve had bad experiences and I’m not good at communicating things regarding sex. I’ve never actually had a serious conversation around boundaries aside from one person and those were blatantly ignored. It’s not so much that I’m worried about that happening again, I just have no idea how to approach the topic. I’ve been in only a few relationships and the guy I lost my virginity to ended up being my husband and father of my kids, and I wasn’t even comfortable talking to him about this stuff. There are a few things specifically that are a hard line for me and I am worried that it will be a big deal that makes them no longer interested.

I have absolutely no problem getting dates with all sorts of men, but none of them seem to like me for anything but sex.
I'm not stunning or anything like that but I exercise a lot etc so getting men's attention has never been a problem, but I very clearly specify on my profile I want a relationship and I'm not interested in hookups. My photos are nice but not overly showy or super sexy or anything like that because I am not after sex. I also talk about my hobbies etc on my profile.

I'd totally delete my Hinge account if I lived in a smaller city, but I live in London and life is so hectic, fast paced and individualistic here that it's very, very difficult to meet someone organically.

Getting matches, convos and dates is not a problem. Most men I meet through dating apps are like super interested in me, my hobbies, my interests, my life etc until we fuck (be that on date 2 or date 276263727). Once we do, the amount of texts goes drastically down almost immediately, and so does the amount of interest they show.
Sometimes they ghost or even block me out of the blue, but they often keep talking to me (only much less, and in a more distant/less frequent way) and meeting me, though (at their convenience and if possible at night to get sex, rather than day plans). 

Before you ask, no, I'm not going for guys that are out my league, with abs, super amazing bodies, or amazing jobs or anything like that. I'm talking very average guys, that seem genuine, interested and nice until I have sex with them. My friends (both male and female)  have seen the people I go on dates with and they often say I am out of their league and not the other way around. I like very normal guys, not gym bros or supermodels.

Also, I'm all for making an effort when it comes to talking, texting, planning dates etc. I don't expect (or let) the man do everything every time. I'm communicative, I'm hard working, super active, I have multiple hobbies, I'm conventionally attractive, I take care of myself, I'm probably not amazing in bed for everyone, but I also really don't think that is the problem.

She offered to meet up for drinks last night around 8pm, but getting to her required driving an hour into the city, plus wading traffic on a Sunday night that would turn that drive probably in 1.5-2 hours once you figure taking in the T to get to her.

I don't know why but I guess I keep imagining the worst scenarios...like if I end up in a ditch or if he looks nothing like his photos. He's also a bit of an awkward texter...so I'm a bit worried it'll be an awkward conversation. Also...I've never kissed anyone before...which I know is embarrassing at my age...but I'm worried if he tries to kiss me it'll be super awkward and I'll be really bad at it...and then he'll be super turned off by how inexperienced I am.

Honestly, a lot of my friends told me that being as inexperienced as I am at my age...is like a red flag/turn-off for a lot of people.

Also, who pays...I mean...it was never discussed. I guess we'll end up splitting the bill. I don't know... should I just offer to split with him...or should I wait for him to try to pay?

Also, I'm really into clothes and fashion...so I'm a bit worried I might outdress him on the date. I guess I should keep it more casual?

I'm not like super nervous...I guess I'm just imagining all the things that are probably going to go wrong...because shit just tends to go wrong in my case.

The guy is a few years older than me he's 23. I don't really think 3 years makes much of a difference honestly.

Also...part of me feels like I might've forced him into this date. Because... we've been texting for about 2+ weeks now...and I kept waiting for him to ask. Then he would say things...that like hinted at a date but not make any plans. So then finally I got sick of asking and just asked him. But...I mean why keep texting me, if he wasn't interested?

We broke up two weeks ago over an argument in which she left because she was tired of the arguing and also because of some mistakes I made in the past. (I suffer with anxiety, anger, and impulsivity). It ended pretty rough and she ended up blocking my number.

Last Friday she invited me to catch up and say sorry to soften the blow after the breakup and become friends again. The talk went really well, we caught up on each others lives, and I apologized and explained where I went wrong and how I let myself go and became someone I wasnt in the relationship which caused me to make some mistakes, and sometimes take my anger and impulsivity out on her. I told her im not the person I was by the end of the relationship and I wouldn’t let that happen again. She said she really appreciated me saying those things and noticed how I had owned up for what I did wrong and said she wants to remain friends and keep in contact. She forgave me for being a different person, but said that some of the things I did really hurt her. She said she would really have to think about getting back together, but it could be a possibility in the future. We ended at that and we were both happy to talk it out.

But then here’s where things got messy again. That same night, my friends and I were having a party and she had told me she might come by and we might see each other there. She ends up unblocking me and texting me during the party saying “can you get me a ride to the party plz?” She then said “nvm” I said “no worries, just let me know if you need one.” I assumed she wasnt going to the party. Turns out she was at the party, and completely ignored me while she was there. Several of my friends asked me if I saw her and I said no. I decided to text her and said “hey, a few of my friends saw you at the party, did you see me?” She ignored my question and replied “I fell walking home”. At this point I became concerned, I asked her if she was ok, and told her if she needed anything let me know. She said she was fine and I left it at that.

But the next day I thought about it all and felt a little bit hurt by the fact that she 1. Unblocked me just to ask for a ride. 2. Didnt even say hi to me after we had just made up and were now “friends” and 3. Texted me saying she fell, didnt answer my question about seeing me and expected me to feel bad for her about falling. It seemed like she was giving me mixed signals.

I decided to text her and here’s how it went down.

Me: Did you unblock my number last night and ask me for a ride and not say hi to me or acknowledge me at the party?

Her: This just proves you haven’t changed.

Me: What? Lol.

Me: I am just wondering, I thought it was kinda weird you didnt say anything to me..

Me: Am I not allowed to ask that question? I mean you don’t have to say hi to me but we had just made up and you asking me for a ride, and then telling me you fell but not saying hi to me kind of upset me you know?

Me: \*\*long text telling her how I wasnt starting a fight or anything, I was just curious about it. How its not really nice to become “friends” again, unblock me, first thing you do is text me for a ride, and then not acknowledge me at the party or at least tell me she was there. Told her that her telling me she fell and I was concerned about her, just doesn’t seem like she’s being the “friend” she said she wanted to be. I told her I felt like I was just doing too much and she was asking for a lot and that it wasn’t a fair friendship. It seemed like her telling me she fell was to get an emotional reaction because she knew I cared.\*\*

Her: This is harrasment, I don’t want any communication anymore. You won’t stop texting me. You are texting out of impulse. It’s my choice if I see you. Its my choice if I text you. Call or text me one more time and im calling the cops. Im done.

\*\*she then blocked me and I went to sleep\*\*

I just don’t understand. I feel bad because I obviously didn’t mean to harass her, yeah, I texted her 4 times and sent a long text but I wasnt harrassing her, just telling her how I felt. I can see how it was annoying to her and she was probably overwhelmed, but on the other end, she did give me some mixed signals by saying she wanted to be friends, and would think about the relationship again. As well as unblocking me and asking for a ride, then telling me she fell.

I feel bad for getting upset and obviously she doesn’t have to say hi to me or text me, but based on the circumstances, considering we just made up and she texted me about a ride to the party, it would be nice to at least say hi. And I don’t think telling me she fell is really a thing friends say. It seems like she wanted support because she knew I cared about her.

I just feel like she took it too far and saying I was harrassing her and that she would call the cops wasnt super nice, as well as the mixed signals she gave me that night. On the other end, I do feel bad for getting upset with her. Im still blocked, but I don’t know what to do. It’s hard to move on because I know she didnt mean to go as far as calling me a harasser and threatening the cops on me, but I can see how shed be overwhelmed. I just want to make things right but im blocked and I don’t want to reach out to her another way cause she might call the cops.

Do you think she’ll unblock me and maybe reach out again? I want to apologize for my part too because I don’t want her to think I was harrassing her, and I want to tell her that I just wanted to get my feelings across based on the circumstances. It’s a tough one, and I know she still has feelings for me and knows that I didnt mean to harass her, but Im stuck now and obviously I feel bad for what I did, but I still don’t think she was in the right either.

Maybe it's just too soon to be friends cause we both have feelings for each other? Maybe she didnt mean to be friends (but why would she text me first and ask to stay in contact?) Maybe she changed her mind? Maybe I am completely in the wrong and not realizing it? I feel like it goes both ways.

TL;DR; My GF and I made up, decided to keep in contact and remain friends. She wants to think about getting back together but not right now. She texted me asking for some favors, and texted me for support. I got upset that she was asking for these things but ignoring me. she thinks im harassing her by getting upset..",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1096853,public,self,I am completely lost and all hope is gone.. help me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfpt0n/i_am_completely_lost_and_all_hope_is_gone_help_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

At one point, she walked towards my table and we both locked eyes and smile at each other for a good 2-3 seconds (it was that genuine smile where her eyes crease, she was wearing a mask)

5 minutes or so later, I'm watching the college football game they have on TV and noticed from the corner of my eye that she stopped and stood where I could see her from my right peripheral vision and she looked around at my direction and then looked straight at me for a few seconds when I wasn't looking.

I recently got friend zoned by a lady i was very much into. I did all the things my mom told me was good to do to a girl. My female friends also gave me good pointers, but at the end of the day I still got friend zoned. 

To all the fellas reading this, just drop it if she tells you she just wants to be your friend. Just leave her be and move on. She just told you that she does not see you romantically anymore and there is nothing you can do about it. You will be a lot happier in the long run if you just move on. 


Now this is for everyone:
The most important validation comes from yourself. Im writing this because friends complain a lot about this so I’m hoping this will reach the right people.

People in life can and will break your heart if they mean to or not. You are vulnerable in dating, thats the way it is. 

If you depend on how the opposite gender treats you to show you what you are worth you will be miserable. Love yourself and give that meaning

He's super thoughtful, always tries to make me happy and feel safe and taken care of. I had a horrible relationship previously, which was my only other dating experience, and so I'm def coming into this one with a lot of baggage. Especially about sex. I've communicated with him when I feel insecure and how I can make things better and so far things have been going well. I have noticed that he doesn't do a lot when it comes to foreplay And we've definitely had discussions about how to improve foreplay. He also has told me that his last ex was incredibly unenthusiastic about giving him head, and I have definitely made it a point to give him oral very enthusiastically even when he doesn't ask for it, which he appreciates. He is probably eaten me out 10% of the time and I give him head 50% of the time we have sex.

Here's the main part of the story and why I'm asking for advice.
We went on a road trip and it took 4 hours one way for us to get there and get back. I gave him head on the way there (for 30 mins) we did have sex that night as well, and the next morning after we left I gave him road head again (10-15 mins). The second time I gave him road head, I told him that when we got back to his place I wanted him to eat me out, which he gladly agreed to at the time. After we got back, we ended up having a really good and very lengthy discussion (3 hours) about his own relationship past. It's something I've talked with him about a lot but he hasn't opened up to me like that before, and so it was a really great thing. At the end of the discussion, I did feel very much like I needed and wanted him to deliver on his promise for oral sex because we just had a very emotionally vulnerable conversation and I needed physical touch. I kind of brought it up and he said he wanted to ""save it"" for later in the week. He made plans with me for 2 days from now where we could bike, I would cook him dinner and then he would eat me out.

Honestly it pissed me off a lot and hurt my feelings. I consistently provide him oral sex and I feel that it's not being reciprocated. I don't know if he just doesn't like to give oral sex or if it's me (I am always very clean)?? I also feel like he might be delaying because he wasnt going to benefit from it because he had already came earlier. It's harder for me to receive oral when I know that he's not taken care of, so I was very excited to do it when I knew that he was already taking care of so I could just enjoy it.

I feel rejected and not really cared for a whole lot and I think maybe I'm being dramatic. When I left his place he asked me if I was okay with waiting to be eaten out and I said it was fine (because I don't want to beg for him to do that for me), He followed up with a second question asking if I was secretly upset and just wasn't talking about it. Which I said no. Honestly I was emotionally exhausted from our previous conversation and really upset at that point and didn't want to talk about it.

Now I feel like I can't really bring it up because I told him I was okay, but it's really bothering me a lot and I don't know how to proceed from here. I feel like I shouldn't have to beg for oral sex and he was rude and inconsiderate for not following thru on his promise. 


TLDR: I gave him head twice in a weekend, he promised to reciprocate, and then rescheduled it. I don't think he actually wants to eat me out and it pissed me off because I willingly give him head frequently and always try to make him feel wanted.

To be perfectly frank, I kind of play it by ear. If she's receptive to my touch, and not pulling away, I'll stop, but several times I've slowly touched the girls hand/shoulder/arm when we're walking and if I get  a good response or she leans into me/rubs against me, I'll take her hand.

Mind you, I had asked him 2-3 times after 1.5months of dating to be exclusive and he rejected it. He always reassured me it wasn't because he was seeing or talking to anyone else. He just needed more time with me to be sure.

Before reading my thread, I want to put a disclaimer, I am not american, never been there, so you can’t put the experiences and shares of american people in my country.

To introduce my life, I am a girl of 24 who’s french. I have social anxiety since I am 18. I try my best since almost a year to quit this fear. To have a social life again. So I see a psychiatrist with who I do CBT. My social anxiety is also due to my ASD. Which means that I struggle with social skills. But on top of the cake is I am not white. I’ve never faced racism, or rejection based on my race. I’ve never been race conscious when I was a child, even as a teenager. But I realized since some months, as well as my social weaknesses, my skin color could be a struggle to find true happiness. I feel I wouldn’t be able to find a real/ true partner. There are way too many bad representations/ stereotypes around black women and it disgusts me. People tell me be yourself, and you will find someone who’ll love as you are. I even had guys who complimented my looks multiple times (but I never believe them). But for some reasons (social anxiety and years of isolation), I’ve never been in a relationship. Around me, a lot of girls (all white) are in a relationship. I feel like the rule that be natural, be yourself is only for white girls. A lot of them don’t wear makeup, wear simple clothes and are still fancied, married worthy, relationship worthy. Other than that, I’m tall and thin but I feel like a short and chubby white girl will still be more likeable, desirable.

I'm open ears:

I feel like the norms of dance change depending on culture and era, but at its core, partnered dances are mating calls and are physically intimate at its core. My girlfriend mentions that she ""feels free"" and it's a form of escapism/stress relief. She has mentioned that if a partner pushes her waist one way, she reacts and it's an beautiful artform. It's a very close embrace. How I see it is, if you do the dance moves alone, it doesn't feel the same way, but that intimacy disguised as a ""connection"" with a partner is what allows that magical feeling to happen. Latin dancing is, above all, ""lead"" and ""follow."" Without the music itself, the closeness of Zouk and Bachata are just embracing, holding hands, being close and looking into each other's eyes. Yes, you can argue that it's just dance or I don't feel anything for my dance partner. I for one, see physical touch as something that creates a random spark if I find that person attractive, regardless of my intentions or relationship status.

I found this statement from a woman on Quora regarding the topic:

""When I dance with someone, I connect with them in an incredibly intimate way. Not with all my dance partners, of course, but certainly with all of the good ones. It is incredibly easy to fall in love with someone while you dance with them. For a moment, you forget everything else in your life and lose yourself in the music, the rhythm, the movement, the sensuality, and the connection with your dance partner. If you are truly *in* the moment (which I believe is by far the best way to dance), then there is attraction, there is passion, and there is physical and emotional intimacy. When you are single, and dancing this way with multiple partners, the experience is magical - you can get to know so many different people in such an incredibly intimate way, and yet officially keep your distance off the dance floor.

Today I only dance salsa with my husband, because he is the only person with whom I want to be that intimate. Connecting with other men in such a sensual and personal way just doesn’t feel right to me anymore. Of course, I understand that different people have different limits, and I can respect that too. I know people who have polyamorous relationships, and are extremely happy. My personal limits are simply a ways in the opposite direction.

Now that said, of course I am very capable of turning off my connection to someone, and dancing with them by simply going through the motions and safely keeping them in the “friend zone”. I do that on occasion. I also think that many people who are still learning to dance only dance this way. But I find that the reason that I love to dance is for the passion, for the connection, and for the physical and emotional intimacy. And that is something that I only want to share with my husband.""",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1097062,public,self,My GF is an avid bachata/zouk dancer and I'm struggling with how close and physically intimate they are,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfs2tz/my_gf_is_an_avid_bachatazouk_dancer_and_im/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I (F22) have been hanging out with a guy (M22) that I really like for about 5 months! It started great but things weren’t exclusive and he slept with his ex. After that I have struggled a little to trust him but he said that was the end of it and he isn’t even talking to her at all anymore. I believed him and was excited because, like I said, I really like him and would make things official in a heartbeat! 

However, it has been a couple months of us only seeing with each other and I really want to make things official. Being boyfriend/girlfriend whatever. He doesn’t want to commit due to mental health, but I’m scared it is actually because he doesn’t like me that much, wants to see other people, still wants his ex, etc. I wanted to put my anxiety aside and do my best to trust him and try to help him help himself. Even if he doesn’t want to date me I still think he’s a good person who shouldn’t have to struggle with their mental health alone. 

It has been a few weeks of this, and then a couple of days ago he got the anonymous STD text. He got tested and is positive!!! I am alarmed and frankly very hurt. He says that he probably got it from when he was hooking up with his ex, but my anxiety is soaring. I kind of freaked out and asked if he was lying about only being with me. Now he thinks I am being over dramatic and unempathetic because he might have had it for a while without knowing and I’m just assuming the worst.

I've been going on online dating apps ever since I was 14. For a few years I would get matches every now and then. It would never go anywhere, but I felt like I had a chance to find a partner in high school which also never happened. The only intimacy I had with a girl was one kiss on her birthday as she liked me and I decided why not. This happened my 1st year of high school. We walked together for about 2 weeks, but I never had the courage to ask her out and we eventually stopped talking. 3 years later, I asked out a girl that was in my class and she gave me her number. I made sure it was her number by calling it in front of her since I'd gotten fake numbers before. She never texted me back either way. I idiotically never brought it up to her in class since I was too nervous. I completely lost my self-confidence and was severely depressed for 2 months. A couple of months passed and I would get some matches on dating apps and would talk about meeting up. I ended up realizing I wasn't ready to date and stopped talking to those people. I regret doing it the way I did since I never gave them any explanation and they were nice people. It wouldn't be till 3 years passed that I would go on an actual date. I went to the Dominican Republic for a month(go there all the time to visit family)and tried online dating there. It resulted in talking to several people. I ended up going out twice with a girl and we even kissed which was the first time I had done so in 7 years. We talked for a bit after I left, but decided to remain friends. I would end up going out with 2 people the next year and they were both only one date. The following year I ended up going out with a lot of people, but unfortunately it never went anywhere with anyone. There were only 2 people I went out with on 2 dates. I've never been on more than 2 dates with anyone. Typically it's in the Dominican Republic that someone is willing to go out with me more than once. In the US it's only happened with one person. For that reason I've wanted to live there and also because my family is there, but it's not worth it as you get very little pay and the cost of living is way too high for the amount you get paid. I end up trying to at least go on a few dates with someone over there in the hopes that it can get to be a long distance relationship, but it never ends up happening either way. Ever since the pandemic started, online dating has reached its lowest point. Last year, I got ghosted more times than I ever. In that year alone, I got ghosted more times than any year before combined... I ended up not going out with a single person that year. At the start of that year I developed an extremely strong connection with someone. We only talked about a week or 2. I had told her that I was tired of getting ghosted by people and that I wanted a real connection with someone and she felt the same way and that she never ghosted someone. I ironically became the first person she ghosted... I was already feeling depressed before and when she did that it got to the point I felt suicidal. I was able to cope through it, but getting ghosted constantly that year made me feel worthless. October came and I started talking to a girl that I also developed a decent connection with. We talked for about a month, which was the longest I had talked to anyone for in about a year more or less. I told her about my ghosting experiences and she felt bad and also said she doesn't ghost people. She ended up ghosted me as well. 2021 starts off the same as 2020 more or less, except that I didn't develop a good connection with someone like I did last year. I talked to a few people for the first few months. At the very least a few of them didn't ghost, but all except one I didn't enjoy talking to that much. In around May or June I started talking to someone, but we didn't talk as much. We would have a conversation every once in a while. I ended up asking her out one day at the end of July and she agreed, but the very next day she stopped talking to me. Another girl I talked to for about a week that same month did the same thing after asking her out. She agreed and then ghosted me. I ended up going to the Dominican republic a month ago because my aunt had died. I didn't really want to do anything because of the situation, but my friends/family suggested I force myself to go out with a friend or something to get my mind off of that and I listened. I talked to two girls. One of them agreed to go out with me and the day of she blocked me. I was baffled and upset as I'd never gotten ghosted by someone from out of the US before and a family member had died on top of that so it made me feel even more upset. I still convinced myself to go out with the other girl and actually enjoyed myself. We talked for almost a month, but we haven't talked in about a week for some reason. I've been trying to AT LEAST have a conversation with someone anywhere, but either no one talks to me or they send 1 or 2 messages and that's it. It's extremely exhausting mentally. I go on these dating apps every day and I get absolutely nowhere. I've been doing this for several years and I can't take it anymore. There's been times where I stop searching for someone for a month or two and get lonely and then get back into the same habit without any results. This year especially has felt the most exhausting and I thought that last year was bad due to all the ghosting, but not even being able to even talk to someone for several months here is extremely fatiguing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1097111,public,self,Dating feels impossible (24M),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfspx3/dating_feels_impossible_24m/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Now that I’ve been here for a while and we’ve passed the honeymoon phase(at least I’ve ), I’m starting to see I won’t be able to spend my life with him and that I can’t compromise to his major quirks and other differences we have. I don’t see this working out in the future.I have always said  I wanna work on our relationship despite of the problems we have, But honestly I don’t want to anymore. I don’t see this going anywhere and I’m emotionally getting drained. I’ve tried to break up once in the past.After that I’ve been trying to work on this.Not that I don’t love him, I don’t want to have him as my partner. He’d be a good friend and I don’t mind staying friends but no, no romantic relationship.

I did a google search around the first month on her, since she’s sort of a public figure &amp; an actress. I came to find out through a google search on a local blog, that someone called her out as a prostitute. 

I confronted her about it &amp; she told me that a girl, she knew back in the day was jealous and posted stuff to mess with her. She told me she took her to court and that they were able to trace the IP to her specifically so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

Fast forward 4 months later, her mask began to slip. She told me how she would hang out at strip clubs, she’s really pretty so owners would pay her to just hang out there. She swore she never stripped danced and how she was offered 10k to dance with a mask and she refused. How she’s also had sugar daddies but never acted on anything as she said she was just a serial dater &amp; guys would just buy her stuff as long as she gave them attention. So I gave her the benefit of the doubt again. 

Then she told me her ex-bff of 16 years was a stripper and an escort and she managed her at some points. That triggered everything and I bounced. She would show me how guys would offer her money &amp; she rejected, she has a modelmayhem profile but it’s for modeling specifically it says. She’s dated pro athletes &amp; a celebrity. Her net worth is about half a million.

I cut off all contact with her as I’m afraid to know what I got myself into! 

Is there a way to find out??

I ended up visiting friends in his city over the weekend and texted him a few days before my trip to see if he wanted to make plans.

One of my friends, unbeknownst to me, invited him out with us later in the night and he replied saying he was swamped with work and couldn't make it out. It's been a couple of days and I haven't heard from him since. 

I guess I'm just bummed that he totally ghosted me and didn't even bother giving me a heads up that he couldn't meet up anymore.

I (40M) recently decided to get back into the dating scene after getting divorced 18 months ago. 

I started a Bumble account a couple weeks ago and have been getting matched up with women pretty regularly. 

They of course have to initiate the conversation first before we can start chatting. I get alot of basic hellos and simple questions and people are certainly nice enough. No complaints there.  On Friday night I got matched up with ""Molly"" (37F) and she sent me a paragraph introducing herself, saying she liked my profile and how we shared similar interests, etc.  After looking at her profile, I was amazed that we liked many of the same things in our downtime away from work. We sent messages back and forth for only about an hour and she mentioned she was hosting friends from out of town and was busy until Sunday night. At this point, I""m certainly interested in getting to know her. She certainly piqued my interest.  I'm only checking my Bumble account 2 times a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Well shoot, on Sunday afternoon when I checked my account Molly had ""ended"" our conversation. Not a huge deal I guess because its online dating and we had only chatted briefly. 

Now the creepy part, maybe?  I live in a small town, and she lives in a small town about 90 miles away. She works in a very professional, specific line of work, so looking on facebook it was super easy to find her profile, it was the first name that popped up. 

Question is: Would it be creepy to send her flowers at work, or even a card of some kind wishing her all the best and hoping we can connect again, or should I just leave it be?

The first time I had set a deadline for myself to ask the girl out and before the deadline came around, covid hit and I lost touch with her.

Another time, I waited for so long (like 10 months) that she ended up going to an out of town university and we wouldn't see each other again.

This time though, the girls is in one of my classes and I just got the courage to ask her out when we were both entering the building at the same time. 

She said no, cause she already has a bf, at least I tried and got some closure.

After that, I went to a cafe and treated myself with hot chocolate and a slice of cake. My friends cheered my up which also helped. But over all, it was better than not asking her out and debating if she liked me or not.

For example, she called me today at around 6 pm, however I was napping. I woke up to a text saying: you - “call me whenever heart face emoji, also you: is busy.” For some reason, this sent me into a spiral of anxiety. I called her back and sent her a few texts saying I was asleep, but no response until a few minutes ago where she said she was in a study sesh, and she will try and ring me again tomorrow.

all the quick sex and temporary flings i have are really nice in the moment, and give me that temporary hit of dopamine i need to keep going. sex is just a way for me to claim validation and attention and obviously have the physical needs met. 

i love meeting new people as well, and getting to know their personalities and routine and also their trauma and what not.

but then i have these awful commitment issues; i can’t trust them, and i’m so cynical about love that the moment any cracks start showing (which usually takes only a few days), i leave to spare myself the inevitable bad ending that comes with my emotional unavailability, or i push them away.

i crave a deep and meaningful relationship with someone, but everyone is so predictable, the end is predictable and i’m predictable. i’ve met so many amazing people i share amazing chemistry with, that still don’t stay more than a few days because i don’t know how to be vulnerable with someone anymore. 

every time i have sex with someone i wonder if this is the guy that will finally see all the issues and think ‘yes shes fucked up, but it’s still something workable’ but i know that realistically i cant expect any man to fix my issues for me.

So anyways we are getting ready to go out its just us now, and the topic of if i meet a guy and wanna have sex with him then just txt him and he will sleep in the car and this rubbed me the wrong way so i responded by telling him in a joking manner if he finds a girl and goes home with her then he can call someone else to come and pick him up...he looked at me with a surprised face and reiterated we aren't in a relationship, i said okay whatever. Anyways we go out and get pretty drunk, he ought me a few drinks surprisingly, at one point i try to dance with him and he says I'm not ready for all that yet"" WHATEVER that means???, i immediately get upset and walk away from him to go do my own thing, he later comes looking for me just to make sure I'm ok i had met a group of random girls to talk to. Later he says he couldn't get any girls because i was ""standing next to him all night"" but he claims he saw plenty of men come up to me, so i don't see the issue. so then we go back to the hotel and we just sleep, after getting me pizza which he bought for me which was a kind gesture....not something you would do for ""just a friend"" but anyways we had a pretty good time overall he claims he had fun regardless. The next day i realize i lost my debit card while we were out bc i was so drunk so i cash apped him 60 and he withdrew it from the bank for me so i could have money for food and stuff i guess and then we drive back home. On the way back he falls asleep and at the 1 hour mark i start feeling sick and having anxiety so i ask him to drive even tho i had felt fine previously. So we make it home and i dont hear from him the rest of the night, and i start reflecting on what happened over the weekend and i get upset so i pour a drink and txt him that im done with this friendship, he responds by saying ""good morning and i understand"" I then realize maybe i was drunk and acting rashly so i then inform him i was drunk when i said that to which he told me i need to stop drinking so much, this honestly REALLY upset me because he drinks just as much, but i basically said ive just been drinking alot lately because ive been going through shit with my anxiety and stress THEN THIS IS THE KICKER he asks me if i have ever had therapy or considered therapy of some sort. Like the only reason ive been drinking everyday is because he has been stressing me out and playing with my emotions then he has the nerve to suggest i go to therapy, that statement just made me feel SO judged and like he basically called me crazy and desperate and suggested i need therapy, yes i did say i was drinking due to my mental health being bad lately but for him to say that idk it hurt my feelings and made me feel a mix of embarrassment and judgement bc this is my first time even opening up to him about my mental health struggles and we've know each other for about 6 months so to get that response idk how to take it or how to feel or what to do about the situation, I've been deeply depressed since we got back just overthinking everything.

Days went by and I never heard from him. We worked together today and he avoided me like the plague.
