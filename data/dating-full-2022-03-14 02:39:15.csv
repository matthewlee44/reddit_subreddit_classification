I spent the better part of the past 20 years getting 2 degrees and a certification, traveling the world (included the Peace Corps), getting my head &amp; body straight, and figuring out what I want in life. I realize I’m in an incredible position of privilege in that I was able to freeze my eggs before age 40. I did so in order to “buy time,” and yet here I am a couple years later and single as all get out. 

The past four guys I dated either didn’t want to have kids, thought they could change my mind on the matter, or flat out shared the fact that they have had vasectomies. Others never actually met up. Countless ghostings. One catfish. 

I’ve been told I’m attractive and that I’m a catch, but yet here I am. I’m 5’7, 145 pounds, redhead, have a great family, good job, earned a 819 credit score, and still am alone. I’m baffled X 

My “list” has been whittled down over the years and is now hella short. I am seeking emotionally mature and available, honest, and communicative. Oh, and that they would like a child. That’s it.

But overwhelmingly, I've been having bad experiences when it comes to being ghosted, flaked on, or generally bad attitudes when it comes to dating. 

The same drill comes through whether I meet someone in person organically or online, we hit it off, I set a time and place that's mutually agreed upon in a public neutral place - and either a ghost, a bail or a no-show. I'm just done with it all.

I'm not a perfect person, I'll be the first to admit that. I have problems, just like everyone else does. I also think I can bring a lot of value - have my life together, hobbies, good family / friends.

When I do meet someone and they decide to stay usually ends up being a lot of drama to the point where it's too much so I have to leave them. Or they end up being mentally unstable where they aren't truthful, cheating (I have to leave), or expect way too much out of a relationship.

I'm just done with dating at this point. I would like to find a partner I could settle down with even if I never get married to her. I tried the apps, in person, it's just a dating desert all around. 

Now focusing on things that are 100% return on investment and my self esteem and overall happiness has gone up - Dating has done nothing but negatively hurt my self esteem / confidence. 

For those that say "" just be more confident,"" confidence comes from having success and you can't be confident in something you're not having success in - so again, another reason why I quit dating.

Hey! So about 4 months ago things ended with my fwb. We were seeing each other for about 3 months and eventually I caught feelings. He was the first guy I ever went out with and I got attached. It ended when I asked if he was seeing other people and when he said yes, I had a breakdown and cried. Tbf I was also dealing with the death of my grandpa so I was already emotional at that time. 



He decided to end things because he didn’t want to hurt my feelings while he was casually dating others. Very soon after the break up, I realized I didn’t have feelings for him. I fell in love with the idea of him. I put him on a pedestal and thought he was perfect. Even though he had flaws just like me. I was addicted to the chase and uncertainty of it all. 


Well, 4 months have passed and I’ve been seeing other people and all feelings are gone. We’ve been doing no contact this whole time. I’ll know I’ll never have feelings for him again bc tbh, he makes a good friend but not a good partner. I know he’s not in an exclusive relationship right now and I want to reach out to him to be friends with benefits again. He was the best I ever had.

For the longest time I've had this feeling in the back of my mind that I really wanted to date a girl like her. I don't know why it wasn't her, but I guess it wasn't the right time before. Fast forward to last October we were hanging out for another close friend's birthday and something clicked and I started liking her. We were both drinking, and I think she had been a little flirty at that time but it was at a level that I could pretty easily mistake for just being friendly. We've had the kind of relationship where we hug each other, sit next to each other and such so I wasn't completely sure. I hadn't seen her since then but I've been thinking about her. I asked her to come to my birthday party last night and we were super tight knit the whole night. We were singing karaoke together, joking together, we had a couple moments where she was a getting a little  touchy like walking behind me a stroking my back, we were talking about scars we had, and she showed me where she supposedly had stitches, right below her lip which just made me stare at her lips and I wanted to kiss her so bad... I feel like she was being very intentional, but I was also pretty drunk/high. Everyone was treating me, and I had an amazing birthday party. So today I texted her saying that I was glad she came and that I had a blast hanging out with her and I haven't gotten a response. I'm feeling like I should ask her out now but she didn't even respond to my attempt to text her. So I'm at a loss of what to do, and I can't get her out of my head at all right now.

I personally have been rejected a good amount of times by men that want petite women. I hear from them that they want a woman to weigh very low and be less than 5'3 in order for them to fit their requirements. This is a hard requirement to meet because not many women are that short and weigh that little. So compared to tall men requirements, this requirement accounts for both weight and height.

Long story short, got in contact with a guy I have a long history with. It had been about 10 years since we last saw each other. We met up and ended up sleeping together, before we did I communicated to him that I did not want to be ghosted &amp; if he started seeing someone to please let me know, which he promised. We kept in contact for a bit here and there. I noticed a change in his communication, and a few days later he sent me a novel of how he was unavailable emotionally. I accepted &amp; still asked for a heads up. 

Today I saw on a girls story I went to high school with that she was over at his house, she was taking a video of his new dog. They don’t live in the same state, so she obviously traveled that same area. She didn’t have any other posts with friends or family in Arizona &amp; she normally posts everything. They were never close friends but she is always commenting on his pictures.

What are the odds that he is seeing her? What do you guys think?

Would you move? 2. Are u open to kids and something about polyamory, whcih im not into so i was checking. he said yea to the 2 important ones. So I kept chatting. I also said we couldn’t rly talk about future stuff until 3 months in (too many love bombing situations)… we are hitting that mark and while everythings going great, fantastic 
1. I found out he has 15k in credit card debt which is a major red flag for me- ive always been at poverty line but ive never had that much debt - but ive been saving a lot and feel good about where im at but this is def not how id want to start a family, he also works full time and barely has any money at the end of the month.

2. He doesnt seem to be thinking about moving to my town anytime soon nor does he want to. I had a business in my town but its closed since we started dating. If I didnt want to move should I really be considering a guy that I have to move for?

I know some of you will say this is moving fast. But I am 36, know I want a family and am pretty clear about communicating etc. 

Is this doomed? Is there any way I can justify keeping going if I know I dont want to be poor and struggling my whole lofe? 

Should I tell him im going to date other people while he pays off his debt or should I stay by a good man now that ivefound one? Tho I know there are more out there (im attractive fit and charismatic)

We then started spending more time together and that led to us hooking up one night. We then met up at a Starbucks the next day....he says that he enjoyed himself but he is not quick to jump into something else after a breakup but suggested that we continue to see how it goes and maybe it will turn into something serious.

Yeah....I heard this song and dance before but a part of me still can't resist the sex. After all, I have been dying to receive romantic or sexual attention from this man for two whole years. I'm at s place where I'll take what I can get. Even if he's not as serious about me as I am about him... it makes it easier to pretend he mine just for that brief moment even though he's not.

About a month ago I heard from one of my friends that he liked me too, but he wasn’t sure how I felt about him because I kept on giving mixed signals. This is true. I would let him put his arm around me about 50% of the time, but I’m not great with touch (didn’t get much of it as a kid lol) so I would occasionally get overwhelmed and pull away. I realized this was messing with his head and started feeling really guilty about it. At the same time he was telling a mutual friend that I was giving him said mixed signals and, last week, that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend. I freaked out and thought I had to put a stop to it, for his sake. I ended up hanging out with him with the intention of telling him we shouldn’t ruin the friendship. I couldn’t do it. I felt nauseous for hours. The next day I texted him saying I only saw him as a friend and couldn’t be in a relationship. He took it very well and said he hoped we could still be friends, but he told our mutual friend that he felt led on and wouldn’t talk to me for a while. Fair enough.

I study, work and have a dog so i have not much time to go out and meet new people, even though, i am pretty nervous about starting a conversation with a total stanger down the street.

I 'm 1.77m height and 85 kgs, and good looking. Usually I am quite easy going and funny, but the issue is when it comes to the proximity. I got scared of touching people, i do not like to invade personal space and always think that I am sexually harrasing. Im also freightended about being bulletined as a sexual predator, since particullary in this school some things have happened.

I went to a party where at least one girl tried to fuck me, one even tried to kiss me when i left, but i was drunk and scared so i avoided that, since another girl classmate was looking.

I am not looking for casual sex either, but i believe is going to be hard to find a girl about my age, i would like to have more serious relationship, since i havent had one in about 6 yrs or so.

I would appreciate some advices, and some help with my state of mind, apparently Im pretty frustrated sexually, i feel like I cannot live it openly, and always thinking something bad is going to happen.

It was weird because there were signs that said over wise. Even people that knew us was supposed that he didn’t like me back. Fast forward to January of this year, he wasn’t do so good and we don’t see each a lot so I surprised him with his favorite food at work. He was so surprised and he gave me a hug. He texted me later that night saying I helped him a lot. That’s when I noticed a shift in our friendship. I made a post saying I wanted to have a Valentine’s to go on a date with. He said he would be my Valentine’s. I was surprised, but agreed. I specifically said it was a date. This also made me nervous because we never really hang out with just the two of us. Mainly because we are always busy.Well he picked me up, we both were nervous. I was going to pay for our food or at least pay half but he would not let me pay. We ended having a really good time. He ended up texting me and telling me he had a lot of fun. After that he started to treat me different. He is sweeter and he comes visit me at work if he isn’t busy to talk to me.

I have been best friends with John\* since preschool, and we might be called brothers as we are always together, but to be honest when it came to dating I was always getting the short end of the stick because i would say i am a 4/10 or something, simply because no matter how hard I tried and got some form of progress with a girl, they would drop the "" can you tell me more about your friend"" bomb or can i get his number, it is so painful to think that a woman is interested in you and all smiley and lovey dovey but you find out they are using you as a stepping stone to get to your friend.  


its always been like that and going to bars and clubs with him you feel like his bodyguard, I remember we went on a double date, he hooked me up with the sister of the girl he was with, she was not being receptive at all for like an hour just giving yes or no answers not even trying to keep up with the conversation or showing any interest. I stood up and went to the bathroom to freshen up and get myself back into gear, coming back to the table she moved across the table next to him, so he was sitting in the middle of the two sisters. I didn't stay long cause i was so embarrassed i made an excuse to go home. I don't blame him cause its not his fault he is blessed with the only thing that seems to matter in life and that your facial arrangement.  


And one time he gave me his IG/Facebook password so i can help him with that 2-step authorization thing cause he isn't that tech savvy and attempts to have his IG hacked prompted him , I couldn't believe his DM's it was buzzing like times square in New York! compared to mine I was planet mars besides the occasional crypto scammers, I mean there are women overseas that are willing to catch flights to come meet him, thousands of unanswered and ignored DM's from so many women it was crazy, he even told me to help him accept all the friend requests my finger got tired from clicking accept at about 700 requests just to have 1000 new ones pop up again,I always never got why people catfish but I am starting to slowly understand why its  and its a horrible feeling to be ghosted, ignored, blueticked, seen receipted and blocked.

We catch up a few times a week for dates and are going on a week long holiday together in about a months time. I thought were were in a pretty decent position to progress the relationship further. 

Now I knew he was going to have a big weekend with his friends on this boys trip as he was going to a camping festival which is basically just a drug fuelled bender here in Aus. I just assumed he would at least send me one message just to check in with me as it is 4 days and we usually chat once a day. As we never had a conversation around him communicating with me over the weekend, I didn't feel it was okay for me to message first as he was obviously having a weekend away with his friends and if he wanted to chat, I feel like he would have contacted me.

He's been back since this morning (after 4 days away) and it's now nearly evening here. I still haven't heard anything from him and he's active on FB/Insta. 

Should I be concerned that something has happened or that he has lost interest? Or am I just over thinking it? I understand we are not 'exclusive' yet but I would have thought that if a relationship was his eventual intention he would at least have sent a message checking in just to make me feel at ease.

A couple of days later she shows up again and asks if I would like to grab some coffee with her. I'm stoked and I say yes.

I start texting her to sort out the details but she takes 3-4 days to reply any message, so it's impossible to have a conversation with her. She also added me to her close friends list on instagram and she posts things all the time there knowing I can see it, while ignoring messages. Mixed signals. Almost two weeks ago we finally set a date and time and that's supposed to be this Friday.


However, during that time I met another girl (22) on a dating app, and we've gone on 3 dates. Let's call her Sophie. She's like the complete opposite of Mary: we text everyday, she's clear about what she wants, and the interest she shows is consistent. It might be too soon to call it a relationship, but she did make it clear she would want to be exclusive if I want to keep seeing her and I told herThis happened like two days ago.


My dilemma is if I should still meet Mary for coffee or not. She's really lovely in person but the way she is online is just frustrating. My male friends told me to just make up an excuse to cancel and ghost her, but that's kinda mean. The women suggested I should meet her and find out what her deal is because it's impossible to have a conversation with her online, and maybe tell Sophie and see how she feels about it and maybe she could also suggest something.

I actually met her by accident while I wasn't looking for love. 

Now after I healed from that break up I wanted to read about dating and how it works and the more I read about it the more disgusted I become:

1. First of all, when I met my ex from the time I talked to her I felt she was different and wanted to pursue her. Now people tell me the odds of this happening are extremely low so you are supposed to date any available girl and hope you develop feelings for her or not. Dating someone you don't feel into then dumping them is just shitty idea. 
2. ""Her friends have to like you"" wtf ? am I dating her or her friends. my ex friends didn't like me at first but she kept pursuing me. 
3. ""Don't message a girl cause a bunch of other guys are doing it too"" so if a bunch of girls messaged me I just dump my gf, what ? 
4. ""If her social circuit has lots of hot guys you don't stand a chance"" so any girl is dating me because I'm the hottest guy available to her wtf ? I didn't date my ex because she was the girl with highest feminine features available to me I dated her because I saw myself in her.
5. ""She has to see you have value, like other girls are chasing you"" so now I have to manipulate other people and girls to like me ? 
6. ""She has to see you being a leader and commanding other males"" is this fucking animal kingdom ? I don't view people as leaders or followers we aren't dogs. 
7. You have to act in certain small range of behaviors like ""Don't try to impress her or she loses attraction"" ""Don't show weakness or she loses attraction"" ""Don't get too attached she loses attraction"" Don't get butterflies or nervous around her or she loses attraction essentially just don't fall in love for her cause she loses attraction XD
8. You have to make her laugh regularly, you have to show her value regularly you have to show her other girls are chasing you regularly you have to make sure you are her best option regularly you have to be stoic all the time don't show weakness don't get sad/depressed. 

Jesus christ fuck this, so everyone is now reduced to abstract values (Her prettiness makes her 7) (His height and because he's popular in school makes him solid 8 but when he loses his popularity for stupid reason he's now 5) 

No sense of uniqueness no sense of individuality no sense of connection, just putting people in hierarchy according to superficial stupid values (height - looks - money - personality ONLY IF IT INVOLVES OTHER PEOPLE/GIRLS LIKING YOU SUCH AS PLAYING GUITAR OR MONEY POTENTIAL OTHERWISE YOUR PERSONALITY HAS NO VALUE AT ALL).

""Just be yourself aaaaaaaand learn some seduction"" except learning seduction is all about manipulation and not being yourself in the slightest.

I felt like we really hit it off. We've been out 4 times in the last 2 weeks. Last weekend she came over to my house for dinner and a movie. We cuddled. Kissed. And she went home. 

She texted me a bit that night and we texted all the next day so I thought nothing of it. Then we texted a little bit Sunday morning as well. She typically answers texts really quickly even while working. For the 2-3 weeks I've known her the longest response time was about 20-25 minutes, but typically it's within 5 minutes.

So yesterday I ask her if she wants to get dinner this week with me and name a nearby restaurant I think she'd like. It took her 5 hours to respond. When she did eventually reply she said she would like to go, so that's good, but it was just really weird. I asked how her day was at work and she said it was a lot less busy than the day before. So if it was less busy than a day she was responding promptly, it's strange it took her so long, isn't it?

Obviously I didn't bring it up but now I kinda don't even want to go anymore.

I’m incredibly analytical. When I have problems to solve, I look at those problems from every angle and figure out the best way to solve that problem before I ever begin with my solution. 

But that doesn’t work with dating. So I don’t understand how it works. 

If it wasn’t creepy as hell, I’d honestly gladly follow around people who are dating to determine what steps they take that work, what doesn’t, gauging actions and reactions, because in my mind, dating is a problem to be solved.
But the reality is it’s not a problem that can be solved. It’s different for everyone, for every date.

My roommates are constantly meeting new girls and going on dates. Half the time I come home one of them is on the couch with a girl he just met snuggling up to him and all I can think is “HOW??”

I go on a date and the only thing I can think of is all the possible action/reactions that could happen. If I say “let’s go eat,” how will she react? Be happy that she gets some food? Disappointed with my choice? Irritated that it’s cliche? On the date, how do I balance the conversation? How do I make sure I’m not dominating the conversation, or letting it wither out and die? What questions would best spawn the most amount of conversation? What responses are the most truthful, yet not painfully lame? How far is too far with flirting? Is what I’m about to say flirting or not? How do I tell if she’s okay with it without looking like a creep? 

This is my brain 100% of the time when talking with girls. So it completely blows my mind that people can just talk to people and be so open with them.
