I’ve spent my life defending my abusive family and abusive exes. I am now talking to someone who has bipolar disorder and was hospitalized for it a few years ago, against his will. It was a terrible experience for him and he has my empathy. 

Today we were talking and I mentioned an ex’s name again as he was asking about how I had met one of my friends. He asked to hear about him and I told him about when he tried to strangle me. I then noted that his mental health further declined after we broke up and he was hospitalized and jailed at some point. 

He said “poor guy”

I said he was cruel to me and it wasn’t just because of mental illness. He had been abusive before that point. 

He said “how can you really separate it out?” And “Strangling isn’t a rational act”

After I told him the conversation had upset me(he asked if I was mad), he said he was “reacting from a mental health perspective to parts of it, not all”

He then headed to bed. I’m sleep deprived and just had a stressful emergency vet experience so I might be feeling overly sensitive. 

He did say something like “that’s terrible” after I told him about the strangling(and then another time he attacked me/sexually assaulted me, and the cruel things he said to hurt me) but it did feel like he was so quick to empathize with my ex. 

I really like him but I have honestly been concerned about becoming involved with someone who has had a psychotic episode and lives with bipolar disorder. I greatly empathize and I have mental health issues myself; I just fear instability and any abuse. I’m wanting to settle down with someone and have a quiet life. I want stability and peace. And I know I have a tendency to put my own needs and mental health aside to help a mentally ill partner.

Now here’s the part that’s bothering me: she said the word “ever” and the honest truth is that I would do it if I were single, but I wouldn’t do it with my gf bc I think it’s toxic in serious relationships. I’m always 100% honest with her and always want to keep it that way but was my answer a lie by not telling her that I would if I were single?

However, I feel insecure over the lack of experience I have. I've never had a boyfriend before. I've never kissed or had sex. However, he has an ex that he was with for five years. They broke up two years ago because she's pansexual and got with a girl. I don't think she cheated on him, but her heart wasn't really into it at the end. He knew she was pansexual, but he never would've guessed that this would happen.

He's experienced all the typical romantic stuff. Not only does he have experience, but he's way more experienced than a large majority of people our age. We're in our early twenties, and there's some people who've had a lot of experience, but few people have relationships that have lasted that long. So I'm worried that I'm going to be more immature about things. Also, I'm worried that all of my firsts won't be exciting to him. And why should they be? They're not his firsts. If anything, all of that (dating, kissing, sex, even anniversaries) won't be anything new to him. It's not that I'm insecure about the physical aspects, because it's good that one of us knows what we're doing. It's that I'm worried that I'm going to be too excited/nervous, and that may turn him off. Not because he doesn't care about me, but in terms of dating age, he's got a good five years on me.

The other girl, we also arranged a day to hang out and she said she was down.

A year ago I was outside late at night walking my dog wearing pajamas and a covid face mask, I had just finished dying my hair, I had no make up on,  I was on my cell phone on a call  and I was holding a bag of garbage on my way to the garbage bin....  
So basically I was looking sexy as hell as you could imagine 🤣

 A handsome guy pulls up, in a shiny nice new car and yells out his window where to find a street ... he was lost and asking for directions. So I told my friend on the phone to hold on and started conversing with him back-and-forth ...it was a bit awkward because we kind of had to yell since I was on the grass with my dog and he was in the middle of the road with his car and It was so late at night I was trying to be discreet but also polite at the same time.

I told him I wasn't from there and I couldn't help him find the road but that it sounded familiar and I thought it was close by. He told me my dog was really cute and then he mentioned that I was also cute ... he said oh you must have a boyfriend right? you couldn't possibly be single and then I said yeah I do actually and hes like oh yeah I figured. Then he told me his name and said it was nice to meet me and I said nice to meet you too but I never gave him my name back. As I had a bf at the time. Then I wished him luck on finding the street and he went on his way. 


After getting in from walking my dog, I thought oh my God what just happened.... I couldn't get the interaction out of my mind, it was so randomly unique and I thought I can't believe someone was just hitting on me with how I looked literally holding a bag of garbage but then thought how the banter flow was nice...and what a  random interaction connection it was. 

Months later in the summer time I had randomly drove past him in his vehicle but I was driving too fast and there was traffic so I couldn't like stop to talk to him and ever since then I've kept a note in my purse To give him just in case I happened to pass him by again.

The other day I was working later than usual. When she came in to do her normal tasks, she asked me if I could help her because she couldn't login to her computer. I was confused because she has used this computer on several occasions, but I went over anyway to help and it turned out the monitor wasn't even on...maybe it was a brain fart moment for her or maybe it was on purpose i'm not sure. So as I was more or less leaning over her to help turn on her monitor, **she started small talking me again only this time she was really touchy and kept grabbing my upper arm throughout the conversation**.

Hi, I(23m) am from Canada and have been dating my girlfriend(32F) for a few months now. My girlfriend however is a foreigner from Korea and just moved here about 7 months ago. She’s been using friend-meeting apps(people from different countries talk to other people from different countries in the other persons native language, so, her friend would speak Korean while she speaks their language, English, in this case), and other things to learn English. She’s made a lot of friends on the meeting app. I’m happy about it because she’s improved her English a lot! Even made real friends she talks to on the phone! However, today in the car, she kept talking about one of the friends she met on the dating app(36M) is so nice, speaks Korean well, and overall an amazing person. I was happy to hear that she’s met a good person, BUT, she brought up how she wanted to go to Montreal to visit him. I immediately felt my stomach sink. I told her I was upset and refused to talk to her for the rest of the ride. I was upset because it seems weird that she wants to travel to another province to see a person she’s never met before, albeit, they have conversations on the app. But I just can’t seem to shake off the upset feeling. Am I overreacting?

For the record, if the guy came to my city and she wanted to see him I’d totally be okay with it. It’s just, she wants to pay money out of her own pocket and pause her P.R. (Permanent resident) application and travel to another province to see this guy. I’m still a little upset while typing this and might be a little unclear at some points. Let me know if you need more info or clarification

We broke up because of his anger and his violent outbursts and drug use benzos, He couldn’t keep a job and I found out he was cheating on me with his sons mother for six months And she did heroin. When we broke up he made my life a living hell by stalking, harassing, threatening me calling the cops and CPS To make false reports. I mean he did it all. And he would randomly not talk to me for 1-3 months and then come out of the blue and want to get back together with me. He would scare off whoever I’m talking to at the time-  sometimes it’s easier to give in and be with him and he’s broken my heart multiple times we will talk for a week and everything will be so perfect, Tells me how much she loves me and how much he misses me and how he can’t wait to see your future and then he will just go ghost. And then in a month later he’ll text me off a texting app acting like everythings fine- he really tries so hard to get me back like he’ll buy me a promise ring and he’ll convince me that he’s serious. But recently in January I had him arrested for violating an order protection Because it came into my house at 5 PM. I already had a order from August when he broke in my house to robbed me at $500 since I didn’t want to be with him- the fact that he came into my house didn’t bother me (I was excited thinking he wanted to get back together) what bothered me was that he came into my house telling me that he needs me/loves me/wantd to be with me. But reality he was trying to use me for sex since he had a girlfriend (that he lied about) I did have him arrested At 10 o’clock that night because he wouldn’t stop harassing me calling me names and telling me im a pushover who he hes been bullying for two years (which is true because I don’t like confrontation) but They cut them in jail for five days which I hundred percent think be needs. And i even went to court and I got all the charges dropped for him. That was last Monday. He messaged me on Thursday saying thank you For not ruining his life him in court and stupid me still loves him and I still miss him and no matter how hard I try I just can’t moveon or picture myself with anyone else. When I do meet somebody I like them for a week or two and then it’s like a switch and my mind goes off and I want nothing to do with them. And my ex says the same thing that he feels these emotions that he’s never felt with anyone else before. 

Well tonight my ex’s parents freaked out on him about talking to me even though he has been done the problem of everything and relationship either even in his past relationships they’ve always broken up with drama and I think I’m going to court because he’s very spitefully. 

I treat him very well and we have the best sex in the world both kids love each other I’ll bend over backwards for him.

So, the man (30) I (27) have been dating for 8 months. We constantly messaging, talk on the phone for a good hour and a half every other day and try to see each other every week (we're both busy with work). He has told me everything about this job, his family history, his struggling relationship with his dad, his view on how religious he is, his ex's and what he did wrong. He also talks about his perception of himself as a man and caregiver and how he really wants to make partner at his job. He has also told me he loves me (albeit it was just him him texting me 'I love you' twice while he was drunk). We haven't had sex yet but make out and touch each other whenever we see each other. We haven't DTR but he has talked about us being parents and has made jokes how we would argue when we're husband and wife.

I've been a little more guarded with my feelings and haven't been as vulnerable to him due to my past ... which is also the reason for this question. At most I've said I like him but haven't expressed that he means a lot to me.

Males of Reddit, help me understand why he's still here when we haven't had sex? I'm having intrusive thoughts that this is a challenge for him and he's going to leave but ... why would he still be here? I'm struggling with the inner conflict that he may just be playing me or stringing me along?

I have always found this part of our relationship very comforting, even when it is something I may not want to hear. Usually the good outweighs the negative.

At the same time it does appear he gets worried sometimes and steps out of his own boundaries that for the most part he holds very dear to himself.

Usually it is not anything too concerning, just the normal stuff of the day we talk through though every now and then it does appear he is reaching for a relationship I am not sure I can give him.

Sometimes he isn't able to share anything though and it could have to do with him being preoccupied. I just wish it were possible for us to reach a common ground on this. How do I let him know there is nothing to be concerned about and I am a person he can rely on?

How it started 
Im 28 she is 25 I met her originally on a dating app a few years ago we had some good dates but I didn't want a relationship and was not in a good place and we didn't pursue it. Then we start talking again over text and Instagram. And we go on dates and a few months later we are in a relationship. 

I have a lot of mental heath issues and depression I battle but she has been supportive and actually cares. I just don't like her pushyness I think I was really hurt from my last break up and I just wanted someone decent to make me forget. And I reconnect with her. And she actually does things and cares about me some times however I feel like she wants me to have my life more together.  She doesn't realize I make more money then her and I have secret incomes. But I don't want her to know cause I'm not sure if she will expect more material stuff. Idk I don't like her super rich friends like they are stuck up and I feel weird. Like they have on 10k in diamonds and not to say I am a bum or look like one I'm modest I make great money but you probably never realize that guy makes significantly above average income. 

I am not sure also if I'm afraid of marriage in general I read so much on horror stories about divorce and its usually initiated by the female. What if I can't provide the money for a life... she sometimes gets carried away with money. She does save it and invest so I'm happy about that she calls me cheep sometimes but I don't like to spend it all. It's just my nature i like to be smart about it.

She really pressed me and kept asking jokingly when am I gonna get a ring? And she asked so many times I finally just bought a ring and she loved it when I proposed. She also has a very racist dad who doesn't like me perhaps cause I'm Hispanic. But I have gotten along more and more and we both likes same sports. 

I guess I have been going back in my head I do love this girl there is a lot I like about this girl more then I dislike I'm just worried about a house a wedding a marriage like it's so much even for someone great.

He’s. Amazing. Sweet, attentive, respectful, funny. All of it. 

While we were dating, I was having so trouble with my mom, so he offered to have me stay with him. We lived together for about 2 months, and then one day everything changed. 

He had be suffering from major anxiety, before we met, so that wasn’t new. But, he had some major anxiety about our relationship… which I didn’t know about. 

The day we broke up, he came into our room, crying. He was having a huge panic attack. I tried to calm him down but nothing helped. After a few minutes of chaos, I realized he was trying to tell me we needed to break up. 

He told me that his anxiety was getting the best of him and that our relationship was a big cause of it. 
He told me he couldn’t handled being in a relationship with me, and that he needed to to work on himself and his mental stability/anxiety. 

We broke up. He moved out. And sought out therapy. I did too.

Now we are still close, just like we were before, and we do EVERYTHING people in relationships do…. But we don’t have the title of BF/GF. And that bothers me.

I ask him all of the time to try and see his side and gain clarity on our status and relationship… but he always says “I’m just not able to be in a relationship…” 

He has never treated me wrong, in fact, he goes above and beyond for me…. And I think that’s what hurts me most. 

He’s someone I would like to be with and commit to. But if feels like he’s not accepting what we are, like I am. It’s causing me a lot of emotional turbulence. And I don’t even know what to do in my dating life, outside of him!I don’t know if I should move on? Or if I should wait for him to level his head, and heart

Flash forward to now, we ended up having to do a group project and we were both in the same group. Obviously that involved having to talk to each other to work on it, and while it wasn't really ""fun"" conversation it made being around her less awkward for me. We did a presentation and let's just say some funny things happened during the presentation and we both end up uncontrollably laughing. Even when we finished and went back to sit down we couldn't stop right away.

&gt;**A little bit of background:** *When COVID hit, I fell into a depression that made me slow down on working, and in July of 2021 I decided to switch jobs temporarily. I was now working in a position I'm overqualified for, that didn't pay as much (and I was aware of it beforehand) but that would make a big positive impact in my mental health. I was not wrong. Getting that transitional job helped me immensely, I even lost weight due to how far I was pushing myself when working. It didn't take much to get a raise, and quickly became one of the most reliable employees the company have. Due to this, my boss (F40) mentioned my name on more than one occasion to her superior (M28).*

In one opportunity, while at work, I picked up a phone call. It was my boss's boss, the *owner* of the company, who needed me to gather some information and send it to him. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was the first time I ever talked to him, and I didn't know anything about him at all, other than his name and position. He was professional, respectful, and we ended up engaging in a 30 min conversation -*discussing work-related things*\- in which he also gave me some advice. He made a reference to the upcoming company's Christmas party, and that he'd be open to continuing the conversation in person.

December came, and with it, the company's ""Christmas Party"". I was really looking forward to it, because I felt like he was level-headed and his advice was useful, so I'd seize the offer on gaining some more insight. Judging only by his voice, I thought he was on his 40s. No wonder I was surprised when he showed up, and he wasn't only *younger (28)*, but also cute. We clicked immediately. I also let him know that I was looking forward to continuing the conversation with him, and he proposed we invite my former boss to the conversation as well. However, I actually wanted to approach some topics related to my boss, and I knew I would need to talk it only with him, so I declined the idea. He was fine with it.

The party went on, there was no alcohol involved, but a lot of yummy food. We had a good time.

After the party was over and everyone went home, we stayed at the building to chat. It was midnight. He asked if I didn't mind if he smoked, and I didn't, so we went outside. It was cold, and even though I had a jacket on, I was lowkey shivering. He gave me his coat, which I accepted. We were talking about work-related things, he even mentioned how I make his life and my boss's life easier, by my dedication to my work. I broke the news to him that I was planning to move out of the city in the upcoming year (2022), so I'd leave my current position. He asked me if I needed references, but I was interested in remaining in the company. To my surprise, he was straightforward in telling me that I should pursue something bigger than what this company has to offer at the moment, even if we're talking about a transfer. He also *knew* I was overqualified. I really appreciated his insight and how he didn't ""try to keep me"", but was genuinely looking forward to see me thriving and going for bigger and greater things.

The conversation eventually shifted to hobbies and studies. I was surprised to learn that he is an avid gamer -same as I- and that he has a degree in the same field I'm pursuing a Master's on. We couldn't help but get nerdy on the topics. At this point, he also gave me his gloves so I wouldn't freeze. We were passionately talking about games, discussed which WoW faction is better, and I even showed off my ranking in a specific game, which was better than his. He teased me because of it, in a flirty way. Overall, the conversation was so enjoyable that I couldn't stop smiling, and we were laughing so much and having so much chemistry that it just felt like there wasn't a power imbalance or a work relationship at all. After 2 hours we went back inside, and prepared to go our ways. I showed my interest in adding his game tag so I could beat him, but he was quick in declining my invitation, explaining that he *""heard about some cases where a boss got involved with an employee and it didn't go well* (legally speaking)*""*. However, he told me to reach out to him if I was stuck in Dark Souls (actually, he prompted me to play it), or had some questions about off topics we approached (stocks, investment and such). Even though my intentions never were to take advantage of the situation and get him in trouble, I understood and we parted ways.

The next day, I sent him a message apologizing and hoped I didn't put him in an uncomfortable position with my invitation. He said that I didn't do so. I was going to let him know if I needed help with the game, but months went on and we didn't really talk again, until yesterday.

We had scheduled a phone call, since I wanted to let him know *when* I'm officially leaving the company, thank him for a couple of things and how his advice actually helped me and pushed me to seek better opportunities. Told him that the talk we had was like a *""slap on the face""* and I needed it. He bursted out laughing. We talked about my performance, my potential, my plans (he congratulated me), and of course, about gaming too. I respectfully told him that *""I do hope our paths cross again in the future, whether it's professionally, personally or virtually"".*

He didn't hesitate to teasingly say *""Now I'll be able to kick your ass in BGs! Since you're not part of the company anymore, you're leading me up to it"".* I laughed (*I'm sure I'll be the one kicking his butt*). We talked about Demon Souls, Dark Souls, BloodBorne and Elden Ring. At this point, I was calling him ""dude"". I also told him he's a masochist because of how he enjoys those hardcore games, to which he explained the reason why, making a reference to something I previously said. The talk was effortless, but we had to continue with our day, so we closed the conversation and I told him that I was going to send him my game tag. He agreed to it before I even was able to say ""next month"". *(I'm gonna wait to leave the company officially, so the ball will be in his court and he can add me if he feels like it).*

\-

So, this is where we are now. After giving it a lot of thought, I realized that he's someone I'd pay attention to, even if we didn't work together. I like his personality so far, I have a *thing* for voices (and really like his), and I can be a nerd and have a debate in which he'd engage properly, with good arguments.

At the same time, I can't help to feel that there's an elephant in the room, and it's the power imbalance that ultimately led us where we are. I'm also aware that he's financially better positioned that I am, but it's not something that I mind, since I'm independent and stable. I don't need *""a man to come rescue me"".* So, even if he wasn't in the position he's in, I'd still be interested in getting to know him.

A friend told me *""do you realize that if his position as a superior allowed him to flirt with you, that means he'd probably done it with other employees too?"",* and that kinda hit me. He's probably right. **Am I being too naïf? Should I look forward to giving this a chance?**

I truly don't mind treating him as an equal. I do have professional respect, but other than that, I'm just being myself. I'm hoping his true colors will show after I leave the company.

\-

**TL;DR:** My boss's boss is my age. He's been guiding me, giving me good advice and pushing me to thrive in life and in my career field, even if that means leaving his company. When I met him in person, we had really good chemistry. We ended up talking about gaming and other nerdy things... and flirting became somewhat inevitable, but we didn't go further due to professional standards.

Now I'm leaving the company, so we talked on the phone about work-related things but the conversation shifted and he's showing interest in *kicking my ass in one of the videogames we talked about.* He was even being a tease. He showed interest in keeping in contact after I leave the company, and I hope that'd make him show his true colors. However, I can't help but feel that there's a power imbalance that led us here in the first place. I'm financially stable and independent, but still, I don't want him to think that I'm interested in him due to his position; because he's someone I'd genuinely pay attention to, even if we weren't work-related. However, a friend thinks he's probably been flirting with another employees due to his ""position of power"" (which I guess it's a posibility, even though I'm none the wiser). My plan is to give him my game tag after I leave the company (he agreed to it), and then go from there. But, I'd like to hear you out guys. Your thoughts, am I being too naïf, or should I give this a chance while treading carefully?

The topic came about on sexual history and she had had multiple partners in the past which I don't care about but when I told her I was a virgin her attitude changed completely. She was telling me that it was a big responsibility and how taking someone's virginity is such a huge thing. She thought it was strange that I was an 18 year old virgin. We still dated for some time and I went over and stayed the night at her house and we cuddled a few times but she was always hung up on the virginity thing. I eventually ended it cause it was making things weird. Since then it has always felt like some kind of handicap and I just want people to treat me like an adult when it comes to that sort of thing.

Could someone here please say things that would make me just care about myself instead of the situation around?

Person A was my crush at work. We hung out a few times, just casually. That was fine. I asked her out, she denied. I gave up and went back to being friends with her. Enter male person B (a lot more good looking than me, alpha male personality, sweet talker, and keeps modifying the things he says in front of different people, even though I'm present all the time). A and B date and marry. Enter person C who is my second crush at work. We hung out a lot, I would say we are not very close as friends, but only at the surface level. She is very introverted, so I was fine with that. She's also super attractive and sweet. I asked her out and she said we can only be friends. I gave up. I thought at least the awkwardness will be gone in interacting with her. All of us know each other and have hung out many times. In fact, I consider B as a good friend of mine in a professional way and I don't want to care about his personal life.

Due to recent events I have a thought that B and C might be trying to hook up. I am not yet sure though as I dont really know whats happening. I feel I'm in such a mess due to 3 reasons : I am super jealous of B, concerned for my first crush (A), and C is really grossing me out. I feel C tries to use me to get to A and B.

I really don't want to be a part of all this but the way things are happening, they keep bringing me back into a situation where 4 of us are together. B invites me to hangout with them (A+B) and then C appears. C tries to get close friends to me and suggests about inviting A+B, or being with them.

Example: matched with a female.  She alluded to us meeting each other.  I asked if we could FaceTime just so that I could know that she is real (fyi: her profile seems legit, is not obviously fake, but I really cannot be certain).  She said the speaker on her phone is broken (**super sketch in my opinion**).  She suggested we just meet briefly for coffee to see whether we are a good match.   She is the only person I've been forward with about verifying their identity.  Like I said, I just started using dating apps.  Her profile is sketchier when compared to some other people I've matched with these last few days.

Idk what to think.  Like what if she is deaf (i.e., doesn't want to FaceTime), which actually is not an issue but I have no way of knowing?  Or super insecure/thinks that I am just trying to see if she is good looking enough?

**Either way, just curious what all of you do before meeting someone in person?  Do you somehow verify they are not some catfish/psycho/murderer, or do you just go for it and see what happens?**

I am a guy. Have always been talking, seeing, dating one girl at a time.
As a result I only had three realtions, from which only one, in which I saw what love is, but she left me.

Most friends, always tell me, I should be dating multiple girls at once, till I find the one that is worth it. Do not understand me wrong. I do not want to be in multiple relations at once.

Which brings me to my next question.
When is it a relation?
Let's say I am seeing two girls and start going on a date. Honestly, from past experience, where I am from, if I don't go for a kiss from the first, second, date, the girls will lose interest (one asked me why I did not go for it from the first date).

I never thought I would actually see him in person as I am a little shy.

It went really well, he paid for everything and even got me flowers. We hung out from 7pm to 6am lol but we did not have sex. 

After that he made it clear he wanted to see me again but a week later he left me on open on Snapchat. We never really have conversations, just a streak basically. He just randomly leaves me on open sometimes but he’s never done that before we hung out. I might be looking too into this but it’s something weird that I have noticed. 

He’s never asked to go on a date again and did not seem too interested when I asked. But he did ask me to hang out at his house and we hooked up. It wasn’t like other hook ups I’ve had, it was very like passionate? We cuddled and held hands. A week later, we hooked up again and it was once again very sweet and cute lol. We even embraced before I went home. I’m starting to develop a crush on him but I’m not sure how he feels about me like that. We barely speak unless it’s in person.

We met while I was going through some mental health issues and he helped me through it. We moved in together about a year into the relationship and currently have 2 dogs and 2 cats together. He is my first boyfriend and he is sweet, kind, caring, and we have a lot of common interests. He’s never treated me bad and has helped me through a lot of my trauma. But here’s a list of things that have started bothering me more and more and I’m not sure what to do. 

1. He’s pretty conservative and I’m liberal. We don’t differ our opinions on most things but there are a few strong hitting points that we just can’t seem to work through. For a few examples, I’m vaccinated and he won’t even consider it cause he thinks it’s a violation of his rights. I’m a huge advocate for the LGBT+ community and he could care less/doesn’t see the importance. He stands in the middle with most of these things but I’m full on supportive of the Liberal side of the issues and it bugs me that he doesn’t feel the same.

2. Our sex preferences are completely different. He does a fantastic job of getting me off but he is the most vanilla person I’ve been with and I’m more of a kinky person. He won’t even try anything more than vanilla sex. There’s nothing wrong with not being kinky but it bothers me that he won’t even try. 

3. He’s more of an introvert and I’m more of an extrovert. We both tend to be introverted in public but I’ll do most of the talking. The thing that bugs me about this is that he won’t even be outgoing at home. My whole life has been filled with spontaneous dancing and singing and he won’t participate in any of it. He doesn’t want me to stop but he doesn’t participate or encourage me at all. He also doesn’t tell me that I look good or hype me up much unless I say something. 

4. He’s currently in school and I’m taking a break. I eventually would like to go back, I just don’t know when. But for the meantime, I am working a full time job. He works part time while being a full time student. I pay for EVERYTHING. I pay both of our portions of rent, I pay for groceries, and I buy dinner every time we go out. He will occasionally have a little extra money and he will buy me cute baskets of my favorite things or get me somethings he knows I like. But our main finances, I pay for. I don’t mind it as I want to help him get through school but it isn’t easy.

He really is an amazing guy and I love him to pieces. He will make a great father someday and is an amazing partner at not giving up when things get tough. I know that he loves me and we’ve had a lot of long talks discussing these things but we’re both pretty stubborn and set in our ways. The only issues I have are listed above but it’s starting to dwell on me more and more. I keep thinking that I’ll move passed it but I just don’t know if it’s working anymore. I don’t know that I want him out of my life but he’s made it clear that if we break up, he doesn’t want to be a part of mine. Our animals love him and I don’t know if I could separate them from each other either. The majority of his living expenses rely on me and I don’t know if he could afford something without me but he would not want to live with me if we weren’t dating.
