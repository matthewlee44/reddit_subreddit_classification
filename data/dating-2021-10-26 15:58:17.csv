Last night I sent him, a ""you suck "" message as a joke. He replied  and we message each other for 30 mins but I couldn't tell if he just replied because he feels sorry for me or if he is still interested. Have   I stuffed this up?

9,qggycd,1635284373,I never feel good enough,"Hey,

So most of you probably read my last post. I am just so sick of crying, this time for a different reason! So ill put it out there I'm jealous and insecure and I clearly have trust issues it's obvious, I know that and I can admit that. But I'm sick of being screamed at for feeling jealous and insecureüòí. My partners wanting to go to the gym and I made a joke although it wasn't a joke deep down, I said ""oh loads of women at the gym for you to look at"" I could see him getting pissed off so I told him I was joking, I told him I was fine with him going which I am, but he was talking about wanting to go when it's quiet and all I said was ""that gym is always busy"" well he screamed at me and told me that I need to shut the fuck up about it. 

And I cry because I hate being shouted atüòí. Secretly tho, I never let him see me cry. Anyway my point is, shouldn't he be making me feel more secure instead of getting defensive?

I'm not saying he's a bad guy he just has a horrible side to him sometimes, and I'm no angel either i have alot of faults and an ugly side.

I know mentally there's something wrong with me, I've been through so much in life and not sure whether that's had an affect on me, I'm trying to be better and for a while there the jealousy went away, I couldn't care. But it's came back with a vengeance and I can't seem to control it. 

I just want him to show me he cares and to make me feel secure in our relationship,  and I don't. We don't do anything together anymore and he keeps making fake promises like ""we will have a date night once a month"". That was months ago he said that and we've never had one! Is there something wrong with me? Am I the problem? Am I expecting too much? 

I feel as though I'm asking for the bare minimum and not even getting that. All the relationships I've had it's me who's put in the effort who's looked after them, but noone ever looks after me. 

I just don't want to cry anymore, I hate it. I just want to be normal and not be jealous or insecure. Honestly it's getting me down so much, I just never feel good enough for anyone.

Please be honest, I don't care. Sometimes it's better to hear the truth.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qggycd/i_never_feel_good_enough/
10,qgh161,1635284601,I think I‚Äôm in love with this guy‚Ä¶ help lol,"What should I do?


So this is a long story, sorry in advance. I (23F) just moved alone to a new country a month ago and 3 days after I moved I met a guy (27M) in a park,we hanging out with mutual friends. Everything was good, a lot of them went back to our dorm and we had a plan with one friend to make dinner together, but we stayed more, went for a beer, went back to the door with a lime scooter etc. 

We really liked each other and some people noticed that when we went back to our dorm and after that we made an agreement to make dinner in 2 days with one couple from here. Since that dinner I started hanging out with that guy (the first time that we hooked up was a day after that dinner) all the time, we‚Äôre going out to clubs, going for walks during the day and night, seeing each other almost every day, we‚Äôre watching movies, he‚Äôs planning dates like walk around the castle, walk around the park, going on a light festival, he‚Äôs also opening up about his family etc and also went on a date with him to one of his restaurants where he always went with his dad or grandma. He‚Äôs always hugging me (even hugging me all the time while were sitting in the metro lol),kissing me and smiling when he‚Äôs around me( he‚Äôs doing all of this everywhere, doesn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôre alone or not). 


Also for example, yesterday we had a deal to go for a breakfast, but instead i went to his apartment (he moved out from our dorm and lives with one of his best friends), he made breakfast, we just hung out for a bit and then went to IKEA. He was hugging me ther as well, it was really nice and after a couple of hours we had to split because he already postponed a business meeting because of me and ikea lol (he has a small staryup with his friends) in the evening he came to my place after he was done with soccer and everything was nice. 


However, the problem is that 2 days after the first kiss, we were drunk and he told me something like I really like it that everything is so relaxed with you and idk why but I was like yeah,  it‚Äôs to early for a relationship, we can do whatever we want, if we want to hold each others hands we can do that but its early for a relationship and he was like yeah I‚Äôm fine with that. But after that we went on those dates, he‚Äôs opening up more and more, hanging out with me all the time etc. But he is also traveling back home tomorrow and he‚Äôs coming back in 6 days. 


What should I do? Does he like me? I really like him and I didn‚Äôt feel like this for years and I would love to be in a realtionship with him but not sure if he wants it and what should I do/say? Please help, I literally can‚Äôt sleep.

13,qghczb,1635285584,What do women expect on first dates?,"I (23m) am in my last year of college. I've haven't been in a relationship since HS, which only lasted 3 months. I just don't have a lot dating experience, but I've finally been getting dates these past 2 years through tinder and cold approaches. 

Usually the dates I get from tinder go better just because we talk more before the first date. When it comes to cold approaches, I get more nervous and the dates I get from them feel different in the sense that it feels like meeting up with a stranger (which I guess I am). But what feels more different is that I don't know what they expect from the date.

When I get a date from tinder, hugging, cuddling, and even some cheek kisses are bound to happen and usually do happen. It just feels that, because we matched on tinder, we already have some physical attraction and we feel more comfortable in the date for some reason. I've just noticed this from the dates I've had from tinder.

When I get a date from just asking a cute girl at the coffee shop or whatever, I feel 100x more nervous and literally don't know what to expect for the first date, and I especially don't know what *they* expect. Is hugging (hello, goodbye) okay? is a kiss on the cheek okay? should I flirt? I know how to hold a good conversation, but when it comes to anything more than that, I'm not sure what to do.

I have a date tomorrow afternoon with a girl I literally approached yesterday. As always I'm really nervous, and don't know what she's expecting. I'm probably overthinking it... She did seem interested, when I asked for her number and told her it's fine if she didn't want to give it out, she insisted and she seemed really excited about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qghczb/what_do_women_expect_on_first_dates/

However, I feel like I am stopping myself from liking her. Everytime I start to fall for her or feel that warm fuzzy feeling about her I shake myself out of it. I am very aware that we have not been talking for long and it is very possible that we never move beyond friends. Like all people, I'm sure, I've had my fair share of crushes that didn't go anywhere and have repeatedly dissapointed myself by giving into fantasies that never came close to being materialised. I feel like I am constantly undermining happy and positive feelings towards her to protect myself.

I have also grown somewhat pessimistic about emotions and feelings over the last 1-2 years. Ever since my breakup (1-2) years ago I have not felt that kind of unconditional happiness that comes about when one is wholly satisfied with themselves and the life they have. Indeed, I have begun to harbor an attitude of disbelief that anyone will love me or be attracted to me. I worry that I have embedded this attitude to the point where any real prospect of romantic fulfilment is being automatically disregarded by my mind.

I am a bit nervous and would like some tips.

I went on a first date with a guy this past weekend, and it went really well.  I am seeing him again this weekend.  

He is really my type and I am quite attracted to him.  We connected really well upon meeting and he's upfront about what he wants.  He is however extremely busy as he's in school pursuing a demanding career (law).  Having an idea what work/life balance is like for lawyers, I am very hesitant about pursuing a relationship with him and think it might be best to nip this in the bud if nothing changes after our second date.  He doesn't talk to me much since he's preoccupied with studying (completely warranted, I respect his dedication to school and don't expect him to neglect studying to talk to me, I just didn't realize how busy he actually is upon first meeting).  While we have a great connection, I've learned my lesson from my past relationships and I know I need to avoid people that I feel like I am ""chasing"".  I definitely feel like I am chasing him.

I've never had to do this before... how should I word things if I decided to stop seeing him?  I don't want to just say ""I don't feel a connection"" because there obviously is a connection, there is just an incompatibility due to lifestyles/career choices.

35,qgj7q0,1635291126,22(f) with zero dating or intimate experience. Terrified I will be single forever.,"Basically what the title says, I'm 22 and hopelessly single. There have been many times where I came close to having a significant other but for one reason or another was never able to pull it off. I haven't had my first kiss or any other romantic experience, which is doing wonders for my self-confidence /s. When people find out about how inexperienced I am, they act all surprised which makes me feel like I am a weirdo. For that reason, I avoid conversations about dating or merely the question ""are you dating anyone?"" like the plague.   

I recently started graduate school and have been trying to meet new people but meeting people and socializing has always been hard for me. I can be quite shy and reserved when I am uncomfortable which I am trying to fix but old habits die hard. Somedays I feel accomplished if I talk to just one person and even if I only say hi. I think my complete lack of social skills is my biggest problem when it comes to finding a SO as I don't talk to enough people or get out of the house enough. When I try to go to events by myself I get extremely uncomfortable which exacerbates my social ineptness. I often find myself wanting to say something...anything...but my mind goes blank. It's weird because if someone starts a conversation with me, I can hold an interesting conversation perfectly fine. I think I struggle with knowing how to approach people, like when it is socially acceptable or not. Plus, its hard for me to read whether someone would be receptive to having a casual conversation when they're wearing a mask. Everyone just looks kind of angry and unfriendly when you can only see half their face. 

I don't think my appearance has anything to do with it. I think I am pretty and I always try to dress nice. I recently lost a lot of weight so my self-esteem is getting better but still shaky. I do catch a lot of guys checking me out or at least looking at me but don't really know what to do about it. I guess I just want to know what I can do to change my dating prospects or any other advice you guys can give me.

42,qgjkut,1635292281,My bf has an addiction and it‚Äôs making me insecure,"
I‚Äôve (f22) have been dating my bf (m22) for a year and 6 months and it‚Äôs been great for the most part. He‚Äôs made his stupid mistakes here and there but one major problem I have with him is his issue with being honest. He‚Äôs never cheated or anything, but he lies for the dumbest things and I‚Äôve always caught him for it. It makes me question him sometimes. (I‚Äôll explain why I brought up the lying). 

Now, he‚Äôs always had a HIGH sex drive, it is even higher than mine. I could be laying down next him and he‚Äôd be ready to go. Like an energizer bunny. He was like this pretty much the whole time we were together. However it all changed suddenly. He never wants to be intimate and when we try to, he loses his erection and it‚Äôs just kinda awkward afterwards. This has been going on for 5 months now. We only have sex like maybe once a month now?  I will admit that I‚Äôve gained weight. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11 and I used to weigh 108 and now I weight 120. However my body is changing and I can‚Äôt be the same weight I was when I was a teenager. But I‚Äôll admit I haven‚Äôt been taking care of myself because I‚Äôve been battling depression/anxiety and dealing with stressful changes in my life. I‚Äôm definitely working on it by eating better and going to the gym. But I can‚Äôt help but think he‚Äôs not attracted to me anymore. He loves petite women and I don‚Äôt fit that description anymore so maybe he just doesn‚Äôt wanna be intimate because he finds me ‚Äúfat‚Äù. I‚Äôve struggled with body image my whole life so maybe I‚Äôm just being hard on myself. He tells me he‚Äôs still attracted to me and finds me sexy and beautiful, but it‚Äôs hard to buy it. 

For the past 5 months I‚Äôve been constantly asking him why this has been happening and if he‚Äôs been seeing someone else behind my back. Maybe he‚Äôs cheating and feels guilty about it? I asked him if it‚Äôs just me and to be honest but he says he‚Äôs just been tired and it‚Äôs normal for guys to go through this. However every time we have sex it always happens. This isn‚Äôt normal and he knows it. It‚Äôs made me so insecure and I feel horrible about myself. Am I too fat? Is he interested in someone else? Is he just tired of me? I had all these assumptions in my head and I recently snapped and told him I wasn‚Äôt buying anything and that he needs to be honest with me or else we‚Äôll take a break from each other to figure or what‚Äôs going on. He finally confesses to me that he has a porn addiction and it‚Äôs been getting out of hand.. I asked him how long has this been a thing and he said 2 years?? I‚Äôm in complete shock and I‚Äôm not familiar with things like this so I don‚Äôt even know how to go about it. I‚Äôm upset. I‚Äôm upset that he‚Äôs hid this from me and lied to me multiple times and made me question myself. He saw how much this affected me and he still couldn‚Äôt tell me the truth? If he could lie about this, what wouldn‚Äôt he lie about? I‚Äôm super understanding and transparent and he knows this so I don‚Äôt understand why he couldn‚Äôt confide in me. I love honesty and he couldn‚Äôt do that for me. I asked him if there‚Äôs anything I could do to help him and he said to never bring it up and that he wants to figure it out on his own. I respect his decision but I can‚Äôt help but worry. He also mentioned that he jacks off constantly which is why he has no desire to have sex. So what should I do guys?

I have a 15 year old daughter that I had when I was 16(When I thought I was straight) and she is like a daughter to my friend.

  As of right now I‚Äôm getting a divorce from my husband(24M)who I‚Äôve been married to for 2 years. My friend has been nothing but amazing since I told him I was getting divorced about 6 months ago. He has always had my back since we were little kids. 

My friends husband passed away 1 years ago from a heart attack (he was much older than us) and I have let him stay with me and my daughter since he didn‚Äôt like sleeping in his house alone since  his husband passed. He‚Äôs one of those people who don‚Äôt like to show their emotions, so he didn‚Äôt really have a reaction when his husband died, he didn‚Äôt even go to his funeral because he didn‚Äôt want all the attention (he‚Äôs very shy). I went to the funeral and said something in his honor since he couldn‚Äôt be there. 

But fast forward to about a month ago, he comes over to my house one night because that‚Äôs what he usually does when he‚Äôs bored (btw he doesn‚Äôt live at my house anymore, he eventually moved back home to his). Me and him were sitting on the deck just talking and we were completely sober and we eventually hooked up for the first time ever. In the morning I practically shoved him out of my house because my daughter was going to wake up for school soon and she would freak out if she saw him.

 I didn‚Äôt want this relationship to go any further so I completely ignored him for like a month but then my daughter invited him to watch her basketball game like she usually does but she didn‚Äôt tell me she was doing that. He came to the basketball game and convinced me to have dinner and talk with him and after a few drinks, one thing led to another and you know what happened. After a couple of days I realized I might have romantic feelings for him and we had dinner one night and he said he felt the same way. 

Idk if I should pursue this relationship with him in worry that it may ruin our friendship and lose the most important person to me in this whole world (excluding my daughter). What should I do?

Side notes: 

Along with my daughter, he is really the only family that I have because I‚Äôm not close with my family because they don‚Äôt like the fact that I‚Äôm gay. He‚Äôs also not like a brother to me at all, he‚Äôs more like a gay best friend even though I‚Äôm gay as well (I‚Äôm not sure if that made sense). But I‚Äôm just wondering what I should do? Do I take our relationship further and hope for the best? Do I wait till I get officially divorced before starting a relationship with him, but who knows when that will be? Or do I end whatever this thing we have going on right now?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share with you some experiences I have had recently, that are killing my self-esteem and leaving me heartbroken.

I have been replaced by two males in less than 6 months, or at least, that's where things are heading.

Three months ago, after a very intense and emotional relationship with my ex, she decided to break up with me for very valid and logical reasons (we were too far, and something that she did in 2020 was too traumatic and made me a toxic person) and lied to me, at first, on whether she was dating someone or not, until I asked her. I tried to do my best, but after our history, she decided to remain with him. It was rough, but it was the best decision for her and me. I am not gonna lie, I was hurt, but with time, and after meeting another amazing person, things started to get better and better.

This person I met is the next protagonist of my story. She had cut off after a toxic relationship with her (now former) boyfriend in June. We met on the internet, and we instantly got connected as it was ridiculous the number of things we shared in common and how we complemented each other; music, art, history, ways of seeing life, love, languages, etc, etc, it was like finding one in a million for all of this. 

We met face to face, after me traveling 4 hours to see her, we spent about 26 hours together and then another 6, then I returned home. Our date was amazing, as we literally shared an entire day and night together. Distance is not a problem that cannot be sorted out as I am going to live in her city in some months due that I am going to college there, and she can always come here for free. Everything was going perfect, we loved each other, we liked each other, we really were one for the other. However, two days ago, a boy she has been liking since she was 14 (shes 20 now like me) french kissed her out of the blue, I am not gonna get into details but that is what happened. This action made her re-think everything about our relationship and her relationship with him, as she is now confused and doesn't know what to feel for him (tho she knows she loves me). I am afraid that she will choose her old crush that she could never have over me...

The thing is, this has more to do with how we see ourselves. For me, when someone wanted me, I felt desirable and when someone wasnt interested in me, I would automatically think something was wrong with me.

But  I have learned that relationships are about having a good fit and it doesn't have to do with your identity. If someone isn't interested in you, it doesn't mean you're unworthy or that there's something wrong with you. It just wasn't a good fit.

Shifting to this mindset has freed me of holding onto people from my past and blaming myself for why them not liking me.

70,qgma9c,1635301185,Dating an immigrant.,"Hello reddit!  I'm in need of advice in what feels to me like a very heavy situation.  Hit me with your honesty but please be respectful.  Thanks!

About 90 days ago I matched an immigrant girl from Central America that's illegally within the US.  Long legal side of the story short she was interviewed and released for 1 year and is in removal preceedings. She needs a lawyer to file her asylum.  

We've been dating for over a month.  If I pay for her attorney it will cost me a substantial amount of money, but she will likely gain another 2-5 years within the US.  I'm a financially secure individual so I'm not going broke on this by any means...but I'm questioning if it's worth the risk.  The fact is people get used for their money, and everything that has happened in our relationship could very well be a lie out of desperation. There's also the chance she's telling the truth about her feelings for me. I made it clear from the start that I don't want her to feel compromised because of my help, and I'm giving free (yes I told her I would pay for a lawyer,  and she agreed to accept my help). There's also nothing preventing me from backing out at any moment to protect myself and my family from a fraud.  

I've been in a decent amount of relationships and I'm pretty good at reading body language during interactions.  If she's faking her feelings she deserves an award for acting skills.

I would like to share with you some experiences I have had recently, that are killing my self-esteem and leaving me heartbroken.

I have been replaced by two males in less than 6 months, or at least, that's where things are heading.

Three months ago, after a very intense and emotional relationship with my ex, she decided to break up with me for very valid and logical reasons (we were too far, and something that she did in 2020 was too traumatic and made me a toxic person) and lied to me, at first, on whether she was dating someone or not, until I asked her. I tried to do my best, but after our history, she decided to remain with him. It was rough, but it was the best decision for her and me. I am not gonna lie, I was hurt, but with time, and after meeting another amazing person, things started to get better and better.

This person I met is the next protagonist of my story. She had cut off after a toxic relationship with her (now former) boyfriend in June. We met on the internet, and we instantly got connected as it was ridiculous the number of things we shared in common and how we complemented each other; music, art, history, ways of seeing life, love, languages, etc, etc, it was like finding one in a million for all of this.

We met face to face, after me traveling 4 hours to see her, we spent about 26 hours together and then another 6, then I returned home. Our date was amazing, as we literally shared an entire day and night together. Distance is not a problem that cannot be sorted out as I am going to live in her city in some months due that I am going to college there, and she can always come here for free. Everything was going perfect, we loved each other, we liked each other, we really were one for the other. However, two days ago, a boy she has been liking since she was 14 (she's 20 now like me) french kissed her out of the blue, I am not gonna get into details but that is what happened. This action made her re-think everything about our relationship and her relationship with him, as she is now confused and doesn't know what to feel for him (tho she knows she loves me). I am afraid that she will choose her old crush that she could never have over me...

So, for some context, when I started dating my first girlfriend about four years ago, when I realised I was falling out of love with her, I didn‚Äôt feel too bad, because I was young, and I told myself that she just wasn‚Äôt right (which she wasn‚Äôt), and that I was falling out of love with her, which was true. 

In recent years, I have had two far more volatile relationships with 2 other women whom I loved very much, but those relationships never really blossomed into ‚Äòfull‚Äô relationships. 
What I mean is that they were so volatile and unfulfilled that they always remained in the dating stages and never became settled/committed relationships. I was obsessed with both of them and utterly in love.
Both of these caused soooo much heartache and left me longing for something simple, easy and committed. 

I‚Äôve been dating my current girlfriend now for about six months and she‚Äôs absolutely incredible. She‚Äôs everything I ever wished for. Attentive, committed, stable and loving. She‚Äôs been so good for me, and my mental health has been thriving. 
However now I‚Äôve started to get this niggling and sinking feeling of impending boredom. Like the fact that we‚Äôve settled into a routine and stability/ mundanity. 

I remember about a year ago, a friend of mine said that she thought I was inherently attracted to unavailable women. And that that was natural because availability becomes boring. I‚Äôm so worried now that perhaps my friend was right, and can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm feeling ‚Äòbored‚Äô

I'm divorced. I left an abusive marriage. One where my husband cheated, loved to yell at me and denied me any affection.
I've been in therapy for about a year.
I was out in the wild dating here and there. But not really finding anything.
I connected with a man. He just started talking to me at the gym.  (,He is younger than me , by about ten years. He is late twenties. )
Amazing conversation. We finally exchanged numbers after like a month and a half of seeing each other at the gym.
We hung out. Went out on dates. 
We fell into something. I honestly don't know what we are . It's been four months.
I just know it's beautiful and awesome.
We hang out pretty much every day at the gym. 4 times a week on our own ( dates, hanging out etc)...he sleeps over once or twice a week. 
We cuddle. Talk for hours. He makes me laugh. We have an amazing intimate life. 
He showed up when my cat got sick to make sure I was ok and my cat was ok. He stayed for like four hours just cuddling me and watching tv. He brings me ice cream if I had a bad day. I have his favorite snack in stock. When he leaves we walk to his car together...and he always kisses me. 
We were joking around one time and he called himself my boyfriend.  He did mention he isn't talking to anyone else.
He says he's told his friends about me..but I heard him talking to his boss and said the girl I'm hanging out with .. I've told my friends. 
We don't constantly text during the day as he works in the field. But he will randomly text me.  Sometimes it's just a meme..or a random music video...or it's something nice. 
We are constantly laughing and smiling...Im just filled with so much joy and happiness..it's crazy. 
I guess I don't know exactly how to define what we are. I don't talk to other guys. I don't want too. 
I mean I honestly think it's way more than just a friend's with benefits...I mean why would a man spend pretty much every day with someone if they didn't like them? Or think of them as something special?
But it's been awhile since I've been out here...so. maybe I'm just being a romantic right now. 
But I like him a bunch and I guess I just want input.

I always think twice before making any joke, or acting a certain type of way, because I'm scared of hurting him or making him feel uncomfortable. I have a very chaotic personality with a very chaotic type of humor, so I censor myself a lot around him.

Should I just ignore it, and still try things with him? Or is this a sign of incompatibility? I absolutely like him, but I feel worried that maybe this will get more tough in the future.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qgnl7n/hes_very_nice_but_way_too_nice/

87,qgo2zn,1635307482,HELP ME!!!!! I cheated? Kinda? Idk,"
so pretty much what happened was me and my ex started talking again like 2 months ago, he told me he wanted to get back together and I just wanted it to be a chill thing (communicated it to him a lot of times). We both knew our intentions so we decided on a middle ground to just go w the flow. 

During this time and now, one of the reasons why I dont want a relationship is due to my DECLINING mental health and my alcoholism. I take meds as well so I have literally just been a full on zombie, not really knowing who I am or what I want and just rolling w it (as u can see why I saw him that way. 

I really love him, I do, but I just couldn‚Äôt.

I got really fucked up one night and ‚Äúcheated‚Äù? on him with one of his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù-they aren‚Äôt friends their in the same friend group but my ex despises him. my mental state, me being fucked up or anything can excuse the decision I made, it‚Äôs my fault and I TRULY regret it. But through me doing this, I feel like ppl don‚Äôt talk ab what cheating on someone acc does to u? Like I feel heartbroken.

And here‚Äôs my whole thing, I feel guilty for anything now. He‚Äôs beyond pissed at me for it (oh yes 100% I told him right away) and he just wants me to get better.

I feel so guilty bc I feel bad that I feel like he doesn‚Äôt even want to think ab how I feel (completely understandable), I feel guilty for ever even feeling happiness again bc I just feel like I don‚Äôt deserve it. I feel guilty even getting better bc why did I drag him through hell and back and then get better after this? Then I get mad at myself for even thinking like this bc it‚Äôs like wow now ur just playing victim ur trying to be the victim with everything-
SOMEONE HELP ME.


I want to bleach my insides and my entire body so any part his friend touched his shit isn‚Äôt on me anymore. I want to go back and time and I wish I wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic mentally fucked up person. What do I do.

92,qgog09,1635308807,Why I‚Äôm deciding to give up on Relationships,"This isn‚Äôt a final decision, but it feels like I should give up on relationships and the reason is quite complex.

I[15M] never had luck with girls. I‚Äôve had a life full of rejection, oh well that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm upset about right now.

All my successes have been with girls who live extremely far, it‚Äôs quite wild. I have been close with some girls I live near‚Ä¶ or at least I thought I was. The first girl (who we‚Äôll call Sarah) I want to talk about was right before the school year started. She told me she was interested and wanted to get to know me more. A few days to a week later, she‚Äôs in a relationship. 

The second time was with this girl (who we‚Äôll call Hannah) and she told me she liked me but had a lot of drama with her ex I knew. She told me this guy bullied her, had his friends bully her, and a whole plethora of wild shit. I found out that was a lie. How? She started flirting with my best friend. I confronted her and she admitted my suspecions were correct.

The third time, was this girl we‚Äôll call Sabrina. We agreed to go to homecoming together, and everything was going well. Then she told me she ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù got asked out and said yes. Then posted this TikTok of her and him kissing on her car. This one hurt the most it still hurts lmao

The final time wasn‚Äôt actually her fault. We have this exchange student[16F] and I saw her during a school play. I thought she was cute so I had my friend tell her about me and everything and she thought I was really cute. BUT, her host family doesn‚Äôt give her a cell phone and we don‚Äôt see each other often enough at school to build a connection off that alone. I was gonna try to get around that and see her but then I found out (today) that she was apparently thrown into some conflict with her sisters and is moving back to Serbia. What a wild ass situation.

I‚Äôm always put in the shittiest situations revolving relationships and I‚Äôm ready to give up. I don‚Äôt know to fix this shit, it almost feels like the world conspires against me getting a girl, the president of the US himself orders the secret service to keep girls from being interested lmao.

Now that part about the world and the president is very obviously a joke, but that‚Äôs how it feels when love is constantly out of reach. I think I should give up, what do y‚Äôall think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qgog09/why_im_deciding_to_give_up_on_relationships/
93,qgog40,1635308820,Why does it seem that monogamy is a relic now?,"That's what I get from Social Media and internet now. The biggest reason why I stick with monogamy is risk aversion. For the most of time I meticulously calculate risks in everything. And I came to the conclusion that monogamy is the safe bet. 

Seems like vast majority of home sapiens are not keen of risk aversion. At least that's what I get from how things are going. Ironically I learned the importance of risk aversion from military. I was just in the Services career field in the Air Force but I learned the value of safety and maintenance.

95,qgovi7,1635310458,I suddenly got past my obsession over my fwb?,"Long story short, met this guy online and we started hooking up right away. I purposefully distanced myself from him so no emotions would be involved since we are just fuck buddies. I found myself getting attached to him after I haven‚Äôt seen or heard from him in awhile, I missed him. 

I started becoming obsessive and was dying to see him again. We finally meet up but we don‚Äôt hook up this time, we just talk. 

We talked about his depression and how fucked up he is from his last relationship that ended not that long ago. 

It‚Äôs weird because I feel like I should have been sad or hurt that he‚Äôs still hung up on his ex while seeing me, but I didn‚Äôt. That obsession I had over him went away and I felt at peace. I wasn‚Äôt butthurt or upset in any way. I wonder why that is. Is it because now I know there are no feelings between us and that put my mind to ease? Is it because he saw me as more than a ‚Äúfuck buddy‚Äù by opening up to me about his past and depression? 

I‚Äôm not sure what it is but I don‚Äôt find myself thinking about him as much lately or as eager to meet up with him (don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôll definitely keep seeing him because we have great sexual chemistry). 

I guess now I‚Äôm wondering how I should go about our relationship. I have strong lust towards him but do not have feelings for him. However I am a little scared if we continue to open up to each other and become vulnerable I will end up falling for him emotionally which I cannot handle knowing it‚Äôll be risky to fall in love with a guy you‚Äôre sleeping with that is not over his ex.

Great situation to be in, almost paradoxical considering I‚Äôve been in a dry spell almost my entire life (ex: took me years to get over repeated sexual harassment and trauma to the point where I was able to present myself well and be extroverted again).
