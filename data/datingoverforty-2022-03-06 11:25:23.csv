That's just not the case anymore with OLD. I feel highly stigmatized as a never-married 40 y.o. with no kids, even if in my mind I still feel just as young, and physically I'm in better shape than ever. I'm also considerably better off financially than I was, and career-wise things are great for me (knock on wood). But I'm penalized for being shorter (5'7) and just being older. 

It's very depressing, because I can feel energy levels slowing down slightly, even if my strength/stamina is still very good. I'm currently in a large West coast city, but have been advised I'll need to move to NYC to meet more women who would find me attractive given the West coast is utterly dominated by young, attractive software engineer men. I have a few differentiating factors: I'm a musician/singer-songrwriter, and really enjoy travel and can move to/live in the EU if I want. But at this point, I just feel the numbers aren't in my favor at all to meet a younger woman who would want me, and find myself sinking into depression a bit as a result.

I go to a University gym, so I told him I was flattered but then I asked his age.  10 years younger than me, which I have no issues with.

10,t8e1j3,1646617413,PDA and a physical touch love language,"I need some help to figure out if I have a personal hang up or a relationship incompatibility. 

43M dating 38F for four months. Physically things are great. We spend 4 entire days out of every two weeks together. We‚Äôre always holding hands when walking from the car to stores. I‚Äôm big on physical touch and like to stroke her hair, arms, a graze as I walk by, etc. when we are close and she has commented how much she likes it. It‚Äôs to the point it makes her so comfortable it often puts her to sleep. She also reciprocates touch, not to the degree I give, but more than enough. 

This is all just background to say that while I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily touch her all these same ways in public, touch is something very important to me, she is very responsive to, and has always been a major positive aspect of the relationship. 

We met each other‚Äôs kids for the first time within the last month. Full understanding that with this being the first time any of our kids seeing their parent around a romantic interest since their parents‚Äô divorce, there would be very minimal PDA and keep things as platonic as possible, we‚Äôre both fully on the same page. Fast forward to last weekend when I was to see her kids for the third time where we would meet at a trail for a hike. I mention something like wanting to get a nice long kiss when we part (kids would be strapped in and we could easily stand behind the car where they can‚Äôt see) and I get a comment from her something to the effect that she‚Äôs not good with PDA. I assume this means like around strangers in the parking lot and think nothing of it. 

Now today I come to her house and one of my kids meets her kids for the first time. They are off playing and I also get to meet her mom. I‚Äôm there for 2.5 hours and while she will follow me into a room I‚Äôm in alone to get a hug and a kiss, the only time she ever touches me in front of another person is one quick peck as we are leaving. 

All this to say, I feel like ‚Äúnot good with PDA‚Äù really means she is not comfortable having any PDA to any degree around anyone she knows personally. I could ask her about it, but actions speak louder than words. My concern is that by now she‚Äôs met my kids, I‚Äôve met her kids, they‚Äôve met each other, I‚Äôve met her mom, and I‚Äôve met a dozen of her friends. This is no longer ‚Äúlet‚Äôs take things slow when we‚Äôre around kids/etc.‚Äù, this is just the way she is.

16,t8l153,1646643442,Bending your own rule: Not dating outside of your political party?,"Well, here I am finding myself again wondering if I should stick to my guns or bend my own rules. 

I‚Äôm 40/f dating a 50/m for two weeks. It started as just sex from the first night but now we hang out with his friends, etc. 4-5x each week I stay at his house. We went away for a quick weekend trip to stay with another couple of his friends this weekend. We got along great and my date and I too had a great time together. 

I wouldn‚Äôt call it a kink but I live in the south and I love southern men who are ‚Äúblue collar‚Äù or as we say know how to work with their hands. That being said I‚Äôm kind of an alternative type of person. Fairly tattooed, my friends are a varied group of folks but we‚Äôre all liberal as far as politics go. I‚Äôve always said I would never date a republican; it‚Äôs a deal breaker. Well, enter my new prospective love interest. I‚Äôve been actively trying to date men who are more settled and less wild. I recently kinda dated a 30/m friend but he was just too wild for me in my older years. The 50/m is very settled, self made and successful in his life except for his love life. Never married and no kids but he still wants both. On our little getaway I confirmed my suspicion that he‚Äôs a centrist politically and on some issues he leans right or left. He‚Äôs pro choice but I didn‚Äôt delve further as we were on a trip. I figure I can probe further on neutral ground‚Ä¶ so, does anyone have experience in dating someone whose political party doesn‚Äôt align? I‚Äôm no politician but I fairly keep up in politics and I could be considered a bleeding heart liberal. We‚Äôve both successfully avoided inflammatory conversations when politics were mentioned (it never even got close to inflammatory and I‚Äôve noticed he avoids the topic in a respectful manner) and I‚Äôm wondering if we can keep it that way? He checks almost every box I‚Äôm seeking in a partner aside from political party. I just worry I‚Äôd be cutting my nose off to spite my face if I dumped him for his politics as I‚Äôm no spring chicken. At the same time, I‚Äôm breaking my own rule by continuing to date him. He‚Äôs kind, tender, intelligent, chivalrous, attractive and for some reason he really likes me. Should things continue to move along I would of course have a conversation about this with him and if he too can handle this difference.

Help??

TL;DR: 40/f liberal dating a 50/m centrist with possibly some right leaning beliefs wondering if anyone has any advice based on their personal experience of dating outside their political party? As long as he‚Äôs not hiding some deep dark secret dealbreaker I could see myself with him long term. Yes, I know it‚Äôs early in the ‚Äòship but I‚Äôm too old not to think and talk about this kinda stuff immediately and same for him he says.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t8l153/bending_your_own_rule_not_dating_outside_of_your/

When I was young I had myself had a stray kitten for few months so I know how to handle cats. However today I don't see myself living with cats inside my house. I am really not sure how to react to all this. I am sure if she moves out of town for few days, she would want to leave them in my care.

30,t91l06,1646692643,"I‚Äôm (46M), married and have fallen for a much younger (30F) coworker.","When I met her, I only intended to be a friendly coworker, but our eyes met, and I was stunned.  I‚Äôve been trying to be adult about my feelings, and treat them as though they aren‚Äôt as big as they feel.  Apparently, I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing because I‚Äôm not feeling any better, I think about her way too much, and it‚Äôs been over a month now.  Hopefully someone here understands and can tell me what to do.  

So when this first happened, my wife and I were going through a long rut.  I talked to her and even told her what was going on with the girl at work.  This situation woke us up from the routine of going through the motions of life together.  Things between my wife and I have possibly never been better now.  So this is a great thing, however, when I see the girl at work, I still can‚Äôt shake the feelings and it is taking a huge toll on me; my work, and makes me doubt that things will remain positive with my wife.  

So when this started, as I said, I was stunned by this woman.  She seemed to like me too and there were a couple of days where I wasn‚Äôt in control of myself, and I may have lead her on a bit.  This reached a point on the day after we met, where I was at her cubicle at the end of the day when noone else was around and I started some small talk with her, and when I felt it might be time to make a move, I woke up and realized what I was doing, and I somewhat abruptly left the situation.  So abruptly, that it was a little weird.  Since then, it‚Äôs been all work talk, and I‚Äôve been trying to leave it that way.  So, no big deal, right?  There was just a little bit of innocent flirting, and I stopped.  This would be fine, but I see her every day at work and my thoughts about her continue to get away from me.  This happens over and over.  

So you know, I would have had no problem with this before I was married.  I would have asked her on a date pretty quickly and it would be settled one way or the other.  -Thing is, I don‚Äôt know if she even feels remotely the way I feel or not.  -AND if I ask her, and she does feel similarly, I know I will not be able to prevent it from becoming a romantic relationship.  I‚Äôm certain that if it comes to that, I will have no choice.  I mean, if I‚Äôm having a hard time seeing her now, how will I feel if I know she wants to be with me? So that is my reasoning for not talking to her and finding out.  I thought time would make this better, but it is not.  Conversely, however, if she doesn‚Äôt feel about me the same as I feel about her, it would be great.  Then I could go on with my life.  

I know it might seem strange that I would have such powerful feelings about this.  I don‚Äôt even know this girl hardly at all.  I suspect my past is a part of it.  I have old regrets about women in my past, and I think that possibly, this has something to do with redeeming myself and feeling better about those regrets.  That‚Äôs all I can think of anyway.  Of course, in my heart, I keep thinking there must be something special about her.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t91l06/im_46m_married_and_have_fallen_for_a_much_younger/

I am a male of 46 years old now. I just realized that throughout my dating experience has yielded  nothing but heartache, pain and financial ruin. I have only my obliterated heart to show for.  I had to endure the cruelty and the emotional dumpster fire of my life. ZERO relationships. Cucked against my will, indulging professional restaurant goers, driving my dates to their dates. I feel so bad I let theses people do these things to me.

I am not taller than 5ft6 on a good day. I do not make 6 figures annually and Objectively the ONLY silver lining of my life is that I have 6 figures in savings as I was always retained good legal council when they tried to take valuable things from me. (Canadian legal craptastik system).

It was explained to me that I am just attractive enough to be the disposable throwaway fluffer because I have a healthy body that can run marathons on a regular basis. As a young man I was deployed to the middle east and I had an unfortunate enough to get disfigured. It was also explained to me that I am too nice, too available, I am a simp,  I'm a beta bitch. I've been Airport Ghosted a few times on flights that I paid for.

The prospect of never finding love is interesting to examine at my advanced age now. I've purged ALL of my socials just now.  And I give up.  And this makes me sad and I feel sorrow in the strict Webster dictionary definition. Every few years I question my sexuality? My gender? my sanity? Can I make through my upcoming golden years loveless? are there support groups for people in my situation?

45,t9yl5j,1646796768,"Getting older, easier to date and connect, but zero depth, passion, or love?","Dating in my 40s is easy, but truly connecting seems impossible. I feel like the older I get dating becomes more and more shallow... nobody cares about character, belief, or values so much as they care about if you are good looking and make good money or have nice things. 

I feel like I will never be in love again, because what I loved about people in the past just doesn't seem to exist in people my own age anymore? I feel like relationships now progress and become more shallow vs becoming more deep. My girlfriends of the past 5 years were more interested in my bank accounts, credit scores, and whether I could support kids while maintaining a bougie lifestyle rather than if I would love those kids. 

My last year of dates don't ever seem interested in anything deep, or having long conversations... just doing fun things and have a good time, then getting down to 'business' of whether or not we can 'get serious' in terms of money...

People seem to stereotype young dating as shallow and older dating as more mature and deep, but my experience has been the opposite. Each year goes by and my dates get easier but they get more shallow... people seem to care about dishware more than they care about what you believe in and who you are. And if you try to ask about deeper things... well goodbye, they don't like you anymore, those conversations are 'depressing'. OK... but that's the kind of stuff that made me fall in love in my 20s and 30s...

I'm a pretty idealistic person. I devoted my life to education, learning, and helping others. My girlfriends in my 20s and early 30s saw that as admirable... now people just seem to think it's weird at best and I feel like I'm just being dated for my looks and charm vs having a real connection based on shared values and dreams like used to? Not sure how I can fall in love with anyone at this age if most of what matters to them is what kind of car I drive in the future?

These years have been great to discover my hobbies, learning a new language, volunteering etc.

The last 3 years I have been having a situationship with a guy, mainly netflix and chill dates. The sex and intimacy are amazing but nothing else. We had the exclusivity talk and he chose to continue non exclusive. I decided to stop seeing him because we are not moving forward and because it is only sex at the end of the day. 

Now it has been a couple of months and I do miss the intimacy and the sex and having someone to share some nights with. I had tinder again but I didn't see myself starting again with the matches, the chatting, etc

I feel bad for not being able to tolerate not being exclusive when I personally do not want this person as a boyfriend, and I could have kept having my regular oxytocin dosage. I miss that our sex together came very natural, we never had to tell each other what we liked etc,

I'm struggling not to reach out again to him but up to know I still see that there is no point in going back because if I am with him, I have my sexual needs covered for example so I am not looking for anybody who maybe can fulfill me more in other ways.

I am also not sure if after so many years I would be able to be in a relationship seeing someone every day or even living with someone else right now gives me the creeps.

To make it short: 

1- If I do not want a relationship, why did I stop it?

2- am I just feeling lonely and I really don't miss him?

Last time I was using apps, I spent a couple months dragging a tripod and shutter remote around in case I found a good opportunity for a profile photo.  It worked out pretty well, I matched with someone and stopped needing to take pics of myself.

The downside is using these pics reminds me of her, and generally feels kinda tasteless.   We dated for long enough that all my photos from before that time aren't 100% true to who I am these days: grayer and rounder.

I could get a professional photographer to take photos, but that's not going to add much breadth to my profile.  I'd get friends to take photos, but most of them are impossible to get out of the house.

I didn‚Äôt really read the terms &amp; conditions of this sub. Who does beyond mods? I‚Äôm guess partial assembly was required and I didn‚Äôt read the fine print. Sorry, that‚Äôs on me.

I posted a screenshot of a text exchange where I expressed being insecure after 1 date to the woman I‚Äôm dating yet after a couple weeks total of actually connecting. She called me on it and said she still wanted to meet for a 2nd date. You guys gave good advice, told me how you would have moved on from me, &amp; that usual Reddit hard love we give one another at times.

Date #2 earlier with her (now yesterday Eastern Standard Time) was SO much fun. We had no idea the place she chose to eat out at had 10 comedians doing back to back 10 minute sets. So funny! Then, we got to talk more after the comedian performances ended. During the show, we both caressed and rubbed one another‚Äôs arms, legs, and back‚Ä¶ reciprocally. We both agreed that there will definitely be a 3rd date! She‚Äôs even talked about wanting to show me around the area in the future. Totally cool vibe that we have together so far.

Long Story Short: we may all have our moments of insecurity while dating, especially early on, but we should always value and welcome communication and instead of living too much in our own heads as I was, just appreciate what actually is‚Ä¶ whether what is are the beautiful and perhaps stressful/anxious moments within the dates themselves or the time between.

Best of luck to you all and hopefully the pic hating mods won‚Äôt delete this post. Thanks for the kind AND harsh words you all gave on the post the mods deleted.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tasqmf/update_i_didnt_know_pics_here_werent_allowed_date/

73,tav6ad,1646905359,Not expecting meet up/first date Intimacy feeling Guilty,"Me [51m] dating [39f] I ended a LTR in April 2021 and move to a small City on the West Coast. My prior relationship was emotionally abusive and I've also had several of these types in the past, so when I'm dating and meeting new females I'm super aware of my red flags and behaviors it needbto be checked

Since I live in a smaller City the dating scene so far has beem pretty grim, it's a college town so most of the single women are too young and very few single women my age. So the last 8 months trying to date and doing meet ups has been bad, to say the least, I actually gave up and took a break for 4 months until recently. Im good-looking for my age and a  little edgy, but respectful and looking for casual first without all the commitment stuff just see where it goes from there

So I meet this girl on Facebook dating and we met for a drink after texting and chatting for 3 to 4 days, which went very well. I don‚Äôt get my hopes up due to the experience I've already had here. We meet up, she's fantastic, she's beautiful no red flags she works full time, no kids, responsible and level headed so I was optimistic and maybe something will finally be positive 

When we were done at the restaurant she asked me if we could talk more in the car since the place was getting loud due to a folk band was playing music and I agreed. As soon as we get settled in her vehicle she blurts out ""Can I give you a blow job?"" and it literally knocked the wind out of me. I looked down and was looking for a response, and all that came out was ""ok""

So, we have been talking ever since and hooked up 2 times at my place and I don't know what the hell Is going on and I feel a little uneasy with the whole thing and when I tell her I'm just looking for casual and a get to know and see and she says that she's cool with that yet I'm getting the sense she wants more right now

So my question, is this a warning sign of bad things to come? I have put her through the PD detector and was done thoroughly, believe me I know when they are. Or am I overreacting and she just likes me and wanted to have sex with me from the jump?

84,tbbjef,1646953186,Playing house? Looking for opinions from women about this type of a relationship.,"A little background. I am 40. I was married for 10 years than got a divorce because of her cheating. Spent a few years going wild and working on me than settled down. In a relationship for 4 years but we broke it off because it just wasn‚Äôt working. Now I‚Äôm looking to date again but being 40 I‚Äôm just not sure if I have the time or energy with two teenagers and working 48 hours a week for a full time relationship. So sort of came up with this. 

Ok. Good stuff starts here. 

I was talking with a few coworkers about what I want out of a relationship and this is what we came up with.

I have free time two nights a week and every other weekend. But with working 3rd shift it‚Äôs harder yet. So what I sort of came up with is an idea of playing house. Basically having someone come over, I‚Äôll cook dinner, we chat, clean up, then relax with a movie or tv and cuddling. If she wants something intimate, yes it would be her decision, she could initiate it say key phrase or whatever. Than cuddle, maybe nap. Than by 9ish pm I have to get ready for work so she‚Äôd leave than.

This would be happening two days a week. Than maybe every other weekend do a full Saturday to Sunday date. Doing whatever. 

Would this be something women would be interested in? Or is it to hard? 

I would be upfront about it. It would not be a dedicated relationship or anything like that. If it didn‚Äôt work than fine. Just looking for opinions before I try to make something like this happen.

Fundamentally we are incompatible. Shes super extroverted, a bit on the wild side, super spontaneous and changes directions in life like the wind. For example once she wanted to be a Stripper for a month just to try it out. She has moved several times since ive known her which is about 3 years now. Shes also a Workaholic. She has been described as ""Sparkly"" by two friends and tends to garner attention wherever we go and im more low key type that blends in.

We clashed over the same 2 or 3 issues in our relationship. After a few months i knew this wouldnt work but she insisted that we could make it work. Basically this consisted of me just accepting things and defaulting to whatever the situation was at least most times. I feel there was more that i didnt know about. For example she would not let me on her FB/Insta because she said it would just make me confused and possibly upset. I insisted that this possibly wouldnt work out and she said it could if i just accepted who she was and she could show me how to adapt to constant changes. One thing she said if she ever got her own place ( or moved in) she would have parties and people over all the time. I remember she said this I would grind my teeth. Part of the dynamic problem is a me problem I understand that and i think thats why i always gravitated towards certain types...

She hasnt really said much mostly small talk. Except one time where i said we never took the 3 puffs of weed together. She said shes afraid because she may go to wild and jump my bones or something to that effect. Although when ""we got back together"" ( ironically around this same time last year) this is how it started...

88,tbe5zn,1646960898,Can I slow him down?,"I‚Äôm 44f and met 36m on Tinder. We chatted for weeks because I had an exam. I first wasn‚Äôt super keen on him, but he messaged again and again. He was never pushy or clingy and after I got through my exam and was less stressed, we kept talking properly and met. He is lovely.

I was very clear that I‚Äôm looking for something a bit substantial than casual sex. We had a great connection and I did sense that he liked me. The age gap doesn‚Äôt bother him. It did bother me, but I got over it as he seems mature. I look younger than my age. 

After the date he walked to my car and we kissed. He was trying to make out a bit, but I wasn‚Äôt up for it, so I diverted his hands and I didn‚Äôt engage in it. He didn‚Äôt push it, I dropped him to his train station. 

I felt very turned off on my way home. I had a mini accident, well, someone threw a bottle at my car while driving. I got very scared. 

He msgd to ask if I got home ok and then wished me good night. This is usually heartwarming and a great sign after a date. 

I never had this before but I just didn‚Äôt respond because I was so torn. I like him but the attempts to make out came too early. I was also very upset about the bottle incident. 

I did msg him in the morning and told him about the bottle. So he thought the bottle was the reason I didn‚Äôt respond to the night time msg (which was out of character from me). 

We did make flexible plans to meet after work today and he did ask if I want to go to his place. I said no. 

I really like him and told him even though we met on Tinder I‚Äôm not ready but happy to meet for a coffee and chat etc. He said ok and then I thought ok, he drops the ball here and now. Lost cause. 

Anyway to my biggest surprise he did msg me at night again, but not in the morning. I said good morning first (it was always him before as he has an early start and I wake up much later) and he immediately responded. 

I guess I just want to know if I could save this from ending so soon but divert it from casual sex so soon to something more substantial? I know we met on Tinder but I heard of successful relationships that started on Tinder. 

I also had issues with wanting a lot of chat and being needy. I want to play this cool. But not too cool, I don‚Äôt want to appear clingy but also don‚Äôt want to come across as cold.

Out of those 15, 2 lived far away, 2 opened with sexual comments, 2 people I had to rule out due to personal red flags, the rest of the convos but one fizzled out pretty quickly, after one or two messages, and those were half-assed and disinterested anyway, too.

One person, yes, one person opened with a long (longer than a couple of words) thoughtful funny message, and we are still chatting, 3 days later (lol) but I am not holding my breath because we matched a couple of months ago, too, and it fizzled out that time very quickly.

We can only meet once a week which suits me. He doesn‚Äôt sleep around because he doesn‚Äôt have the time to juggle more people. I don‚Äôt get shit from him. He is typically not the type of guy I would be in a relationship with ( not connect intellectually) but he is nice and is good company.
