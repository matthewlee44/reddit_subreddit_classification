I recently ended a relationship that started as FWB and I'm certain that I want to stay single. About a month ago I moved to a new town and met some new friends, then ended up in a FWB situation with one of these new friends. 

I told him I'm not ready for a relationship and he said the same, so it sounded like a perfect match, the comfort and pleasure without the commitment I guess, we both agreed to this. But recently things have gotten weird.

The last time I went over he told me I should leave a toothbrush. When I was about to leave I remembered that I left my necklace in his room, it would've taken me a second to run up the stairs to grab it but he told me to pick it up next time, it felt like he wanted me to leave things there. Another time he dressed me up in his clothes so we could meet up with our other friends after hooking up but idk it felt weird taking his things home with me after. 

It's starting to feel a little romantic, he whispers sweet things like ""I'm so happy you're here with me right now"" when we cuddle in bed, and he asks me to sleep on his side of the bed so when I'm not there he can smell my perfume as he sleeps. 

The thing that triggered my overthinking was when we were cuddling and he asked me to take a selfie of us because he wanted to remember this moment.

I know the best way to solve this would be to just ask him, so I did, and he told me he doesn't want a relationship at all, but his actions are saying otherwise (in my opinion anyway).

When we were both 15 I really liked her and I wanted to be in a relationship with her. Since we were only able to see each other once a week I decided to get to know her almost exclusively over text. This was adequate enough for when we were just friends, but after I told her how I felt and we got together it became crippling. We were able to talk for days and days through texting but when it came to face-to-face interactions we both were incapable of talking to each other. This saddened both of us out because we both really wanted it to work, but the only things that our ""relationship"" did for us was make me insecure 24/7 and cause her stress. Unsurprisingly she told me one day that she thinks of me more as a friend than a boyfriend (which was really true because I never acted romantic in person) but since I didn't want her as just a friend, I decided to cut contact altogether.

Thankfully since the pandemic started almost immediately as we broke up, I didn't have to deal with seeing her in person. But when regulations lessened in the fall, I had to deal with being near her on a weekly basis once again. Over the summer I had basically gotten over her, but when I started seeing her in person again the feelings immediately returned. However, because I didn't want to make the same mistake I made last time, I resolved to never text her and only build a relationship with her in person. Sadly this didn't really work because I never had an excuse to hang out with her outside of that once-a-week window and even when I did, it was still very awkward and difficult to talk to her. I made the stupid mistake of asking her out on a date via phone, and she of course declined.

Fast forward to this year. Over the summer once again my feelings had left me, but just like before as school is starting back the feelings have returned. However, over this summer I've undergone a serious period of growth and maturity and I am so much more confident now than I was two years ago. I now understand that in order to build a relationship with her I need to first build a solid, in-person friendship. The thing is... I have no idea how would I accomplish this. As stated before, in-person interactions between the both of us are really weird even to this day, and as said in the last paragraph I have no idea how I would even ask her to hang out without it sounding like I was trying to go on a date.

I'm an artist so that should go even further in showing how empathetic and sensitive I can be

And even as I'm typing this I realize how hard it is as a man to prove this because the more you try to prove it the more you look like you don't have it but I'm going to try anyway

I have had a nice mixture of female friends and because of my artistic background of I was been interested in works of art made by women just as much as men so growing up and trying to understand women wasn't so hard but it does get confusing because there's so many conflicting ideas and narratives about what's proper conduct between men and women

But as a guy who has been told so many times that he's husband material and has had so many girls leave him for the guy they say they hated and abused them,

There is just no correlation between a man and his attitude towards women and their experience and how well he does

And as sad as it is to say I have found that men who act the opposite and do not care about women at all do way better which is our generation's greatest irony since we're supposed to be a generation raised by feminism but it shows in our daily conduct

So many girls love to say this and I don't want to be disrespectful but it just seems like a cop out answer because it's easy to tell this to a guy to win an argument

The idea is that if men somehow were supposed to understand women more than they would do better but as a man who has been just that and who used to be a feminist himself it just does not manifest this way

I went to high school with a girl who was excellent she was a cheerleader and she was preppy and she had straight A's and she was very respectful. She was the type of girl you knew who would make something of herself

There were so many other boys like her in the school but guess who was the boy she chose.

The neighborhood gang banger who ended up killing a guy before graduation.

Why am I only attracted to heavier/plus size women?

This is going to be half a question and half me venting. I get every person has a type but my type very much goes against what is considered conventionally attractive. My whole life I’ve only ever been attracted to thick, chubby, or fat girls. Honestly I’ve tried dating skinny women to see if I could change what I find attractive but it just doesn’t work out (especially in bed) to the point that now I’ve had to reject multiple skinny women that have shown interest in me. Every relationship I’ve had that went well has been with a large women, but it’s always a weird feeling when what your girlfriend is self conscious about is what you find physically attractive like a fat ass, belly or fat arms. My friends have poked fun at me for it and I’ve even heard I have poor taste in women but I don’t really care what they think. I do wonder, if men think this aspect of me is weird what do women think about it? I’m sure women want a man that finds them attractive right? I’m not oppressed like LGBT folk but In a way I relate to gay men/women in that what I find attractive isn’t what the average person does which can feel weird at times. For example many times I’ve been in a scenario where I flirt or confess feelings to a big lady and they find it hard to believe that I’m interested and I have to convince them I am, one time even after a couple months.
I’ve read online that some people consider this a fetish and I disagree. Being attracted to a plus size body isn’t fetishizing them it really is no different than a man saying he isn’t into fat chicks. But idk what do y’all think? Obviously personality matters too and shouldn’t be ignored but attractiveness is an important part of sex and any worth while relationship at least to me, so this shit is important
Ive sort of just had to accept this part of my personality and I think I’m on my way to making peace with it, but I definitely still wonder why am I like this? And is there any way to broaden my idea of what is attractive?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,917285,public,self,Why am I only attracted to heavier/plus size women?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or4f5k/why_am_i_only_attracted_to_heavierplus_size_women/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

It was after 3 a.m when we said goodbye, so…
We stopped near my house, he jumped out of his car, leaned on it, and when i stood in front of him to say thanks for the ice cream he pulled me, murmured something and kissed me so lightly on my lips twice holding me as if i would break, and i got so excited from all the sexual tension that i licked his lips, put my tongue just a little in his mouth and bit him lightly on his lower lip. 
I got so embarrassed and pulled away right away, i felt how surprised he was.

We met through work (virtually, we don't work together directly), have texted a few times but haven't met in person yet. We didn't explicitly call it a date but to me at least this seems like more of a date activity than a friends only activity. Fast forward a week (still about a week before our dinner), she messaged me asking if I wanted to meet up that night at a bar. Context, this had been one of the two days she proposed for our dinner originally but I opted for the other one saying I had family in from out of town for this day. I responded politely saying I don't drink and further clarifying I wasn't free this day but offered to change up the plans if the original one didn't work for her for any reason. She then said she would prefer to meet up in a park or at a patio for COVID reasons. I was happy to oblige as I am pretty uptight about COVID too and we switched it up to meeting up in a park. I know the new plan is fine (and I am still very excited!) but I can't help but let part of this eat at me. It just seems like she already knew I was busy and presented this as an indirect way of changing our forthcoming plans. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me because she proposed meeting at a bar on a day where it was pouring rain and then said we needed to change our plans to be outdoor for COVID reasons. I just feel like there's something happening in the background I'm not fully picking up on. Why couldn't she have just asked directly to maks a change if she was uncomfortable with the original plan? Is she getting cold feet? Am I overthinking this? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR The girl I had a date planned with asked if I would meet her that day on a day she knew I wasn't free.

He still texted me this morning and we briefly talked, but unlike other days where we are keeping convo going all day, he hasn’t texted much for the rest of the day.  I assume it has to do with him being busy with his friends and possibly partying hard.  

My last two messages where one acknowledging something he shared and another answering a question he asked me. I’m wondering if a message tonight saying “I take it you’ve been having a wild time in [insert city name].  Have a goodnight and sleep well” as a triple text would come as clingy or overbearing.  Or if not that, if I can just be the first to text him “good morning” tomorrow morning.

We’ve both never been in relationships before, so I told him that we should meet in real life before deciding if we’re both interested. 

I definitely feel like I’ve gotten to know him online quite well and the in-person date went really well too! Problem is, because of school and stuff I won’t be able to see him again for months. 

Ideally, I think it would’ve been nice to go on more “dates” before saying yes to being exclusive. So, I’m not really sure how to proceed... neither of us are interested in meeting other people right now but I’m not sure about basically starting a relationship after one date, a long distance (ish) relationship at that (despite having talked every day online for over a year).

So why is it that a guy will spend months talking on the phone/online, meet with them in person, have sex once and then call it off? 

This has happened a few times. The reason that they have spoken for months and not met in person is due to Covid/restrictions. When restrictions allowed they would meet with each other. 

They then had sex as it is long awaited and throughout those months of talking it was expected. 

So why then, has the guy called it off the next day?

Is this not a waste of time for them because it certainly is for my friend. My friend is asking me why this keeps happening to them and I can’t seem to work it out either.

The problem is, she said hey I just need to sort some things but let me get back to you for a time on Sunday (she was coming back from out of town) but come Sunday she hasn't mentioned a time at all and when I follow up on Sunday she says she came back late and has another event on in she has to go which was true but I'm kind of pissed she didn't let me know and I had to ask.

I (29M) don't have a lot of success with dating recently, most people seem to talk for a week then disappear so, anyway.  
As brief as I can be:

Match on Tinder with 27F, and we have some meaningful conversation and we seem to get on well. As the days go on, this conversation becomes shorter and shorter, despite my attempts to try to keep it going, asking questions, etc. It pretty much dries up and I can't get much out of her. She explains its due to her parents being around helping her move into new place. Fair enough, I get that, she says she'll let me know when they're gone so she can talk more as her mother is 'judgemental' of her choices.

Next week comes around and it appears her friends have turned up, so she is still busy. Fair enough again, I try to have conversations now and then but get little, or a very broken up conversation with days between replies. At this point I'm trying not to be too pushy, Im suggesting dates, or at least ideas for dates, which she likes the idea of, but I can never get a date in the calendar nailed down with her.

Seems then she deleted her tinder profile, or unmatched me I'm not sure, but she hasn't blocked me on whatsapp so likely the former. She rematches me a week or so later. So despite the lack of conversation I get the impression she is interested, but yet conversation is lacking still. She's busy a lot of the time and I'm thinking ""Do you really have time to date, if you can't keep a conversation going"". She leaves my messages on read a lot of the time, which I find kinda rude but whatever. 

After a while I speak my mind and ask whats going on, from the leaving me on read, whether she is actually interested etc, and where I stand. She rolls off about being busy with her new job, which I appreciate, and how her ex keeps popping up, which I can understand. She says she is interested but isn't in a position to date right now. Fine, thanks for wasting my time I guess but she still talks every now and then, but this week she is either getting her house sorted or her friends are down. She said both in the same message, which is weird, is it one or the other? Call me persistent but I'm still interested, and considering I don't get matches on Tinder for weeks, I'd rather try to make the most of what I get.

By far, he is the most unexpressive and stern type of guy I've ever dated. I was all smitten about him and I really like him, but now I'm starting to think if I should call it quits now because it's going to be crash and burn at the end. 

He is a master's student who also works a quasi full-time job, so his schedule is quite hectic. But he will always find time to meet me and I see him at least once a week. But at the same time, he never lets me get in the way of his personal schedule. 

He works some weekends, and he came over to my place this Friday. And right after having sex (it was around 9), he says he has to leave because he has to get up early tomorrow for work...even after I told him I hate it when guys leave right after sex, 10 minutes later he was gone. I really felt like crap. 

(I know he has very strict personal boundaries. For example, he once told me how he wouldn't mind another lockdown because that way he would be free from social obligations and could focus more on his studies and personal schedule.) 

Also another issue is his inexpressiveness. I am a very expressive person, and I'm not hesitant to let him know how I feel about him, both verbally and physically. He would reciprocate (e.g. saying ""I like you""s back) and he's been getting better, but he never initiates them, which sometimes makes me feel unwanted. I once told him  I sometimes can't figure how he feels towards me, and he goes: ""How can you not know?"" 

One of my friends who met him said that she could just tell he was into me, just from the way he looks at me. But if he never expresses his feelings, how am I supposed to know??? Sometimes I'm not even sure if he likes me or not.

Nice house, financially stable, fit and good looking. Deep down however I feel like a mess. Throughout my life I held a dark secret that's prevented me from being able to connect with anyone and not be able to maintain healthy relationships. I only realised later on into my adulthood that these are the remaining symptoms after extreme child abuse and trauma. 

 I stay away from relationships and became emotionally detached for a reason. I rarely ever find anyone attractive or connect to them but the very few times I do it's always to trainwrecks, emotionally unavailable or just damaged people. I literally don't know what else to do and how to stop being attracted to them and it scares and saddens me because attraction is out of my control. It is almost like I barely feel drawn to normal people. It's not like I am getting any younger and I feel the years are ticking away. I'd love to find a life long companion and partner one day but sincerely don't understand how to get out of this hurdle. 

I have read hundreds to thousands of self help articles and spoke with other people who could relate. I've even wrote some uplifting articles myself which has helped people but it is of no use. Cognitively understanding it doesn't erase this problem and it doesn't fix my internal wiring. I feel like I just carry out motions and I'm really good at being polite and civil with people. However everyone I meet I always feel a barrier and I don't feel anything for them. They all seem like acquaintances like the wind that come and go. If I sense someone is in pain and hold trauma, I feel I subconsciously relate to them and react to that more strongly. It is the only time I actually feel much of anything when most of the time I feel really empty. 

I was just curious if anyone else could relate to this because I don't know anyone in real life who understands this torment. How has child abuse or trauma affected your adult relationships?

Before anybody starts jumping down my throat and telling me what my problems are I have had three girlfriends. Ironically I shouldn't use the number of women I've had to measure anything but everyone seems to think that if you are a guy you complain about this type of thing then you're hopeless.

Not every girl acts like this but it has been a cliche thing since time immemorial that young women seem to date men that are not really in their best interests

All my life I've seen it with my mom and her friends and the women in my group. The girl starts dating someone that we all know is not good for her but since he looks flashy then she goes for that type of guy and there's nothing inherently wrong with that at first glance

But it starts to becoming a problem when girls like this continuously date men like this but then come to the conclusion that all men must be evil or horrible based off of the few that they've dated

It does make men like me a little frustrated especially growing up in the female dominated home and hearing this type of thing all the time.

It does get insulting knowing that as a man that if I were to act more rough and treat a woman more aggressively than I could have had more women in the past and that's not something that is making me proud or eager.

Men of this generation have grown up with conflicting messages on what is proper conduct when being around women. But the irony is every woman is different.

A lot of people both men and women included seem to think that it is disrespectful for a man to approach a woman at a grocery store. Yet I've done it before to get a girlfriend and I've been on the opposite end to wear a woman came to me in my own store.

It's not a matter of respect but pragmatism. And I know a lot of guys like me probably missed out on a lot of chances trying so hard to be respectful and non-threatening because you can best believe that girl is probably seeing you in a different light And losing attraction for you.

I am at way too many women including my own ex tell me that they have never been treated well before and I find it crazy because a man's treating a woman normally should not be seen as something to unique  but it happens

And it also does get a little bit insulting especially if you are of man who was raised in this environment where every woman in the family is telling you one thing but then you go out into the wild and something else is revealed entirely

I'm from the hood. I tried my best to be professional and get out of the hood and so far I have had some great successes but something that has stayed constant is that so many hood girls seem to go after the wrong men. Whether it be because environment or that's what they saw growing up doesn't matter but that is the phenomenon that I grew up with seeing in high school and college and beyond

Of course it's not every girl but it is a sizable portion to wear this phenomenon is visible. Something about criminality is very attractive and a lot of kids who grew up in poverty or in environments like this usually end up going this type of way. 

I was on a date with a girl and me she had a boyfriend but her boyfriend was in jail because they're both gangbangers.

I come from a family of gang affiliated people and it tears me apart knowing that if I went a different path and became a gang banger then I probably would have had much better respect and even romantic opportunities in my own environment right now.

I know this isn't all the time and I know this is not every man and woman but once again and this phenomenon seems so visual but we all get so angry pointing it out because we would rather not make it seem like women are the problem in choosing bad men.

It is a problem from both men and women and yet I find it crazy to so many women seem to ignore this type of thing especially since they are the party that is doing the choosing.

If any bad men ever hurt anybody we should not be blaming men and we shouldn't really even been blaming all women but we should be blaming the small percentage of women who actively choose these type of men over and over again.

I was in an abusive relationship myself and what she says still haunt me and I do understand that that most people don't plan on getting in these types of relationships but as a man who grew up scene both his stepfather and mother abusing each other it tears me apart knowing that if I exceed at the same traits I probably would have been looked at in a better life and that tears me up inside",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,918030,public,self,The nice guy stereotype is just that.

I swear if I went through one more “talking phase” with someone I wouldn’t come out on the other side with my sanity. 

I won’t even begin to discuss the dumpster fire that is online dating. My hobbies aren’t something that women also enjoy, if there are women there they aren’t single. Just approaching a woman I find attractive in public isn’t acceptable anymore and many women have stated they don’t want to be approached, you won’t know if she does or doesn’t until it’s too late so I just don’t do it at all.

A consistent friend with benefits situation would be great as random hookups were never my thing, but I feel like that’s just as difficult as finding someone who wants a relationship. My life has been devoid of any kind of intimacy for two years now. I’m not blaming the pandemic either because it’s not like I was doing well with dating/finding what I wanted before.

The saddest part of all of this is, if dating is this difficult *now* it’s only going to be 100x worse as I get older.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,918059,public,self,I finally understand why so many people aren’t looking for a relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orctfr/i_finally_understand_why_so_many_people_arent/,all_ads,6,,,,,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark
