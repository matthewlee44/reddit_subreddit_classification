But she is like the first person that I've liked in a long long and this is after years of not really getting a vibe from anyone. And it was instant.

We do have common interests, educational and work backgrounds even. But idk how or when I'd go about asking her.

I'm thinking I could get her insta and then we could slowly build from there if it happens.

I could also ask her for her weekend plans today and propose something today but it'd be too soon I fear.

-It has to be a paid service.
-Men should only have a very limited number of swipes a day, since otherwise they just swipe on every girl with the hopes that one swipes back. 
-Women should be free to swipe as much as they want.
- Both should get penalties for not writing back. This will have a stronger effect on women. 
-There should be an option to end a conversation where you have to give a reason instead of getting a penalty. It should have at least 50 characters (I just picked a random number). 
-You should see the description of a person first.
-Profiles have to have a description.
-There should be a limit of matches you can have at any given time. Your profile should disappear for everyone once you matched perhaps just 5 times. 

I hope to reach a state where both women and men only get very few matches, and therefore they have to focus on these few matches a lot. You have to explain to the other person if they are not right for you. 
Other apps should be for hookups, while this app should aim at having a small customer base and its business mode should be to attract new customers through word of mouth. 

When the app opens it should maybe start with the results of a study:

When people have the choice between six chocolates, they find it easy to find their preferred one and they are very happy with their choice afterwards. 
If they have to choose between 20 different chocolates they get choice paralysis and end up unhappier when they finally make a choice. 

The name of the app could be Chocolate choice.

I am writing this due to a big conversation about our relationship that I‚Äôve been wanting to have. It is too much for me to effectively communicate in the heat of the moment so the only way I can effectively organize all my thoughts is to write it all down like this. I love you and I cherish the times we have spent together. That is why I am giving you this so we can try to work for a better tomorrow. Although we have tried to progress on some of our issues together for the past year, it seems like things have actually been going in the opposite direction since we moved in together. It is getting harder to feel like this is an equal partnership and it is a frustration that has been building up inside of me.  Sometimes it leaks out and hurts you, and I am sorry. 

We need to work on how attached you are to me. It seems like you are afraid to be away from me outside of work, and that is not healthy for you or me. I feel smothered like we‚Äôre attached at the hip. Then there‚Äôs the issue where you emotionally lash out at me if I separate from you, which doesn‚Äôt feel great either. I want you to feel comfortable by yourself. I want you to feel comfortable in your own home. 

Another issue is that your level of codependency seems to be growing higher. Maybe we‚Äôre both to blame for that, as I enable you to be that way. I feel like I am your dog to go fetch things as you ask me to do most tasks for you. I do almost everything, including cooking, cleaning, and sometimes part of the one chore you volunteered for. In doing all of this for you, I am feeding into a loop of enabling you to grow more codependent. I am happy to cook for you, but I just don‚Äôt know how to take it when you won‚Äôt eat an entire dish I‚Äôve prepared for you because it‚Äôs missing one thing you like to put on it. It also does not feel good when you expect me to drop everything in the middle of dinner to go get it or you just won‚Äôt eat. You could tell me to just not cook for you, and maybe I should do that, but I am worried you would not take care of yourself. I want you to be cared for and healthy. 

I also feel like I am the only one holding up our date nights. I always have an idea for us to try on my nights, but you are always starting to say you don‚Äôt have a plan for your nights. It makes me feel like only one side is putting in effort. I know you can think of something! Expand your comfort zone and open your imagination, but don‚Äôt forget the idea can be a really simple at-home thing! I understand that it‚Äôs harder for you now that you don‚Äôt have money to spend on date nights. 

This leads me to my next point, which is that another thing I feel is unequal is our handling of the bills. You don‚Äôt have the money to pay your half of the bills anymore. I‚Äôve been trying to help you get your finances in order and will continue to help you, but please understand that you can‚Äôt afford everything you want, and you can‚Äôt afford to take days off or leave early just because you feel like it. I also need you to understand that you can‚Äôt fulfill your spending urges through me either, or that will hurt me as well, which in the end, will hurt us both.

These next couple of paragraphs might get a little harder. We have a bit of a problem with emotional manipulation in our relationship. I try to do my best to be a good partner, but sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm chasing a goal that‚Äôs always moving. Sometimes you get upset, or act angry, or accuse me of something (like cheating), and use that to get me to do what you want because I want to keep you happy, or I‚Äôm afraid of you getting even more upset. It is not fair to me when you do things like get mad at me and say I don‚Äôt care because I didn‚Äôt do one certain thing for you, like buy a matching bracelet with you, as if everything else I did for you that day didn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs as if nothing I ever do for you matters because when you don‚Äôt get what you want, you‚Äôll throw that all away in a loss of control over your anger. Sometimes you put me through tests where you see if I‚Äôll do what you want without you having to tell me, then when I don‚Äôt do the thing you wanted, it must be a sign I don‚Äôt love you. It isn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt love you. It‚Äôs because I want you to get stronger. I must also say that there is a slight physical abuse problem in our relationship, like when you intentionally hit me in the balls. I legitimately flinch at you sometimes, which is not a good thing for us. I never have the intention of hurting you, but there are times that you have the intention of hurting me. That isn‚Äôt right. I just want you to be happy in a healthy way for both of us.

Something harder to talk about is the meltdowns you‚Äôve been having, where you break down and try to break up with me until I calm you down. I think they‚Äôve been happening an average of every 2-3 weeks since we moved in together. I‚Äôm your rock, but these are starting to get hard even for this rock to bear. I feel a little closer to breaking every time a new one comes up. I cried after the last big one because it seemed like we were actually going to go through with it and it made me imagine my life without you. I don‚Äôt know how I can help. You tell me it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt do this or I don‚Äôt do that and it all builds up, so I‚Äôll write down things I can change. Short of doing things that I believe are enabling you, I take steps to change the best I can. That doesn‚Äôt seem to stop the meltdowns though. How do I help? If this relationship is too stressful and it‚Äôs hurting you more than helping you, I understand if you want to end it. I love you and I just want you to be happy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1070664,public,self,"I was writing a letter to my GF as the last ""make it or break it"" of our relationship.

There's many alt-girls, goth girls, alcoholics, and these wanna-be instagram models but ordinary yet good looking girls are uncommon. Throughout my time swiping I found around 3-5 such ""normal"" girls, with one of them I had a relationship for some time but whenever I find them they are always far away (200-300 km / 124-186 miles) , the last one I found was literally half a country away.  
Now this confuses me because I remember just a few years back in my early teens *(here I should note I have the ""honor"" of being a part of Gen Z)*  most girls were ""normal"". There were no alt girls, no goth girls, substance use was waaaaay lower and they even looked similar (style wise). And I don't know if this is just what happens when ppl age or was it sorta a social change around that time that resulted in girls changing so much. There's also now more girls with piercings and tattoos (which tbh look crap in my opinion).  
Also another thing that puzzles me is how when you find one of these ""normal"" girls they try to downplay their normality. They say things like ""my psyche is messed up"" and try to be edgy. Why are they doing it ? Do they feel like they need to seem ""cool"" or ""different"" ?  
Also as a side note, I do guess that a lot of girls who fall under the ""wanna-be instagram model"" category could actually be ""normal"" girls who just do things for instagram but it's not really easy to tell.  


So does anyone have thoughts on this. Honestly I can't tell if what I see is true or whether I'm being delusional and I just never noticed other types of girls because when I was younger my social circle was slimmer. **And if you know how to find such ""normal"" girls please share how.**

Went on ONE date. He invited me back to his place and we kissed and ended up hooking up (I said ‚Äúmaybe we should not do this‚Äù but I guess I kissed him back so cannot blame him. He did not verbally ask if we can have sex, but we were already making out...so he probably expects it. He tried to put his ‚Äúprivate part‚Äù into me (without a fucking condom on). He put it in halfway before I push him away and tell him to stop. Then I asked him to get a condom and he said ‚Äúlet me see if I can find one‚Äù - why would you even try to hookup without a condom WITH A STRANGER.
He put it in, we tried to have sex but I was not in the mood anymore so we went to sleep. Cuddled for a bit and slept together. The thing is when I am half asleep, he rubbed his ‚Äúprivate parts‚Äù on me again and tried to talk nasty to me. I AM NOT HAPPY that he tried it again, maybe he got the wrong idea because I cuddled him...but still, I was half asleep. I did not feel good about it.

In the morning, he cuddled with me, kissed me in the lips and cheek. Hung out with me. Invited me to meet his friends and family. This happened a while ago. He texts me everyday and asked me to be in a relationship with him. He hardly calls but started to call more now I mention I prefer verbal contact. I told him we can continue being together but not in a serious way but he insist that he want us to be exclusive. I also tried to cut him out of my life because everytime I think back to that night, I am annoyed. He always comes back no matter what I do (maybe for the sex but we are long distance until Christmas so not sure if it‚Äôs worth his effort to do all this just to have sex with me again). He also wants to invite me to his company party - he works for another office in another city. The second time we tried to sleep together I told him I am not ready and he said it‚Äôs fine and just hugged me. I just get a player vibe from him because he calls me ‚Äúsexy‚Äù all the time.

I like the guy but he did not leave me a good impression first time. Overall he is respectful and gives me what I want. I push him away a lot because of what happened but he is still there most of the time.

 I turned 50 last December to me 50 is old, very old but I do realize that a lot of people do not think 50 is old.  I was surprised that there are a lot of younger people that are actually into older people it's something that's been on an upward trend for a while..

  Yes I do realize these people have daddy issues or some are into older for financial reasons but I have found a few younger guys that are not in it for the money, as far as whether they have Daddy Issues hey listen I'm not living in their head I can't tell you what's going on there..

 I've decided to throw in the towel for multiple reasons and you would think the biggest reasons would be my health. My health sucks  no way around it, I have a lot of health problems and they're not getting better. 

 My health started fading officially 13 years ago and it's just been downhill since.  For a long while I was actually just unable to date ---constantly being in the hospital getting treatments having surgeries-- dating was impossible.. as I was recovering I started putting myself out there and in the beginning I enjoyed dating.  I had a good time but nothing ever seemed to clicked with anyone.. a lot of the issues that I blame it right on the fact I was getting older I was in my 40s my health was a slow decline always something cropping up problem after problem but I still was determined to try to get out there and meet new people and have fun..

 Now being gay this community stinks you would think he would be a little bit more tolerable and kind if you're over 30 and you're single and you're gay you might as well give up..  I wish I did,  I wish I did a long time ago give up that is.. But no I had to keep trying..

   as the years went on I became more toxic, jaded and bitter.. not because of my health but because of the people I was dating. one jerk after another and now I'm one of the jerks and I don't want to be.. I've decided I don't want to feel the way that I feel anymore.. I feel terrible not health-wise, yeah I feel lousy there too but do you know what's worse is how I feel after going on a date or trying to meet somebody or me needing to turn someone down or someone rejecting me, which if I'm honest is everyone that's all I face.. I just can't do it anymore it's way too much of an emotional roller coaster and it's one I want to get off,  I don't want to be on this ride anymore.. 

   yes,  I'm lonely I'm extremely lonely and that's the whole allure to wanting to be in a relationship. I've been seeking the dream for so long to have a significant other that cares about me and that I care about, someone to do things with someone to keep my spirits up and I can keep their spirits up,  just the opposite keeps happening so far..  I'm never going to find it so why put myself through the misery any longer.. 

 I'm just not going to do it anymore. I finally need to put an end to this and it's way overdue. Some people may be wondering how are you going to handle interaction with people when you are in the mood for sex.. simply I'm not and that can be done.   I started a medication that will kill your sex drive it was specifically designed to do that as long as you take this medication you don't even think about sex you don't want sex you don't want any of that.. I started it last week it kicked in and boy you immediately start thinking differently when you no longer have any Drive.. and as any gay will tell you (any honest gay) will tell you your sex drive really controls a lot of what you do.. From going out on various apps and hooking up and doing things it really takes over it controls a lot of what you do in your life and once you eliminate that do you get your life back or you get (a life back..) 

 I look back at the things I did the relationships I've had the arguments have gotten into it was all so stupid.. this is all new to me but I can already tell that it's going to be a pretty lonely existence.. now that I don't have to deal with my sexual urges while trying to make friends I guess I'll find out if I'm someone people want to be friends with. I suspect its going to be a pretty lonely existence..  But would I rather be alone or would I rather spend the rest of my life getting turned down rejected made fun of be the butt of the joke or even get taken advantage of for whatever reasons... NO I don't want any of that anymore. I don't want to be that person anymore I'll take being alone.. sometimes you just need to know when it's time to throw in the towel.. I didn't know that I should have thrown it in 15 years ago... 

so far all you that are in your twenties and thirties and single enjoy it!  try to settle down for those that did  congratulations.. for those that got married or in committed relationships don't take them for granted.. you don't want to be apathetic old guy grasping at straws trying to find someone before they check out..

  The last few years I feel like something is unsettled, I was missing out on.   I never got it, now I know I never will.  I took care of it I wanted to stop that yearning to be wanted. I didn't want to take my last breath thinking of that, having that regret.. I'm hoping my decision and medication will provide me freedom from the feeling of not being included.. so here is to being alone it's nothing new just science is going to help me a little bit.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1070760,public,self,I'm Done with Dating...Officially done..,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q96p5d/im_done_with_datingofficially_done/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,

I'm dating with the purpose of finding a relationship. In the last year I've been on dates with 

First guy I went on 2 dates with (we slept together on the second date). After I went home, he told me he wasn't feeling a connection. He wanted to be friends, so I agreed. We ended up sleeping together again on multiple occasions of course, this went on for about 2.5 months until I stopped seeing him. He said I ticked all of his boxes and we got along great, but he wasn't feeling that spark.

The second guy I went on 6 dates with, we never even kissed that entire time. Yet when I asked him out on dates he would agree to go. That fizzled out when he did a slow fade and eventually ghosted me. I cut my losses quickly.

Went on first dates with 2 different guys (#3 and #4) I ended things straight after as I wasn't feeling any interest towards them whatsoever.

The 5th guy I went on 6 dates with. Slept together on the third date, things seemed to be going well. A few days after our 6th date, he told me he didn't see it turning into anything serious as there wasn't a strong connection there for him. He wanted to keep seeing me casually, I told him I couldn't see him anymore.

The 6th guy I went on 2 dates with. At the end of the second date I had a feeling he wasn't as into it anymore, but I decided to ask him on a third date anyway the following week. He let me know he wasn't feeling a romantic connection.

I don't really know what I'm doing or not doing that results in a lack of romantic connection with guys. They all tell me they find me really attractive, they like me, they enjoy spending time with me. But that romantic connection is always missing. Doesn't seem to matter if I sleep with them or not.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to improve the likelihood of developing a romantic connection with someone? I feel like I've lost 2 really great guys because of this.

P.S. When I've posted previously, a few common questions come up, so I'll answer them now.

* I've been told I'm an attractive person by men and women. I believe I am, too.
* I'm slim, petite, slight curves. I've been told I have a great body and I believe I do, too.
* I dress very feminine and to suit my body shape, and enhance my curves. I always make sure my makeup and hair look great for dates.
* I can hold a conversation and typically focus more on the other person. Asking questions, showing an interest in what they have to say. I talk about myself too of course, but I definitely make it more about them.
* I have a lot to offer a partner and I believe I showcase that, myself, and my personality.
* I'm an introvert, and I come across as confident but not cocky. Like everyone, I have insecurities but I don't let them show.

So I decided to make simple mobile app that I hope can help such people. It's free, has no ads and don't use internet connection.  
Let me explain the idea of the app.  
Say, you met a stranger in the subway, cafe, bus, club... and you like her/him?  
And if you don't have enough courage to speak with a stranger, but brave enough to show mobile phone screen, here you go.

1. Just type your name and write an interesting dating offer.
2. Then show the screen with your offer to the person you like. That\`s all!
3. The person you show the screen can type phone number or social media account name, so you can continue your conversation and go out for a date.

If you like to try it, you can search it in App Store or Google Play by ""Small Talk Pickup"".  
Also, there is PWA version, but I can't post url here due to rules of Reddit.

I can tell she is taking this serious, and thats good. She is just incredibly lazy, and where she does show up it is great.

Right now I do not think anything is going to happen between us. She is still very tense and our conversations fall flat every time we talk. This isn't good and doesn't allow for us to talk about things how I prefer.

However, once I discuss why I have this preference, many taller women run to the hills. To be put it bluntly, I have a height kink specifically Macrophilia (the attraction to large things, in this case tall women). There is more to said kink, but for this post I will keep it simple here. In short, it is hard for me to date taller women because many of them revile that kink.

Honestly, I can not blame them. Especially those who have dealt with too many height chasers that only want to fulfill their fantasies while completely disregarding the woman's feelings. This stigma of the chaser with no boundaries hangs over me because of this. I like to openly express what I am into, but I will do it with someone who is comfortable with it. It is about being respectful and having common courtesy for those who are into it and those who are not.

If there is anything you should take away from this post it would be this, regardless of what you are into, always be respectful of one's boundaries. It goes without saying, but sadly some people tend to disregard that rule of dating just for their own pleasure.

It started online and we're both in our 20s. Obviously, with the pandemic, it took us a while to actually meet up. We waited until it was safe, we were both fully vaccinated, etc. We talked on a daily basis and it was seemingly all good. We seem to gel pretty well and have all the same interests and all of that.

One thing that always kind of stood out when we talked; 90% of the time, when I brought up meeting up or something we could do when we finally could do so, she'd kind of ignore that message and talk about something else.  I figured, maybe she wasn't cool with it yet, not interested, or whatever. At that point, we'd only texted, talked on the phone, etc. Occasionally, SHE would come up with an idea like ""let's go skating when winter comes along"". It was a weird thing where she'd only acknowledge doing something together if she brought it up first. 

Anyway. Fast forward a couple of months. It's safe to meet up and we finally do so. We had a nice date. All is good. Our next date? Two weeks later. The next date after that? Another two weeks later. 

I'm really enjoying the time we do spend together. However, she works a fairly demanding job where she works over 55 hours a week sometimes. Some weeks, she has to work on Saturday. 

We literally live around 15 minutes away from each other and I spend as much time with her as I did with an ex-gf that I lived an hour and a half away from. 

She gets busy and tired because of work and I entirely understand that. But here's a kicker; even when she has a weekend off and knows she may have to work the next weekend, she'll tell me she needs a day or two off to just stay home and be lazy (in her own words). Which means, she's too ""lazy"" to hang out this weekend but she probably won't be available the weekend after either. It's kind of driving me nuts. 

So since first talking to her back in April... we've hung out four times total. I'm all for giving this some more time but this schedule of hers is making it impossible to actually plan anything ahead of time.
