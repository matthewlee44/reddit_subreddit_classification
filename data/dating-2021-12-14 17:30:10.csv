1,rgkuq4,1639525796,I wasn’t afraid of ghosts until I started using dating apps,It’s seriously getting ridiculous. How can you go from having great conversation with someone and having plans to meet up and then just drop off the face of the earth and leave them completely in the dark? I’ve been ghosted back to back with the last two girls I talked to from tinder. The first one I met up with twice and had plans to see again before she disappeared. The next one I had plans to meet up with for the first time and she was very enthusiastic about it but now it’s crickets. I get people have a lot going on but I just don’t understand why ghosting is so common because it always leaves the recipient feeling like garbage. I’m planning to take a break from the apps for a little while because it’s just so mentally draining. As an average guy on the apps it’s hard not to get excited about a conversation lasting more than a few messages because it doesn’t happen that often. So when it’s going well and then they ghost out of nowhere it makes it suck that much more.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgkuq4/i_wasnt_afraid_of_ghosts_until_i_started_using/
2,rgkyqm,1639526127,Uncertain if co-worker feels the same,"Due to some circumstances, I started a new job recently. I'm a girl, just fyi. My mentor, so to say, introduced me to everyone, including two guys my age (26). They work in entirely different jobs, but for the same company as me. Every day, I chatted with one of the guys (outgoing and talkative, the type that gets along well with everyone), the other one was around but didn't say much. If I'm completely honest, I didn't even notice him properly. Then the talkative guy took his annual leave. The remaining guy was very reserved, and when he came to talk to me, I was busy doing phone calls regarding an urgent issue. He walked off. The next days he didn't come to see me, so I went to his office and asked how he's doing. He said he was busy, but later admitted he felt a bit too shy to approach me without his friend. We talked a more and then something changed. He told me about himself, we told each other jokes and he really seemed to open up. He even gave me his phone number so that I could meet up with his friend and him on the weekend. He said that his friend is bringing his girlfriend. We talked in the mutual chat group but I didn't text or call him yet. I would want to, but it's just difficult for me to see if he is interested, too. One day I was sick and the next day he immediately walked up to my desk and said he missed me, he asked a co-worker and was told I was sick, so he was worried. Sadly I actually didn't have time to meet up with his friends and him that weekend. I really hope he didn't think I was just making up excuses. He also talked about how he wants to do a roadtrip next year and that I should come with him. I'm bad at noticing signs, so I really don't know how to take it all. Him looking at me whenever he walks past doesn't have to mean anything. Does he want to be friends ""only"", or, is he perhaps, well, considering to date me? I can't just ask him directly. I'm not really experienced when it comes to dating, I had only one serious relationship in my entire life, and that was someone I first met online. I really don't want to make things awkward, but I also don't want him to think I'm not interested, because I definitely am. At least in getting to know him better, and then we could see where we go from there. Do you have any advice for me? I'd really appreciate it. I don't want to blow this. I really like this guy and whatever it is, friendship or something else, I don't want to destroy it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgkyqm/uncertain_if_coworker_feels_the_same/

Dating apps
I get like 1 match in like 6 months (even in cities like Paris) so not great at all. And I have zero idea how to start and hold on to a conversation on dating apps. And also I can say that my self-esteem here is an absolute -1000

Meeting in person
Here it is a wierd thing. I have no problem striking a conversation with any random person (guy/girl) and I will be confidently able to hold on to the conversation and pretty much become friends too but then everything goes down the drain when I'll have to chat with the person over text. (Absolutely 0 texting skills)

But the moment I see someone I like all that confidence of talking freely just vanishes off (*poof*) and my mind goes completely blank....and so finding a date the conventional way is also gone.

6,rglbrm,1639527130,"Is it a red flag that my BF mixes up my name with hers, forgot our date, bc he is is now going to the gym w/his female best friend more times a week than he sees me? Plans to go 3x with her, 3x with me a week so it's even","***Context***: They are best friends since high school, before I met him. They lost contact for a few months bc a girl he liked at the time asked him to stop talking to her. He did and now regrets doing that to her bc he never even dated the girl in the first place. His friend got possessive with his future GFs since then.

***Now what happened is:*** We (relationship length: +3years, we're all 24yo) used to go to the gym together before covid hit and the gyms closed. He recently asked me (early December) to resume going with him, and I replied I'd go starting January bc I'd already started an at-home exercise program weeks ago and I wanted to finish it first. Interestingly enough after I said no, he says she asked him to go with her. He told me he'd stop going with her once I went. (His gym membership allows him to bring only 1 guest along with him)

My initial reaction was positive, as they hadn't gone out much before this, so that he could go out his longtime friend. But last week:

* *Her mom asked her if I wasn't mad that they were seeing each other so much* (I'm a med student and see him 2x a week. They are going to the gym 3x per week. With this he admitted that it's a bit weird for him too to see her more than me)
* *He forgot about a date we had bc he was at the gym with her*. Instead of picking me up at 3pm, he came at 5:30 (because I called)
* *He called me by her name* (twice, says **he also accidentally calls her love sometimes, that he is always mixing up the names**, as if that's supposed to make me feel better) 

So I asked him to stop going with her or at least to tell her of our initial arrangement, (that I am going with him on January and that he'd stop going with her). I just don't feel comfortable with them seeing each other the same amount of time we do. And then he felt I was being controlling and manipulative (like the girl in the context) and said I was no different than her. About our January arrangement, he says he will now go 6x a week, so he can go 3x with her and 3x with me. 

According to him this is totally okay bc it's just the gym, he is not inviting her to dinner like he does with me, and bc I was the one who said no in the first place and now it would be odd to tell her they can't go anymore. He doesn't want to upset her bc of a GF again, says my motives for going in January are only to keep her from him and that's controlling. I feel he IS inviting her to the gym he pays, so it IS like inviting her to dinner, and that if I can't go to something I'm easily replaceable.

*TL;DR: When I said I'd go to the gym with him in January, not this month, his female best friend asked him to go with her. Originally we planned he'd stop going with her once I went. Then he forgot about a date we had, has called me by her name twice, and they are going out 3x a week when I only see him 2x a week. Now that I asked him to tell her Im going in January or to come with me, he feels he's being controlled and instead plans to go 3x with her and 3x with me a week, completely changing what we had previously agreed on.*

 Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know if I even want to go in January with him anymore or what does this says about him not taking my feelings into account.

I thought I was over it, but I think I’m still a little hurt. I deleted his number a few days ago, but I went in iCloud and was able to re-delete it because I need closure. I texted him for the last time, and he still hadn’t responded to that, so I think I found my answer. I’m late 20s and he’s early 30s; just figured I was at a place where people wouldn’t ghost me.

I'm not terrible at dating. Although I've only ever had one girlfriend, I've gone on well over a dozen dates with other people over the course of my life. I even captured the interest of two different women a few months ago, one of whom even gave me a second date (but sadly one lost interest in me, and I lost interest in the other).

But now I'm trying to get back into the dating game. I'm struggling to find out what to say on these dating apps when I send women intros. 

Typically, if they share a hobby or interest on their profile, I'll ask them about that (i.e., ""who are your favorite metal bands?""). But so many women have nothing worth talking about in their profiles. They just write, ""I'm just trying to figure out life, i LiKe fOoD aNd bObA, not sure what I'm looking for on here, message me because I can't see likes 😊"" - and the absolute WORST one, ""if you wanna get to know me, just ask 😊"" There's nothing about that profile that allows me to easily start a conversation. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do with that.

The problem is that a lot of women want us men to be ""interesting"", but I find that this is extremely hard to do when most woman have empty profiles.

3 months later, I didn't have strong feelings for him, and if anything - his eagerness to GF me was putting me off, so I ended it via DM. It was a long message - saying sorry, thanks for your time etc, hope he finds someone special.

18,rgm2sa,1639529313,I think my racial preference goes beyond race— can anyone relate?,"I (20F, black) have always known that I prefer white men with few exceptions, but it was only recently that I really dug into this rigid preference and found another layer. 

I thought of a variety of valid explanations:
-I was raised in majority-white environments
-I saw white men as love interests or objects of desire in the media
-I’m self-hating and insecure about my blackness and sought a closer proximity to whiteness
-My own black father didn’t get to spend enough time with me during my formative years and now I seek the opposite of him thinking a white man will be more reliable

I think there’s truth to all of these possibilities, but recently I’ve uncovered a larger preference that also encompasses my racial preference. I want someone who seems very mainstream and well-established by traditional American standards. When I re-examined the specific kind of white men I find attractive it’s WASPy, clean-cut, older, white-collar, politically moderate to conservative professionals who went to top-ranked schools and dress in preppy clothes and have traditional interests like golf and wine tasting. My general preference doesn’t extend to white Europeans, bohemian or alternative white men, or other men who notably deviate from this type, even if they are white. 

I think this comes from an urge to be accepted or viewed favorably by society at large. Like if I can get this guy who looks good on paper and fits a conventional idea of success and desirability then it reflects well on me.

When he finally messaged me back it was 4pm and he said his phone battery died.

I got him $100 Xbox credit for coins on his favourite game which he’s always saying he doesn’t have enough of, and some of the Gundam action figures he didn’t have, and preordered one which hasn’t arrived yet. 

After I gave him those and we had sex I said 
“what do you want to do now? We could play Xbox or watch your fav show or something”.

I do feel very sexual and I am so very grateful of my body and looks, but I have always had a weird relationship with my sexuality and the idea of “giving” myself to another person. So it was my first relationship, lasted for about three years (we kissed after 8 months, had intimate relations 1,5 years into it). It was very deep in a superficial way I seem to think now, he saw me (he a friend of my cousin, M27) and decided/pursued the relationship and I was naive, and said yes eventually because he was persistent (he is not a bad man, but I would not have been with him if he had accepted my no’s). I think we both had issues and allowed our comfortabilities and codependency to trap us. We didn’t communicate well, I had no idea what I was doing (growing up with not much knowledge of how to be a girlfriend?) after trust issues from both parts, we decided to end the relationship. I then found out I was pregnant, he wanted the child but was still supportive when I decided to abort. We both have been civil since the break-up (rarely get I miss you texts) he is usually toxic, but he stopped after a while and now he is in a relationship and acting very respectful towards me (we move in the same circles). Just to explain my love life in a short story, 

I am good at being open and good at making conversation, but usually I just get bored or have a feeling like this is not the one. Think since me and my ex broke up, maybe 9 men have been in want to be more with me. So like they still check up on me to this day (I am usually very honest and hate bad vibes, so I never play men for a fool) - but I am obviously the problem, but what is wrong with me? I do not feel like my ex and I should be together but not a lot of people have the kind of vibe that I fall for (can this be a case of me being too set on a type??) I appreciate confident people, humble but who do not feel ashamed about being themselves in any way. Apparently in my experience that’s not the case, men seem intentional at first then it kinda changes and I always am in control or they do not understand boundaries…

That first girl is now one of my best friends, but having 2 years of unrequited feelings for her when I was younger taught me a shit ton about this kind of thing. That started the same way and felt amazing at the time, but in the end it led to me having to force myself to get over her as she had a boyfriend and when I told her how I felt it got a little messy between us. We both handled it really maturely and are great friends again, but it took a lot of work on both our parts to cool things off. To this day we still have to keep our distance from each other a little and it was never quite the same. I should have learned to accept the friendship for what it was from the get go.

Anyway, I know this isn’t going anywhere logically. She is insanely out of my league to the point it’s ridiculous. I know she’s just being a friend and we just have a laugh together and I shouldn’t read into it. I know from firsthand experience work related crushes can lead to heartbreak. I know that the fact is we’re both just the only single people around the same age at work and a little flirtation is probably just natural in that situation. I know it won’t lead anywhere and I told myself I’ll never be that into someone again without dating them, but I know asking her out would be stupid when you have to work every day with each other.

Basically, I don’t want to let this become a big thing in my head. Right now it’s manageable; I look forward to seeing her a little and we have a good time together, but I know I need to keep it under control and to myself and I’m not thinking about her all the damn time like previous crushes. She’s just one of those people who’s really nice to everyone and it’s not that she likes me in that way, it’s obvious she just sees me as a friend. 

So, how do I keep this under control while it’s still kind of a small thing? I just don’t have it in me to fall too hard for someone again when it’s not gonna happen, it’s happened too many times and I’m sick of it. While it’s been nice having that kind of tension with someone again, I realise it’s probably mostly in my head and that it’s gonna be a whole lot easier for both of us if I just learn to keep it as no big deal. What’s the best way to keep this low-key and stop myself falling for her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgmnz9/developing_a_crush_on_a_girl_from_work_ive_been/

27,rgmp5y,1639531135,"FWB lacking communication from both our ends, talked about his ex during dinner - will bring this up to him","So I found this guy off of Tinder around two months ago and it started off as a meaningless hookup. He'd occasionally invite me over and as the sex was good I obliged to the point where I mention becoming friends with benefits or fuck buddies. He agreed and we both established that we weren't looking for a relationship due to our busy lives. Weeks would go by and I noticed that we had frequently texted and met up with each other. I've only ever tried out fwbs once so I wasn't entirely sure how far the intimacy would go, but I've noticed that he's initiated cuddling and pillow talks at the very start. I pass it by and let it continue but of course with how tricky emotions could be handled I realized I had caught feelings. I definitely should have brought it up for my own mental health when I started seeing him differently, and now it's a mistake that I am learning from. 

He's shown some weird signs that he might actually care more than he's letting on. This has only happened a few times but when I would be too busy to respond back after he had hit me up, I could tell that he was very passively mad. I jokingly mentioned this one night and he denied that he was ever at all mad about it. There were also a few times where we've talked about the hookups we have had recently and he asked for a picture of this guy I saw before him. I told him that I personally don't keep photos of my past hookups but he would obnoxiously press me for them. Not really sure why but I questioned it and its because he wanted to know if the dude was hot. Whatever that means. 

He's also shown more affection throughout the past few weeks such as holding my hand throughout a whole car ride or the sex would be noticeably more passionate. Just a week ago, he suggested that we go out to dinner after I recommended a restaurant that he should check out. I again joked that I would be down if he paid for it, but when he took it seriously I had taken it back pretty quickly knowing we are just friends. He again offered to pay telling me it was his treat, and so we set a day. 

Before we even got to the place we were talking again about other people and he mentions his other fwb. This isn't private knowledge at all because I knew about the other girl he was seeing, though he now only mentions that they dated and broke things off because they both wanted to explore with other people. They broke things off just a few months ago (Right when we first started hooking up) and is still continuing to see her as a fwb. Then I started to realize this was the same girl he wanted me to have a threesome with and honestly it was difficult to wrap my head around. I thought it was strange because that wouldn't really be my approach after breaking things off with someone, but I decided to let that go and feel out the rest of the night. He briefly mentions his ex every so often throughout dinner with him. That really put me off and I barely finished my food. He also forgot that he ever even mentioned paying for dinner, I can't tell if he really did forget or if he was just playing it off. So we split the bill and to put the cherry on top he makes out with me before he drops me back at my place. 

I don't really know what to think about that. I know the first step would be to  tell him how I really feel and learn to accept whatever the consequence would be. Should I at all mention his weird behaviors in the past? It's been a whole mind game and I just want to get it all over with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgmp5y/fwb_lacking_communication_from_both_our_ends/

32,rgn14r,1639532161,Did I overreact? He stopped walking me to my car at night.,"Hello ladies and gents of reddit. Just need some outside input on whether I reacted appropriately to this.

So, I’ve (29F) been seeing this guy (39M) for about 4 months once a week. It’s definitely a casual thing but I thought it was close to a FWB situation. Our arrangement was that I come over, always at night, we hang out a bit, eat some dinner, hook up, cuddle, maybe round 2, and then I leave. He lives in a downtown area that does get sketchy at night. I always park at a parking structure across the street. I would usually leave around midnight to 1am. Because I think it’s relevant to the situation, I’m a petite attractive woman and I would dress up nicely whenever I went over. I’ve been assaulted before but I’ve never disclosed this info to him. 

Up until our last 2 get togethers, he would walk me to my car. The second to last time, he walked me to the door of his apartment, and then closed it behind me as I left and he said bye. I was confused because this had never happened before. I assumed maybe he was too fucked up (high and drunk) and it was an honest blunder. Anyways, I was hollered at by a group of sketchy guys as I was walking back to my car but thankfully nothing else happened. 

This most recent and last time, I told him that he needed to walk me to my car. He was lying in bed and started complaining and basically kept saying that it was only across the street. I asked him again, mentioning that I didn’t feel safe going alone. He continued to raise a fuss because he was already comfy and warm and falling asleep. I’m not one to beg from a man, so I got up and left.

The next morning, I sent a text basically saying that I’m cutting the cord, it was fun while it lasted, but I will not tolerate being treated like a random sex worker. We are professional colleagues (in the same field) and, at minimum, we were friendly, maybe even friends. 

I blocked him after sending the text. I did it because I didn’t think I’d be strong enough to stay away if he apologized or argued his way out of it. I am hurt because I was always very nice and I don’t understand where this devaluing behavior came from. He used to be such a gentleman. I figured if he’s already acting like this, it’s only bound to get worse.

I’m bummed that I have to search for another unproblematic D to fulfill my weekly needs. But even with these casual situations I feel that I should maintain my dignity right? Or did I overreact? I acknowledge maybe I could have communicated more but…I did try.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgn14r/did_i_overreact_he_stopped_walking_me_to_my_car/

37,rgnl3k,1639533790,Terrible timing... Please help,"So I (35f) got up the nerve to ask out a guy (26m). I know, I know, the age difference, but I pass for late 20s and I'm pretty immature. Anyways.

Our kids are friends and I see him pretty frequently in our little community. We're always friendly, but I'm terribly awkward and shy when i have a crush, so it's been a slow process. He was at my house for a play date last winter and I got a very nervous vibe from him, which is kind of what got me thinking about him that way (I'm not accustomed to making men nervous haha).

I have his number from waaayy back (kid related) but we haven't communicated by phone/text in nearly a year. I decided to go for it 2.5 weeks ago, so I texted him one evening with just a ""Hey this is so and so, is this still a good number for you"" kinda thing. HOWEVER, I later learned that not 2 hours before I texted him, he had left on a work trip that keeps him out of cell phone range for days at a time with only random, quick trips back to civilization. My luck, right?

So it's been 2.5 weeks, no response, haven't seen him, and I'm stuck in limbo. I know he has had cell service a couple of times, but no idea how long or the context. Is he ghosting me? Has his number changed? Did he assume it was about our kids and just not bother to respond since he's away? I managed to overhear that he's back later this week, and I don't know how to follow up or even if I should.

If I don't happen to see him, could I try Facebook and mentioning I tried to text him? Too stalkerish? If I do see him this weekend, can I mention it to him then? I prefer the idea of doing it virtually; better for my nerves and he can think about what he wants to do. 

Or should I just accept the ghost and cut my losses? I really can't see him ghosting me - our kids are buddies and there was nothing about my initial text that would have suggested I was going to ask him out. Plus he's just a sweetheart.

Obviously I'm waaayyyy overthinking this, but it's my first move in a guy in 14 years (was married) and just the going incommunicado + how long it's been have really shaken my confidence. I was pretty damn sure he was interested, but now... Ugh. Please help!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgnl3k/terrible_timing_please_help/

39,rgo0b1,1639535014,Blocked out of nowhere,"Little background information: A couple months ago I had visited the city I was planning on moving to for about a month. 3 weeks into the trip, I downloaded bumble and matched with this girl. We hit it off right away and she really wanted to hangout before I went back home. I gave her 2 dates that I was free before my flight but she was busy for both (no biggie, I was moving there in a couple months anyways). 

Fast forward a month and we start talking again. We’re now approaching ~3 weeks until I move into my new apartment and things are going REALLY well. So much in common, we’re FaceTiming every couple days for hours and she’s really putting the time and effort into this despite drowning during finals season. She’s coming up with date ideas since I’ll be new to the area and she knows of all the “cool” spots to go, etc. Complimenting me, flirting, all the good stuff. I even started to think it was too good to be true. I did a little “am I the only guy test” just in case someone suggests she may have other partners lined up. Here’s how that went: she wanted to do my astrology chart (I thought great, red flag), but actually she just thought it was fun to read about but obviously doesn’t base her dating life around signs. I read in one of her “stars” that women like her are always late to dates and have multiple guys lined up in the city. So jokingly, I say “ah so you got multiple guys AND you’re gonna be late for our first date?!” She laughs and is like “oh god no I’m never late and I don’t mess around when I’m interested in someone. I’m an all-in type of person and I feel like depending on the person, it might scare them off”. I’m the same way so perfect, right?

I feel like I should add that there was one subject that she was really touchy about. She’s an indigenous woman and anything to do with the island she’s from (not gonna specify) gets her really upset. I’ve had small glimpses of this and she acknowledged that her reactions to indigenous issues are big because she’s passionate about her heritage. I really loved this about her because as someone who’s a bit more reserved it was inspiring to see. When these discussions came up I was an active listener  (she even said that I made her feel “seen”) and would always support her or be an ear for her rants, etc. 

Here’s why that information is important. All of her previous summer jobs involved some sort of forestry and that’s what she was studying in school for her first couple of years. She told me a few weeks back that she had switched to psych because when she was in lectures, a lot of the information about her home was incorrect and it would really frustrate her. The profs would thank her for pointing stuff out but she didn’t like all of the attention put on her from her classmates and profs when they found out that she was from the island in question. Fair enough. 

One day we’re FaceTiming. We’re laughing having a good time, talking for over an hour while she’s in a café. She decides to take me with her on her walk home still on FT. She’s showing me around campus pointing out the buildings and mentions something about engineering and how shit she is at math blah blah blah, but she isn’t liking psych anymore because she feels like it’s all memorization and multiple choice exams. I agree and say “why did you switch from forestry again?” This is where I think I upset her. In my head I meant to say what made you choose psych anyways? I know that a lot of people take it as an elective during first year (I did when I was in school) and have a pretty good idea of what it’s gonna be like. She’s goes “really?” with a bit of a sigh and starts to say the things about forestry that I mentioned above. Mid sentence, her phone dies and I wait like an hour and text her good luck on her exam tomorrow. Never delivered, calls straight to voicemail. I got blocked. Today is my birthday, and its been 4 days since she blocked me. It just hurts. 

For someone who prides herself on speaking her mind, I’m just struggling with the fact that I wasn’t given the curtesy of communication if she was upset with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgo0b1/blocked_out_of_nowhere/

I'm 26M and got out of a relationship that started in highschool just this year (she cheated and is with the guy now since I dumped her so tbh I'm pretty insecure at the moment), so I'm relatively new to the dating scene and a little out of my element.

I've been talking to this one girl 24F for a month and a half now and I just can't really read her. She takes really long to text me back every day and it's usually me who's setting up dates. My friend read her texts and she says she thinks she's interested as her texts are trying to be funny and show genuine effort. However I just have trouble believing that if she were really interested she wouldn't want to text me right away. She sends selfies and did venmo me money for a coffee on my bday which I thought was sweet and not something someone would do if they didn't have any interest, I dunno. 

We just went on our third date and I picked her up and actually met her family, who was excited to see me so I think she's been talking about me to them. But she seemed a little cranky that day, not sure if she didn't want to go out or was just tired or what. At the end of the night she was a bit bubbly though, and I actually called on my way home to tell her I like her a lot and want to go out again. She said that she feels the same way but has to figure out when she could because her sister just got engaged. We each have a week off next week so we're trying to plan for sometime then, she just isn't sure which day yet.

Part of me feels I'm just overthinking it, we still talk every day and are trying to plan a fourth date after all. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm putting in most of the effort and she's not as eager as I am. She did tell me that she's only dated people she already knew (we met online) so she's not sure exactly how this works, which is the case for me as well. Nothing physical has happened mostly because I'm too chicken shit to make a move so maybe she just thinks I'M not interested, who knows. She gave me a hug on the second date and that's it.

I just feel if she were really interested, even if she were busy, I'd hear from her more often or she'd be trying to set more things up herself. We did go a month between our second and third date because we were each very busy, not sure if that matters.

54,rgpuri,1639540574,Should I(m18) try to keep in touch with her(f18) or is being quiet for months going to tarnish our friendship as a whole?,"So this is a long story to get the main situation..

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.” 

Some other stuff that happened that I don’t want to somehow cram into the story

- when we were playing video games together, she started talking about baby names and which ones I liked. Then she followed up the names she liked with my last name. 
- after the whole situation, her mom followed me on Instagram. 
- she out of the blue started checking up on me when I went off to college",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgpuri/should_im18_try_to_keep_in_touch_with_herf18_or/

57,rgqca7,1639542169,"After the first date, do guys...","Just confused. 

First date two days ago.. I don't think it went well. I didn't show my best self. I think I'm still half sabotaging myself because I am afraid to get hurt, so I acted a little bit more carefree. Although it felt like it wasn't that bad. Lasted about 2 hours. He texted me a couple hours after the date to say he had a good time and thanked me for coming out. I replied same &amp; thanks for the date. No mention of wanting to see me again. 

He wasn't much of a texter before the date but it feels like the enthusiasm after the date dropped. But why can't he just ignore or tell me upfront it isn't working out. If I ask him a simple question he would still give me a very elaborate answer. Is he just too nice? Doesn't want the guilt to be the first to reject? But that would save a lot of headache and overthinking honestly. 

Do guys just keep texting until the girl gets the hint? 
Maybe he's just not sure and wants to explore all the options first? Maybe he just is really nice and considerate of other people's feelings and doesn't want to come across as rude for ignoring or mean for rejecting? Or he could at least give one word answers and I would get the hint. But he writes back in long sentences sometimes. Very polite but rarely asks questions.. unlike before the date. 

I don't know if I even like him. It's been one date. But not knowing and the feeling of being strung along is really bothering me.

The day of the event came and he cancelled as he had a covid scare. I understood. He makes the comment, ""Well, I at least owe you a beer.""

Today, he texted me saying his covid test came back negative. He also says, ""First round is on me for missing the event...""

91,rgu3lx,1639555568,Would you view a guy as less attractive if he doesn’t have a license?,"I (m18) was chatting with a girl (f18) I know, we were laughing and vibing until we brought up drivers licenses. I told her I don’t have one yet and she said “big L” and the rest of our convo was still enjoyable but had a different vibe after I told her that, idk how to explain it. almost like she started holding back a little. I couldn’t tell whether she was joking when she said that or something else? Idk if that made her view me in a different way or less attractive ? I’m in the process about to take my permit test next week but she didn’t know that. Is it a immediate turn off when a guy doesn’t have a license at my age?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgu3lx/would_you_view_a_guy_as_less_attractive_if_he/
92,rgu8wu,1639556167,My boyfriend said he’s waiting for me?,"I’ve been dating him for three years - recently I’ve gone through some challenging situations. I accept I have some issues and self-esteem is one of them and it manifests in extreme anxiety and insomnia. I’ve been seeking medical help unknowingly behind his back. I did reach out to him to have a talk and eluded to having a difficult year. He then proceeded to delete me and block me off socials - which he’s entitled to do it’s his life. Understandably, I was really hurt and just bombarded him and he was so angry and said some hurtful things. 

He suggested that I work on my anxiety and depression, and said he’s willing to wait two months for me. He said if I’m continuously as low as I am we cannot progress with our relationship. Which, I feel hurt by because when he was going through a rough patch I gave him grace and space and stood by him. I just feel really hurt because I’d never treat him that way and I know he’s aware that by ignoring me I was besides myself. Anyways, I told him my plans that I’ll be taking to get better. I’ve been going to therapy since September and I’ve quit my job to find a new career. I’m also going on holiday to help an NGO in a few days and to see where my family come. But, ultimately to grieve the loss my grandmother. I’ve also asked him to come to therapy with me and he agreed. Yesterday, I told him it’d be in mid-January and he hasn’t replied yet? I know I’m being paranoid because, I have no right to him time etc. but I do feel a little on edge. 

My question is what shall I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgu8wu/my_boyfriend_said_hes_waiting_for_me/

94,rgualt,1639556360,What’s the difference between communicating and having to tell someone what to do?,"A lot of my dating life I’ve just expected the guy to read my mind. I own up to this mistake and have been trying to do better. When something bothers me, I tell them. If I’m annoyed, I tell them. However, when I am I crossing the line of having to tell them what to do all the time? I have told the guy I am talking to right now that I wish he would be less dry. He got better for a bit and then I had to tell him he wasn’t asking any questions about me. He said, “ok my bad” and then didn’t ask a question… I suppose I already understand that maybe I shouldn’t give this guy another chance but I realized I really don’t understand proper communication honestly. Is too much/ pointless to tell these guys I’ve only been talking to for like a week, like “this is bothering me but I want to keep talking to you.” How do I go about this ? Do I tell them what is bothering me as soon as they do it ? Or do I cut them off or wait until they ask me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgualt/whats_the_difference_between_communicating_and/

Im 21m that has 0 experience with girls and past 6 months im trying to up my game by i had little success. Hell i would say 0 success. Idk what im doing wrong. Tried to join dating sites. Got 1 date in those 6 months and it ended up being a disaster. I know it is not my appearance cuz i take care of myself and have good athletic body. It has to be something with communication or Idk.

Anybody have any weird stories of people faking their service, or bragging about their application? 

Just matched with a guy who is bragging how he's a shoe in for ""a list of officer positions despite never graduating."" 

That's... not how that works in this country.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rguo4l/lying_about_military_service/
