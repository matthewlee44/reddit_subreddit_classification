At best.  üòµ‚Äçüí´ I started on Craigslist.  Wow.  Was I completely unaware of stranger danger.  A few psychos later, I went to dating websites.  It was kinda new so it was easy to chat and I managed to meet one person.  11 meets later she disappears.  Ok.  No big deal, wasn‚Äôt a good fit.  Then the wonderful thing tech is there came out apps. On the phone.  Weee!   Here I go.  Scammers everywhere.  Rejection at every step I take from real women.   But Nigerian scammers.  Ha.  Honed in on me like a guided rocket.  Every one of the people who contact me for chat and potential love live in another country and use loneliness and the human being‚Äôs desire to be loved to make a profit.

2,q5wvwi,1633961992,How to discuss political differences.,"I (36M) am talking to this woman (32) who has a background and upbringing that is reasonably similar to mine (white, Christian, suburban/slightly rural, Southern). However, she gets her political news primarily from conservative friends and family on Facebook which, obviously, tends to have a tenuous relationship with the facts. I lean on what I consider to be more credible and objective sources, and I'm significantly more liberal than she is. In attempting to talk about politics, we seem to have have significant overlap in our attitudes about the role of government, but our interpretation of current events differs widely because of our the different interpretations that come from our respective news sources. Some things she believes that influence how she votes are conspiracy theories that have been debunked (though she seems unaware of that) ages ago.

She seems to realize Facebook isn't a great place to get your news from and appears open to taking in news from other sources. Being able to discuss current events calmly and rationally with my significant other is really important to me, and I think this girl is something special. If I can make this work, I would like to. I've expressed my doubt to her that, given these differences, things could work between us, but she's open to forging ahead.

I (23F) had been seeing this guy (23M) for about 3 months, and yesterday he cryptically broke things off. We'd been mutuals on Twitter for about a year and a half, so we had known each other for a while but never met in person. I had always thought he was cute but we didn't live in the same city until recently, so I was on top of the world when we started seeing each other.

We had sex on the first date at the end of July. We started consistently texting, going out, staying the night at each other's houses, meeting each other's friends, etc. Yesterday, we went to a farmer's market before going back to my place, where he said ""we're only having sex because we're both hot, but doesn't think we have a strong romantic relationship."" He said he likes hanging out with me, but once again, didn't think our ""romantic connection"" was strong. I said I was confused because I like him a lot. He held my hand while breaking up with me, and then kissed me before he left.

We didn't do much in terms of hand-holding when we were out, but we kissed a few times in public, and were generally acting ""romantic"" when we were together. Arm around me in front of friends, I made him dinner a few times, he got me some postcards because he knows I like them, said he had missed me when I was out of town, etc etc. It just feels like it came out of nowhere.

He's generally reserved and not the most expressive, but is a little more so when we're just hanging out 1-on-1 in private. A few weeks ago, I thought he was becoming more distant, so I checked in and asked if he was still interested in hanging out, and he said yes. Today was the first day in 3 months that I haven't heard from him.

I'm just feeling confused. I'm wondering if maybe he just has some commitment issues? Do you think I'll hear from him again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5yll5/interpreting_a_breakup_23f_and_23m/

Whenever i try to talk to about it to anyone they give me the 'you are so lucky' or 'you must do something to deserve it' responses. It's so frustrating. 

A lot of them seem really nice and normal at first, but whenever I tell them no, they start insulting me or hitting me. They have done things like tell me how to dress, demand I get a different job, start trying to take up all my free time and telling me I'm an abusive asshole if I don't do everything they want me to do.

It's not constant, but it's so depressing to feel like I either have to be alone, or suffer abuse/harassment if I want to date anyone. I've never had a relationship that didn't end up this way. I have been physically assaulted by numerous girlfriends, and verbally assaulted by almost all of them. I do not believe in violence, so I do not fight back. I just leave. They have also harassed friends, family, and new people I'm dating after we break up. 

I would just like to meet someone who isn't abusive and angry all the time, but it seems like it's impossible for me. This has been going on since I was a teenager. Yes, I've been to therapy. It made me stronger and better, but it still has not stopped aggresive and hostile women from seeking me out. I get weird matches on apps from women make jokes about violence and rape as a form of flirting.

This occurs IRL as well as online, it's like my face only attracts abusive and hostile people. I know many people who aren't like this, who are my friends, and they tell me I'm not attractive, I'm boring, etc. But apparently that makes me super attractive to abusive people?

So I‚Äôm a 24 y/o Female doing a long distance relationship with 28 y/o male. We have been together for almost 8 months and things were really good in the beginning I guess... we have only met in person twice so we are usually on the phone 24/7. From the beginning I knew he wasn‚Äôt very romantic and didn‚Äôt know how to do this whole ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù thing because I‚Äôm supposedly his first love and the only girl that he ever wanted to be in a relationship with. But I‚Äôve never met someone that i clicked with so quickly honestly. We have a lot in common and I know he loves and cares for me. He knows everything and anything about me honestly and has really helped me a lot with my mental health this year. Since we are long distance we have to try extra hard to keep the spark alive but sometimes I feel like he doesn‚Äôt want to try and it frustrates the hell out of me. The efforts in the beginning were there but after he finally asked me to be his girlfriend he completely stopped trying. For months I‚Äôve been explaining how I feel about this and he says he is trying but he just does the bare minimum and it honestly just makes me kinda sad. He never makes me feel special or try to do something nice for me (other than just buying me food occasionally). I always ask for dates and just to spend time with each other but he doesn‚Äôt even try during our dates at all and we always just end up arguing. With anniversaries he only celebrates with me If I asked him to and i try to make shit special for him but he never reciprocates the energy. Another thing is, I currently make a great salary and I work my ass off everyday. He currently does not work at all and is always struggling to figure out what to eat and how he is going to pay rent for the month. I door dash/Uber eats him food and I try to help out as much as I can. Even when he comes to visit i paid for almost everything. But it scares me because as much as I want a future with him I don‚Äôt want to end up being the care taker of a grown man that barely takes care of himself or me. We talk about the future a lot and he wants to marry me soon. But I know my parents would never allow me to marry someone that can‚Äôt financially support me in the future, and i don‚Äôt want that for myself either. I try to talk to him about this but he doesn‚Äôt know what he wants to do. He does not have any sort of drive or goals for himself. He doesn‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything really. He honestly spends his day sleeping for half of the day and then hangs out with all 8+ of his roommates. I‚Äôm just scared idk why, I love and care about him so much but I can‚Äôt keep dealing with this bare minimum bullshit. Im scared for the future honestly and i know things are going to get worse from here. I know i deserve better... I‚Äôm just scared since he is going through a tough time right now, if I try to break up with him I feel like I‚Äôm lowkey kicking him when he is down and it will cause him to do something...idk anymore it‚Äôs stressing me out and I‚Äôve been crying about this like crazy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5yyzh/idk_what_to_do_with_my_relationship/

28,q5zo0q,1633969697,"Am I ""one of the boys""?","Sorry in advance for the long post and for my not-so-perfect translation as English is not my first language. I want to give all the possible info for context.

In July I (24F) was invited to an old friend's wedding, where I got to know the groom's cousin (25M). Not my smoothest introduction as I made a sarcastic joke about his job without even knowing his name, but we made some small talk. A couple of days later I ask him to see each other for a drink, and in return he quite aggressively asks me if that was a date or what. I became defensive and told him to act like I never said anything. The following night he reaches out to ask if I wanted to go out with him and his friend, but I was busy. 

He works very far from our hometown (we are born in the same), so he went back and we exchanged some messages once in a while. In September he comes back for vacation and again, ha asks me if I want to go out with him and his friend. This time I accept and has a good night, he initiated some sort of physical contact, and also that the following night he passed by himself by my house to say hello before going out with his friends. After what I considered a successful outing, I asked him to meet again a couple of times but he always refused; I got the hint, decided to cut my losses there and texted him goodbye the day he had to fly back , to what he responded ""Thank you &lt;3"". 

In what seems like a joke, he got injured (badly sprained ankle) that same day and decided to return back to our hometown, but I didn't know it. He started to react to my insta stories, to text me once in a while, until he told me that he was back jokingly saying that I was mean to leave him alone in this situation. He proceeds to  invite me out with his friend + a colleague that came to visit him, he was touchy-feely when we were by ourselves and when we got back home he texts me that I turn him on. We then clarify our intentions to be YOLO, no-strings-attached ones (uni takes A LOT of my time and he lives far away), and talked everyday over text.

Yesterday I texted him if he wanted to go out but said no a bit rudely, so I again get the hint and calmly text him to have a good day, I will text him in the following week. He, AGAIN, gets defensive but tells me to pass by his house to say hello before his family comes back from lunch. I go there, we talked a bit, he maybe smiled once, I tried to make a joke but he scarily stared at me, all of this until I have to go home and, before saying goodbye with a kiss on the cheek (in my country this is normal also among strangers) I made an involuntarily sexual joke, to which he laughed a bit and I said:""You have time until november"", as in november he has to go back ho his job. He didn't try to kiss me or whatever else.

The same night he texted me this:

him: what do you mean with having time until november?

me: that if you go away we won't have any

him: Would you really say that?

me: Yeah, I think 

him: All right &lt;3

She's been my friend for as long as I can remember, been with me through 2 breakups of mine. And I'm still recovering from my last one, taking my time focusing on myself. Anyways 

She hasn't been dating anyone and is a Nerd (sorry for the slang but she's a straight A student who really loves her books) 
She last dated (just online texts and no calls) when she was like 16 . She's from a Conservative family and I haven't seen her for a while and we only talk through text and she lives around 140 plus kms from me. We do not call because conservative family of hers gets suspicious of her and she doesn't want to hurt them. 

Last week things got really heated up between us during a conversation via chatting, and she confessed to having feelings for me and was quite upfront about it considering how close we are.
I didn't reciprocate (yet) but I did manage to ask her if she'd like to go out for coffee sometime and she told me that she liked me very much and would very much love to hang out with me and hug me when she sees me next but she's really afraid of getting into a relationship because it might affect her grades and her studies because she says emotions affect her a lot and she made sure I wasn't hurt or upset by her response and she made me promise I won't force her into a relationship because if I did she might have to say yes because it's me. 
She continued to write me a paragraph on how special I am to her and how much I mean to her and I am really touched by all those.

So now my dilemma,
I've also been very engaged in my studies recently as I'm studying for college still and,
I know I cannot stick to just one girl and I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing by letting things be and not force anything between us. 

What do you guys think?
Should I stick by her?
 Does anything sound or look fishy? 
Should I know anything?

41,q61q4j,1633975334,Healthy relationships after being in toxic ones?!,"I‚Äôm 23F and about a month ago I left a toxic relationship I was in for about 4 months. He was an ex-boyfriend of mine that I dated when I was like 16. When I was a young I remember being so ‚Äòin love‚Äô with him because we got along really well, but things ended because he just wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship at the time being also 16 years old.
Before getting into a relationship with said ex again in May of this year, I was in this weird situationship with a guy I had really strong feelings for. It was more like fwb, he was using me and we weren‚Äôt even really friends because we only talked when he wanted something from me. I really liked him for some reason though, I found him very attractive and I guess for some reason I fell in love with the ‚Äòidea‚Äô of him even though he was this narcissistic man that only cared about his own interests. Was just a mess of a situation, and he was very toxic.
This ex boyfriend of mine I just left wasn‚Äôt very different, was also narcissistic but in a different way. He always would find little ways to put me down. He would start little arguments with me after getting mad at something I said, and then blame me for starting it. My final straw was when he yelled at me for being ‚Äòfat, lazy and unmotivated‚Äô because I said I was finding it hard to find time to exercise since i‚Äôm a full time student spending 50+ hours a week on school work with a part time job as well (Why he thought that was any of his business is beyond me) 
Fast forward to now, i‚Äôm having a very difficult time getting along with men. I have major trust issues from the pattern of abusive relationships I‚Äôve been in. I feel as if I almost don‚Äôt deserve to find genuine interest and love in a person.

I have been liking this girl, i can see some signs that she likes me, i started messaging her between all the meetups we had so i get to know her better, i am not much of a talkative guy through social and i prefer face to face things. At the cafes we were going some times it wasn't so good, some times we were fully vibing together ( i know this happens). So a few days ago i told her if she want to go for a coffee and she replied,"" let me check if am available and i am gonna let you know, btw can the other join us?"", i was intending to go me and her but i thought maybe she doesn't feel very comfortable with me and she mentioned the other 2. I learn from my friend that my crush communicated with his girlfriend ( they are besties, same my friend and I), and told her to go for a coffee all together before letting me know if she can ( which i find a good sign since she wanted to come for a coffee). Well we went for a coffee we had a talk as usual, then my friend had to leave so its me and the 2 girls (my friends girlfriend and my crush), me and my crush had a general talk but with very humorous way and me making ""fun"" of her in a good way. My friend's girlfriend didnt talk much, she wanted us 2 to talk ( which i can see as a good sign as well). Then a few days later i message her again if she wants to join me on a ride in town, and if she wanted to tag in, i told her i wanted company, Unfortunately she couldn't join me since she was with her family, so she told me next time. I replied to her ""Hope so :D"" and she replied ""Yes why not!"". So know i want to tell her that i am interested in a her and i want to meet her more as a person. But i feel that i have messaged her so many times ( i didn't btw :D) and i feel like am stack.

I'm a few years away from 30 and I'm happy being single but people around me treat being single as the worst thing. There's this pressure from parents to find someone and have kids, social pressure from friends, even more from family.

*Them: Hey, I haven't seen you in a while... do you have a boyfriend?*
*Me: No, haha*

62,q644dw,1633981783,"The Fearful Avoidant is Jumping Out: Please talk some *kind, gentle* sense into me","I 27, F have a date coming up this Sunday and the anxiety has kicked in. Me and this guy (30, M) have known each other for years and now he has relocated back to my home state and I'm here after being gone a while. For years he flirted with me and even wanted to meet up in my previous residential state 2 years ago. A the time I sabotaged it and he ended up flying out without as hanging and we lost touch. He recently moved to my current state for work and said he finds me attractive, wants to take me out on a date etc. We are super flirtatious on text and he makes me laugh a lot, he's physically attractive etc. 

My thing is I keep doubting the authenticity of his interest. I keep thinking he'll loose interest once we meet, that he's just bored and lonely, that he might even cancel the date before and once I start going down this rabbit hole It never ends well (I cancel dates, ""reschedule"" hoping they'll forget to reconvene, etc. ) This only ever happens to me when i find a guy attractive before the date. 

I really like this guy and want to at least finally go on this date, he's asked for a while and I'd love to. But my brain is telling me a lot of reasons why I shouldn't even bother and at this rate this date is looking very cancelledish. I think what triggered these thoughts was that all weekend we texted and the vibes have been good, then yesterday night he stopped responding and liked my last text to him. It's reinforcing my assumptions that he's not into me etc. 

For those of you who understand this self-sabotage b.s common with Fearful Avoidant people, what piece of advice can you give someone having these thoughts? For those of you who have experienced then overcome these thoughts, how did you do it?

68,q64gjq,1633982659,"Is this what divorce feels like? 6 years dating, broken up for 1 year. I dont want to do this again.","Odd title, also not sure if this is considered ""getting on a soap box"" but im trying to gather some feedback on why im feeling this way. 

29 y.o male, ive been single for 13 months now. I dated my ex for 6 years, we bought a place together and raised 2 kittens. It was an ammicable split and were still really close friends. We havent ""fooled around"" or done anything more than a bear hug since weve broken up September 2020. 

She moved out, she took the cats first, but her place was too small so they're back with me. She helps me take care of the cats and i help her keep her old crappy car running. We have a few hobbies in common but overall we have very different beliefs and values. Regardless, we enjoy eachothers company, even if its purely plutonic. It is obvious though that we both still have feelings for eachother. We both understand we both need to grow individually if we ever want to get back together (we dont talk about it like were going to tho, we want to keep expectations realistic). 

Why did we breakup? Jeez, well it happened during the lockdown so im sure that had an effect. But it was mostly small things that added up to both of us wanting to do more stuff in life before settling down (we had pretty much settled down when we bought our house). We both kinda freaked out i guess, we both have busy careers and hobbies, we didnt plan to have kids. So we thought if we didnt do this now we would grow to resent eachother and be a miserable married couple (or have kids as a desperate way to salvage things). Neither of us wanted that outcome. We had more things we needed to accomplish on our own. 

We both tried dating, we encouraged eachother to meet new people. We talked about some of our dates with the good and bad (avoided the gritty stuff). I won't go into her feedback. But for me i just wasnt into it, i went on some fun dates with very attractive people, i got laid a lot. But honestly I was miserable, as soon as i had confirmed a date i was regretting it. I didnt want to meet these people, let alone date them, even if we ended up having fun... it wasnt fair to me or them so i just got out of dating all together. 

Now im in this wierd limbo, i dont want to date anyone new, mostly because i dont want to start a whole new relationship with someone and go through all that with someone else. Its like i only wanted to do that 1 time and whether it worked out or not i dont want to do it again. I have great memories with my ex, but at this point in time i enjoy being single and i dont want to get back with her. 

I feel like a burnt out divorcee, there's nothing wrong with being single, so thats fine. Im just wondering if anyone with more experience can shed some light on how im feeling?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q64gjq/is_this_what_divorce_feels_like_6_years_dating/

It was a friendship since we were both involved in a group for people who like building computers. He had shown interest in me but I had made it clear that I was not interested. He was nice enough to respect that. I knew he had a girlfriend so I thought there was no chance so why even bother. But during the friendship he will always tell me his problems and how he didn't love her, but he still cares for her. Then he told me that he was in love with me and that I was the women of his life. Although, it was a nice feeling I didn't understand why he will tell me those things if he barely knew me. He said that he felt it in his heart. He repeated that various times during our friendship. But I always told him that he needed to take care of his home. And that I was not going to be with someone who had a girlfriend and to think of me as his friend. 

Then after 6 months of knowing him he broke up with his girlfriend. I was in shock but I knew it was coming cuz he away seem so unhappy. So then he started getting closer to me and we began dating. It was more to get to know each other. Since he has recently broken up with her I didn't want to be a rebound. We had already built up a friendship so it was easy to date. But after one month the brake up started hitting him hard and he asked me to give him time. That he needed to find himself and to get use to her not been there. So, I told him I understood and to take his time.

I really like him but I'm not going to put pressure on such a delicate situation. Im the type of woman that takes a relationship serious. I like to take my time to know the person and to make sure we share the same values. But I had never dated someone who just broke up with someone.  

Our forms of communication since we met had always been phone call and text. Everyday he will call me since the first day we met to talk about computers and our day. Mostly he will talk about his girlfriend problems at home. Then when we began going out after his brake up he will still call me. So when he asked for time, we stopped texting. He use to text me all the time and I was use to it. We will often have conversations about computers and tech. Also, he will text me randomly I love you. He has said last time that he wanted to build a future with me. But that all stopped. However,  he still calls me everyday.

That is what‚Äôs making my head spin. Why would he ask for space. Keep calling me, But stop texting me. I‚Äôm not a huge texter but I do miss our normal convos comparing computers, the random I love you etc. I just find it so weird. On the phone he talks about his day at work but that‚Äôs it. He doesn‚Äôt really mention anything about us or the relationship.  I suppose is because of needing time to figure his life. I had already a convo with him when  He asked for space so I‚Äôm not going to repeat myself.

I‚Äôm independent, I got my own home and I got a career. But I‚Äôve only had one long term  relationship in my life. I‚Äôve been single for four year. So, I may be a little lost with modern dating.
 

Keep in mind I don‚Äôt ask him this questions because I don‚Äôt want to pressure him. I believe in respecting the time and space he asked.

72,q650d6,1633984182,How do I go on a date with this girl?,"So this girl (we'll call her Jas) went to a haunted house attraction with my brother, his girlfriend, a couple of our cousins(Jas is a cousin of my brother gf), and I (20M), and Jas asked for me to hold her hand throughout both haunted houses. The reason being that she said she's easily scared and that she can't even watch horror movies. I believe her because we both have extremely conservative parents who never tried to celebrate Halloween, so I wouldn't put it past her parents to ban something like horror movies. Anyways she holds my hand by interlocking our fingers together and I'm just thinking the whole time that only couples hold hands like that. The haunted house comes and goes and we talk for a little bit about anime and stuff like that and we exchange goodbyes as we drop her off at her place. I would like to talk to her some more but I don't have a way to message her. 

So here's the part where I ask for advice. How would I get in touch with this girl again? If I do get in touch with her how do I ask her out? I know the answer is a super obvious ""Just ask her out man."", but Keep in mind that I've never gone out on a date with another girl so I'm definitely lacking in experience. I guess what I'm really asking is how do I ask her out without freezing up due to anxiety. I already have somewhat of a plan in mind. I'm going to tell my brother that I have a crush on Jas, and I'm gonna ask for some help from him and his girlfriend to try and set us up in as natural a way as possible. Then I'm gonna talk to her some more and ask for her Snapchat/number. then I'm gonna try to escalate things to a date. I would really appreciate any advice/ pointers.

73,q651aa,1633984250,What went wrong here?,"I just wanted to get this off my chest for a while now, maybe someone could help me understand what happened here.

I met a guy off of bumble - I wasn't in town at the time we matched, so we texted on and off for a couple of months before I went back indefinitely, he had asked me out even before. So when I came back, we went out almost immediately. And when I say it was great, it honestly was.

I thought we clicked super well, we had a lot to talk about, we sat on this bench overlooking the city and we talked for hours about literally everything, like what happens after death, deep shit like that, so it definitely didn't feel on a surface level. I thought we'd be outside only for a couple of hours, but we ended up talking non-stop for 5+ hours, and we both agreed that time passed super super quickly. 

I asked him out again right after that, and he enthusiastically agreed, so we saw each other the next week, he invited me to his place, we watched a movie, again talked about a lot of things and time passed really quickly, like spent 10+ hours together quickly. He asked me out again in 2 days to watch another movie. Repeating myself a lot here, but again, spent a lot of time together, laughed a lot, talked about deep shit, seemed to be in understanding.

I'm going to be honest, at that point I was a bit worried because we hadn't really done anything but hug for bye/hi, I thought he didn't really want to make me uncomfortable since I was at his place, and we did actually have a conversation and he thought I felt uncomfortable but I was just being polite?? But I tried to assure him that it's not the case.

At that point, we were texting pretty much every day, but after that, I guess something happened and he stopped initiating conversation, he did for a couple of days, then stopped, I let it be thinking he was just busy, but a week passed and he didn't. So I just messaged to ask how he was doing, he didn't really seem that enthusiastic about talking to me. I just wanted honesty and to get things out of the way, so I asked if everything is ok because he doesn't really seem that interested in talking to me, and if he's just kind of not feeling it or if anything was up because I would really hate it if I had done anything to offend him or turn him off when we were out together. He was like ""oh nono don't worry, you didn't at all, I just have a really all or nothing personality and sometimes I just don't feel like socialising for a while"". Which I understand, I can be like that too. 

He said he still wants to go on a walk with me to a specific place when his leg gets better (has leg issues). I said I understand and I let him be, I don't really want to be annoying.

Well, cool beans, but that was two months ago, so obviously he was just ghosting me. And it's fine that he doesn't like me as a friend or as anything more, it really is, but I feel like he just lied directly to my face and that really angers me and offends me. I specifically went ahead and asked if I had done something wrong, and he just lied to me.

I assume it's not just the social thing - it's my birthday today, he knows it is, he didn't say shit so obviously he doesn't want to talk to me. I kind of unfollowed him anywhere I have him, but he's still following me on Instagram and watching all of my stories. If you want me to be gone from your life so badly, just do me a favour and disappear completely, what the fuck is this shit.

I know this is just my point of view, but I'd like to know what might have happened there. This whole situation honestly really hurt me and turned me off of getting to know new people for the timebeing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q651aa/what_went_wrong_here/

We had been talking about school stuff for months and he was like ""hey do you want to grab lunch?"" 
I had to decline because I had other stuff planned but promised to get back to him later.

A couple of weeks later I asked him to play golf with me and he was like sure. We played golf for an hour and so and then he invited me to his friends place to meet his friends. They were friendly.

I had fun etc and time went by when a week later I asked him to go on a walk with me in the evening, it was like 7 pm. And he was yeah, answered very fast and all. We went on a walk for an hour and just talked, it was flowing so good and never felt stale or awkward.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks and pool. Before I arrived he sent a snap, a selfie of himself with tons of heart emojis. I just thought it was a joke so I didn't think much about it. 

And then two weeks ago he sent me a text telling me to come to a student bar that he works at. I went there and saw him in the bar and we talked a lot and I held him company for a while before I went to a table and talked to some students rest of the night. He texted me and was like ""where did you go?"" And I answered I was at a table with some students.

When the bar was closing and I was going out, Kind of drunk, I saw him, he approached me and put his arm around me and was like go home you're drunk which was funny.

And then the day after, kind of late, it was 11 PM, he texts me again telling me to come to the bar again. I was sleeping so didn't see the text until the morning after so I couldn't come. The week afterwards I asked him if he wanted to hang with me and a friend at the bar. He was like probably if I'm not busy. However some things came up so I had to decline the whole thing unfortunately.

A couple of days ago I put on Facebook that I would attend an event. He wrote to me the same day asking me if I was going to the event. I was like yeah why? He was like can you get me tickets? I was like sure if I can, can't promise anything. And he wrote something like thank you‚ù§Ô∏è with a heart emoji.

I'm going crazy trying to decipher his behavior, is all of this just being a nice guy or is he actually into me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q65aw6/is_he_into_me_or_just_friendly_need_expert_advice/

So quick summary about my situation, I have a crush on a co-worker, we just started talking one week ago, we are going out this week to chill etc.. and hopefully to get to know her more.

As you may have noticed she is older than me, also she was in a 8years relationship and since then she is single.

So when we are going to go out this week, i want to get a bit flirty etc... so i can build up a bit for what i want, because i definitely don't wanna be just a friend.

How can i flirt with her, knowing that we just started talking so i don't look creepy ?

And also, what should i do and donnt as a first meeting with her so i won't blow my chances in one shot ?

81,q65hev,1633985510,Why did she[29F] invite me[29M] for a drink but made out with another guy in front of me?,"tldr; A girl I just started seeing invites me for a drink with her girl friend, her friend brings two guys and my girl makes out with one of them.

I (29M) met this girl (29F) at a live music show last week and we immediately clicked. We also found out we have mutual friends and are from the same city abroad.

I asked her out on a date this past Wed. It went super well and we both had a great time but we but kept it slow (no kissing, little touching).

We've been talking over text everyday since and agreed on going out again, but come Sat evening she told me she was with her girl friend in my neighborhood and that I ""should come and say hi"". So I meet them at the bar and we're drinking, dancing, and getting pretty close. She was telling me how fun I am and that she's liking me.

Her friend told me she had a date coming so I jokingly told her I'd be her wingman. Her date came with his brother, which was unexpected but I had no issues with it at all. So I was getting to know them and I let the brother talk to my date and get to know each other. I also ran into a couple of my friends at the bar. We were all dancing and having a good time. Then after I came back from the bathroom I saw the brother having his arm around my girl at the bar and then they started making out! It was such a shock and I felt SO disrespected and frustrated but didn't show my emotions. I told my friends that I couldn't be there anymore so they just took me to another bar and we left them.

She called about 20 min later and I didn't pick up. No other calls or messages since. We had plans for this upcoming week.

I obviously don't want to pursue her unless she REALLY goes out of her way to justify what happened, but I am just curious to know:

1. why a girl would do something like this given that she was the one inviting me out.
2. Should I confront her about it via call/text or just move on at this point? There's a high chance of us running into each other again due to mutual friends.

83,q65k3a,1633985717,How do you initiate the first kiss?,"So I 20F have been talking to this guy (21M) for about a week now. We‚Äôve went on two date and both of them have been amazing. We can talk with almost no awkward silences, we both have a similar sense of humor, and we‚Äôre both awkward rock nerds. We get along great. 

The thing is like I mentioned were both kind of awkward and all we‚Äôve done so far is hug eachother good bye, and even when we hug I get butterflies in my stomach. It‚Äôs almost a thing where we both like each other a lot and we‚Äôve both been burned by past relationships. So we‚Äôre both pushing past the fear of getting hurt again but then again not wanting to mess anything up. So I‚Äôm very nervous to initiate the first kiss and I can tell he is too. 

So is it like a thing where we just wait for the right moment? Do I ask to kiss him, do I wait for him to ask me? Should it be a goodbye kiss or like a mid date kiss? How long should the first kiss be? Should It be like a quick peck, a few second kiss or should it be longer? 

I‚Äôm sorry for all of the questions but there are just a lot of variable and I don‚Äôt want to make a mistake or make things awkward. I also know that it‚Äôs like a personal preference thing but I would just like to see what has worked for other peoples first kiss.

86,q65vut,1633986569,Does he like me?,"I've (20F) been working in a restaurant for about a month. There's a guy (20M) that I work with. He‚Äôs a friendly guy, but also a bit of a nerd. I consider him a friend. We know a lot about each other, and we've gone through very similar experiences. When we first started working together (he and I started around the same time), I would almost always be the one initiating the conversation. He'd answer, and he always asked me questions back, but he would almost never initiate. So I stopped approaching him. Since I stopped, he‚Äôs been the one coming up to me. Usually, I come into work later than him. When I come in and he's not busy, he‚Äôll immediately come over to my work area and start talking to me, asking me questions about my weekend plans and such. There are even sometimes where he'll come over to me, but he'll stand next to me and won't say anything, so I initiate then. While he‚Äôs on good terms with our other coworkers, he‚Äôll normally only greet them hello when they walk in and that‚Äôs it.He doesn‚Äôt have a conversation with them like he does with me; only about work related things with other workers.

He‚Äôll also help me at work, to the point where he almost goes out of his way to do so. Of course, he‚Äôll help other coworkers as well, but they usually have to ask for his help, and if he does help them voluntarily, it'll usually be when he's not busy. One time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and closed it, forgetting to give the customer their change. I didn‚Äôt have the code to reopen it, and I didn‚Äôt think he had it either, so I was about to make my way to the back to ask another coworker who had more experience. But before I could leave to the back, he stopped what he was doing and walked up to me and asked what happened. I explained to him. He tried to open it, but wasn‚Äôt able to, but he tried even though it was inconvenient for him to do so. Another time, he and I were both at registers helping customers. A customer asked for a beer, and without me asking, he got the beer from the fridge and opened it and bought it to me. I could‚Äôve gotten it myself, and he was busy with another customer, but he helped me anyway. The same day as the customer with the beer, another customer asked for coffee. I was at the coffee maker station trying to fill up the coffee cup. Again, it was busy that time, so there was a line of customers. I tried pouring the coffee, but one of the machines was out of coffee and the other one was wasn't pouring. Even though he was helping package food, he took the coffee makers and transferred the coffees for me so that way I would be able to pour it. Even that in itself took like a good five minutes. Another time, a customer asked for a dressing for her salad, and I had to get it from one of the drawers. The drawers were only a couple of feet away from where I was, so I could've easily have gotten it. He was at the register, but he overheard the woman asking for dressing, so he left the other customer at the register and got the dressing for me.

Another thing that I've noticed is that he'll find little ways to touch me. I don't mind at all. When we work together, sometimes we'll be close to the point that our arms graze each other. While it could be accidental, he doesn't get as close to other coworkers. Another time, it was time for his fifteen minute break, and it was only the manager and I working. As he left to take his fifteen minutes, he lightly tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was going to head out. Another time, I was packaging food, and he told me that a customer wanted a specific dressing for the food. But when he told me this, he whispered in my ear, to the point where he was less than an inch away from me. Not that I mind any of this; he's respectful of boundaries, but I just found it interesting.

Tl;dr - coworker speaks to me more than anyone else. When I come in for my shift, he'll immediately come over to me and start talking, or stand next to me and not say anything. He also helps me at work, without me asking for assistance and when it's not the most convenient for him. He also will make little attempts to (respectfully) touch me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q65vut/does_he_like_me/
87,q65yk4,1633986779,Being insensitive to sexual assaults,"I really appreciate some of you guys advice , but some of you should not be in a Reddit forum giving advice to people on how to date. In the past few weeks I have asked for advice on how to meet men online who were not just interested in sex and how to navigate all the men who are. I explained that I put in my profile ‚Äúseeking a relationship‚Äù and how a lot of men would still try to have sex with me on the first or second date. I‚Äôve explained that I have had to be super careful on dates just to be careful to avoid sexual assaults. And I also explained that I was looking for a guy who doesn‚Äôt engage in casual sex himself and is also looking for a relationship. A few people made suggestions that I go on Christian mingle website. Said I‚Äôd be more likely to find a decent guy on there. 

I followed all your advice . I explain that the first guy I meet off the site shoved his hand down my pants in a public mall where people were walking and driving by. I explain that I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that there are simply a lot of sexual predators and desperate guys out there and some will go to great lengths to prey on women. And that I‚Äôm just giving up on dating. What do some of you do ? You victim blame. One person said that my profile saying ‚Äúseeking a relationship‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough. That I should be saying ‚Äúnot going to have sex for x amount of time‚Äù in capital letters on my profile. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? It is not the men misunderstanding my profile . They don‚Äôt fucking care what I want and think they can manipulate me! They know exactly what I want. At least this has been my experience. How do you not get it ?  Two others were  saying, (I‚Äôm guessing they were men), that if I‚Äôm experiencing things like this so often (another guy shoved his hand down my pants on a date earlier in the year) then I must be doing something to attract these types of men or I must be attracted to these types of men. Are you fucking kidding me? That is your first assumption ? I say on my profile I‚Äôm seeking a relationship, I dress modestly, don‚Äôt take a lot of pictures of myself on social media ,but somehow I‚Äôm attracting men who assault women or just want women for sex? 

I just want a regular guy who treats me with respect, is honest with integrity, isn‚Äôt a bum, has goals, is funny and intelligent. What part of that does it sound from this post that I‚Äôm attracted to men who treat women like shit? Did you ever think that your wearing a pair of blinders all the time and your completely oblivious to the other option, that maybe it‚Äôs difficult to navigate dating as a nice and attractive woman and that men can sometimes try take advantage of you? That there are tons of sexual predators out there? I suggest that some of you go online to your local sex registry where you can see how many sexual predators there are around you . These are the ones who have gotten CAUGHT. Both times I was assaulted the guy did  not get arrested because I know from experience, unless someone witnessed it or recorded it or you have bruises on you , etc, chances are the guy is going to get away with it. There is basically no point in even reporting assaults that don‚Äôt fit that category. 

1 in 4 women are sexually assaulted at least once in their lifetimes, again these are the assaults that women are reporting. They don‚Äôt represent reality, the numbers are thought to be much higher. Even that is a lot. Some of you really disgust me with your comments and I hope that this post was at least educational so you can be more educated about these things and not blame victims for predators behavior.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q65yk4/being_insensitive_to_sexual_assaults/

90,q665lh,1633987333,Can a lapsus be a hint about what a person can feel towards you? (Or is it a pseudo-psychology bullshit?)," Okay, here's the situation.

I'm a 25M, every month I go to the same barbershop and I got accustomed to choose the same barber who's a 25yo or so woman (who I think is attractive). It's been a couple of years now that I'm her customer and I know for sure that she's single. I know that because I'm following her on Insta and she's following me back and there hasn't been any post or story that can let me think that she's dating someone (I might be wrong but I consider that there's a slight chance that I am).

A few days ago I went at my barber to get my hair and my beard done. When I sit on the chair, instead of asking me ""What do we do today?"", she asks me ""What do we do tonight?"". When she realizes what her question implied, she started to have a laugh alongside one of her coworkers and seeing the chance to tease her a little bit with her lapsus I then said: ""We can do whatever you want"". After my answer we all shared a good laugh and then the rest of my appointment was going like every time: we were talking about different subjects, I got updates on her life, she got updates on mine and that's it. The only noticeable thing that happened was when I was saying everyone goodbye, her coworker teased me by replying: ""And have a good evening!"".

I'm not that good at dating nor am I good at seeing the ""small details or signals"" that women can show when they feel attracted towards you. Should I consider that her lapsus revealed something at that moment? What should be my next move, next time? I feel really attracted to her and I'd like to know her more. But I'm a little bit shy and I don't want the next appointments to become awkward because I got rejected when asking her out. I'm introvert and finding a barber with whom I feel comfortable is difficult for me so I don't want to ruin that.

I'm also curious to know if any of you M/F have ever taken advantage on a lapsus to take things to the next stage?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q665lh/can_a_lapsus_be_a_hint_about_what_a_person_can/

When we first started working together, I noticed that he would always stare at me. As in we were in a crowded room standing on opposite sides of it, and I caught him glancing at me and then he looked quickly away. I definitely have seen that look before and know it means a sign of interest/attraction. The other time is when we were in the hallway and there was no one around and he was leaning against a door just staring at me for about a minute. It actually made me a little bit uncomfortable so I kept walking. Ever since then I sometimes catch him glancing at me and we lock eyes out of the corner of our eyes. He also looks me up and down a lot. My friend recently confirmed to me that she saw him starting at me at work and then they made awkward eye contact because she ""caught,"" him looking at me and he looked away. Sometimes I feel like he tries to act ""cool,"" around me/ he can be hard to approach mostly because the staring is so intense. I just don't understand it-- why not ask me out or stop staring? I've noticed at meetings he'll sometimes talk to other people and not me when we have to work together. It's just so weird.

During the first two weeks of school he was in my room and we were venting/talking and he told me that he was single.

We were intimate almost daily and sometimes multiple times a day. But after I moved in (a year into our relationship), sex started to significantly decline. Now it‚Äôs pretty obvious that he doesn‚Äôt want to have sex at all. I‚Äôve communicated my concern many times. I‚Äôve poured my heart out about how it makes me feel and what I need from him etc. But not much has changed. 

He‚Äôs given me different reasons like work related stress, his self esteem, how he hates how he looks etc. But I don‚Äôt know what I can even do. It got so bad that I initiated 99% of the time. And even then I got rejected often and we had sex maybe a few times a month. After I brought up how I did most of the initiating, he stepped it up a little and initiated a few times as of late and finally didn‚Äôt act like sex was a chore. All of this makes me feel horrible. I feel unwanted. I feel awful for having to beg for sex now being only 26 years old and together for only 2 years. I‚Äôm starting to grow a lot of resentment and it just makes me feel awful about myself. 

I know my bf brought up his self confidence and body image as potential contributing factors but I don‚Äôt understand how this even came to be. Yes, he‚Äôs a lot heavier than average but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs changed a ton since we got together and I‚Äôve always given him compliments. I also  tell him how sexy he is when we‚Äôre in the bedroom and I do mean it. This has not changed since we got together.  Work related stress isn‚Äôt an issue anymore bc he has a new job. 

Idk what else to do.  I‚Äôm feeling so so desperate and sad and frustrated that sex is even an issue now. I‚Äôve done my part in trying to communicate this to him and being patient but this problem has persisted for almost a year now and it makes me really bitter. I‚Äôm human I have needs and it makes me want to reach out to guys I know would fuck me in a second to get my needs met. I never thought u would be a cheater. That was my #1 dealbreaker but here I am. I keep thinking I could justify it by knowing I‚Äôve done everything I could to communicate this issue and my partner still wont give me what i need. I know many of you will suggest breaking up. But it just seems so sad to end a good thing over sex. Why does it matter if I sleep with other ppl if my partner doesn‚Äôt want to do that with me? He‚Äôs actually the one and only person I want to sleep with.  But he‚Äôs not even merely interested.  So now as a human with needs, I gotta get my needs met somewhere‚Ä¶..please help.

Our first 1-hour date went quite well and she even initiated the second date shortly after our first date.  (Which surprised me)  

On our second date, everything seem to be going ok, but towards the 2 hours and a half mark, she said she's tired and wanted to go home.  She seemed kinda annoyed but always smiled.  I thought to myself, yeah, maybe we spent together a bit too long and tried to brush it off.

(I noticed her texting started to taking much longer to respond)

Prior to our third date, she sent a text saying we can grab drinks after our date of mini golf since she'll be up all night and she cares for me with a kissy emoji.  After we finished I asked if she wanted to go grab some drinks and she hits me with the same ""I think I'm going to head home, I'm tired""...  I asked her if I can come along and she said ""what! noooo"" with a happily disgusted face and when I walked to her car, she hugged me and said bye and left.

Keep in mind, I never did the typical push pull, banter, sexual innuendo.  I mainly focused on physical attraction (hugging, shoulder touching, knee touch, smiling, eye look) I was mainly acting like a gentleman towards her so she can feel comfortable around me and kept our conversation about learning about one another.

I‚Äôd like to hear from anyone who has personal experience or in similar situations like these. Feedback or comments Would be appreciated :-) I‚Äôll get all the help to prepare for this change",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q66xxs/moving_in_with_partner/
99,q673qq,1633990042,Putting More Efforts in a Relationship,"So I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19 F) for around 4 months now. It's going great. She was the one who confessed she has a crush on me. We started meeting and eventually the feeling became mutual.

However, in the past few days, I've noticed a change in behaviour. Tbh, in the start of the relationship, I wasn't invested, so I didn't talk much. Over time, with frequent meetings, I started getting attached.

Now I started noticing I'm the one putting more efforts. I don't consider it a competition and expect her to do the same things just because I did, but the feeling of being made feel special sometimes is nice.

Today I could sense her mood was off a bit from her texts. We spoke and she told me to call at night. I called and her phone was off. A few mins later she texted, she's going to sleep. I called her. We spoke and I had to ask her ""Is something wrong"", after a few mins she replied ""She overthinked and started feeling whether I'm serious in the relationship""

This was a shocker to me, because if anything, I'm the more expressive one in the relationship. I tell her about wanting to meet her, how special she makes me feel whereas she doesn't express much. So for her to doubt whether I'm serious was weird.

Then she told me that someone told her (she didn't take the name) that ""your boyfriend is too nice and if he's nice, he's hiding something"".

Now I understand the difference between being too nice and being a pushover. I don't bend over backwards. I have a rich social life, I call her maximum once and don't bug her if she doesn't wanna talk or do anything which gives away a pushover vibe.

I'm really confused on how to proceed. I've been in relationships before (both serious and casual), whereas for her, it's her first relationship (including first kiss). I need my own space and respect other people's space, but to being hated on the fact that I am too nice or notice changes in my SO's mood was weird to me. It made me sort of get out of the ""my girlfriend is great"" zone to somewhere ""meh it might just not last"".

Am I overthinking or do I just start playing hard to get?

Tl:dr:- Girlfriend had a crush on me, asked me out and we started dating. I didn't put efforts intiiallly but when I started doing it, I feel she takes me for granted",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q673qq/putting_more_efforts_in_a_relationship/
