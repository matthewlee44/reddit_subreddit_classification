The sex is incredible and we have an amazing time when we get together. She also feels the same way. The thing is, she is very loud in bed and doesn’t have any restraints about that.   
The past week we had sex two times and both times she was moaning and groaning like we were on another planet and there was no one nearby. Don’t get me wrong, I find it extremely hot. But my neighbors don’t. My building has very thin walls and I know that my neighbors can definitely hear us. The first time this happened, my neighbor politely told me to keep it down. And that’s just my neighbor in the adjacent apartment. I’m pretty sure with the way she was moaning that the apartments above and below mine could hear us as well. Although I have been lucky enough not to bump into the people living in those apartments, I would rather that they not be disturbed. The second time, during the first round of sex, I gently told her to keep it down. During Doggy, she pushed her face into the pillow and that seemed to work for the time being. But then during the subsequent rounds, she told me that she was not going to bother with restraining herself. She told me that she was gonna enjoy herself to the fullest and my neighbors can go to hell. It was mid-coitus and I was thinking with my penis, so I said okay. Then we continued with our sex and I’m pretty sure the entire street heard her moans. I also know that after we both finished, I could hear my neighbor open the door and go out. I’m afraid he had enough of the noise and had to step out.  
What can I do to let her know that while I love her moaning, I don't want to disturb my neighbors? I like my neighbor and he tries to keep it down while playing music or having friends over so that he doesn't disturb me. I’m just trying to return the favor. But I’m afraid if I tell her once more, she might think that I’m telling her not to enjoy sex or that I don’t find her moans sexy. It seems like right now the only option is soundproofing my bedroom :)

we rescheduled our call to another day. she comes on call and only talks about her work. doest want to know anything about me other than my work. i get uninterested responses when i bring up other topics like friends, hobbies, family, etc. she then puts me on hold midway through our call to text a friend who needed her advise on interviewing for a job. at the end of the call she proceeded to let me know her expectations on “courtship and marriage”. she wants a 1yr courtship followed by marriage. 

we agree to meet in person on a weekend afternoon. she cancels 2hrs before our meetup, excuse was she was tired from working all night the day before and needed to sleep. FYI shes in a 9-5 type profession so this to me sounds a bit abnormal.

Hi! Some background: I’m an 18 year old female who goes to a college 2 hours away from this place. The guy I like is 19 years old and doesn’t go to college. So I have this coworker, and I’ve liked him for some time (about 1 year). We both work at a gym and we tend to spend some time together. During my last month of work (I was leaving for college) we started getting closer. 

There was this one employee who showed interest  in me and asked me to spot him while he was lifting. My crush who was also lifting during the time with someone else said he could spot the dude instead. I don’t know if he was just being kind or if he was kind of jealous. 

Then, during one of his shifts, I had about an hour until I took over so I just hung out behind the front desk with him. We talked a lot and at the end he said it was really nice having someone there to hangout with. 

During my last week of work, he gave me all his shifts during the week (I asked if he had any shifts he wanted covered and he gave me them all). During that week, he came to the gym every day during the times I worked. 

So it’s been a bit since I’ve seen him and I asked if he wanted to go to the gym during a time I was going to be there with some others. He said he “definitely will!”

I could really use some help to figure out if he likes me. If I can determine that he does like me, I think I can muster up the courage to flirt more or to ask him out. What do you guys think?

So met in January. Married by December. I know a lot of religious people get marries super quick, especially when they are ""saving themselves for marriage"" 
But isn't it still too quick? 

The groom is a super flamboyant, which everyone thought he's gay. And the whole wedding, it's all about the groom. The bride didn't get to speak much. The bride's family didn't get to do speech. Their wedding video is almost all on the groom. Even the bridal party only had 2 of the bride's friends out of the party of 10. 
A lot of focus on man of the household, woman follow and do as her told. 

I just feel like my very very smitten friend just basically wanted to chase this boy (potentially gay or bi, who knows) so much that she gave up herself and personality to be with him.

In the first month, I got a pretty good job offer in another state and I brought this up on my date. I accepted the offer because it was the best career move for me. The only reason I continued seeing him was because he said he could be convinced to move depending on how the relationship goes,  and he was open to long distance relationships and that he could even work from home in my new place (he gave me signs his job was flexible). We continued to date and I started to develop feelings because we really connect (I think we do). Today, I asked him how he was feeling about the move and the relationship and he completely turned tables. He said he was dating me hoping I would decide not to move, asked me if there were other places I could be open to moving to other than the state I’m currently moving to. I was firm in that, I can only see the immediate future and that is me moving for my new job. I then asked him what he thought our plan was to which he said “we can continue to date till you move but after that this relationship won’t work logistically”. I’m so sad because, if he wasn’t convinced by our connection or relationship he could have brought it up earlier or just stated that, before I started to develop feelings. The truth hurts but is easier to deal with. I’m upset that if I hadn’t brought this up at all, he would have probably just told me this the week before I moved (I’m convinced of this because he said he wanted to avoid this conversation), which would have really caused a breakdown the week before I started my new life. 
I’m sad, hurt and not feeling hopeful. I can accept I wasn’t enough or that we didn’t connect for a relationship, but somehow the way and timing of the conversation leaves me so sad that, I’m not feeling too hopeful. 
Dating is hard.

I know it's absurd, but I got that tendency to fall in love with a person I just meet on the internet. Especially when they make me feel special. It happened to me! So I am stopping this before it affects my well-being, well, it's actually already affecting me quite a bit.

I am this kind of person who's focused on talking to one guy at a time and I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to meet that guy ""who is capable of being with me"" if we continue talking.

I'm so sorry! I'm super sad to let you go, I'm sad that I am not gonna be able to talk to you again, but I think it's for the better! ❤

Always remember that I believe in you and I am gonna be happy for every small progress you make. You are gonna change, you are gonna make your life better, you are gonna have your own happy family! And that's what is gonna keep you going. Take a risk and be with someone whom you feel is worth the risk.

I really enjoyed the moments we've shared virtually! 😍

No, I am not trying to distort the truth. This is the truth. I like you but I don't see this thing going anywhere. and I need to take care of myself. especially my heart. 😊

I met my current girlfriend on a young age [F16] and me [M17], almost 18, i’m now 29 years old. We are still together till this day and i love her deeply. Our problems started around 3 years ago with small fights about that i’m to busy, i’m always away and don’t text much, i’m not doing this on purpose, it’s because of my work. The problem is that she is always at home, she doesn’t work, has no hobby’s, not a lot of friends to hang out with and if she’s interested to learn a new study she always says “i think i start with this new study” but in the end she never does while i encourage her and want to pay for the study. She is always waithing till she finally sees me. I mean if you are busy you have no time to wait for my response or to see me, right. Now don’t get me wrong, she is very beautiful, sweet, she is caring and is a very good person who loves me more than anything. The fights got worse with time and years and this got even worse when she got pregnant and lost our child after 3/4 months. She got depressed and cried almost everyday and made our fights even worse and intense. It created a distance between us, but in a very strange way because you would think, Oo distance then our love is over? No, she still loves me deeply and i still loves her deeply but i just could not see her anymore or hear her voice, whenever i heard her voice like when she said my name my mind was ready for a fight and i was thinking “What is going on now again?”. Now we get to the point where my fault begins. I was on Facebook and i just randomly sended a friend request to a goodlooking girl [F26] and she accepted it, after a few days i thought why not and i sended her a message how she’s doing and she replied, and after some texts i got her number and we continued on Whatsapp, we talked for hours that day and the connection and vibe was strangely good, i mean i texted and had conversations with different girls (not in flirty way) but it never felt so good with them as with her. In the back of my mind i knew this was wrong but i continued. She had a 10 year relationship and was now a year and half single, she had a bad relationship where this guy beated her, she got pregnant but lost her baby at birth (6 months). Her baby was the reason why she kept going for so long with her previous relationship, even while he beated her. Now, it felt for her extremely good to and while she never would meet a strange guy she met on Facebook, she wanted to see me because of our extremely good vibe, and we met. We had a great day and we had sex on the first date, and i’m now seeing her for 3 months. Met her bestfriends and her mother and i slept for the first time in her bed after 3 months (at her mother’s house), she told me she would never just bring a guy into her room because she has her baby’s toys and bears in her room, she would not just bring random guys into her room, if she takes someone into her room then that guy is special to her, so i mean a lot to her. While i never officially ended my current relationship it feels like if it ended already. She doesn’t know that i’m still in a relationship but i didn’t see my girlfriend now for almost month and a half because of our fights. I know, this is not good and i’m saying this to myself aswell but i just don’t know what to do with this situation. Some of my friends say “It’s your girlfriends own fault, she keeps fighting you” But still this is no reason to cheat on her, i had to end the relationship before i texted this girl, but it happened now, can’t turn back time. I have now 2 voices in my head, 1 says that i need to end my current relationship and then continue with this new girl (without) getting immediately a relationship with her, i would wait and see what would happen between her and me so no rushing. And 2, leave this new girl, you only know her for 3 months, you want to trow a 11/12 years relationship away for this girl? You know, i’m scared loosing my current relationship of almost 12 years, because i still love her deeply and i’m scared to live without her because i’m so used to be around her, we have been trough a lot together, but on the other side it feels like i’m trowing away not only my life but also her life if we continue living like this with all the fights. I know cheating is VERY wrong and i never cheated on her ever before in these 12 years, i’m normally not the guy who cheats, i really don’t understand it myself. Advice me guys what to do and please, just be nice because i know i’m wrong to .. Not only for her but also the new girl who i just met because i didn’t told her about my situation while she is in love with me now. You know, mayby my current relationship was already over after those years of fighting and it’s better to let go and continue with this new girl and tell her the truth or telling not the truth? Because we are not in a relationship. Or mayby end both and live without any girl for the first few months? Or end it with this new girl and try it again with my current relationship, it’s very hard to explain but i know it’s not healthy to continue with my current relationship when we have fights like we have now but i’m affraid to loose her, to live without her because i’m so used to live with her all these years already, good times, bad times, holidays together, lost our baby and more, and she’s telling me she can’t live without me. These are the questions i’m dealing with because either way, i will hurt one of the two … I’m normally not the guy who cheats, 1 thing i’ve learned now is that when the relationship is going bad for so long it’s better to take a break or end it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132603,public,self,Advice for being a bad lover and person,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r90r4x/advice_for_being_a_bad_lover_and_person/,no_ads,0.0,no_ads,0.0,,

He seemed to be curious about my life a lot, asking a lot of questions about how my childhood was, my family, friends. I also asked him questions too. When he got back from a 10 minute bathroom break…. (Bit strange but I guess it was a busy bar and I think he had to pay for the drinks we were getting sent to our table all night) He said he realised he has to work in the morning. I told him I did too, I felt abit weird because I know guys sometimes use this as an excuse to get out of the date but I just thought, whatever at this point I’m happy to go home. We did end up still talking for another 30 minutes with him directing the conversation because I didn’t want him to feel like I was holding him there. Anyway it was about 12am and we went for a walk so he could come with me to get an Uber. We laughed a lot then hugged goodbye and i thanked him for paying for the drinks. 

After about 2 minutes of getting into my Uber he messaged me “goodnight *my name* 😘😘” 

With the kissy faces? Yet he didn’t even attempt to kiss me at all haha.

I just replied goodnight it was nice to finally meet you 🥰 and replied it was cool to after all these years.

Anyway now I’m just confused. I was just accepting that I wouldn’t hear from him but he messaged me right away? Now I’m confused.

So, after chatting online for a few weeks, I went on a first date the other day at a nice bar for dinner and drinks.  The girl was amazing: ridiculously cute, lots of similar interests, music tastes, and opinions.  We had banter going and it seemed like things were going great.  

After a while, we leave the bar, hug, and say ""we should do this again soon"".  I left kicking myself for not asking if she wanted to continue at another place or walk and talk, but really looking forward to the second date. 

Theeeeen the next day I get the message saying they didn't feel the connection they were looking for.  Completely fair and understandable, but I do feel bummed out and tbh a bit blindsided as I thought we had a great connection. It's kind of got me questioning what constitutes a good date and overanalyzing the date in my head to see where it went wrong.

I realized that there are things I could have done a bit ""better"" or differently (man am I terrible/awkward at the ""goodbye"" part of the date haha), but then again it could have just been my general vibe or (most likely) me in general, which is okay.  Not every person is for every person, and I guess I am happy she realized she wasn't feeling it and ended things early on before any feelings or emotions developed.

So my(F) boyfriend since about a year broke up with me after a stupid fight. We are quite different and have a tendency to misunderstand each other on small things. It’s obviously rooted in insecurities but that’s for another thread. While arguing he just said he’s done having these fights over and over again and wanted to break up. I could see his entire face and body shut down and it was as if he’d never cared about me. I didn’t want it to end and cried my eyes out, packed my things and left. During the past month I’ve tried my level best to explain and “convince” him that we can work out and that there can be a change is we work on it together but he’s not having it. Of course I understand that convincing is not the way to go and I should probably just move on. But we’ve gone back and forth a lot and he finally said he’s too unstable to give it another try. He’s bipolar and struggles with anxiety. He has a very unhealthy habit (imo) with alcohol and after an incident which affected us both he decided that he was going to quit. I supported him and asked him if he’s committed to it. He said he was and that he relates the effect it has given the medicines he takes and that it also was for the sake of our relationship but I know that somewhere he also did it for my sake because he knew where I stand on that point. He was sober for about 5 months but after a fight which almost broke us up, he said we can give it another try but he’ll go to his friend and drink. I broke down and begged him to not do it. He felt bad and decided not to go. After that we kept on arguing about petty things and finally I told him that I will let him be after he got mad about the texting and me wanting to talk. He then started saying he misses me, that I’m good for him, I make him a better person, we have a lot of fun together etc and was afraid that he is making the biggest mistake of his life. He said that he’s a broken person and mentally unstable so he’s scared. 

I told him that he wanted time to understand if he’s ready to give it another try so take the time, I’m not going anywhere. He then said that I’m right? He needs time and that he knows that he’s not good for me either. He said that he doesn’t want me to wait for him to heal or get better but that if and when he does he will always try to come back to me.  He has repeated this several times. He then stopped messaging me, taking my calls and blocked me on Instagram. 

It’s now been a month since we broke up and during this time he’s started drinking heavily, smoking (which he also quit when he met me) he’s on tinder and yesterday I saw him go home with another girl, probably not the first one either.

I have been using this time to heal and see where I can become better with my shortcomings but the way he’s handling this, will he ever come back? Even if he does I don’t know if I’m okay with him being with other girls during this time.

Just situationships that I thought would be something real. Never been in love.

I’ve been talking to the same guy (23M) since 2019 and we only been in talking stage because I am apparently inconsistent &amp; inconsiderate. Mostly due to my poor communication skills. Things were never this hard for me with past guys. 

I believe he just makes me nervous and we haven’t fully connected. Whenever he raises his voice, (while expressing his discontent regarding something I did if he thinks it’s simplistic and I’m not yet getting where he’s coming from), I shut down bc I don’t want to say nothing that’ll sound dumb to him. I often don’t have much to say after he will rant and expect a thorough response, (as he and anyone else would). I have a hard time being direct with him bc of what he might say or think of me. (But rn we’re long distance which made it harder).  

I don’t feel that close to him bc of how things ran since after the beginning, (1st night we met.), but I like him and I would love to see something real between us because he does want me and he goes into detail when he’s upset about my actions and explains how he’s tired of us having these same convos. I mean I am too. He’s a good person at heart and he brings me adventures. 

1. How can I strengthen my communication? 
2. What are actions of love and care that I can show him that most men would appreciate. 
3. How can I make him feel comfortable enough to express his entire self with me? 
4. How do I conduct a real relationship?

I know you’d think by now we’d be very close but it didn’t workout that way. I’m very in like with him and don’t want to continue this same stuff next year or in the future.

i feel very scared to open up about these feelings, as i am not very open about my emotions. the part of me that is terrified is if this ruins the friendship, because first and foremost i still want the friendship intact. but i have also always been truthful and upfront with her on everything and i feel i owe it to her to know what's up.

His profile really does make him seem perfect for me. There’s some humor in it that’s right up my alley and we have a lot of common interests. It became clear from my first time meeting the guy that he was a bit socially awkward and he never really attempted to be the one to break the awkward silences. When he loosens up a bit because he’s laughing at something or making a small joke, I can see the personality from the profile that had me interested in the first place. I have no problem holding out and having patience with him and seeing how the dynamic changes as he gets more comfortable with me and vice versa. Heck, I’m more than a bit shy myself, so I don’t mind awkward silences all that much. 

BUT this guy is a little insufferable over text. Just kind of stale for one thing. He’s asked me how my day was almost every day that we’ve texted. And hey, that’s nice and all, but it makes for some very crappy conversation. Not only that, he’s typed it the exact same way FIVE times in TWO weeks. “So, how was your day?” That exactly.

That was less than ideal, sure. The kicker came the other day when I sent him a message about something I did at work that day and he said something about how he realized he’d never asked where I worked before. I saw the notification but didn’t open the text to reply since I was a bit busy and about to drive. When I still hadn’t texted him an hour and a half later, I got a text saying “where do you work?”

(Ignoring the potential privacy aspect entirely, I know some people might be considering that right now but I’m separating it from the issue since I’d refuse to answer the question if uncomfortable) What the hell. He did text me after he already had when I didn’t reply a few times before, but never anything like “hello?” or asking why I was ignoring him so it wasn’t too big of a deal.

So I moved from a mid-sized city (500k) ppl to Montreal last year. I’ve spent 1.5 years here, and 3 months out of heavy covid restrictions. Since school started, I’ve been flirtatious with women, and I’ve asked quite a few women out on dates. None of them say yes:/ I’ve been on two dates in this city in almost 2 years.

Now, you might be thinking “this guy just doesn’t have game” and that is where I disagree! I was quite popular in my hometown, and, not to brag , but I had beautiful women ask ME on dates in high school! Even now, whenever I go back home I get messages from really cute girls I used to know asking me out. I must admit though, my hometown has a reputation for being trashy, and in my experience a lot of the guys weren’t really catches. Now that I’m in Montreal, it’s like women don’t even look at me. What’s going on? The only thing I can think of is back in high school I was really into “hookup culture” and now I’m looking for a longer term relationship, but it’s not like I articulated that back then or now. Or, back in my hometown it’s slim pickings with guys, and in Montreal I’m just an average joe.

I’m not sure what’s going on, and it’s been getting me discouraged. Any help or insight you guys could provide would help a lot.

My story:
I had recently turned 18 and I was still a virgin! Why was I a virgin? Because I didn’t really have an emotional connection with any of the guys that dated in high school and they were all VERY immature!
2 weeks after my 18th birthday, a very attractive 21 year old asked me out and I agreed to go on a date with him. He seemed very mature and I liked him a lot! 

2-3 hours before the date I started getting nervous because I was a virgin and I knew he had a lot more “experience”!
So I thought I should “learn” how to do stuff…. 
So I decided to go on p0rnhvb to try and learn how do everything step by step. I watched some videos for “educational” purposes and I learned as much as I could. I got ready and went on the date! 
We went to one of his friends parties, I had a few shots and I was kinda drunk. He asked me if I wanted to go somewhere to be alone (he was sober) and I said sure! Long story short we went to a river and talked there! Then I suddenly felt sick and threw up in the middle of nowhere… he held my hair and after I was done he gave me water and gum… (not the embarrassing part)
We went to his car and we were in the backseat. We made out and he suddenly whipped out his eggplant and after 30 minutes I was not no longer a virgin…
When we were done he realized that there’s blood on the c0nd0m, his hands on the seats.. I was very embarrassed and kept saying sorry but we cleaned it up. (Sadly still not the embarrassing part)
After we got dressed and cleaned everything up, we were talking and he asked me something and I went on google to show him something. I opened safari and the tab was still on the p0rnhvb page. It was paused on a very graphic moment. I shut off my phone and i nearly had a heart attack, my body felt stuck, i turned my head and looked at him with my eyes wide open. I asked him “did you see-“ and he said “that you were on pornhub watching a video? Yes i did! Wow I did not expect that from you” I put both my hands on my face and I said “noooo no it’s not what you you think” and he said “then what is it? Were you musterbating before our date?” And I said “no!! I wasn’t!! I was watching it for educational purposes. I was trying to learn something very specific.” he laughed and said “you were watching that video for educational purposes? Did it educate you? What were you trying to learn?” I said “I can’t tell you what I was trying to learn but please please forget what just happened” and he said “its okay but from now on if you wanna learn anything I can teach you!” And he winked. I shook my head and I felt dumb for not closing the tab. 

We dated for 6 months after that and he would bring up the fact that I was watching a p0rn video for “educational purposes” as many times as he could during those 6 months!

Hi using a throwaway so no one I know see this.

I’ll admit, I am insecure about my lack of dating experience. I’m 19m and I have never kissed a girl, held hands or done anything of that sort. I am a fairly sociable person and I have no problem talking to girls. I would also consider myself an attractive person too.

However, I feel very left behind about the fact that I have never done anything with a girl before.What would a girl think if they found out a man has absolutely no experience. I’m pretty sure that is a turn off to most women.

How do I overcome this? Every girl I meet has a boyfriend or they just aren’t my type.

This is where strangers on the internet will bring up confidence and working out. Started weight training at 14 and until my mid thirties when laziness took over had a visible 6 pack and lots of muscle, I was confident that despite my laid back nature I could kick the ass of most everyone I came across, but also fully confident that I would still be going home alone after. Despite that laziness mentioned earlier, I am back to working out, 20lbs lockdown weight gone and probably 5 more to go for my own preferred size. You know what being not just in shape but better than most got me, nothing, do that for yourself, if your ugly then no one will care how defined you are.

You have got to get out there and be seen, now here I am supposed to say I don't like bars an such, introvert, netflix, etc... Sorry I like bars, and at least when you are younger if you are in really good shape, you burn those alcohol calories like it's nothing so enjoy that while it lasts. But yeah, bars, clubs, concerts, art shows, parties, parks, beaches, social gatherings of all kinds. Hundreds and hundreds of opportunities to meet thousands of women and not once has it gone far enough for my personality to shoulder some of the responsibility for turning them off.

Get some hobbies and interests. Have plenty, those aren't a problem, but the people in your life interrupting them to inquire why you still aren't with somebody and then treating you like your brain is broken are. Covid comes and so make the leap and try OLD. Do the research, multiple apps, multiple bio rewrites, take and narrow down from hundreds (not an exaggeration) of photos. More than a year later not a single like. Through the miracle of modern tech I have been rejected en masse by every single and looking woman in my age range, in a large urban area within a hundred mile radius. All without having to leave the comfort of my home.

 Some of us are just ugly, we have tried and failed, I have never chased models, my only dealbreakers were that she is not currently in jail and that she is not an IV drug user. Obese, pregnant single mother, currently treating an STD but not treating her diagnosed mental health issues, I would say bring her on but that is someone who already turned me down and wasn't nice about it either. People want to be with people that they are attracted to. If you have someone in your life that you can see is ugly and they are always getting rejected and therefore they figure it out that they are ugly, then let them be ugly. Don't send them off on missions to improve this or that thing making them think that if they grind out enough XP they will be more acceptable.
