• cringes at affection (19M was being sweet and touchy, and I was just not feeling it??);

• nice guy overall, sweet, and touchy;
• extroverted;
• has much more experience/knowledge in romantic relationships than me;
• recently broke up with his two-year (ex-)girlfriend about four months ago because she cheated;
• tells me he has moved on and wants to pursue me;
• isn’t fully healed, I think; and
• a bit possessive over me and already somehow committed even though we aren’t officially together (he already said ""I love you"" numerous times and calls me pet names like ""baby"")


NOTE: We were both raised in a conservative family and country. Dialogue is non-verbatim.


Moving on with the story. After meeting him at our designated meeting place, I brought him to my house, let him meet my parents, talked for a little bit, had lunch, went to the mall together, and came back again to my house since there isn’t really much to do at the mall. Since we share our love for video games, we played for a little bit, and after that, proceeded to eat pancakes my mom prepared for us. 

So, we (just him and I) were at the dinner table, which was circle-shaped, and we were sitting next to each other. I set up my phone against a makeshift stand and decided to watch Netflix because I couldn’t handle talking and eye contact anymore. Everything was fine for the first few minutes; we were eating, watching, but there’s still a bit of talking here and there. He was the one usually initiating it, and I either just listen or hum in agreement. Then after eating, I notice he keeps on staring at me now and then. I act like I don’t notice it, but it goes on throughout the entirety of the film, and mind you, it’s quite weird for me. I don’t know why. Yes, I’m aware that when a person likes someone, they LOOK at them with adoration or STEAL GLANCES at them, but him, he just flat out stares at me, and that’s what I find unusual, I guess. “Like, dude. Watch the film, not me!” is what I want to tell him.

Eventually, I grew uncomfortable because he wasn’t even trying to be subtle. I nudged his knee with mine playfully and said, “Hey, keep your eyes on the film.”

He replied, “Sorry. This is my first time seeing you, and I just can’t believe it. I want to make sure I memorize your face because after this, I won’t be seeing you again sooner or later since y’know… college and all that.”

I don’t reply anymore because I don’t know what else to say, so I let him do his thing. Moreover, he also asks me for my hand, to which I impassively and hesitantly give, because he wants to “see how smooth it is,” “measure mine with his,” or just simply “look at it.” Yeah, right, bud. I know he wants to hold my hand, but I already told him, even way before we met, that I want to take things very slow. I only want us to be friends for the time being while also slightly considering us being together because he’s a really nice guy. It would be such a shame to waste an opportunity to be with someone like that. Also, while my elbow was on the table, propping up my chin, he was rubbing circles on my arm. Yes, I know these are just simple actions, but being raised in a conservative household makes me uncomfortable about these gestures of affection. 

I need your advice. I already asked my friend, and they simply said, “Oh, silly you. He just really likes you is all! No need to look into it so much.” Yeah, I know he likes me, but is the staring, hand-holding, rubbing circles on my arm, and other sweet gestures typical for friends who only just met?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160350,public,self,"I, 19F, met with my 19M four-year internet FRIEND (who admitted that he has feelings for me way before we even met)",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sxmmk9/i_19f_met_with_my_19m_fouryear_internet_friend/,no_ads,0,dating,,,,,

If you were going to start dating someone or if you already are dating, would social media make you feel insecure at all? This probably sounds ridiculous but, I can’t stand the way social media is used now- it can be toxic IMO. If a man I’m interested in is following 1,000+ half nude models, women with hardly anything covered, it’s a total turn off for me. Obviously there are many different opinions, lots say they don’t mind- they can look but not touch. I feel like it’s a *little* disrespectful, even for men or women that aren’t very insecure. To me I think of it like, he sees the photo of a beautiful woman but that’s almost like p0Rn because of the fact they aren’t wearing much and he “likes it”. Could you imagine if you SO was just constantly walking around with you and seeing anyone he finds attractive/ sexy and telling you that out loud? “Wow I really like her chest, she’s got an amazing butt, I’d like to see her dancing half naked. *most* people wouldn’t do that, obviously. So why is it okay to do similar online? It’s ridiculously hard to not compare because most of them don’t look anything like me.

I'm scared to find it all amazing impressive and not relatable .. i write this with a lot of burden over my chest..So 

I'm a 26(M) from India , definitely a introvert and I have anxiety which creeps up during a lot of defining moments and I think my self esteem has taken a hit

I've had girls in my life .. many fond memories and while I was with them I had no and not a single inhibition to do anything that needs to be done .. but the difference is it was them who took a interest in knowing me and discovered I'm humourous and romantic and all things good .. my last girlfriend went on to say (with tears) that she never thought she would ever feel this kind of pleasure or body could feels so much pleasure . While amidst a relation I was fine .. *what seems to be my unrequited desire and a problem is i can't start or initiate a conversation*  ... Like in movies Ryan gosling walking up to a girl saying his name sweeping her off the floor and get Outta tht door that kinda stuff .. all i can't figure out is how do I get her to talk to me ... 

Eg here , i go for my morning workout and see a beautiful girl also working out and we exchange glances and thats it .. I'm stuck .. i keep watching watching and watching till she thinks I'm a creep or gets a hint of my inadequate confidence and sm other guy walks up to her and does the job and they walk off infront of my eyes 
And I console myself saying he was more handsome attractive than me .. and all those good qualities to be ..but In reality .. I feel a paralyzing pain within thinking of getting up and saying smthng to her

My strange assumption is .. that when I walk up to her .. her reaction would totally be ...ewww what the fuck who are you ..😂😂 .....
Or call up ppl telling i tried to harass her and All these thoughts ruin any kind of courage that I got

Have read numerous dating books watched podcasts but nothing giving me the push .. i can't think a girl who goes to temple can also be a girl who enjoys sex ofcourse (due to the prolonged society stigma towards sex and sacredness of woman) and this is messing up my beliefs .. 

I now feel I might never be able to end this misery and Introducing my self to a attractive woman would forever be a dream

I'm 28 and somewhat romantically/sexually inexperienced due to a combination of introversion, shyness and not learning acceptance for my abberant personality type until later in my life.

Much to my surprise, ever since gradually coming out of my hermetic lifestyle I've been getting a surprising amount attention from women, even some very attractive women.

However, something that holds me back is the constant fear than women are going to see me as a potential stable monogamous relationship and/or family provider after already going through a stage of hooking up with alpha-male/bad boy types that can provide better sex and excitement than I can. If you have ever heard of ""the red-pill"" you will probably understand this dynamic.

The idea of fulfilling a woman's emotional needs and/or financial needs but being unable to match the raw sexual attractiveness of her previous partners feels like an absolutely repulsive and insulting situation, to the point that I would rather not put myself in it at all.

I'm not a ""nice-guy"" in the subservient sense but also don't have the personality of an ""alpha male/bad boy"" type (i.e seeking social dominance/high risk taking).

However, I'm not a push-over with either men or women and can become quite hostile when I feel that I'm being treated disrespectfully (more typically from men) or used somehow (more typically from women)

Any advice on how to avoid the fate of being (just) ""the good guy"" so that I can also hold a woman's sexual desire more than her previous partners?

So I met this girl on hinge and talked for a few days and I asked her to meet up on a lunch date. She is in medical school so she is extremely busy with her schedule and such, so I was happy that she agreed. To start when I met her she is extremely beautiful, even prettier in person. This made me even more nervous than I was previously. As for the date: Throughout the date, I would ask her questions and she was answering in long thoughtful answers. The only problem was she wasn't asking much about me. This could have been my fault because I continued to ask her questions after she just answered the previous one (As I said I was extremely nervous and was trying to prevent the awkward silence that happens on the first date). Anyways it ended with us telling each other that we had a great time, but that was it. Later in the day, I messaged her ""Thanks for today."" It took her a while to respond, but when she did her response was the opposite of what I wanted to hear. She said ""Thanks for today. I had fun and I think you're a great guy, but unfortunately, I didn't think the connection was really there for me."" Gutwrenched I replied ""Damn, okay. Best of luck to you.""

I will try to keep it brief.

**People involved**:

I (M mid 20s) and a woman I will refer to as G (mid 20s), and her boyfriend of few weeks (20s)

**Back story**:

Me and G are both foreigners in a country. I try to avoid dating foreigners, because nearly all want to leave the country and go back home after they finish with their studies. I like this country and want to live here and not go back. This has been an issue because most relationships are short lived, hence why I try to date people that are likely to stay in country.

I've met G a couple of years earlier. She really was and still is amazing - beautiful, smart and really dedicated. She did not want to stay in the country after finishing with her studies. I decided to risk it, because we did get very well together and we both enjoyed each others company. We went on a few dates, but because I was very immature and insecure, and because she was going away soon, she decided that we shouldn't continue. Because I was still interested in her, I decided to stay away and go no contact with her, so that I can move on. She left the country shortly after.

**Present**:

I've long since moved on and have had a few partners, but have been single for a while now. I believe I have since grown and fixed a lot of the issues I had. G returned back to the country and decided that she wants to stay here permanently. I decided to reach out and hang out as friends. We had a lot of fun and I realized that I still have some feelings for her. The problem is that she started dating someone a few weeks ago.

She told me that she is very unhappy, that they fight a lot and that she is happy that her boyfriend wanted to take a break from their relationship. She told me that she has some issue and this is her first proper relationship and she doesn't want to be alone.

**Dilemma**:

I am not sure how to proceed. She has a boyfriend that she is unhappy with, however, it feels wrong to ask out someone who is taken. She is already unhappy about that and I don't want to force her to make a choice or to try to replace him.

The way I see things, I have 3 options:

1. Do nothing and try to forget her again and move on. Go no contact possibly.
2. Wait for them to break up and then ask her out. It seems very likely that they will break up, but I can never be certain. I don't want to wait for something like that to happen. It seems unfair to both her and me. Besides, she would need time to heal anyway.
3. Confess my feelings and tell her to choose if she would like to date me or him. I don't like that I am ""forcing"" her to make a choice, she already has enough to deal with. But I think this might be the best outcome for both of us. She would either accept me or I can move on and not potentially cause issues with her relationship.

I do care about her and I don't want to lose her as a potential partner or even as a friend. I don't really want to give her an ultimatum or mess with their relationship. I don't think that it would be possible for me to stay quiet and just be her friend, however.

I am not sure what to do. Any advice or reality check is appreciated.

I'll think to myself ""well, this probably won't work"" only to receive a message asking for a 2nd date a few days later. But on the other side, when I really enjoy the first date, feel confident, like i'm ""being myself"", there never is further interest on the other part.

Is this just coincidence? Or is it possible to be ""too confident""? Right now I'm wondering whether I might be 'too loud' when I enjoy myself: I usually laugh a lot, make stupid dad jokes, can talk a lot about things that interest me when I'm relaxed. I always thought that confidence / being yourself is key and that most women liked that kind of outgoing behavior, but maybe it can be too much? Especially when I talk about some of the niche interests I have: I believe that I can talk about them in ways that make them interesting to people who don't know a thing about them, but maybe I just come out as a weirdo without realizing it.

Kind  of a long one, but I'll try to keep it short. For reference I turned 32  a couple days ago and she turned 30 two weeks ago. Feel free to skip  ahead to the tldr

I met a girl  online last summer. We went out on dates for a couple months, but things  ended in mid October. Our first couple dates were great and lasted for  hours. But things started to get weird a few dates in, she admitted that  she had only been single for a few weeks before we met. And she kept  mentioning her ex boyfriends more and more, not even her previous one. I  was 3 months out of a relationship at that time. And even though I was  over my ex and ready for someone new, in hindsight I realize I was still  dealing with the emotional issues my ex created by becoming excessively  controlling (which is why I left her).

Anyway,  this created a lot of confusion for me. Not knowing if I was just a  rebound, or where her head was at, I told her I wanted to take a break  until the thing with our ex's cooled off, and that I would keep her  number. She talked me in to giving things another chance, and we went  out one more time (I met her friends). Things were terribly awkward  between us at that point, and days after we agreed to call it quits.  Like I said, that was mid October 2021.

Over  the next couple months she kept texting me here and there. The  beginning of January she texted and we actually talked every day for a  week. And finally, the beginning of February, she asked me if I would  try dating her again. We've been talking every day since and she is  coming to my apartment next weekend.

On  one hand I do really like this girl. Like, maybe too much. I've been  taking things slow and not letting myself get to excited because of how  things went last time. I'm still feeling apprehensive and nervous about  how things will go when she comes over next weekend.

tldr  - Tried dating last summer/fall. Issues with our ex's interfered and it  failed.

I try to match guys not just for their looks but mostly for their interests and potential shared values and overall I have quite nice and interesting conversations. However, 90% of the times when I meet them in person, I usually don't feel any physical or sexual attraction. They either end up being shorter than I thought, not as good looking as I pictured them or there is simply no desire from my side. The bad thing is that I feel I immediately shut down and end up killing the connection, which makes me feel terrible.

I'm really making an effort to push past this and go on at least two dates to genuinely know people that are nice to me and with similar values and but I also don't want to feel like I'm settling down for someone just because they are nice or interesting, the physical part should make me excited too.

As much as I feel bad in saying this... I always end up feeling like I could find a much better looking guy that I would feel immediately attracted to. I don't think I'm being vain or shallow but attraction also plays a part in this. Overall, I find it extremely difficult to find the full package in someone: nice to me, interesting, with shared values and good looking/that I'm physically attracted to.

I have a casual relationship with my work mate which lasted a year. He is the most lovely and gentleman I’ve ever met, we both agreed to keep the relationship casual at the start. However, during our encounters or conversations everyday  he makes me feel so special and even told me “He is not just here for sex”. We are always talking and texting and cuddled, watch movies together, spend special occasion together. This all lead me to catching feelings for him and getting confused on what we are doing. He can spend time with me without being sexual and just talking and catching up.

I really think that he is having feelings for me too, so what an idiot I am I confess my feelings. He has not said anything with regards to my feelings, he still continue to talk to me everyday but has not met me since the confession. He always cancel and it’s been two months now already. It’s very unlike him to not see me in 2 months.

I spent a long time repressing my personality, pretending to be a much better person than I was in order to feel in control (bad childhood through early adulthood), and have recently come out of it after a couple of years of therapy.

Pretending to be a clean-cut considerate person caused me a lot of distress, so I can't go back to that, but I'm not a liar either (like a lot of sleazy guys are). I like sex and openness and positivity, and yeah, I am sleazy, and I enjoy it. The thing is, I'm not looking to fool anyone or date someone who doesn't like that sort of thing - I've tried dating nice girls, passive girls, normal girls, and felt incredibly bored and trapped in those relationships. To be fair, I never acted like my true self in those relationships, so I can't be sure how they would have responded.

I don't want to lie about any of this, but I'm a bit confused about how to fill out my OLD portfolio. For instance, one of the prompts is something like ""Tell us about a superpower you have"" and my immediate reaction was ""I can jerk off with both hands"". I know that sounds juvenile and comes off as pushing sex, but I find it funny and that's my personality. Do I just write my profile like that and take what comes? I want to weed out the types of women who wouldn't like being with a guy like that (probably most women, but not a problem, I only need to find one), but I want to go about it in an effective way.

Cue to a couple days after we made out. She ended up texting me  telling me how she’s really enjoyed getting to know me how she’s never met someone so fun and genuine etc .

I told her I need some time to be alone while I process this and she told me she fully understands and take my time.

can we really be just friends after that? Hang out like normal , and that’s it. Or is she just too nervous to actually say we are “dating “ so wants to just throw out the friend card bc she’s still not sure but dosnt want to loose me?

Soon later she starts taking interest in things I did such as play Pokémon Go( she had no idea what pokemon was), sight seeing and playing basketball (all these as well she never played). Kept asking for my ideas for college events and also kept me informed about what she was doing each day, even though I never asked. Some days we never texted and she broke the silence and asked ""Why haven't we been texting?"". When ever I traveled back home, she asked me to text her/call her when I reached home(late night) or when I came back (early morning). 

She made attempts to even learn my native language and speak with me when I told her "" I feel more comfortable and ipen to people I speak my native language in"". During our intra-college fest, she used to practice basketball with me( she never played basketball ever, but tried well to learn). She waked me up in the morning and called me in the evening for practice. She always noticed what I wore during our fest and if I had done something or not. She always cared for me as I stressed out during exams and sent me memes and some joke (none of them being that funny but appreciate the efforts). But in time for our final I cut off from the outside world to read and she moved on I guess from me to another guy whose major characteristics match mine. Did I miss a part where she was hinting? Now once she has moved (been about a year) will she ever look back?

I'm a 24 year old guy who's socially awkward and has never been in a relationship before, and only a handful of dates over the past few years. In 2019 I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

He went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, (things no one's ever said to me before) and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and he kept bringing up sex and how he wanted to have sex with me and that I should because I know that he likes me and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed and not in a car, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me to being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. A few months ago I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking. I know it's dumb to ask a question and then get upset when the answer isn't what I wanted, but I don't like knowing for certain that I ruined things with a really attractive guy who really genuinely liked me and could see himself spending his life with me and I'm having trouble moving on from it and getting over it.

I had made a post about falling head over heels for that I had too much in common. This was after dealing with a breakup from a 2 year relationship that was rather toxic. But overall is the update I guess and I am not dealing with it well. A lot of it is on me, but now even with acknowledging the problem, It can be too much to handle sometimes.

About a year I had gotten familiar with my neighbor (22F) whose company I enjoyed. Over time, I found out she had the same birthday and tastes as me so I was interested. We hung out over time but I grew feelings for her. There was a point in time where we didn't talk, and I had forgotten, but we hung out again over a couple months, and it was good! I kissed her somewhere within our time and we wanted to go to stuff together. Then she moved at the end of the month, and things were different.  All of the whole ""sweetheart"" thing stopped right after. I felt some type of way about it. And after awhile, I felt like I was never shit to her, so I told her that. She responded in kind,

I haven't been able to get back to you, I wanted to give good news

I love you, but in a different way,

Heal from the inside out not the outside in

I can tell you have some things to work out, I'm still here for you, I'm your friend 

Im not emotionally there for myself believe me.

I know I have some things still to work through, But I have fallen head over heels over this girl even still. I just don't know what to do. I know I fucked it up between me and her, but frankly she is perfect to me, and I want to try. I just don't want to follow my heart just to push her away. But also if she doesn't feel the same way ( Which I can't even tell anymore, well now it's like I didn't mean when I thought I did before). I'm constantly thinking about her, wondering if I did something wrong? I don't know. and I don't know what to do moving forward. I do deeply love and care for this girl, and I want to be the best that I can for her, but I""m not here for myself. I'm pretty sure she is talking to other guys (she loves raves and stuff) I don't know.  Just losing my shit. Wishing I was better and never gone through the shit that I did before I met her, I wish I was better. 

I'm pretty sure moving forward I'm friendzoned, and it sheds light on things I need to work on moving forward. But I'm tired of things like this to as to what I takes for me to learn this shit. I just want to be happy with someone, and not constantly feel like I live in a world where no one cares on default. It is also discouraging when you share the same birthdays, same tastes, same outlook, and yet still, you are not enough. I'm just done trusting people, and just trusting dating, when it's really just two people looking to fuck with no compromise.

I’m just really not sure what to do, online dating has been a good means of meeting people in the past and I’ve actually had some super awesome dates.  But the issue is that the people who would actually date me end up being the weirder people and the people who are enjoyable to be around either ghost me (sometimes after 4 to 5 super good dates and with no explanation) or are just looking to be friends with benefits and hang out.  I also have been having terrible luck in the past month on online dating sites and have had about 2 dates in the past month with probably about 10ish people that gave me their number and then bailed the day of the date or even stood me up once I got to the date spot.

I (31F) had been dating this guy (30M) for a couple of months. Everything seemed to be going fine. We were spending more time together, staying at his place more often, I met his inner circle and joined them for activities more, it all seemed good, almost relationship-y. We had a talk about exclusively dating fairly early into the relationship to which we both agreed to and I took his word for it and stopped seeing everyone else.

Recently, he started distancing himself, communication decreased, no more enthusiasm or eagerness on his part. So I had to ask him personally what was going on. It turns out he recently started going out with someone else and stated that he wanted to casually date now. Needless to say, that conversation did not end well as he got very defensive when I confronted him so much as to say he did not need my permission to see other people. 

I am having a hard time coming to terms with it as I feel like I was led on and deceived. Why didn't he express that earlier on? He had the chance to.

I feel very shitty about the whole
situation cause it could have been easily avoided. I also feel ashamed and embarrassed that I opened up to someone who pulled this card on me and broke my trust. I personally don't know what to do... his last words to me were: ""We can still see each other casually""

She's new to the country

Everyone got a bit too hammered and me/H separated from the group a few times to make out. She seemed insecure or maybe guilty, saying things like ""we can't tell T about this"", ""I'm such an overthinker"", ""T was so lucky to meet a guy like you here"", ""i'm a bad person, I don't want to hurt you"". We both checked-in a lot to make sure we wanted it &amp; that nobody was being taken advantage of

A couple times she started crying on my shoulder about this terrible guy who used her for sex (she was inexperienced) and ghosted her 2 months ago. I'd instantly stop and try comforting and ask if she wanted to leave, see T, etc. I texted her the next day to make sure she was fine with everything that happened because I didn't know she was that far blasted

Clearly she's going through a lot, I feel bad for her since she's so nice. She started therapy a couple week ago. Apparently she'd never been that drunk and I know some people can just get really emotional if they had too much

Still though despite all that, I found her nice, very cute (appearance wise &amp; mannerisms), and the kissing/feeling was so passionate and intense. I have a bad habit of getting feelings too quickly, but I can also lose them fast &amp; handle rejection so idk my deal

I don't want to hurt her or complicate her life, so I don't feel comfortable initiating but rather backing off &amp; seeing what she does. Idt she's into meaningless physical connections so maybe she likes me a little too. The mutual friend T says H is mainly focused on getting over the stuff she endured so hasn't said much about me. I don't want anything to be awkward so if nothing happens again I'm super cool with leaving it in the past

English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes. 

I (26f) met this guy (32m) on an dating app over a month ago, we really connected, talked every other day and so far we have had 3 dates (going out to dinner, drinks and things like that). Our last date was past Friday we went for drinks and then ended up in his apartment to watch the all stars game (nba). That night I asked him what were his intentions because I don’t want any casual arrangements but I’m not desperate for a relationship either, and he said to me that he doesn’t want a casual thing but feels like he’s not ready for a relationship either. 

(I’ve had really bad dating experiences in the past which leave me with a lot of trauma, insecurity and anxiety, that’s why I wanted to have the things clear so early on) 

That same night we ended up hooking up (not our first time since we did it on the first date). The next day we were texting and he said that if I was comfortable being “just friends”, which I responded that I was confused because those weren’t his words last night, and he said that “friends” is a word he feels comfortable to describe what he feels/want - I then stated that I don’t kiss/fuck my friends, and that if he wanted to be that it’ll has to be that way and he agreed. He suggested that we even can hang out once in a while if I wanted to. 

Now I’m confused - I don’t know what does this mean. I don’t feel like his words match his actions because He is really sweet and thoughtful ex1. He took me to a pizza restaurant were they used vegan cheese because I told him once that I was lactose intolerant. Ex2. Every time we hang out he always drives me back home because where we live is really dangerous to take ubers late at night (people I’ve dated in the past hasn’t care at all about this fact).

It went greater than expected. We ended up kissing and things got steamy and he asked if I want to go back to his place.

Now I know well that 1st date ending up with sex usually leads to nowhere. But we both haven’t dated in a while so the lust kinda took over. Before deciding though, I told him that I like him and want to spend more time with him, but I want to know what his intention for me is. He said I’m a cool person and he wants to see me the 2nd time. So I just thought okay let’s give it a try. We went back to his place and had sex and I stayed for the night.

Since then he hasn’t talked to me at all. I asked if he wants to join me and my friends at a club on Friday night but he said it’s kinda late so I just sent him good night. Should I ask him if he still wants to hang out? I could tell that his long silence is already the answer but I want to be clear before cutting all contacts.

Oh, and to make it worse, I remember him talking about just ending a 2-year-relationship last month and I’m his first date in a while. I was wondering maybe he’s still got feelings for his ex since they’re in the same social circle. So I found her Insta and she’s honestly so beautiful, a model and a photographer. Now my confidence is totally crushed 🥲 I feel like I’m only attractive enough to be a hookup but not to be in a relationship…

TLDR : Asked a date what his intention for me is, he said I’m cool and wants to see me again. Ended up going back to his place and having sex. Been 5 days and haven’t heard from him.

Hi guys I'm a 29 (M) who has been on and off dating for a while, sometimes taking multi-year breaks between dating sprees. My orientation is that of a straight but gray asexual, specifically demisexual. What this means is that I only feel attraction to people, specifically women, once I start feeling an emotional bond towards them.

I want to share my own growth with this community regarding how I have handled past and current relationships after the way I handled my last dating experience.

I do not condone my actions during my younger years, that man was a man with issues but I will reveal them regardless and I completely own my actions despite how despicable they were.

# First attractions

In high school I had no less than 4 big crushes, two of which happened to be of a polyamorous type in which I was attracted to both girls at the same time and they were friends with each other. It was weird to navigate this one but it is where I will begin, the other two crushes are irrelevant. I will also post it in bullet form to summarize how the relationship to each person started and ended

- I was 17 

- Both girls were 15 hence forth known as ""**Girl A**"" and ""**Girl B**""

- We attended the same school

- One of the girls, Girl A was initially dating a guy who would a year later become my best friend (prior, we had no affiliation) in life.

- When they broke up she started dating another guy from a different school but that is when we started speaking

- She introduced me to her friend Girl B whom was also dating someone at the time

- We got along pretty well as friends

- Girl B breaks up with her boyfriend and we become a bit closer but I was too scared to ask her out

- Girl A breaks up with her boyfriend and starts making it pretty obvious she is interested in me

- I fuck it all up by picking Girl A over Girl B as Girl B calls me fickle in how I was switching interest between the two (in reality, I really liked them both equally)

- It goes pretty well over summer break

- When we return back to school somehow the entire school has found out we are dating

- We go out on a date for supper and some school kids spot us and come and tease us

- She immediately breaks it off after the incident, like right after the people left, because it's upsetting that we've basically become a ""paparazzi couple""

- I struggle to come to terms with it over the next few days but stupidly agreed to still be friends, meanwhile I am still off-and-on with Girl B

- I invite Girl A to my 18th birthday the following year where she meets my best-friend-no-longer

- They apparently went on several dates that I did not know about

- He asks me if it is okay to date her well after the fact that he'd already been on a few with her that I didn't know about

- I told him I am still trying to get over her so I would prefer he didn't

- Immediately breaks our friendship by telling me he doesn't have to do what I ask of him and that he's already been on a few dates with her and he is going to continue dating her

- I invite Girl B on a small family holiday

- She reveals she has certain mental issues and derives joy from seeing other people in pain and breaks up with people to feed off that pain. I think she is crazy as fuck for having that belief and immediately break off contact with her after the holiday and never speak to her again

- I get really upset and over the next few months/years as I subtly tried breaking Girl A and former-best-friend up, I never truly got over her after many years out of school even.

- Fast forward to age 21, third year of university and Girl A and myself meet up by accident one day on campus

- She says she has just broken up with former-best-friend

- I ask her out for lunch to catch up the ""lost years"". We meet for pizza, I confirm it is not a date. I am still attracted to her though. Former-best-friend keeps spam calling her as he is finding it hard after their first break-up

- She logs into facebook on my phone because her phone dies because she wanted to block him. She did not logout. She also saves her details on the phone which I didn't realise till several months later

- Former-best-friend somehow convinces her that I did something which somehow gets them back together and makes her ostracize me like I did something really wrong. I only found out several years later that former-best-friend blamed me for making a profile on steam of Girl A with sexy photos on the Steam profile because at the time she ostracized me from her life, she just told me cryptically ""you know what you did"". Spent years wondering wtf did I do?

- Several months go by and I look through my passwords from google to see any compromised passwords I need to change since Google made it a new feature and come across Girl A's facebook account login details by surprise and immediately take the opportunity to go fuck with her profile. I look at her chat history with former-best-friend and see that after many years of dating they still haven't had sex and former-best-friend is basically pleading that he has been waiting a really long time (years lol). I take the opportunity to due something really vile and despicable and start typing all sorts of things like ""I am ready to give myself to you"" and describing what she wanted to do to former-best-friend. She never found out it was me until I confessed several years later. I wanted to know why in the hell 

- Randomly contact her one day on Facebook just to see how she is in life, she has since broken up with former-best-friend. I asked her why she cut me out all those years ago. I went on a big mission to find out who actually did it and it turned out it was one of her guy friends who was also really into her and when she rejected his advances he did it in revenge

- Still doesn't want to speak to me though even though I found out the real culprit behind the Steam incident. Knowing then that it would most likely be the last time we chat to each other, I confessed to the whole facebook messaging scandal and apologised for it. She thanks me for the honesty and always wanted to know who did it and is grateful she can now put it behind her. We finally split ways and haven't spoken to her in many many years since then

# First and last girlfriend

- This coincides with the previous section a little bit

- Met a girl who we shall call Britney (not real name). We were both 19 and in our first year of university/college

- I was not initially attracted to Britney but we did hit it off in a friendshippy kind of way with many common interests. She was still in a relationship but again I wasn't attracted to her at the time

- She eventually breaks up with her now-ex-boyfriend and it becomes clear that she is interested in me over the next few weeks as she invites me to places and slowly but surely the demi side of me starts feeling an emotional connection to Britney

- We eventually become official. At no point in the relationship were there any disagreements or fights, we just got along really super well. I started to love her now and a very strong emotional bond formed. She then suddenly broke up with me out of the blue. It was so sudden. Not like she was ignoring me prior or not kissing me/touching me or anything. From my perspective it was like an atom bomb exploded from nowhere. She didn't want to tell me her reasons which fed further into my confusion and ate at me

- She said she still wanted to be friends and I foolishly tried going along that route but no longer hearing from her everyday and seeing she was moving on with her life really hurt a lot. I still had extremely strong feelings for her so I kept trying to win her back. My most extreme action was tweeting a whole plan to try win her back (she also had twitter so she could read it all and that was the plan). I bought a big bunch of flowers and drove to her house in the late evening. She didn't let me in the house but she did come out to collect the flowers and we spoke for about an hour. I kept trying to convince her to either get back together or tell me why she broke up with me all of a sudden. I left without an answer but she calmed me down for a day or two

- I found out two days later that she told a family friend of hers who then told me to make fun of me that she broke up with me because apparently I was ""too feminine"" and it felt like she was in a relationship with a male version of herself. This absolutely hurt and shattered me to the core so I started bullying her online but at the same time STILL trying to get back together with her. I would say this is the lowest I have ever been in my life and it took me just over 10 months to finally move on. She had blocked me on social media 2 months after the break-up and deleted some of her social media accounts because of me

- I deeply regretted these actions but we are on better terms today than we were back then as we bumped into each other on university campus a few years later. Britney is now married with children and I am extremely happy for her. Looking at her now, I can see that long term we would not have been compatible.

- After this incident I swore off dating for the next 8 years as I could not handle another emotionally fueled break up like this again. That empty feeling inside was just too much to bare for such a long period of time. I also knew I had to work hard on myself which I did

# Getting back into the dating scene part 1: Got out almost as quickly as I got in

- This was roughly 4 years ago

- I knew a fellow student whom I will call Christina (again, not real name) from the university days who was in her final year. We tutored a comp sci class together during under-grad although I was 2 years above her as we both studied computer engineering.

- She had been in a relationship during university and I will admit I was attracted to her as over the tutoring sessions I found we shared very similar interests however she was in a relationship so I had to let go of those feelings. Of all the girls in this post she was quite conventionally attractive as well. She randomly reached out to me one day and wanted to meet up to ask me how it was like in the industry (I had been working for two years already and she was busy with her final year)

- We met up, had coffee and it was understood from both sides it was not a date. We chatted for a while during the meet up, I answered her questions etc. We then also just spoke in general, catching up and almost 4 hours later we finally ended the meet up not knowing where the time had gone

- A few weeks went by and then I asked her for another meet up, just another hang out session as friends. I wanted to make sure that I was actually attracted to her but it was a mistake on my part as I actually fell head over heels for her after this meet up. I don't know if you guys have ever had that experience where you're just so invested in a person so quickly but that is what happened to me and it was the first time I experienced this

- I then asked her out on a date and she said yes. We went out and while I felt a really good connection, apparently I misread her the entire date. Towards the end she told me that while she does really like me, unfortunately we had a clash in culture and that her parents wouldn't accept me etc. The only difference between her and I is that I am Jewish and her parents are really heavy Christians and they have a strong cultural identity which I am not part of. I tried convincing Christina to at least give it a chance but she was adamant that it wouldn't last and didn't want to hurt me since she was a church goer and in her fairly religious church it was seen as very weird to not come with your partner and her former partner was as religious as her(I am for all intents and purposes an atheist, I just identify with the Jewish people and was raised in a religious Jewish household). She said she was willing to be friends and I told her I don't think it would work out as I was really into her and then she said she would be really upset if she lost me as a friend and I made the mistake of trying to do that while I was practically in love with her. I should have just cut things off then

- The first two weeks I felt fine but then my desire to be around her and not hearing from her everyday started to eat at me. I then lashed out at her, not in the way of hating her for not wanting to continue dating me, I was okay with that for the most part. What did eat at me is that she stopped responding to my messages at times, leaving me on read for days at a time where as before, even when we worked as tutors together, she would always get back to me almost instantly. I confronted her about it and she said it was because she didn't want to lead me on and that she was seeing other guys and didn't want to hurt me while doing so. I told her I can't go on like that and immediately blocked her from all social media and deleted her number

- Due to this experience, I took another 4 year hiatus from dating to work on myself again

*****

# Getting back into the dating scene part 2: Finally understanding how to deal with dating when things just won't work out

- My sister suggested putting me on OLD. I told her not to bother as I had extremely bad experiences in the past (average amount of matches, like 2-4 a month, not that I swiped all that often) on tinder. Not to mention I am not a ""conventionally attractive man"". My sister found that out very quickly when I agreed that she can create a profile for me on tinder and see for herself. 

- After two days of her constantly swiping and not getting any matches she got bored and then found out about JSwipe, basically tinder for Jewish millenials like myself. I didn't think she would get any matches on it either, but within the first day she had 3 matches one of whom she she gave my number to.

- I immediately hit it off with the first girl that contacted me, we'll call her Grace (not her real name). Grace is 24 and I am 29 and we started speaking a lot and found that we had a lot of things in common such as series, sports, beliefs etc. It was actually crazy to me how similar we were in that respect, more so than Britney from the prior sections. I did start feeling a bit of a connection to her during this time of chatting before even meeting her. Of all the girls I had dated in the past, she was probably the least conventionally attractive of the bunch and I don't want to be shallow but I am sure I was ""out of her league"" on the conventionally attractive scale. Not that looks matter to me.

- After two weeks of back and forth texting we finally decided to meet up yesterday and for all intents and purposes we had a really good time together. I didn't have any emotional bonds form yet but we knew that we really got along together. We laughed and walked around a public park and after the date I did let her know that I would love to take her out on another date but unfortunately for me she said that while she did enjoy my company and that I am a really great guy, she didn't feel sexually attracted to me. I completely respected her view and told revealed to her that I am a demi-sexual person and didn't quite feel connected to her just yet either even though the beginnings of the emotional connection I need were there, it would take several meet ups before I would start really falling for her her and that I was still in the ""getting to know her"" phase despite how in-common we were. 

- I told her from my end that if we remained friends there is no guarantee that I would not start being attracted to her and that if she was not open to the idea that she might develop feelings for me in the future that it is better off we part amicably and on friendly terms now and she respected my decision and was happy that I was so forthright and honest with her and because of my explanation about demi-sexuality, she understood my reasons were not malicious because I was just looking out for both our well beings.

- We then said our goodbyes to each other and wished each other the best for the future. 


I felt really good after this interaction and could see I had learned quite a lot from my previous dates and relationships on how to handle rejection. 

I know I'm ready to date many people and how to gracefully accept rejection and move on. It took me many years to understand that. I regret being a massive creep and asshole to the previous girls and only wish I knew then what I know now because then I would not have put those girls through all of that. 

If they ever read this and somehow deduce that I am talking about them, I apologise a million times over. You didn't deserve any of that and my actions then are inexcusable. 

This is my message to my fellow men and women and those in-between: 

Rejection happens. The first time it happens it is incredibly difficult to process but please know it is not your fault. Attraction is a strange thing. Do not fault the other person if they don't find you attractive. You will survive and you will learn how to handle it better.

&amp;#x200B;

28 yo straight dude here, and i'll go straight to the point : I really really really don't like penetration.

I got through a lot of difficulties during my pathetic sex life, because all the girls I've been with wanted me to be inside em a lot, which I did all the time without ever letting them know how much I hated it.

I know I know, communication and honesty are the keys to have a healthy relationship, but please, how can you tell the girl you love something like ""hey, I hate pleasing you."" ? You know it's gonna sound like this, no matter the way you put it.

Anyway, nothing dramatic so far, but the point is that today my penis and i are breaking free and won't date a girl who's into piv sex anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Which lead us to my question : Do I have any chance surviving in this cruel world if I tell my crushes from the start that I would NOT like to be inside them ?

Are there guys like me ?

Is it realistic to seek for a girl who is as much not-into-piv as me ?

Would you girls date a guy who's gonna do everything but piv ?
