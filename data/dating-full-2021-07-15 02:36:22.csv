So I posted the italicized text to r/relationships. It got removed so I don't think I can link the post. Anyways, the answers I got to my question were all along the lines of ""you're new, word gets around quick in a small town, so the girls flocked to you"". So my question to the people of r/dating is: **how can I have a repeat of the success I had with girls? Does it mean girls here at home find me attractive?**

&amp;#x200B;

*TL;DR: Why are attractive girls all over me in small town but not in hometown?*

*Not sure if this fits the sub so sorry in advance. I recently visitied a rural small town in a midwestern state for a couple days to see my grandma and for a high school class reunion for my dad. The population is a little less than 400 people. Well they have this thing called ""Alumni Weekend"" that includes the class reunion (actually, multiple classes) and a bunch of other festivities. One of them is a thing called a ""street dance"" that is apparently rlly common in small towns in that state. A block on the main street is blocked off and people listen to live music and drink in the bar(because the bar is on the block thats blocked off). It's mostly adults just hanging out and talking but a few teens go to it and my grnadma encouraged me to go. I decided to go to it as I had never gone to any dance or anyhting like it before. I figured what the hell, I barely knew anyone there and it being away from home made it seem like whatever happened there wouldn't matter so who cares. On the other hand, I was going by myself and not with a group of friends which I thought would make me look weird. Long story short, an attractive girl came up to me asked for my snap (I don't have snap so I gave her my number). Later on, another girl started flirting with me. The next day, there was something going on in the park and I was walking downtown for some reason and an another attractive girl yelled at me as I walked ""You're cute!"" and her friend said ""She thinks you're hot!"". So this was blatant attraction from 3 seperate girls, two of whom are quite attractive, in the span of less than 24 hours, without me even initiating it. For context I am an average looking teenage boy. I'm short for my age. I don't play sports but I work out every day. The reason I write this post is I have NEVER, EVER received that kind of attention from girls in my hometown of around 23,000 people or at my high school. Never. I have had a total of 1 girlfriend and my peers at home seem to be very popular with girls. So I am wondering if anyone has any insight into this. This wave of attention is very unusual.*",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,898527,public,self,How can I replicate success with girls in small town on vacation here at home?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/okjwjn/how_can_i_replicate_success_with_girls_in_small/,all_ads,6,,,

once that was done it was done. we are official, we dont get jealous of each other and are very honest about who we are talking to and what about. we trust each other and want to be with each other. the problem is is that now that i know i want exclusivity, my fear of being cheated on creeped back up on me, so i started periodically checking tinder to see if his profile had updated. i did this because my last ex’s profile changed once when i was preparing to delete my account and what do you know, he cheated on me. i know this is wrong, i admit that by doing this im letting my trust issues get the best of me and its u healthy, i wont excuse that. but every time ive checked it hasnt changed up until now. the only thing thats changed is his pictures, it added two new ones, and im wondering why this is. i want to believe benefit of the doubt and say it just took a long time updating, but im really not sure and im very very veryyy scared im being cheated on. i dont want to point fingers and accuse him of cheating on me either and im scared he’ll think i was using tinder to cheat on my end. what should i do?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,898691,public,self,my (f18) bfs (m18) tinder profile updated even though he has a fear of cheating?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oklkct/my_f18_bfs_m18_tinder_profile_updated_even_though/,all_ads,6,,,

So i have been through situations where when i genuinely did not feel attracted or did not give attention to a girl later on she was looking for my attention. 

When i tried this on purpose did not always work. 

I have talking to girls that seem (for real, no illusions here) to like me but they take hours to respond while posting stories and doing other stuff with other people online. 

I have been dealing with years of failure and i simply dont know if i should pull the ""whatever"" treatment card and act like i dont give a damn anymore.

I'll be starting college in the fall and while I have no intention to search for a relationship during my freshman year, I know what at some point I will want to later on. However, I've come to realize the absolute hellfire that modern dating is and I don't think I'm built for it at all and now I'm just convinced I'm just going to die alone. It sounds awful. I saw a post earlier about modern dating and it was something like ""modern dating be like: woah woah woah, let's have sex before we rush into dating"" or something like that. The number of people replying about how that's how things should be kind of scared me. I'm not that kind of person. Everyone seems so mortified of commitment, views sex as both casual but also the most important thing in a relationship above all else (going back to the previous post I mentioned, people were saying that you should have sex first because getting to know a person is pointless if the sex isn't good....even though dating/relationships about getting to know a person and learning communication so if something like sex isn't immediately spectacular you would learn each other and your bodies and become compatible sexually, right?), and people don't want to put effort into relationships. When the going gets tough, people just run. 

Everything that modern dating is about is just not what I want. I'm the type of person who would probably want to wait months before having sex, I value commitment and monogamy, I find communication and being upfront to be important and I like to work through problems rather than running away from them, and I feel like you should allow room for growth for a partner and not expect a perfect person from the very beginning, but I feel like people nowadays would just call me clingy and a prude. It horrifies me. 

I remember watching a youtube video where a girl was talking about her parents and how when her mother was dying she told her husband that he didn't have to be there at the hospital all the time with her and he basically said ""where tf else would I be?"". And the daughter was talking about how much love they have for each other and was like ""do people even love like that anymore?"". I wonder that too sometimes and it makes me sad. 

Did I also mention I'll be attending college in Los Angeles too? Isn't that like peak modern dating? Yeah, I think I'm screwed...Am I being dramatic? Are things as awful as they seem?

I like hanging out with people, but not too too much. My bf on the other hand, I like spending a lot of time with him. He makes me very happy and I enjoy his presence and our time together. We’ve recently made 2 years not too long ago. I’ve been thinking and reading up on how to improve our relationship, and it all starts with me. 

I tend to get super jealous when he goes out. Sometimes he invites me to go and hang out with his friends, and I do, but there’s most times where he just goes. I’ve become so emotionally attached that every time he goes out without me, I breakdown. I sob and sit in my room for what it seems hours, and waiting until he comes back the next day. It’s hurting me so much. I’ve done this so many times. 

What sucks is, he wants to go hang out and he finds me super upset with him leaving, that he too gets upset. He doesn’t want me to be sad when he tries to go hang out with his friends. Then i feel terrible because i just made his happy mood turn into a sorrowful one. He ends up staying with me instead of hanging out with friend, which leaves me being regretful. 

Ive been trying to read up on how to stop being so controlling and jealous and trying to find how to be happy, alone, but it’s so hard. I know if i keep this up, he may wake up one day and realize he doesn’t want to be with me anymore, especially because of my behavior. I want to be mature about this, but right now i’m not. I’ve realized that i can’t take away what he enjoyed doing before i came into the picture. 

I don’t like that i don’t have any friends of my own to hang with. I haven’t pushed them away, it’s just that they are boys, and when your girl, you’re not allowed to hang with them for long. Girl friends seem cool, but i’ve had too many complications with them, they just don’t seem right for me.

i’d love some advice on this situation because i do think i need to remain calm, cool and collected. i 23F broke up with my toxic ex boyfriend about 6 weeks ago. after a week of being single, i downloaded tinder for the first time. matched with this guy 24M, super hot at first glance and he wanted to get coffee after a few hours of chatting. i politely declined as i was a busy, and we kept talking with loose plans for the weekend after. a few days after talking to this guy, my ex pops back up and wants to work on things. i was a bit of a mess so i said sure, and i deleted my tinder account and blocked this guy i was planning on getting coffee with on instagram and deleted on snapchat as it felt moral to do so. 

however, with my ex, nothing changed. it was just 4 weeks of bullshit, and i kept thinking about this new guy. i blocked my ex for good and unblocked the new guy and said i was so sorry, had a bit of a breakdown and explained what happened. he said “oh i had a feeling you got back with your ex” and i said no we didn’t even get back together and it was awful. he then said he still wanted to get coffee and organised it for sunday morning just gone. 

prior to the date, i remade tinder and super matched with him as a joke and he said “you can delete this now, we’ve found each other and i’ve deleted mine” so i did. he also said he wasn’t looking for anything serious or to get married, but he’s not ruling anything out in case i’m the right person for him. so i thought fuck it, why not give it a go? i’m looking for something serious eventually and i bet a lot of people say that until the right person comes along. 

the date was amazing. he was so kind, polite, tall, gorgeous and he kissed me at the end of the date and said he wanted to see me again this week coming for dinner and that he’d pick me up and organise it. at this stage we have just talked normally, but on sunday night i turned the conversation sexual/flirty. monday rolls around and he asks to come over tonight (because i kept being flirty) and i said sure. we had sex, it was mind blowing. see my most recent post for deets! i said “are you still taking me to dinner?” and he said “well doesn’t this count as something because we had take out and watched a movie? we’ll see next weekend because it’s my bday this weekend.”

and tuesday morning he messaged me saying “have a great day xx” so it’s not like he has ghosted me but the frequency of texting has now gone down. he still messages me good morning every morning and asks me how my day has been when he’s home at night, there just hasn’t been much else. i’m not sure if it’s because he’s working and we were originally texting over the weekend, he can’t be on his phone much at work but it’s already annoying me and making me feel like saying “why aren’t you talking to me as much as before?” and “are you slowly ghosting me?”

i don’t know if these are red flags or if i’m over thinking it. all of my friends think i am and i don’t know how to remain calm.

The last guy I dated for four months, met my parents and friends yet when I eventually brought up the topic of 'Is this just a fling or something more' over text (which I now regret doing so- should've done it in person fml), it completely backfired and created a quite toxic vibe between us for a month after which we just ended up parting ways. 

 I always try to leave it to the guy **(guys- opinions on this, who should bring up this topic, guys or girls?)** to ask these things or evidently try put off the topic of conversation mostly in fear that they will leave which has proved me correct each time. 

 I know people have said that I should bring it up within the first few dates but I really don't catch feelings easily in the beginning until I do, then I fall harrrddd (anyone else also experience this?). Always feel like my brain goes into 'malfunction mode' when I start liking a guy and bringing up these sorts of things creates a lot of stress and anxiety for me, and Covid hasn't exactly made this easier either.

(First of all, english is not my native language, so don't expect it to be perfect :P )

I met that awesome girl (Let's call her Jen) in my sports group and since I'm actually a pretty cliche male redditor (introverted, never dated and well.. you may guess the thing I never did), I would like to get some opinions on how to proceed in this particular case. We're both part of the same sport group, which I joined roughly two years ago (a bit before I joined, she took a break due to health issues and just returned). During that time, I got to know her parents and brother, which are part of the group as well.

So, lets skip to the more interesting part:   
After training, I was sharing some apples with people I care about/trained with. With my second last apple I went to Jen's mother and asked her, whether she wants that apple. While asking that, I heard a female voice (Jen) from behind my back saying: ""I'll take that one!"". And a hand came from behind, grabbing the apple.  
So, I turned by a 90° angle (with Jen's mom facing me from the left) and wanted to scold the ""apple thief"", when I first looked at Jen. I was smitten. I didn't think ""Boy, is she looking good!"" or something similar, but ""Holy fuck, she looks exactly how she ought to look!"". If someone asked me, whether I've a type, I would show them a picture of her (if I had a picture...). It took me a couple of seconds to process that (3-5, I guess). And my face probably showed that .( I know, that I raised both of my eyebrows and opened my mouth....) In front of Jen and with her mother looking at me from the left.... (Good thing is, her mother likes me. We train together, chit-chat etc.). Jen smiled, her mother stared at me...  
We then talked a bit, during which I tried to make them laugh and to give a good impression.  
They then went home and so did I.  
Couple of days later, I walked about that issue with a common friend and... what shall I say.. They want to support me, because they think, that Jen and I match in character and humor very well. But neither of us knows, whether she's single or not.

I'm not sure, whether I'm insanely lucky currently or just my imagination is running wild.   
But Jen wanted my attention, didn't she? She didn't need to ""steal"" my apple.   
At least her mother does think positively of me (her father and brother probably as well).  
A common friend supports me, because we're a good match in character and humor (according to the friend).  
Am I insanely lucky after never getting a date before and after a 3 year period of self-improvement? Or am I going insane from solitude and me feeling unloved and unloveable?  


In retrospective, I'm happy I didn't ask for her number on the spot. Handing out ones number (or turning me down) in front of her parents and brother would've been weird. But I think, I should try to train with her next time and spent some time with her, getting to know her and so on. And if we click (and I get the feeling, she's single), I could decide to ask her out. 

There are also 1 or 2 (1.5?) reasons, not to do so.   
First of all, we're part of the same sports group, which is unique in our area. If things go south, we can't avoid one another without stopping to attend. And since some males only join cetain groups (e.g. yoga), to pick women up, I actually wanted to avoid flirting in the group. Except, if she initiates. Which in general never happens, but she kinda did, didn't she?  
And on the other hand, I don't know how old exaclty the is, but according to my guess, she's at the beginning of her twenties, while I'll turn 31 in a couple of days..... :/
