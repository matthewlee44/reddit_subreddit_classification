The reality is that I wanted to apologize to her, face to face for my behaviour at the end of our last encounter. And most importantly I wanted to tell her about my big anxiety problems towards sex. But she has suddenly stopped replying to my messages since Friday.

I could expect this kind of behaviour from a match on Tinder. But from a grown up adult I met several times and talked about profound things? Not sure. Maybe I am just assuming a negative scenario.

Hey guys, I am sorry if it’s the right subreddit to post….So, I really have a crush on this girl in school and I really want her. She’s not from my class so it's gonna be kinda awkward if I go ask her out directly. So, my friends and I decided that I should text her on IG cuz she’s always active there. But she didn’t “seen” the text, so I don't know if she saw it or not. I had no other option left than to go full face to face. After a week or two of thinking, I really got the courage to compliment her on her smile and talk. I literally practiced like a day or two and on that day after class, when she was going home, I finally stopped her and managed to talk with her and introduce myself and shook hands(she hesitated for 1/2 secs but she did) idk how. I literally got blank like nothing was coming to my mind at that moment. Somehow I managed to talk with her and went. I couldn’t remember what I told her or what I talked about etc. I can’t even remember if I was even wearing my mask while talking to her.

Now, I don’t know what should be my next step. Should I smile when I see her next time?Should I say “Hi” or what?Should I reply to her stories on IG? 

Please help me guys. I really like this girl and want her. About myself there’s nothing much to be told just a coward guy overthinking about what others think too much but somehow got the courage to talk with this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so in my original post I talk about this child star I met, went out with, and kinda ended up as friends with. I went to his house to check on him when he was on a bender and it was a disaster. Immediately after, I went on a date with this guy at a park nearby and said in the post ""it was the best date of my life""....WELL THIS GUY TURNED OUT TO BE EVEN CRAZIER. 

So on the date, we got along really well because we both love philosophy, love to debate, and when we kissed we had really good chemistry. We snuck into this Japanese garden, he played music and danced with me lol (like in the Notebook haha). It was super cute and I was really excited. However....there was 1 red flag that I ignored and it all makes sense now. 

So I am currently in grad school to become a therapist. He knows this. While we are on the date, his close friend texts him, ""I think I am having a manic episode or a breakdown idk."" The guy says, ""maybe you can help him, I don't know much about this stuff."" So I talk to his friend. His friend says on the phone, ""this is the problem. I have been friends with Jack (the guy I am on a date with), my whole life, I believe the things he says, but I think he is going to screw me over."" I said ""huh? What do you mean by that."" He goes, ""well Jack owns a content creator house and he told me I should break up with my girlfriend and move into the house as it will serve my higher being."" I wasn't quite getting what he was saying. He went on about ""choosing the right timeline"" and ""following Jack's orders."" It was weird af ngl. 

Okay so Jack asked if we can go out the next day (Friday night), but I had plans with friends so we agreed to meet Saturday in the day. I was stressed about this because I have a lot of school work to catch up on and needed all day Sat/Sun to get it done. My friends end up canceling on Friday so I text Jack asking if we could me then instead. His response was a link to a youtube mix of weird videos about death, eternal life, and humans collecting data through the brain. I said, ""I am confused can you call me."" This is how that went....

""Why did you send me this weird group of youtube videos?""

""Well, I thought about it and I don't want to meet you until you watch these videos and learn the philosophy I follow."" 

""Well, I have a lot going on and I cant just watch 13 youtube videos. Plus I have studied a lot of philosophy and I am sure I know most about what these videos have to say.""

""Hmm...seems to me like you are close-minded and that's a red flag. And if you don't have time to watch the videos, then you don't have time for a relationship...another red flag.""

""Uhhh I have been absent because I was sick so yes I have a lot of catching up to do. If that is a red flag then sorry bout it. If you want to discuss philosophy I am down. But it feels like you are trying to indoctrinate me with your beliefs."" 

""Look, at this point, I think meeting you does not fit the timeline of reality that can serve my higher being. You would only serve the purpose of sex to me at this point since you have demonstrated a lot of red flags. However, I do not believe in casual sex and that will not be happening.""

Then I KID YOU NOT, he proceeds to tell me about how he thought about cutting his d\*ck off because he is against the escapism that comes with sex. However, he decided against doing this because he, and I quote, ""wants to procreate one day."" 

Out of spite, I briefly watch 2 videos and annihilated him over text as to why his philosophical beliefs are skewed and how he is basically acting like a cult leader by forcing his friends to move into this house so he can brainwash them.

Now obviously if she is sick that's a valid excuse to miss the date. We were supposed to go to the aquarium today, and I bought tickets in advance and she knew this.

She told me she started feeling sick yesterday and has been throwing up all night. She asked me to check if I can transfer the tickets to another day, and if not she would ""buy the next set"" though she didnt give me an actual day. Though if I was sick throwing up I wouldn't be picking a day either. She sent these texts at 5:40am which is a very unusual time for her to text me, especially on a weekend. 

So she sounds sincere right? I dont know this girl well enough to know if shes telling the truth or just trying to get out of seeing me. Anybody ever have their date get ""sick"" and never see them again, or reschedule and move on? Cant shake the feeling that she was out drinking or on another date last night.

I live 1km from my ex.

Last time I swiped right/liked him and he didnt like back.

Since then I reset my account and swiped left on him and he hasn't come up since.

Until this week... he is coming up constantly each time i go on the app. I never swipe I just shut down the app when he comes up.

Ive concluded he has

a) Swiped right (wishful thinking- i still love him)

b) he set his age settings so he cant see me (im 27) so he cant swipe left

c) hasnt gotten to my profile yet- unlikely since we live quite close but possible.

But due to Covid, I didn’t feel comfortable going off to see him. He would continue to ask me to see him and I would say no. He said he understood and would treat me well and keep me safe if I were to go down there. This would go on a for a couple of months. We would FaceTime here and there. He’s invited me to see his family and friends and to his family member service. He would sometimes randomly drunk call me or randomly call me up to say how beautiful I am.

When I got up to go to the restroom later in the night I had to walk past their table and was surprised to hear someone call out my name. It was my sister’s friend Vanessa. Vanessa is no doubt the prettiest girl I have ever met. She’s a short curvy Latina with the most beautiful brown eyes and this really nice long curly hair. I mean she’s so out of my league it’s not even funny.  I’ve liked her since my sister and her first met a few years ago. 

I’ve always thought she was beautiful and the kicker is that she’s also one hell of a sweet girl. Friendly, funny, and she seems to appreciate my sense of humor. I know some beautiful people can be really self centered but she is not like that at all. But I’ve always figured she’s way out of my league so I’ve never asked her out or anything. Plus until last night she never gave me a sign she was interested.

So I turned toward their table to say hi because she and I have always gotten along really well and like I said she’s a super nice person. When I walked up she introduced me to her sisters who she was with. She said this is my friend Lexi’s brother. And one of her sisters says “This is the one you were telling us about, huh?” Vanessa seemed really embarrassed but her sisters laughed and one of them told me Vanessa talks about me a lot. Which was a shock to me.

So I spent the rest of the night hanging with Vanessa and she said yeah she has been hoping maybe I’d ask her out some time. She wanted to know why I haven’t and I told her it was because I always felt like she was out of my league. She just rolled her eyes and said that was crazy because she thinks I’m cute! That made my night. I didn’t even need to drink anymore because my head was spinning.

At the end of the night I asked her if she’d like to go out with me sometime and she said it was about time I asked. So we exchanged phone numbers. As we were walking out Vanessa asked if I was aware that my sister had been shipping us for a while now and I said I had no idea. Like how could I have been so clueless that this beautiful girl was into me? So she hugged me and gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to call her so we could figure out our plans. 

My buddies were trying to tell me not to call or text her right away and make her wait a few days. But I figured they’re mostly all a single so what do they know?

I thought I was going to be there for about 20 minutes tops, but...I swear he had me there for at least 45 minutes? Apparently, he was so taken with me that he gave me a discount that most other people don't get, I'm pretty sure. I did end up buying a product.

I was just thinking, though, he's like applying all this stuff to my face and yeah, of course, he has to in order to try it out and all, but...I feel pretty squeamish about most people touching my wrists or hands, let alone my face!

The way I was okay with him getting me to try all of that and that we just kept locking eyes a lot and there was a lot of tension on the air? I couldn't ignore it. I could tell he was flirting with me and I didn't hate it, so...I called him. Asked when he would be available to make plans next and...yeah.

I told him it was a date and it was really nice. He was so considerate, a good listener, affectionate, enthusiastic and stayed true to himself. I had not original intention for it, but we ended up having sex...at least four times from midnight to early morning.

I stayed at his place and he was all cuddly and sweet after each time we made love to each other. I feel like he really cares about and is very much attracted to me and vice versa and I couldn't ask for more, especially after that dumb situationship with that older guy who cut me off.

Oh, also, I happened to pass by him at the mall again today and we talked briefly about what was in te box before I left to go and that I hope I didn't seem too moody to him on the date, to which he said it was fine.

His coworker then pops up and says we look like a cute couple, insisted we take a photo together and at the count of 3, we would kiss each other on the lips.

This is around the time shops are closing, so there weren't too many people around, even if it was the weekend but yeah...this is still a public space and I did not mind that bit of PDA at all. I missed his lips. I really like him. I totally plan to go on more dates with him.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124389,public,self,He Made Love to Me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qopgye/he_made_love_to_me/,no_ads,0,,,

Here is my concern or worry that I want to be sure that we are 100% compatible(we haven't talked about sensitive topics like religion, politics, etc) before I make a move in case we break up or stop seeing each other because we don't agree on certain important issues. Am I being too picky? Or should we experience physical touch regardless if we talked about sensitive topics and stuff?

Example of a move:

\- go in for a hug

\- wrap my arms around her neck while we sit

\- go in for a peck on the cheek

\-  move her hair

So far, we feel very comfortable around each other. I don't see any red flags. we have talked about many things. She touched me numerous times. In fact, I feel like she wants me to touch her and do something.

Im currently living in Asia and she's living in the US. Once we matched we quickly moved onto snapchat as our primary means of communication. We hit it off right away and have been messaging everyday since we matched until now. I asked if we could become exclusive at the end of September and she agreed and that's still I guess the official label for us now. 

Obviously there is a time difference between us, but in the first few weeks we would basically have very long late night messaging sessions (her time 11pm -2am) everyday where we would chat for hours about everything, a couple through FaceTime and then she would sleep, and when she woke she would tell me and we would chat for a bit then she would go to work, by which time I would be sleeping. and then when I wake it would be her night time and we would chat again and repeat. 

To cut things short, in the first few weeks I told her that I had feelings for her, and she said she does as well. then after a while she said she has told all her friends about me and I told her same case with me too, She says that I basically live in her mind now as she always thinks of me, she's excited as to where this is heading, she told me she sees me more than a friend as we have a special connection and that this is the first time in a while that she's comfortable and genuinely happy talking with someone. Then a few weeks ago she told me that some guy messaged her and started flirting with her, and she told him to back off cuz she was uncomfortable and said that she had a bf to get him to stop. Then a few days laters I told her that I had a family friend who wanted to introduce her daughter to me, to which I responded no thanks I have a gf already. And her response was im really happy that you called me your gf even tho we are technically not dating yet. I said of course I would love for your to be my gf in the future, and she responded I would love for you to be my bf in the future too. She has also started calling me sweetheart and lovely as a nickname as of late and that she ""wants me in her future as well"". 

&amp;#x200B;

ok all the above sounds great and lovely, but here's where I see some potential red flags? making me a bit stressed/sad

&amp;#x200B;

**Minimal talking time** 

The first few weeks she was working part time, so we talked a lot especially at her night 11pm-2am. but around early October she became full time (9am-4pm shift) and our talking time has vastly reduced since. Basically our routine now is every day she wakes up 7am, she tells me I'm up, then doesn't message me till her break at work, by which time I will be asleep as it's 2 am for me, then she messages me after her work saying she's home and how works has been. I usually wake at 10 am, by which time she will either have sent me a message saying ""hi lovely, im heading to bed now, I hope your resting well and let me know how your day goes as I love waking up to your messages, ill let you know when I wake, goodnight from here 💕"". Either this or we talk for literally 10 mins max, like how's your day generic stuff, the conversation feels a bit hot and cold before I ask u heading to bed soon, and she says yes im feeling really tired and I have to get up early for work tmr and then the cycle repeats.

I know she has work everyday, waking up early and definitely very tiring and she says she likes working cuz it makes her feel productive, and gets her out of the house. But basically now we legit don't get to talk anymore or have those long convos, and every time we talk it feels like on borrowed time to be cuz she's ""tired"" and going to head to bed. She has had a few official rest days since working full time now, but the same thing happens. First time she went to this fair with her best friend and his fiancé, same routine no talk. second time she went to this wedding. Although before she was like I can't wait to show you my outfits and see what you think, and she actually sent me pics of her. and here I tried to talk to her for once via text, but she said she feels really bad that she's keeping me up and that I should go sleep as this was 2am for me. I was like its totally fine don't worry, we ended up talking for like 30 mins before I was like ok imma sleep and talk tmr ( I didn't wanna seem desperate). There was one day where she woke up sick and called off work. She told me in the morning that she was going to head back to bed, and when she woke we talked for a bit and I said r u gonna lunch, she said yea going to make it now. then after lunch she said im done and I thought we could talk but 30 sec in she said she's really tired and needed sleep so we ended there and same routine afterwards. but She has been saying she's sorry that we can't talk too much every now and again lately, and said we can definitely call this Sunday as she doesn't have work the next day. 

The thing is after she says she's heading to bed now at 10pm her time, (im not actively stalking her), but she's active on facebook as I can see from the messenger app until like 1am her time, and time to time she does post stuff on her page so I know she's awake. And objectively looking through our text everything seems normal, we both use 💕 emoji when we say goodnight and say we miss talking to each other, and like I hope you have a really good day today and we have never missed a day not doing this. She also is really supportive of me and wants to be here for be through both good times and bad times, she literally said this. 

I was thinking about this issue, so the other day I asked if everything was going aright with us, good pace and all, im probably over thinking haha. She said ""yea you are haha, im liking how its going so far"" Basically, am I being too clinging and overthinking everything ? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Her Depression / Anxiety**  

She's an introvert, a night owl like me and I guess that's why we connected. We both have got anxiety and depression but I think her depression and anxiety is a bit more serious than mine. She mentioned she was bullied in high school, and was in a dark place in her teens, suicidal if it wasn't for her dog and family. She says she has come a long way and feeling better now, and since meeting me she has been happier and that I make her toughest days easier to pass. She also says she has seasonal depression and that it sucks but it will go away on its own and does get panic attacks every now and then. She's also got a kind heart and likes helping her friends. 

However, this is where im a bit scared. As we are facebook friends I can see her page, and daily she shares memes/posts on her page, and some posts are like ""appreciate me while im still here, cuz I constantly wish I was dead"", or ""all it takes is one person to invalidate my feelings then boom I wanna take my own life"". Others are like ""right now I don't feel important in anyones life so ima back off"", or like memes about dark thoughts and depression in general. Now none of my friends post like this, so this is new to be but honestly im lost/a bit scared when I see this. Are these red flags / recipe for disaster if we do end up ""dating""? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Personality/ her past Relationships**  

She says she's been single for 2 years and been in four relationships, all of them local and have all been toxic/bad where it made her feel like she doesn't deserve happiness. In a post she made about dating her, she mentioned that she's been told she's ""hard to love, gets distracted a lot or will talk your ear off and apologise afterwards. That I have a lot of trauma, annoying, will ask you 1000x if you love me. That my anxiety and depression hurts her brain, thus I tries to go slow with relationship but that I would dump a lot and feel extremely guilt when I do it. basically I have a lot of problems, been in a lot of bad relationships so I guard myself to keep me happy and safe"". 

She's also asexual as well where she feels minimal to no sexual attraction, but she does feel romantic attraction, and when I asked about whether she would have sex she said it would only maybe happen with someone I wholeheartedly trust and love, and only in a relationship. so short answer is maybe. And for myself I am straight.

But some good news I guess is that she has said she was down for a long distance relationship, and that in she is now looking for a serious relationship to marriage (I asked what she was looking for in the start). And I am in the same boat with her here . 

Nonetheless, am I full on walking into a trap here in terms of dating her cuz she's literally saying ""I have a lot of problems"" and ""will probably dump you""?

&amp;#x200B;

**Meeting up** 

Now I am going to the US next year July to see family, and I mentioned to her that we could meet up when we first started talking. Now, this has turned into an actual plan kind of, where I would fly to her state and stay in her town for a week next year. For this, she has now said she can't wait to see me a lot and that every time she thinks of this it makes her very happy. And when I said I can't wait to take you out on a dinner date for real, she was like that'll be very cute. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Our future?**

Now she's basically going to work between now and July next year, which is what she is doing now, and then from July start her undergrad for 4 years in the state she is living in now and then maybe do a masters after that of which this is still undecided. Whereas I have 1 year left on my masters before I then join the work force in the country I am in now next year. Now objectively looking, if we are to date, we will have to be doing long distance for at least 3 years before I can earn enough to move to the US and be with her or vice versa. Which ever way you put it we will not be physically together for 3 years at least. Now even in the most perfect of situation this will be hard, but given all of the above I guess I have now answered my own question in the title of this post? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

Girl and I matched on bumble mid sept and messaging everyday since. I live in Asia and she lives in the US. For the first few weeks we talked a lot, especially long late night text sessions every-night her time. In mid October she became full time, and we barely talk. Every time we do talk its very quick as she's always about to sleep or heading off to work now. But she is showing all good signs, like she sees me more than a friend, very happy/comfrotable around me, and all her friends know about me and wants me to be her boyfriend in the future. But she has depression anxiety, perhaps some relationship issues and we are going to be needing to do long distance for a few years before we can even think about being together physically.

I taught some girls how to skiball, challenged a few to air hockey, talked to a few girls, somewhat danced with a group I kind of got adopted into by a drunk guy and almost made it on to the dance floor!!!! I missed an opportunity to ask for a number but that's ok I was having fun and I haven't had this much fun since before the pandemic! thanks to the people who told me my objective should be to have fun it helped a lot with the social anxiety!

I'm definitely going again next weekend who knows maybe it'll result in a date! I have to say going out to these places and putting myself out there is making me love dating again! so you know what? fuck it last night was a success because I came out of my shell and I feel less jaded now.

I also have 3-5 games I can challenge girls to 

1. Air Hockey, I had girls laughing so hard with this one it'll be the best game to break the ice to though I'm wearing ear plugs next time!
2. Skiball!, turns out I'm a good skiball player even while high
3. Mario Kart! this one is perfect for if I want to get myself in a group as I tend to go alone and this is the least awkward game to kind of work my way in!
4. basketball, yeah I suck but it's about getting her to laugh and have fun for that some embarrassment is needed.
5. keeping with my theme of showing that I'm ok with being embarrassed throwing balls to knock some clown dolls over is fun! 

this is definitely my scene it's still by all definition a club (I hate dancing and excessively loud music) but there's more than just dancing, so now I found my hunting grounds time to go out and meet some more girls my goal for next week is work my way into a group and/or have a girl on my arm the entire night!

I’ll use the most recent situation as an example but this kind of applies to pretty much every situation I’ve ever been in when I like a girl. 

I am a bit older than than this girl I recently met. We go to different colleges but we met through mutual friends cuz I needed help with a certain subject she’s really good in. I guess our friends have been saying we would be a good match since before I even knew she existed or ever reached out. 

When we met it seemed like all the pieces were there. In fact I was the one who was a little slow to acknowledge I was developing feelings. She was always excited to see me, intentionally put herself really close to me. We’d talk about things in common and everything was just easy. When she’d leave, we’d have a farewell hug which she would always linger on. 

Each time we saw each other it only became more apparent. At least that’s what I thought. Things escalated little by little until we were having more intimate hugs rather than friend hugs, which she would always leave basically glowing after. My therapist said be direct so when we were setting up this weeks study time, I asked if she wanted to come with me when I take my family’s dog for a nature walk after. 

She ignored the text for 2 days. I didn’t bother her about it or bring it up again. After work on Friday I texted her just saying like hey just seeing if we’re still on to study Sunday. She said she’s getting sick and will keep me updated but may not be up for it. I said No worries. Ya just lmk. Hope u feel better. 

Now Sunday has come (today), and obviously I haven’t heard from her. It’s still early and I’m not stressing it either way. I’m not devastated. I’m more worried about studying tbh. But it’s just like every time I like a girl it seems they’re really into me, things are going really well and escalating steadily, etc. Then when an actual offer/invitation is made, everything falls apart and it stops dead in its tracks. 

I’m not gonna lose sleep over it but it’s a little confusing is all. I get not everyone will like me and I’m cool with that. I get it won’t always work out and I accept that too obviously. I’m just trying to figure out what I could do differently to improve things in the future. I feel like walking a dog is about as low-pressure, low-investment, “not a big deal” type of thing. 

I even gave her an out and followed it up with “or do you have stuff going on after?”. Directly and indirectly indicating that it’s perfectly fine either way. When asking to study after being ignored I also said “nothing’s changed on my end” meaning my plans but also our studying arrangements. Like everything can be normal between us still. 

This is a common theme and it has improved over the years but essentially all but 2 situations have taken this exact path and both of those were sort of inherently different and filled with dependence on their end.

So I have been seen this guy (38) for 7 weeks. I’m 35.
We see each other once a week or so.
So there was Halloween party at his friends house and I wasn’t invited.
I automatically asked what’s the reason he’s going alone and that I’d love to come but he didn’t want to take me with him for some reason.
So I realized that he doesn’t want me there.
I said ok. 

I do understand we are not officially together and not gf and bf but we are dating and this made me feel he doesn’t want me to be his date at the party  .

So I asked him again a few days ago let’s do something Saturday night and he said he’s going out for his friends birthday.
And he didn’t invite me ….. again.
I don’t understand why he is not making me a part of his life and it makes me feel i am not important to him at all.
He also post stories on Instagram knowing I want to be there with him.

I told him a few times that I truly like him, that I want more , that I want a relationship, love , affection and if he’s not feeling it I’m fine just let me know, he said yes sure I want more too. 

I have met a few of his friends when we just first met with him at the boat party.they were there too. It was a different setting with hundreds of ppl

We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I realize that  I have a bit of a crush on her, and so I start to pay attention to her out the corner of my eye. Thats when I notice she stares back, and its quite a lot. There will be times where if her friends make a joke, she'll start laughing, and turn her head away from her friends to look at me. If she leans over to get something out of her bag, she'll look, she'll look over her shoulder if she passes me in the hall, her eyes will linger for a moment if she looks over to the whiteboard, and sometimes she'll just stare for a few seconds. This goes on for about 2-3 weeks before I do anything.

In one of my classes (physics), we are free to work with whoever on assignments, and she sat with a few of my friends so I went over to her table. I could get her to laugh a few times, but its when everyone else did so I don't know if that was too special. We have to present to the class how to solve assignments on the worksheet with our groups, so the whole class gets to ask questions and know the process of the problem. When i'm over there, I ask the group at large if I should stay there to present with them or go back to my table, and she's the first one to tell me to stay. There is another girl at that table, and she'd look at me instead of the other girl when the other girl was talking to see how much I was listening to the other girl, though I hardly talked to the other girl. She'll turn and talk to me if I end up next to her before class, and there was a time when one of my friends invited me over to her table, and she was leaning over the table to see if I was coming.

So I see all of these signs, and one day after a class where I went over to her table I ask for her number. She gives it to me, and I text her that weekend. No response. I check with one of our mutual friends that it is the correct number, and it is, but that friend said that sometimes she hasn't gotten a response either. When she first gave me her number, I immediately sent a text so she had my number, but she saw me send that text, so she knows it's me. The issue is, now we've moved seats in physics so I don't have a excuse to go talk to her, she doesn't sit with my friends anymore. 

About a week later, still no response, so I ask her after class if she got the text. The text was a question about soccer since we both play soccer, and she said she got the text but was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back, and just forgot.  The weird thing is, that week she still was staring a lot. She was glancing over a lot in the first class, and when she had to give thoughts on the poem she was looking at me out the corner of her eye the whole time, and not the teacher (the teacher is in one corner of the room, and I am on the same wall but other corner, and she sits in the middle of the opposite side but facing me). She did that any time when she had to share thoughts in that class last week. In physics, she's glancing over a lot too, and one time when I was presenting with my new group, she was leaning over her table to watch, and didn't do that for other groups. We also were in the hall with our groups one class, and I was behind her group, and she repeatedly looked over her should back at my group, and when I moved to her other shoulder, she started looking over that shoulder.

She is a shy person, she'll talk really quiet when presenting or meeting new people, but she's not shy around friends and not shy around me.

Is she interested but really nervous? She is shy, but I wouldn't guess that shy, and its not like I'm weird looking or interesting enough that she'd stare for weeks and not get bored, so idk what she's staring at if she's not gonna text back.

You’re also trying to tell us that we’re too stupid to clearly see what we see, or if we really experienced what we’ve experienced. If I’ve been called ugly ever since I was 7, obviously it’s not my self esteem holding me back the most, it’s my appearance.

While I get a healthy stream of matches with quality conversations/video dates/phone calls, most disappear before actually making plans to meet, and when I get dates, I'm either not feeling it or it's amicable that we're both not interested.

Given all my experience with dating apps as someone who lives in a mid-sized metropolitan suburban area, I've come to realize that the reason why apps result in more discouragement than success is because we just don't come across the kind of people we'd actually like to meet. I would love to just meet someone in real life, but like many out there, dating apps are my best shot since I'm a grown adult, my friends live further away these days, and as I mentioned, I'm newish to my area, plus this is not like NYC where you can find groups or hang out in places where people who have more niche interests similar to you are everywhere. 

That said, I think the main reasons why dating apps don't work for most people is because...

* You need to have mega basic interests. Not to be judgmental of others, but when you go on a dating app, it usually seems that the people with the most conformed interests and hobbies have an easier time meeting people, and when you live in somewhere that isn't a huge city, that tends to be the majority of people on these apps. If you're not very into those things, it can feel like you're an alien in your own surroundings.
* That said, if you are someone with more niche interests, hobbies, or lifestyle, the only places where that really pans out well with dating apps are big cities where there's more diversity and eclecticism. The closest big city to me is an hour away (more so if you add the traffic headaches on the regular) and I get way more likes and matches from women out there than I do locally, which has honestly made me consider moving closer there (I just hate the high cost living and traffic.)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124521,public,self,"For most of us, the people we want to meet won't be found on some dating app",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qou2k8/for_most_of_us_the_people_we_want_to_meet_wont_be/,no_ads,0,,,

Things didn't work out between us and we stopped talking after a few weeks. He was very sexual from our first conversation, and told me after our first date that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be dating if it was good. I told him that I don't want to have sex with someone that I only knew for around a few weeks and he said that we should go our separate ways. I got a little clingy when he said that. I was afraid to lose this guy who liked me so much, and I begged him to give me another chance. He said that I was acting crazy and that I made him lose all those feelings that he had for me, and that he might be able to get them back if he could have sex with me. I told him that I still didn't want to have sex with someone that I didn't know that well, and he said that I was being stubborn, and we stopped talking.

I've been struggling to move past this since it happened, going back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me, to feeling like I ruined things with this guy that could see himself spending his life with me and who could be my perfect match.

I was virgin and lost it to him. I had sex with him **purely** because I wanted to try it, I did expect him to be a fuckboy, didn’t do it in hopes of getting serious with him or anything.

He invited to watch a movie but I told him I’m not promising we’ll have sex. He said it’s fine and didn’t make any rough moves. I made the move for sex.

We’re both in our early 20s.

The sex was great, he was very attentive and tried to please me. I spent the night afterwards at his place, we talked a lot about life. He told me he could drop me off home in the morning. Well, he didn’t mention it in the morning, which was a 🚩 for me. 

I’ve always heard that guys show how they feel about you with their actions. 

Before even coming to his place that day, he hinted I could come with the bus even though I asked him if he could take me from the city center. He did eventually offer to take me to his place by himself. I was hesitant at this point already, but I knew he’s in it from the sex as he’s low effort. The first date he did put in effort (paid for the stuff, was respectful etc.)

**So the dilemma is** : the sex was good and I’d like to do it again to practice more and gain some experience, he was respectful and nice, but I really got the ick from the way his words and actions didn’t align, mostly the car ride promise. 

I feel like if I continue to see him (although only for sex), it would feel almost degrading knowing that he almost tests me how far I’m letting him go with this? Or do I put too much pressure on the fact that at night he promised the ride, but when he saw it’s bit far, he didn’t take the topic up in the morning?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124524,public,self,"Slept with a Tinder guy on the 2nd movie date, the sex was good, but his actions turn me off.

For context the three of us are all US ex-pats that have been living overseas for a couple+ years. We ended up talking to a couple of very cute women who were in line with us and one took an immediate liking to one of my friends and but the other one was harder to read but eventually took a liking to me. It wasn't obvious at first but we ended up barhopping and they followed us from bar to bar. All in all they probably spent about 4+ hours with us talking, dancing, asking us questions etc. 

At the last bar the one I was talking too eventually got quite touchy to the point of hugging me with her hands around my waist and we made some witty banter on how we should grab drinks just us 2. She said of course and gave me her number but not before she made sure that I'm not just a tourist who's gonna leave in a few days and that I actually live in the city because she's not looking for anything short term. We end up going back inside and dancing and making out intensely for a good long while (with my friend and her friend following suit). 

I end up walking her home with no expectations (tbh her apt was on the way to mine anyways) and sit on the bench outside her apartment. Its 2:30am making out for a good 20 minutes even after I told her we should go get some sleep she still wouldn't let me go home and kept kissing me and complimenting me. Sex wasn't on the table nor do I think I was even slightly pushy about it. 

Eventually we do part ways and I text her something simple later afternoon the next day  so we can plan a date. Its been more than a day with no response which I find odd for a girl that seemed so into me. I did learn the next day that my friend may have been kinda awkward and screwed up with her friend on the walk home (nothing major he just kinda gave her a soft rejection at the end and called her a cab home) but I don't see why it would affect the decision of the girl I was with. She's obviously very cute - a personal trainer that also works at one of the most chic/exclusive bars in the city so she must get hit on all the time. Maybe she was just drunk and regretted her decision the next day? If she did she held her alcohol very well.

I (F20) met this guy (M23) last year, and thought we had a good connection. He came over I made him dinner (never doing that for a first date) and we watched a movie and he slept over cause it was late. We had sex and after I had that feeling where I knew he wasn’t interested cause he stopped putting in effort so I unfollowed him off social media and stopped talking to him. I noticed he still kept following me and watching my stuff but a couple months after I noticed he had a girlfriend. He still watched my stories but I didn’t think anything of it. They’ve been together for like 8 months and during halloween weekend he messaged me asking where the after party was at. I didn’t know if they broke up cause I don’t follow him but I was bored and haven’t been talking to any men so I entertained the conversation. We were talking for a couple of days till yesterday when he said he has a girlfriend and just wants to be friends. I’m confused. We met once a year ago and he has a girlfriend yet he wants fo be friends? We’re basically strangers and he recently moved to my country when we first met so he probably doesn’t have many friends but still. Like for me if I had a boyfriend I loved and cared for I wouldn’t be interested in making friends with a hookup from a year ago. I’m so confused cause he started the conversation yet only wants to be friends. I told him good luck with your relationship but being friends would just be awkward for me. Can anyone help me figure out what his motive was cause my head is spinning. Do men actually think we can be friends after they treated us shit? This isn’t the first time someone I hooked up with came back months later asking to be friends, same with my ex. Even with my ex like there’s no chance I would’ve gotten back with him romantically. To me if someone wastes my time being friends is completely out of the question. 

Same thing happened this summer, a guy I really liked moved and he stopped talking to me as much. When I ended things he asked why we can’t be friends and I told him I don’t have feelings for any of my friends and ended it. I really liked this guy, maybe even loved but there’s no way I would’ve been happy being friends. He called me like once a week and barely reached out unless I did. I feel like Im a good person, super friendly it just sucks that none of them want to put in any effort. I know I deserve someone who wants me more than a friend it’s just tiring being told they want me in their life as a friend. How do you guys deal with men like this?

Is addicted to the whole game, while portraying that he is looking for something serious, he is not as he knows thats what to say to get them hooked. After they get ""clingy"" he does the whole ""I'm not ready for a relationship at this time, blah, blah, blah"" and moves on. I've told him not cool on many occasions and would leave it be, not my problem but for the fact that it's so many women and he refuses to wear a condom! How do I help them?
I'm not on any of these apps, do I create a profile and try to message these women(I know his type). Just cutting him off as a friend is not an option as that doesn't help anyone? Can I report his behavior to these sites without being a member, would they even take it seriously?
Do I leave it all alone? It's this exact behavior that is making it hard to date for the rest of us...constructive advise appreciated.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124530,public,self,My friend is using women on dating apps!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qovig2/my_friend_is_using_women_on_dating_apps/,no_ads,0,,,

I went home, waited a few hours and texted her “Hey Jane, it’s Alex. How’s ur day going so far?” This was something I found on google so I just went  with it. 6 hours later, she still didn’t reply so I sent something like this “Aight lol that first text was lame, I was too distracted by your beauty and had to spend an hour lookup up best first texts to send to a girl. How about we go out this weekend to some place cool?” 3 hours later she responded something like  “aww thank you:) i was at work so didn’t see ur text. i work this weekend tho so probably not, sorry”. I didn’t think this meant anything as I understood she was probably busy with her job. So I asked if she wanted to go somewhere during the weekdays after school or even next weekend. She didn’t reply to that message at all ( been 24 hours so far). So I went outside, took a pic of the sky with the caption “Have u ever wondered why we barely see any stars” and sent it to her as a snap. That was last night. This morning I woke up, still no reply from her. An hour ago, she replied to my snap with “Because there are a lot of buildings” something like that. Now I feel awkward as I was expecting her to say something like “no, tell me”. But now if I respond to that snap saying you’re wrong I’m worried I might come off as rude. But she still hasn’t replied to my text asking her to go out during the weekdays. Do I snap her back something else with the caption “btw have u seen my text yet”? Or do I just completely change the topic and snap her something else? I really like this girl and wanna date her and would love some guidance on how to continue. FYI I barely know her from class, i straight out just asked for her number “Hey can I get your number if you wanna hang out sometime” and she was like sure and gave it to me.
