Dating has been a living nightmare for me, because I can not go out and mingle like other guys can.  Yes, I also live with my parents, which is hindering me from finding my soulmate, as well.

Yes, I know I'm posting this in the ""Dating over 40"" group, but to be honest, I find older women wiser more mature.

My hobbies are reading books like ""Harry Potter"", and books by John Grisham; playing card games; playing dominoes; watching birds; and being online finding recipes.

Other activities I enjoy doing are watching tv, going to the movies, going out to eat, going to the beach, shop, and going on vacations.  I am pretty limited on things I can do because of my cerebral palsy.  I do try to workout a little bit, though.

I do not smoke.  I do not do drugs, but I do have a glass of wine a couple of times a year on Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I hope I can find a woman who is kind, gentle, loving, caring, sincere, understanding, funny, and loves to cuddle.  If you want to talk, I'm here! 🙂

At some point this summer, the ex decided to take herself off her meds for Bipolar 1, and over the last 3+ weeks she’s gone off the rails. She even got arrested on Labor Day. I now have had my kids for 4 straight weeks, which in turn has not allowed me to spend time freely with the woman I’ve been dating off and on for the last 11 months. We’re both single parents with our kids most of the time, so best we can expect is a date every 2 weeks, sometimes an extra date sprinkled in. Hence, the slow moving relationship.

My parents offered to take my kids this Saturday afternoon and overnight to give me a break. Naturally I reached out to her yesterday about getting together. She texted me back to say she had tentative plans with her sister, but was also apprehensive about spending time with me due to the behavior of my ex. 

I understand her position, as one never knows what a truly crazy ex will do while in this state. The last thing I want is for crazy to finally learn of this woman’s existence and harass her like she’s harassed me and members of my family over the last month. It made me think about whether I just do her the favor and walk away since it could be weeks or more before this mess cleans up in court, etc. I also wonder if she’s holding back saying she wants to distance herself from the situation just to avoid kicking me while I’m down. I mean—this is going to be my life until my kids are adults. 

The timing of all this really sucks because our relationship seemed to have started to progress finally. I admit, I’m missing her, but I don’t want to be bread-crumbed either. Wondering if the right thing to do for us both is ""set her free"" or just let her decide for herself by outright telling her it's ok if she does wish to step away. Afterall, she has every right to to meet someone new and not have the potential of this drama in her life.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pq25nm/do_i_make_the_hard_decision_for_us_both_and_let/

I recently went through a divorce. I have spent the past few months working on myself. Reading, exercising, eating healthy and seeing a therapist.

Over the years we have tried to contact each other and it just never seemed to be the right time for one reason or another. She tells me she is divorced and is now in a difficult relationship with a verbally abusive alcoholic. I confess my love for her. We talk daily and it seems as though she is leaving her guy. I decide one day to send flowers to her work. I still remembered she likes lilies. We then set a date to meet. We meet at a park and sit next to a nice pond. We talk for an hour and catch up with work and kids stuff. Then out of nowhere I lean in and kiss her. It was so soft and slow. We held this kiss for what felt like an eternity. We pull back and look in each other’s eyes. I brush her hair back, caress her cheek and kiss her again. This time I feel her mouth open slightly and then our tongues meet and begin to play back and forth. At this point I am numb! This is what I was missing all these years. I knew instantly that something special was happening and so did she. We part ways and continue to text. Here comes the big red flag! I dug into her Facebook page and find out that she is engaged to her guy. Now this goes against every fiber of my being! I confront her and she tries to play it off as he will be gone soon.

I do not have kids. He has his teenage kids full time and they are… a lot. Their mom moved away and they need a lot of attention and course correction. One has severe depression. 

He comes to see me every 4 months or so. I don’t go there because the logistics would be weird. (But I recognize that I should go). 

I’ve called it off a handful of times because I don’t see a future in 2,3 or 4 years. He wants to move here, get married etc but that hinges on the fact that the oldest kid (19) will launch. The younger kid (16) wants to move here and is eager for a fresh start. He keeps telling me to just be patient, it will all work out. I’m having a very hard time with it mostly due to the lack of communication surrounding all of this. 

I have spent zero time with either of the kids. We’ve only ever talked on the phone. I can tell the younger kid is annoyed by me. 

So, today my bf announces that he HAS to bring his daughter the next time he comes out. That he has promised her and he just wants to “get her off his back”.

News to me. 

This is a huge red flag to me. I feel like an absolute jerk saying no, but I am not comfortable at all with this and how he didn’t even ask me.

Then he proceed to asked me if I have been intimate with anyone when we broke up… I answered yes, and he flew off the handled and accused me of cheating on him. I told him we were broken up with no future to get back. He now threatening to get a restraining order on me if I try to make contact with him to talk.

It seems like every time we start to get close and I think the relationship is going somewhere he seems to pull back. He will not see me for the weekend or longer. Becomes distant with texting and calling. He went to a funeral on Friday, so when he sent a text Friday night that he just wanted to be alone I understood. However, I never heard from him again until after 5 pm Sunday night.  By then I was a bit upset, as this is textbook for him. The weeks prior were great. We spent several weekends together. We even shared the ""I love you"" a few times those weekends. We've been dating/courting since April. I mentioned mid week last week that I was probably time for him to meet my 14 yr old son. I explained that my son deserves to put a face with a name, especially if I'm going to continue to stay over at his house. Of course, I said ""only if this is something you are ready for"". He agreed he should meet my son. Maybe it was too much,  I don't  know? I mean, it's been like 6 months since we started dating? 
When he pulled back this weekend and contacted me Sunday evening I ignored the text for several hours, because I just didn't know how to respond. Also, the text was an article link about Dodger baseball game occurrence, no message (Which i felt was sent to see how or if I would respond). When I didn't after two hours he called, and I did not answer. 
I text about an hour later that I wasn't in the mood to talk. That I was bummed on how the weekend played out and tired of feeling as if I was at peoples disposal. Said ""maybe I'll be up for a phone conversation tomorrow"". 
Am I the one overreacting or am I in a one sided relationship? Being this confused is not a good sign for this relationship, but I do love our time when we are together. He mentioned early on that he doesn't get close to people. Was that said to be used as an out when convenient or warning that he takes a really long time to build trust with?

We get on really well and laugh and have a great time together. She was telling me that she is going on a health drive and going to join the gym.

The ones I have have told me how much they want an intelligent woman but they actually don’t like it when I consistently figure things out before them or make more money than them, and their upset over these things seems to build until they’re clearly really bruised over me figuring out stuff before they do. And I keep my thoughts to myself more often than not when they’re trying to figure something out - I’ll just leave it alone.

My first date turned into a 7 hour marathon and it was the most comfortable and relaxing first date I've ever had.

86,psd7wf,1632206118,Dad (41) with full custody of my three young children. What are my potential dating realities?,"I just found out that my ex is in a serious long term relationship.  Our divorce isn't even finalized, but we have been separated for a year now.  I hadn't really considered dating yet, but I guess this new information about my ex has just got me curious about my own potential for 'getting back out there' when I'm ready.


I just don't know when I'd have the time.  My kids are 7, 6, and 18 mos.  I work from home but my job is hectic and the hours can be erratic.  Just keeping up with school and daycare schedules alone is exhausting.  My parents stay with me most of the week to help me out (I am sooo lucky to have them) but even so, I have hardly any time to myself.  This is ok with me- I am grateful that I have legal and physical custody (my ex only gets one day a week visit, no sleepovers) and I prefer to have my kids over any other relationship, but I guess I do wonder if I'll ever have a chance to meet and connect with someone and develop a relationship.


Of course there's the desire for physical/romantic connection. It makes me feel pervy/creepy to say out loud to strangers on the internet, but I would like to touch and to feel a woman in a trusting and intimate way again.  I can't help but think, though, what do I have to offer for a woman? A life of 'instant mom'?  Homework and diapers and 'ok, after we clean up dinner and get the kids to bed I have to work for a few more hours, don't wait up'. 


Please give me the hard truths.  Should I take the idea of dating off the table at least until my kids are older?  It's been so long since I've dated, and I wasn't even very good at it when I was younger and better looking...  

Or is it possible to find the time to date and still give your children all the time and attention they need?  If so, where do people meet? Do a lot of people wind up meeting other single parents by way of being involved with school or other kids activities?  Do people or age use the dating apps?

88,pshxha,1632228106,Varying availability?,"Hey All

Recently been reflecting on availability and expectations in dating.  I am the proud owner of a new puppy and my desire to date has completely bottomed out.  She is going to require a lot of time as she is a working spaniel and I am intending on having her trained for sporting. So it's gonna be at least 1-2 years of intense training and then a lifetime of long walks.  (Who needs the gym!)   Anyway... since she has come into my life a man I have been speaking to daily has also had a change of circumstances and is back to work and our schedules don't seem to align (he is in another timezone as well).  I think up till this time I would have expected daily contact (attachment style and make that pretty blunt up frupfrontont.)  Now I see how I am not really doing this myself as life has just gotten BUSY.  

So to my questions:

1. Do you expect daily contact from your matches in the early stages? If this dies out have you been able to keep anything going or just let it go as to when life is less full.
2. Do you feel it's better not to date when big life changes come up?  (think job change, move, new pet etc

Anyway... random Tuesday pondering but hey!

All I ever wanted was a wife and kids, I’m 42M, never married and I haven’t even kissed a girl in 14 years. I’m ugly and have no chance of changing my situation. I think maybe I’m better off just ending this. My days are full of torment, I have no one to talk with. My family don’t want to know me. I have zero desire to travel alone. If I had a job or a house I could Atleast do some gardening or renovations, I just wonder if others think about checking out? I have no one to leave my stuff to, I don’t take photos any more. I think 42 is long enough to know I’m not wanted. Do others who wanted a partner and kids think like this?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pshzsy/when_to_give_up_completely/
90,psj00u,1632231791,When it comes to dating there is either chemistry or there is not. I think it’s bad advice to tell someone to give someone a chance and see where things go if there is no chemistry to begin with. Also this IS the right thing to do.

I know I said I wanted to spend more time with u to get to know u better but u seemed like u were closed off to that on put me in the ""only sex"" category because I am dating 😂
[9/20, 13:58] Rukiya: That was strange to me...not gonna lie
[9/20, 13:58] Rukiya: Anyways enjoy your day off!
[9/20, 14:50] Nik: I will, going to get Neven now. I am open to doing things outside of the bedroom with you.
[9/20, 14:51] Nik: My thing is what do you have to offer to me that you don't offer anyone else?
[9/20, 14:52] Nik: I am selective about who I give my time and energy to, and thats what I prefer in a potential mate.
[9/20, 14:52] Nik: You aren't just dating...you are fu****g
[9/20, 15:05] Rukiya: There you go again with your mysogynistic and degrading point of view of women. You have said it a number of times now and it is not for me. I do not think we are a match. I definitely need someone who is open minded and forward thinking. How is someone supposed to judge if a guy is a match without sex?!? I guess you want a virgin 😂😂😂 Lol I hope you find what you are looking for.

So for some context we met via OLD, had an"" interesting"" evening after wine and pizza and this was the exchange the next day. Neven is my son.

Side Note: The wine was excellent  Tesero della Regina a Pinot Grigio if you like whites, I totally recommend it.

He had a short term fling with this woman and now he has a baby. His other kid is 9 years old. My kids are 14 and 12. I really like this guy but I'm not sure I'm up for 17 more years of helping raise kids (plus all baggage...baby mamas). I'm so disappointed as I was really falling for this man. Don't know what to do. I've known him about a year but we stopped dating and then got back together.

Dinner that later turned to drinks and some dancing.  We felt a connection and the next day we spent the entire day and much of the evening together!

Since then our relationship has evolved to something beautiful!  She’s an amazing woman and we inspire each other to excel, be better.  We’ve both said the three words “I love you”. 

Wanted to share my story.  It’s a great feeling, it’s great to be with someone that shares the same values and interests as you do. 

Sharing positive happy vibes.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/psr0cd/matched_about_six_months_ago_and_its_great/
