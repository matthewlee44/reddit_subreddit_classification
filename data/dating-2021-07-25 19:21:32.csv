1,ornjz8,1627259041,"I‚Äôm hung up on a non-relationship, but it‚Äôs a bit more complicated.","So I know I am definitely one of those people who have fallen victim to this in the past‚Ä¶.being hung up on someone I was never actually in a relationship with because I got a taste of all that was good and never got a chance to see the bad. Now that I‚Äôm 28, I‚Äôm a little more aware. 

Having said that, here‚Äôs some backstory: 
Started seeing this guy (37) who I bonded with immediately. We were definitely on the same page and expressed a sense of comfortability with the other person we haven‚Äôt really experienced before. Talked about marriage, kids and values a lot so we knew we were both looking to pursue something serious. Unfortunately he lives 3hrs away, but would come back home (where I live) pretty frequently because of family. A little over a month into dating, his mother, who he‚Äôs very close with, got sick. I of course offered support. He kept me updated pretty often about what was going on with her, but the worse her condition got the more distant and scattered he became, which was understandable. I continued to offer any support I could from a distance since we couldn‚Äôt really see each other. 

In the end, his mom ended up passing away pretty unexpectedly since she wasn‚Äôt responding to the chemo. This all went down within the span of 6 months. During all of this we also talked a lot about me moving to where he is because I actually really enjoy the town he‚Äôs in. So there was an insane amount going on. Currently I‚Äôm just waiting to buy a house, but it‚Äôs slim pickings right now. 

Anyway about a month after his mom passed, I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in a couple weeks so I reached out just to offer my support and let him know I was thinking about him. It was a short, difficult, but reasonable conversation that essentially ended with a goodbye for now. What I got out of it was he is understandably not in the right headspace to begin a relationship with anyone. I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be an appropriate time either. 

There was an implication that he still wants to see me, we just don‚Äôt know when. I guess it‚Äôs just hard having feelings for someone when things are so up in the air and not being able to see them. I also can‚Äôt directly ask him to define things because I feel like it would be insensitive given all he‚Äôs been through. I know he needs time to process, but I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out how to cope.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ornjz8/im_hung_up_on_a_nonrelationship_but_its_a_bit/
2,ornk96,1627259071,is it too soon to move on?,"My ex boyfriend and I broke up almost three months ago. We dated for nine months in total and we had a very positive and fulfilling relationship, there were just too many differences in values to make it long term. We broke up immediately after realizing this as we decided it would be better to salvage a friendship out of it rather than drag it out until we hated each other. Our break up wasn't rocky but we had our fair share of meltdowns and calling each other for support. The last time we did this was about two weeks ago, he (25M) and I (22F) decided we had to stop otherwise we would never move on. I encouraged him to go see other people and I would do the same despite how wrong it felt in the moment. I was visiting my family in Canada at the time (I live in Chicago) so it was kind of the perfect time to dip my toes in the dating game again without any kind of real commitment. I decided to download tinder and ended up matching with this guy named Riz. Riz is exactly my type and I was immediately attracted to him. We went on a date the next day and despite both of us saying we weren't looking for anything serious we hit it off and mutually agreed this could go somewhere. I've since left Canada and have been back in Chicago for about a week now. We have called, facetimed, and texted every day since then and our feelings are growing stronger. Despite all of this, I can't help but feel a little guilty. While nine months really isn't that long in the grand scheme of things I'm not the type to hop from one relationship to another. I was my ex's first love and I know that even though we are broken up it would hurt him to see me with someone else. I care about him so much that it would hurt to see him hurt. I'm having a hard time dealing with all of this and there is a part of me that feels like three months is too soon but I really like Riz and want to give it a fair shot I just feel guilty. Do you think that three months is too soon or is it an appropriate amount of time? If things get any more serious I would have to tell my ex (we agreed that we would tell the other one if things got serious with someone else) and just the thought of that gives me insane anxiety. That was his idea, not mine. Give me your opinions and thoughts please, to alleviate my guilt or validate it lol.

11,oro2lg,1627260972,Texting/communicating long distance,"I already knew him, but we've been in different cities because of covid. I guess I'm not a ""text everyday"" type person, and I dont know how to handle this. I‚Äôd rather talk in person. I dont know how to get deeper over text.

I never thought i could keep something up like this...pandemic has changed that. It's been 1.5 years and we are still going. I'm not used to distance, but he's better at it and likes to text. 

When i was younger, i felt like i used to text guys I was seeing SO much that i would have nothing to left to say in person. So i have this mentality, years later, that it's better to use texting to make plans and thats it. But it's a different situation if we are apart, and I forget how to have those crazy long conversations anymore. But i feel like he wants to, and i get stressed now if the conversation doesnt last.

We have a few nerdy interests in common, they are things that really help me feel like myself.  Sometimes that's what's carried the conversation, or sexting.

He's trying not to get separated from his band who are in Perth with him, but he also has his best friend here in Melbourne and wants to come back. I think its even more tedious, cause its been a few times where we thought he would come here, but pandemic stopped it. We are in Aus, so borders closed or someone gets stuck in lockdown. I'm in lockdown right now. There have been a few months in a row where I was like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I'll talk to him in person later this month!‚Äù but then NOPE more cases came up....more texting...again. Aug was looking like the next date he could come, but not with this current outbreak in Vic. He's supposed to come to play a show, but even if we are out of lockdown, the venue restrictions are gonna mean his show is getting postponed again.

He made a comment at me insinuating that texting was short or something, or maybe that there was a break for a week. I know he wasnt taking a stab, but it really got to me. I'm stressing about my communication.

Does he think we can‚Äôt talk about anything? Does he think i cant get deep? I thought I WAS talking. Now I'm afraid it's only sex that Im able to keep up over text. Sexting is easier, but chatting I hold back a lot. But it hasnt been nothing at the same time. This is messing with me. Sometimes when i reach out, he'll continue later the same day, or the next day. But when its my turn to initiate, I still leave it a few more days. I dont know, I get afraid my day was too boring to talk about, I  literally do nothing, it's lockdown...

I also still have a lot of hard stuff going on mentally, and i withdraw when that happens. Texting is hard to do when i feel like that. And its not because I dont want to talk. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so fucking anxious and distance is hard.

We've had a big chat about it before. Earlier this year, I actually had a freakout because I didnt know whether I could trust he wasnt a fuckboy (I didnt say it like that), and it turned out he was really upset that I felt hurt. (I got him on the phone for it, so I could really hear the tone)

He even said at that point things like ‚Äúi feel like this has brought us closer‚Äù and ‚Äúyou need to tell me, dont let things build up!‚Äù - really understanding and nice things. This is when he told me he loves texting. But I still feel like this stuff is easier in person. Ever since then, he admits sometimes when he's not having the best day. It feels like we are kind of honest, but it's a mess over text cause it's hard for me to get deeper. In the first few months we were talking, he was so happy go lucky and saying he was going good all the time. (He still has such a nice presence, he has this positive energy about him).

it was sort of revealed that he was kind of doing what he thought was what i want. I think he really does try and take notice of things. But I am still overthinking, thinking that when theres a break he remembers im crazy and hes getting distant himself and he's changed his mind.

I dont know whether its really just that i still have shit going on, or are our styles incompatible? I feel like maybe I should bring it up and thats why i can get distant, but I dont know how again. I dont know if i should keep bringing it up? I dont know why i am still holding back even though he said he wants to talk.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oro2lg/textingcommunicating_long_distance/

18,orou8b,1627263845,Struggling with online dating. No options IRL. How to move forward?,"TL;DR: 25M, UK. Last relationship ended at the start of this year. No success since then with online dating beyond some first dates and calls with a few women, and no options IRL (no women my age at church, working from my flat, small social circle of single guys). Not sure where to go from here. What would you do in my situation?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25M from the UK, looking for advice on how to move forward with dating. For some background: I'm a Catholic looking for an LTR, and hopefully marriage and kids; I want to be a husband and a dad someday! I'm also doing well for myself, so I've got the material means to make this happen. What I'm looking for is shared values, so I'm not worrying about finding ""the perfect Catholic girl"" or whatever; if we're on the same page values- and life-goals wise (and they're roughly my age. and in the UK), any faith or none is fine by me.

Ideally I'd meet someone new through friends or church, but all my mates are single guys with few/no female friends, and all the women at my church (and the others I've been to with travelling the country for work) are kids, married, or elderly! Through work's also not an option, as we're still mostly remote with the current global situation (and tryna date colleagues/their friends is a whole other minefield...)

So I've been trying online dating. Some faith-based sites/apps (like CatholicMatch and Salt), and some regular (like Hinge, Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel, etc.). I've read up on how to put profiles together, taken time to get good pictures, put a lot of thought into selling myself, and trying to write good messages. But after six months I've been ignored/ghosted by 99%, and not got beyond a second date/call with the 1%. Fair enough, I'm not the best looking guy, but after trying so hard for so long it's really demoralising. On the faith side things're even more difficult because I disagree with the Church's teaching on contraception (i.e.: I think condoms are OK for family planning), which is an automatic deal-breaker for the few Catholic women I've managed to have a conversation with. Online dating overall just feels crap. A post in r/CatholicDating hit me: it was about how dating should feel fun and spontaneous. It just feels like tryna find a job in a bad economy. I'd love to get off the sites and apps and cancel the subscriptions but, with no options IRL, I feel like I'd be cutting myself off completely.

So I feel stuck. This situation's been dragging on since after my last relationship ended at the start of this year, and it's getting to me.

What would you do in my shoes?

What's a good way to break it to people that I'm probably much older than they likely think I am? I am age 32 male but look 23ish. It's like it catches people off guard. Idc if it catches coworkers, new friends or etc off guard, but I do for potential dates. I'm invisible to girls my own age, or get laughed at in my face ""HAHAAA YOU'RE 32?? LOL"" and then they usually kinda go away. Girls that get flirty/giggly toward me are typically age 16-22 and usually stop the instant they hear my age, which is maybe for the better cause I'm not so into girls THAT young, especially not jailbait.

32,orppin,1627267106,Am I wrong to react this way? (17 M and 19 F),"I asked this girl to hangout on FaceTime when I was drunk after a party. On our hangout, she thought I was pretty cool and wanted to hangout more. I had the feeling that she liked me, but I had no intention of getting into a relationship because I have just been lead on. We hungout again the day after and me, her, and one of our mutual friends came. She soon asked to hangout a lot, but I couldn't because of a project. In a bout a week or so, I went to NY for vacation for the next 2 ish months. The mutual friend already moved to NY so I kinda assumed I was only going to hang out with her. We started FaceTiming all night and talking about our day, some deep conversations, and etc. After about a week or so I caught feelings for her. I eventually told her that just for her, I'll give dating another chance. I hungout with our mutual friend and we became somewhat more close. When she came to NY to originally meet our mutual friend, but now me as well, things got a little tight. The day she came, I hung out with her all day even though she was running on 2 hours of sleep. Our mutual friend made a schedule for all of us to kinda follow and that the day she came was the only day I had me and her time. The date went pretty well in my opinion. We held hands, was touchy feely but not sexually. In the end of our first date, I took her to watch the sunset along the coast of the Hudson River with an overview of the city. This was the first time she took her mask off and it was for a solid couple minutes. The idiot that I am waited too long and she made us leave. On the way back, she was a bit distant. I soon learned that she needed to go to the bathroom for a while. When they drove me back to the airBNB I was staying at, she acted normal as ever. A couple days later, she, my mutual friend and her friends consisting of 2 other girls and 5 other guys wen to an Airbnb in upstate NY. When I tried coming in contact with her through snap, she was dry. I thought that she was busy so i held off. She continued to be dry the next day and she sent a picture of her legs on top of another guy. I was pissed off, but she explained how it was because she injured her leg. When she came back, she was dodgy. She doesn't want to FaceTime like we used to, but I was to confront her about it.

I started to use Bumble and Tinder just to test the waters and was surprised to land 4 dates in just a week on the apps. I've had 2 already that went well enough that the women accepted an invitation for the second. The other two are coming up this week.

I thought it took forever to get a drink and a meal on these things, so now I'm a bit lost. I never really dated in my teens or 20s. Everything I know about dating I got from watching 90s sitcoms, and I'm very dubious of that information.

What do I expect from here? What are some mistakes I should avoid?

I live a rather full life and don't have a lot of free evenings, nor do I want to spend all my evenings out. How frequently should I be dating the same person? Once a month? Twice a month? Once a week?

 Im not religious, but have pretty similar values to religious people. I don't believe in sleeping around or fwb or anything like that. I really need to know someone before having sex. Seems like everyone is either already married and settled down, religious and not interested in people that aren't, or they have slept with everyone and their mother.



I'm also pretty politically centrist which seems rare. Everyone seems ready to label you and throw you in one camp or the other.

I also downloaded a app and got an excessive amount of ‚Äúlike‚Äùnotifications.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt want to spend all of my time finding a boyfriend. I‚Äôm in no rush, but I do want to start dating again. And I don‚Äôt want to go on 80+ dates.

I don‚Äôt know how to handle this, but I wrote a list of things that I need to feel with somebody, like being safe emotionally, being open to moving elsewhere, etc. to ask before even considering a date.

I‚Äôve had a crush on a girl in the year above me since we met, but never acted on it. Of course then COVID happened my second semester of school and I couldn‚Äôt risk dating until I got vaccinated. However since then every time we see each other, which is probably every 3 months or so, we chat and ask how the other is. We also ran an event together, pretty well I think, so we have had each other‚Äôs number for a while and have short text exchanges regarding professional stuff, again probably at a 3 month rate. 

She‚Äôs incredibly smart, beautiful, and in general I just want to get to know her better. However we already have a semi professional/colleague relationship, but I‚Äôm not sure about us being ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but I like the thought. 

The past year I had a GF so I didn‚Äôt ask her out during that time. Plus some stuff I went to therapy for prior to that. With her being in the last year of school she‚Äôs basically on rotation the whole time with an incredibly variable schedule. Both in terms of time and location. So there‚Äôs little to no chance I see her on campus. 

Is there a good way for me to ask her out that isn‚Äôt a random text? Or am I at the point where I should have done so already and just have to realize I missed my chance. Any advice? We have friends in common, do I ask them? I try to text her about things but I have no idea how to lead into it if it isn‚Äôt something regarding school because we have never really interacted outside of school.

51,orqqgf,1627271090,Being an old soul at 18 is rough,"I'm a HOPEFUL romantic if you will. I like all sorts of music from pop, to country, to foreign, to several opera music. Lately I just found Andrea Bocelli and Im really enjoying all his songs, his genre, and looking more into opera-ish music (minus the high pitch notes). My dream date is to go on one occasion to a symphony wearing sophisticated attire and be completely entrassed in the music followed by a stroll holding hands with my date. 

Im the black sheep of the majority of public conversations I have with peers my own age. I find it meaningless to talk about boys we like bc my peer group likes to ask the ""what ifs"" instead actually making an effort to approach a guy. I find discussions around boys tiring because they ultimately never do what they say they will or walk up to a person. I much prefer talking about real life goals. I dont like talking about parties where the goal is to get drunk and make out with random people (I am not judging at all, but its simply not my cup of tea). I find pop culture to be extremely fake and depressing. I dont need instant gratification with anything. Going along with the pop culture, I always think abstractly and offer a different point of view in a discussion even one I disagree with because I would like to see dialogue and peoples opinion. I love service and volunteering. I have principles and stick to my personal values. But more than anything, I love to learn in and out of the classroom. I love excelling in a math concept or learning from a social interaction what I could have done better. All this I think about on a daily basis on how I can improve my personal self. 

The problem, however, is that most dudes my age are man children. I hate childish behavior, especially in a professional environment in which I see the youth of their age seep into their professional life. I would like to have a guy who is mature, open, easy to please with activities, kind, caring, sophisticated, outdoorsy, principled, determined, driven or simply just find a man who will be open to go on dates that deviate from the clich√© theatre or restaurant (bonus points if he is romantic). All of this becomes a struggle further as physical attraction matters too. Can I really find a buff, gym going man who likes to try out going to a symphony at least ones too? 

Are my standards too high? I find my life to be unhappiest when I pretend to shape myself to what a stereotypical teenager my age would act like, but faking it is tiring and im done with it.

He said we can start off as friends. He sends me random texts with no context (just stuff like, hey what are you up to etc.) He is nice in person though.

Should I just slowly ignore him or maybe give it a chance for at least one date? I do want to date someone for fun after that relationship (it killed me inside). 

How do I make sure if he‚Äôs really looking for only sex or he‚Äôs ok with hanging out/casual dating? 
He asks me if I‚Äôm free, and I‚Äôve ignored it twice. 

Should I ask to go out and do something fun? 

Btw; I have no interest in having something long term with him unless he proves that he‚Äôs more mature than I thought. I just want it to be a fun summers fling.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orrrrf/dating_for_fun_should_i_go_for_it/

""When looking for a life partner, my advice to women is date all of them: the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad boys sexy do not make them good husbands. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks women should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do his share in the home. These men exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier."" It is not my turn. Im not one of those cool boys so i will have to wait until my 30s. Im lonely, but you cant change to world.

During that time, she never posted me on social media (said she feels uncomfortable sharing relationship stuff on Instagram), didn't introduce me to her parents and seemed uncomfortable with PDA (and said as much.) At one point, she asked me to UNTAG her from a family Facebook album, which I refused and she let it go.

Even though we parted ways amicably, she initiated the breakup (citing mental health issues and the fact she was only a few months out of a LTR when we started dating.)

My friends would jokingly tease me and say she was 'out of my league' (she's what would be considered the top 1% of attractive - fit, exotic, beautiful, smart) whereas I am 5'5 with an ok face.

Fast forward a year later - she's dating a new guy. He is ALL over her social media, met her parents within months and she is extremely affectionate with him in public (we have the same social circle so often see each other at social events.) The guy she dated before me also was treated in a similar fashion.

I guess the reason I'm asking is I feel like I was treated differently in the relationship because of what I look like. The only major difference I see between this guy and me is his height. He is 6'3, conventionally attractive.

I feel like I'm spiraling. Since we broke up, I've had ZERO success on dating apps, whereas she moved on so fast and seems happier than ever. It's hard for me to not immediately blame my looks.

The amount of raw loathing at worst and apathy at best I read here regarding ethnic men is really astounding. This subreddit makes a conscious and direct effort to silence and denigrate non-white men. We are not allowed to discuss the racial discrimination we face in the dating market even while women are *proud*, bloody proud to rant and rave like nazis about how great tall white blonde men are. The preferences women have in the West (and preferences do not exist, preference = requirement for women) match entirely to the requirements to join the *SS*. Really think about it, you can go look up right now the physical requirements to join Hitler's most vicious and insanely fanatical soldiers and it is basically identical to which men have success on Tinder. 

My question is, why does this subreddit spit on and denigrate ethnic men that dare to not just accept that we are inferior? Every day i see white posters particularly getting dozens, even hundreds of upvotes ranting about how much they fucking *despise us* and how much they hate reading posts from ethnic men.

I saw this cute girl who was on a dating page and decided to try and talk to her. I am writing this to vent on the very unpleasant experience of meeting her.

We start off pretty mildly, I introduce myself and start asking about her. She doesn't talk too much, but doesn't seem bothered by having a chat. After a while I notice that I've been asking about herself and carrying the whole conversation from the beginning, while she hasn't asked me a single question. All she knew about me was in my first introductory sentence and she didn't seem interested in asking, or most likely didn't realize, even when I told her ""I am going to finish my questions soon, next I'm gonna ask about pets, you might want to ask me something"". She didn't get the joke but started talking about her parents getting a labrador after she moved out. 

I was puzzled at her behaviour, but continued talking to find out more. I asked about relationships and here is when shit unfolded. She started talking about how she is single because she cannot find someone on her level: she has a master's degree in psychology/marketing, a prestigious job (not really, but she puts it down like this, and has been working only for little more than 1 year), and has literally tens of interestes from rafting to deep diving to anything you could think of. She wanted someone with the same academic titles and same interests since she was never home and always around for work or leisure. To which I replied that the only person with her same interest and self worth is herself. 

After this the discussion kind of died, I realized she was some sort of megalomaniac who values people's worth only on titles and thinks way too highly of herself. I was left puzzled and mad about how she failed to realize she wasn't contributing anything to the conversation.

I am a complicated individual, think along the lines of someone afraid to take initiative. I cannot really explain why I am like this but im guessing it has to do with my development as a kid.

Anyway, I am currently involved in a relationship with someone who is very beautiful, unselfish, and loving. This person I went through hell and back to even date. We had a serious falling out in the beginning of the relationship but ultimately ended up together a few weeks later. The only problem with this relationship is that my parents do not approve. Now I respect people's right to do whatever they choose, but I am a hispanic that comes from a very close family. Every move that I make in my relationships are heavily criticized within my immediate family. As I move in to my mid 20's, I see my american friends doing what they want whether its good or bad and their parents want them to experience failure in order to be better.  I see that as very productive because at least I can make my own decisions and become my own man but this is only a factor of what is going on.

As of late, my relationship with my current gf has been rocky for about 3 months and we have been dating for almost 2 years against the approval of my parents. Recently, it has taken a toll on me. I find myself arguing with my parents a lot and now that I have recently graduated from a radiography program, they have been on my ass about everything I do. Probably because they care a lot about me and I understand that. However, recent experiences with girlfriends tell me nothing will change, as they have threatened me with getting kicked out of the family and not seeing my 10 month old nephew in the past. However, my current relationship has been mostly arguements about little things these last 3 months and I thought about going on break. I saw her family this weekend and felt guilty due to one particular thing.

As a radiography student, I am required to attend clinical semesters and this last semester involves 4 other students from my class (you need a certain amount of ""competencies"" so several people in my class were put in a busy hospital) and in a class of 16 people, only 3 including myself are boys so that leaves 13 women. In clinicals I recently bonded with a girl in my class and it lead to me having a crush on her. It was also obvious she was sending signals that this woman liked me and wanted to know me better as we talked about our origins and out future career aspects and i ended up falling for her. I really wish I could date her but I feel bad for my current gf as she doesnt deserve any of this. To make matters worse, I have an interview where she currently accepted a job ( she told me ) and if I get accepted there I can possibly see an affair happening. I have felt so guilty that I talked to 2 of my best friends and they said its just a phase where an average guy brain takes over your normal way of thinking. This new girl is perfect. Has goals, values, respectful, beautiful, open to cultures, and just a cute personality. Whereas my current gf uses current insecurities against me in arguements. 

I really want more opinions as my future is in stake at the moment. I am going through a life crisis at the moment and I want everybody to know I have 2 previous suicide attempts due to my crisis with my parents and yes i am in therapy, i know this stuff isnt good for me thats why im seeking help any of you cant give me. 

So I ask, should I go with new girl A, or current girl J? I only talk about this with my therapist so I wanna know more opinions no matter how hard they are, give it to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ortuws/in_need_of_serious_help/

I don't want to come off as boring (or desperate) and really don't want to end up talking about my ex. I'm a great listener but conversation tips and how to be around a another/different woman would be desirable!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oru9ap/first_date_in_over_10_years/
92,orufr9,1627287484,Kids/marriage when woman is in late thirties," I'm   (31M) currently seeing a woman who is 37. Her age is not necessarily a   problem but it complicates things. We've only been seeing each other for  two months but if we want  to get married and have kids we'll have to   move fairly quickly (we both  want these things). She's very beautiful   and I initially thought she was only 30. We're compatible and have great   chemistry (in fact I've never been in a relationship with someone so   optimistic, joyful and cheerful who can make me laugh so much). Neither  of us has been married before or has kids.

So   I'd be  interested in hearing stories from people who've been in a   similar  situation. How did the age gap affect your relationship? Did   family  members frown and advise you to find someone younger? Did you   feel in a  rush to marry and have kids?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orufr9/kidsmarriage_when_woman_is_in_late_thirties/

He was one of the first characters I created in my head. I feel like I messed up my chances of dating because nobody is as interesting or handsome as him. Im not really interested in other guys. I use have a lot of superficial crushes grade 6-12. These days I feel emotionally empty. What makes it worse is that Im an emotionally distant person. I  get freaked when other people like me.

98,oruz0t,1627290175,Tired of having to emotionally detach when relationships end,"I met a guy a month ago who only spends a couple months out of the year where I live because of his job, and lives in a state far away from me for the rest of the year. We met through an app a month ago, really hit it off, and proceeded to spend practically every day together for the following month and even went on a really amazing &amp; unique long weekend trip and a shorter overnight trip. So, I know that's all a little excessive, but with the limited time and the good connection we had, it just seemed like a good chance to go along with something fun and see what happened. 

It was really positive overall but I think we both knew a few weeks isn't really enough time to know if it's worth changing our lives drastically for each other so we left things basically as we will keep in touch and be friends and try and keep getting to know each other and I guess just see what happens. He wants me to visit him in a couple months which I'm undecided/have mixed feelings about but I'm thinking it about it some. He's also mentioned coming back just to visit me at some point. But still, there's no commitment right now, it would really just be for fun I guess. So I'm fine just leaving it on a positive note and if the universe changes our circumstances in the future then cool but not waiting for that. 

Anyway, it's a very 'it is what it is' kind of situation but I'm just so sad that he's gone now (which I knew would happen) but I've just had the realization that I'm just so tired of having great connections with people, having them not work out for whatever reason, and then having to do the hard work of emotionally detaching. I'm so tired of the detaching part. It's so freaking sad, like I just want a dependable and consistent relationship. I am willing to take chances and not limit myself when dating but damn is the whole process just emotionally exhausting. I don't know how to keep doing this until I find a relationship that is right for me. It's so hard to carry such special memories with these people and develop these intimate bonds but know we're not actually committed or connected anymore. 

I also went through a breakup earlier this year where we dated for 5 months but ended on bad terms and haven't talked at all since then. And I had a really hard time detaching from that too even though I was the one that ended it. I'm just feeling so damn sad and I don't know what to do about it.

TLDR: Tired of having relationships not work out for whatever reason, and having to emotionally get over them. It's so exhausting and sad.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oruz0t/tired_of_having_to_emotionally_detach_when/
