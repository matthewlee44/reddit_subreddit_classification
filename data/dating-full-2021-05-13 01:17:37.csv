We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and almost 2/3 months later, I sent him a message telling him what I wanted to tell him if we had cleared the air. He positively responded to it, told me things have been really difficult on his end, he still thinks and misses me all the time. That he basically feels the same, it’s just really hard and he doesn’t know what to do and doesn’t want to mess with my head so he tries to leave me alone. He also said he misses laughing at dumb things with me/times we shared.

Advice? What do you think he would benefit from telling me he still thinks about me all the time/misses me.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision.

Single women who complain about not getting dates, I have zero sympathy for you. If you take care of yourself physically.  you can date anyone you want. What you mean to say is the men YOU want to date you, are the ones you can't get to date you. Most men find most women attractive.  Most women find most men unattractive.

Guys have to do the asking, courting, planning, gifts, surprises. Because women don't approach men to date,  because you don't need to do any of that stuff, even when you are dating or in a relationship. Wait long enough ladies, and a man will approach you. Accept or reject him at your convenience. Wait a bit longer, another one will come along and take his place.

One of the easiest ways to understand a person is to listen to a story. From his family background and experience, people can learn more about her character, habits, friendship and interests. Of course, when you hear her advantages, you should give her more praise. When you date her, talk more about her. From the woman's story, affirm her strength, praise her efforts, and sympathize with her emotions.

2.Talk about her current situation: 

a woman naturally longs for a warrior to appear and protect her. They hope that there is a man who loves them in their lives. When things don't go well, she will be full of anxiety and anxiety. So, find an outlet to vent a woman's emotions and ask her how her date is going.

3.What kind of friends does she like: 

This part is a bit tricky, but it expresses women's views on your relationship more clearly. It is best for a man to express his thoughts and remember to ask what kind of friends she likes. When the conversation begins, let the other person know how much you value her thoughts, her heart, and what she cares about. If she said, please listen carefully.

So I met this guy in November 2020 on Hinge and we instantly connected, it was amazing. Thing is I am not from the USA and was waiting for my OPT so I could start working early January. The papers were supposed to be approved by December and I would move to Miami once I started working. 

Anyway, so going back to the guy... I travelled to my home country for the holidays but couldn’t legally return to the USA until my papers were approved, so I just continued talking with the guy over the phone, facetime etc... 

He was always reminding me that he was being very cautious because of my situation, like not being sure when I would be able to go back because the papers were being delayed. 

So early January, after being super romantic and cute and showing interest, he just out of the blue told me he didn’t want to hurt my feelings so he thought stopping what was going on right away would be the healthy choice.  I was ok with it, i mean if I were in his shoes I’d also try to push away any feelings towards someone whom I wasn’t sure I would ever see again right? 

Mu papers were approved last month, after 5 long terrible months, and I am traveling to Miami tomorrow.  Do you guys think it would be a good idea to reach out and ask him if he wants to hang out at least as friends? Or should I just let him go entirely? 

He is 35M i am 29F

And we haven’t spoken since January.

We had been chatting and things were moving fast and within a week we video called. He was prompt and responsive, even making the time during work to speak with and call me.

He said he was a little busy, but we could speak over the weekend. And when I texted him back fixing on a day/time, he's not got back to me for a day. 


I'm being naive right? I am constantly conflicted between understanding people are actually busy and have a life and making sure I'm not being naive. The thing is I'm very straightforward with my communication and I'm always asking the guy if he feels like there's potential and giving him the option to proceed, or take it or leave it. Just don't be ambiguous with me and waste my time. 

He probably feels obligated to message me right and not hurt my feelings? What do I do? Of course I won't follow up,  (cause he's already on strike 3). But do I even agree to another video/call ? (can't meet due to Covid, though he does stay 2 hours drive away) 
Cause I feel like even if he gets back to me to speak, it feels like a pity offer. And this is below my dignity.

Since first meeting him and now it’s been a long off and on relationship. He wants more and wants us to be “real”. I’ve never had a best friend or ever really told my parents everything going on. It’s been hard. 

Any advice as to how or what I can do to make this easier to tell my parents? I also want him to meet my parents officially as well. I’ve also been wondering if he really is the one for me. He has always been there for me when I’ve been through a break up or needed someone.

I've never been in a relationship before so maybe that attributed to some of my initial awkwardness on dates. Though as my friends have told me because I never go in for a kiss the dates always seem to fizzle to nothing often leading to me overthinking things and the girl inevitably losing interest but I think ik willing to try again.

It was 11:38 pm (late as hell to be snapping) I didn’t recognize the guys name so I let curiosity beat me and the snaps were a picture of a guy half naked and a video that I couldn’t really see due to bad internet connection. From there I noticed that she still talks to an ex boyfriend of her who apparently is just a friend to her now. I opened the chat and scrolled up. 

For context: me and her became official January 1st of 2019

As I scroll up I noticed a picture she sent to the guy (he saved it in the chat). She was wearing a sexy outfit that she wore to her friend’s graduation. It was a dress that showed extra skin, some cleavage or whatever lol. Anyways, at first I didn’t pay much mind but then I checked the date, the picture was sent on March 19th of 2019, thats months after we became official.

I explain what I do and I can practically see the light fade from their eyes.  I've tried explaining it several different ways, and it just dies immediately. It's poison. 

I've had more than a dozen conversations on dating apps end cold right here in just the last two months.  Some of those were going exceptionally well, like where we had been talking for more than a week and really getting to know each other and then it's just over. 

It's really disheartening.  I'm not going to lie about what I do with my business, because if somebody lied to me about what they did for work and then told me later I'd consider that to be just a massive red flag, that's really dishonest, but I don't know how to get over this hump.

i unknowingly rushed things. i expected too much. i liked him too much. i was so hopeful. this made me very emotional and sensitive. i would cry over a cancelled date. i would overthink. this was what made the relationship rocky as time passed. i forced things too much. he was unemotionally available and made it clear that he merely enjoyed my company. but he didnt have feelings. hes reluctant to be in a relationship but he didnt mind dating me. yet i cldnt just accept that. externally i did. i told him im okay and that i didnt expect much from him. but of course i did. i only said these things because i wanted to be with him. so inevitably id get hurt when certain things i hoped for dont happen.

when things started to take a bad turn, it was obvious we both needed a break from each other. he gave me plenty of hints that he needed a time off and even told me to my face that he was tired of me being the way i am. i accepted it but i was very hurt. i wld call non stop because change is smth i cldnt take. the good times we had kept replaying in my head. i was incredibly devastated at how things were so different from before. so i wld call him again and again for reassurance that he will still be there and that there is hope that it will go back to that. but him not picking up would break me even more. this went on for a week until he officially decided to block me everywhere. no proper closure.

i wonder why i didnt cry or was mad at him after this. but i thought about it and i guess i did this to myself. i cldnt take the hint that this needed a break and maybe a time to heal. or the reality that the relationship doesnt work out. i hoped too much and wanted too much from someone who clearly was still not ready to be in a relationship. my hearts heavy everyday because i keep telling myself “if onlys” i was more calm, more rational, more patient, then maybe it would have worked out. but it didnt and i have no other way to contact him. i just want to let him know that i truly liked him as a person. he was amazing. but i pushed too much. im pretty sure he is the way he is because of his trauma from the previous relationship. and i feel bad because insecurity was the reason for his heartbreak as well. and i was an embodiment of insecurity. just needed to let this out. im going to miss him a lot.

We met once. It was okay. 



I've been having car problems and I couldn't meet again. He wasn't happy with me. 


I wasn't comfortable telling him the details . It's not something to be proud of. I'm independent and only rely on myself. 

So I have to pick up my car this week and my friend who was supposed to help me couldn't bc of work and her family member also stopped working at home. I planned it last week and we thought that would work. Unfortunately, it's not going to happen. 

Uber is over $100 to pick up the car, so I thought that I'd ask that ""eager guy"" for help since it'd be in his direction and I could take Uber halfway. 

I didn't even had the chance to explain the situation,  I simply asked him to help me.  He doesn't work this week, I asked about this first. 

That's what transpired.

ME : I need help with the car tomorrow 


HIM : &lt; a wall of text!  &gt; 

What are you talking about? 

I never once said I'd drive you anywhere. You said you didn't have a car and blamed that for not seeing me saying you didn't want to impose. I said I could have driven there. 

I was entirely straight forward as I always am, and do not agree with this attempt to guilt me over something I did not say or do. Feel free to read back through our texts all you want all you see nothing of the sort. 

Despite the fact that I never offered; I'm quite surprised you expect me to do errands for you when you haven't given me the time of day in well over a month or so now. 

So you won't give me the time of the day, but for this you will for the first time in months. You're lucky I want you so damn bad and am in love with your insane body or I would be even more frustrated by this. I know I won't get to see you otherwise; Not much else for me to say. 

---- 

ME : 
Firstly, I don't expect anyone to run errands for me. Secondly, I only asked bc my friend was supposed to and couldn't help me. I don't have any family nearby, so I have to rely on myself. Thirdly, it's always nice to know that people are willing to use me and fuck me, yet won't bother to help when I'm in a bind.

So let me explain. Sorry for the long post.

I am a girl of 27 and have moved to germany for my education. And now I have a job in a new town. So for getting to know people I just put myself on some apps and invite people to hang out. Not datingapps.

So I met up with this guy who seemed like we had a lot in common. Just as friends. But I also might admit I am single so if it is a cute guy there is a bigger change of me hanging out with him.

I see myself as a confident smart person. But not very attractive. I usually wear what is comfortable. And focus on other things. I had short flings but I moved around a lot so never to serious.

So we just have a quick chat. And meet up. He was sitting with my roommates. And I held my composure but this guy was nothing like his pictures.

I tried to act normally but within 5 minutes I was attracted to this guy. And I hardly could focus. Intelligent, thoughful, sexy af and we had a lot in common. I offered him a beer just so I can have one and calm my nerves.

So we talk. And sit with my roommates just to get some pressure of for me.

We hung out in my room after and we vibed. I asked him if he wanted to meet up again. He said sure. When he left it was awkward. I just wanted him to kiss me. I started to stand close to him. But he didn't go for it. 

I felt ugly and stupid after. And couldn't sleep because of anxiety.

A day later he texted that he had a good time and next time at his place. It has been 5 days and I haven't responded.

It hurts me saying this. But this isn't the first time this happened to me. I feel bad for not responding. 

So what the hell do I do?
