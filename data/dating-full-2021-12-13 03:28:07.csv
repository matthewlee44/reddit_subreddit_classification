This happened to me about a week ago and I’ve been thinking through it non-stop.
Maybe some outside opinion would help shed some light on it. Any and all advice/opinions are welcome…


-I 32M Met her 35F on a dating app and hit it off quickly. Nice easy conversation, flirty banter, consistent communication. Talked for one week first 

-Decided on a mid week first date since she was leaving early for Christmas vacation 

-Met at her place b/c she didn’t want to go out, adhering to stricter covid protocols. She visits older family members a lot. Fair enough, covid hesitancy is common here 

-date starts out like most first dates, nervous energy and light getting to know you type convo

-I brought take out for us, we watch tv, eat and pause every so often to talk more

-As time goes on our convo become really deep, we are seeing eye to eye on so many values and shared interests. Talk about family, work, friends, passions, old school stories, religion, future goals, lots of joking and laughter! Compliments! Signs of a good first date!

-A few things to mention was that she is more religious than me (similar religion), asked how a future kid if it happened would fit it and brought up her issues with her strict parents. These don’t really seem like first date topics when I look back but they happened

-10pm, we were going to end since weekday but it was going well so we decide to watch a movie. She immediately starts cuddling, holding hands, laying on my chest

-We watched for a while and eventually I end up kissing her. Turns into a full on make out session, things are getting heavy. When clothes start coming off she asks to slow down, said she just wanted to make sure there was a spark but not looking to rush into anything. All good I respected that and we calm down a bit and go back to talking. Still kissed a bunch of times after and before leaving

-End up planning future dates and she even said I hope you we can continue this via text till I’m back in January. Even joked about inviting me to her trip if I didn’t have Christmas plans

-went home, texted each other goodnight. Happy with the night! 

Next day

-I text her around noon, see how her day is going

-Heard back after midnight, bad long day at work for her. Another bad day with 5am wake-up to follow, I assume wrap up work before vacation. She Asked me how my day went?

-I Reply on Thursday morning…I give her info on my day, empathize with her work issues. Told her she is almost home free. Ask her if she is a morning person b/c 5am is brutal…Then to cheer her up showed her Christmas tree we just put up and asked her what she thought of it? Her family doesn’t celebrate so she was excited about it


No reply…Never heard from her again

I broke my confront ghoster rule like an idiot and messaged her Saturday. Wished her a good trip and asked her why we are not talking…
You guys know what happened next, no reply

Is she just love-bombing on first date for attention? Maybe she has an avoidant attachment style and got scared off?

Like I guess I’m starting to get anxious, and this happens in every relationship I’ve ever been in where I actually like the person. I just start getting worried about them just dropping me (which usually ends up happening for one reason or another), and like I feel that anxious feeling is starting to come back.

Maybe it’s bc I’m not sure if I deserve love, or like I’m just sort of inexperienced but like I’m just scared. I’ve talked to a therapist about it in the past and he basically told me to find a purpose that makes you not as focused on the relationship, so it’s like not all I have in a way. I don’t really know how to do that and in a couple days I’m going to be on a ranch with nothing to do for two weeks.

We were fwb for the longest time. But over the past month we both really wanted more with each. We’re not rushing into it but we both a want a relationship. We’ve been hanging out more, having more serious convos, talking about the future, etc

Everything about her is great but she’s AWFUL at being somewhere when she says she will. This would happen when we were fwb but it didn’t bother me as much then. It’s not every single time but it’s often enough that it’s very frustrating. She will say she’s coming over to my place at a certain time but often it ends up being hours later or sometimes not at all. I just don’t see what’s so difficult about being somewhere when you say you will. And no there’s not someone else and I know she cares about me a lot. We just spoke on the phone and she said it’s not just me she does this too. She says she just loses track of time and doesn’t plan properly. To me, being on time is such an easy thing to do. But with her apparently not

I dont think I can get into a relationship with someone that does this constantly. I don’t think I’m asking for much right? She’s apologized so many times but actions speak louder than words. Yesterday and tonight was the first time though that we’ve seriously spoken about it. She says she’s committed to being better. I’m hoping she can. Am I wrong be this frustrated? After talking on the phone I know she really cares she just truly sucks at being on time. 

So any advice on how I can help her or move forward with this would be great. Below is a screenshot of some of our texts so you can get a better idea of the situation

A lot of people are getting together. And a lot of people are single. But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of people that are in relationships are happier than they were years ago. And I think it's because a lot more people in this era know what they want. Knows what feels good. And knows what doesn't. Have you ever questioned why your parents may have not felt happy together? Why did you witness emotional abuse that you knew in your heart wasn't right? These people came from an era where marriage was the *purpose* to live. An era where everyone in their families would ask ""when are you getting married"" like a thousand times. They pushed people to ""pick"" someone- anyone- who could potentially be a good partner but not someone they connected with. Someone who did good things for them. Maybe even made them laugh once. But love? True genuine connection? No. And I'm sure if you ask 9/10 people if they would decide to date the people they married today they would say no. Because this culture was living in today is a wake-up call to all of those dry relationships the older generation was forced into. Back then people were forced to be together by many factors. Now we as a society are collectively saying ""date for love."" And that's a great thing. And we should encourage that. This goes back to my question, have you considered you being single is benefiting society as a whole?

I know being single sucks. It sucks for everyone. But if no one likes you. If you aren't attracting anyone with your personality. Then those people aren't entitled to date you. Think about if they did date you. Think about how they would feel so emotionally drained from putting their all into a relationship they don't care about. Think about how much you would be hurting from dating someone you know doesn't truly love you. I get that being single sucks. But if every single person in the entire world had a partner, that's millions of people who would be unhappy in their ""relationships."" That's asking for a world where's its relationships are based on abuse, loneliness, and heartbreak.

Does this make anyone feel better about being single? No. And this post is not supposed to do that. I just want you to reconcile on your singleness without making illogical reasons as to why you're single. Instead of just acknowledging the simple fact that the majority of people you're encountering don't find you attractive. And that's okay. Because they're going to find someone who they actually love.

I was teasing him in person about being mean to me and he said “that’s just one of the stages of love” I kinda laughed it off but then I SWEAR when we were hooking up he said “do you love me” I could’ve misheard it and he could’ve said do you love this* but I was super caught off guard and just acted like I didn’t hear it. 
Don’t get me wrong that would be super strange if he did say that but I get it could’ve been the heat of the moment as we have strong sexual chemistry (he was completely sober at this point) 

BUT, when we are apart he barely keeps in contact with me? I know he’s not a big fan of technology, but being so early on I just thought maybe you’d want to match the energy you are putting in person? We are each other’s best friends on Snapchat (meaning we both Snapchat each other the most)

Guys. Even male friends who I have known they take pride or enjoy all the females falling all over them. Even the ugly ones. Enjoy the photos they send, the game(s), phone calls that woman place… etc etc.

I’m not saying my life is peachy by any means it’s just a thought not a judgment. Like what In the world are YOU doing? ‘This’ is what you find ‘so’ entertaining?

So I work at a warehouse and I’m new so I got lost, and so I was going to ask someone for directions to my station and I look over and there this attractive guy a few feet away from me so I ask him. As he’s telling me where to go he was smiling pretty hard so I thought he kinda liked me. After he guides me to my work space I noticed that he would walk past my station a lot and we would pick up on some conversations here and there and I kept on telling myself that the next time he comes past me I’ll stop him and ask for his socials but I kept chickening out since I never make the first move but I really wanted to do it before his shift was over.


 I see him about to exit the building but I stopped him and thanked him for being so nice to me and ask him for his socials. He was kinda hesitant at first and said he doesn’t usually go on social media but gave me his Snapchat anyways. After he hesitated my confidence level dropped but I still had hope that I could possibly still get to know him and see if he was interested. 


But 24 hours after he accepted my request I get no text back. So a day goes by and I’m still waiting so at this point I figured he was just not that into me which is fine, although he ends up texting me he takes hours and I mean HOURS to reply back so I guess it’s safe to say “He’s just not that into me” which is perfectly fine! I’m actually glad I shoot my shot for once in my 25 years of living so far haha I kinda feel invincible.

I have known him for over 6 months now and we have gone out a few times. One of our trips lasted 11 hours. I am completely confused by him and cannot figure out what to do. I love the man (I have not told him). I really want to date him and could see myself spending the rest of my life with him. I know it sounds sudden to say such a thing but I have never met someone whose personality and other traits are compatible with mine like his are. I have a personality that made me think it would take years to find someone like him (of course now that i met him, I realize I was wrong). Our goals and dreams are the same and we always laugh and have the best times together.

We have a problem though, aside from us having two different religious beliefs, I am having trouble trusting him. I think he might be lying to me or keeping certain parts of his life secret. I asked him about drug use because one of our mutual friends warned me about him saying they had done drugs and drank together and that is why she doesn't hang out with him anymore. I asked him about it and told him what she said. He gave me an explanation as to why she said that. Then I asked him about what he actually did do. He said he had done crack in the past because his family pressured him into it when he was 15, but he really really regrets it. He said he does not do any drugs. He did tell me that he drinks and vapes socially. He seemed completely honest when we were talking. One night, he left his jacket at my house. I was curious and went through the pockets (yes, I am in the wrong for doing that). I found half a straw and the jacket smelled like some type of weed or something. The only use I can think of for half a straw is inhaling drugs. I washed the jacket, returned it, and never confronted him about the straw because I want to trust him and didn't want him to know I looked through his pockets. He has also behaved in ways that I can see don't align with his character. I feel like drugs or something could be influencing this behaviour. He dropped out of school for the semester and stood me up on two hangouts without a good reason. We worked together and he asked me out again so I forgave him because I know he has had some rough things going on in his life and really needs someone there for him. I did tell him that if he asks me out again and stands me up, I will never ever ever hang out with him again. I can't completely lose my own standards and self-repect for him. I just feel like he is going through some awful things right now and can see how troubled he is when he is vulnerable with me about his life.

We've shared stories from our childhood, family drama, and dreams. He always encourages me to reach my goals and he gives me the sweetest compliments. I feel like we both love each other but haven't told each other because I won't date someone of a different faith so for now it is better to remain friends. We are actively talking about our faiths and I think eventually, it is possible that we will agree. I bring an open heart to every conversation I have with him and I genuinely want the best for his future. I don't know how to talk to him about the doubts in my head or how to deal with the situation if he is actually doing drugs. If he has found himself dependent on these drugs, I know he is ashamed of it and that is probably where the lies are coming from. I refuse to lead him on and have said things about not dating people of a different faith and he knows I have never had any alcoholic drinks, drugs, or vape. He told me he would give up drinking and vape if it would get in the way of our friendship. I told him it would not. (It is a relationship deal breaker but not a friendship deal breaker).

I have an accent that I myself hate. Although some people said they liked it and that it ""sounded russian""... Unfortunately it's not lol.

I've been single for the past year and tried out online dating for the first time ever back in August 2020. I never really said anything about me being Lebanese in my bio's as I never felt the need to... I got 1 to 2 matches every few days, I'd chat my matches up and try to get to know them before I ask them out. Always somewhere within the conversation I'd claim that I've only been in the U.S for 2 years and that I'm originally from Lebanon... This is where I get ghosted. It took me about a dozen times to realize that me being foreign is a turn off... Or was it me being middle eastern?!

I speak french fluently. So I thought, what about I lie and say I'm french. Conversations actually started going through. With some people i said I'm half lebanese... Gladly enough it wasn't a turn off for them. (Useless disclaimer, I'm actually 1/4 English).

Anyways, at this point I was massively into the idea that americans are all secretly quite racially/ethnically conservative... Although they'd act otherwise.

At some point, I asked 3 girls out on dates, having them think I'm french. I completely faked my accent and went through with the dates. This was over a 4 months span probably. The dates were actually good. One of them said i didn't look french... So I said I was southern french from Marsielle, and that we were a bit tanned. 

After all that, I kind of started thinking that maybe I was to blame for getting ghosted whenever I said I was Lebanese. Maybe I was doing something wrong... And tbh, I still think that to be true, although I've proved myself wrong in some way. So I went back to saying I was Lebanese, and went back to getting ghosted and pissed.

English isnt my first language so, excuse any mistake. 

I was at a wedding this weekend. I was supposed to go with a friend who couldn't come for various reasons so, I was ready to be pretty alone even though I knew some people from the brides side. 

The bride arranged most of my rides with her 2 husbands groom +  the girlfriend of one of the groom. 

That was was crazy. Super funny. We were singing in the car and they made me really comfortable. One of the groom started to be really nice with me.  

He started opening the car door for me, we had to play a game and chose someone and he chose me. After the church, in the program, I wasn't supposed to get back in his car with them. 

He was supposed to take other people. 

So, he was like ""hum no, khaci is coming with us. I've seen with x and x, they are gonna go with someone else""

I don't know if he is single but he told to the girlfriend of the other groom that he has sent a text message to her friend telling her he wasn't interested to go further so, I guess he is. 

I've asked his number phone. I first want to thank him for taking me in charge as I had to live early and didn't really have the time to do so. 

Do you think he will get it and show me if he is also interested?

Sorry for the bad English, it’s not my first language .

There is a girl I liked for a really long time and I have not seen her for a long time because she has been overseas studying. We graduated high school last year and then she went overseas while I am studying in my country. Right after we graduated I told her that I liked her (which was true at that point) because a friend had found out for me that she only see me as a friend, but I really wanted to say it to her. Any ways, we met a couple times before she left, and continued on and off texting throughout, but my social anxiety makes me anxious texting someone I like so we did not text that much and she is also a very bad at text.

Shes very focus on her job and career and I do not think she has a boyfriend overseas yet, but it will break my heart if she does. I don’t know if she is even interested in a relationship with anyone at all, because of this. She is also very quiet and does not share her feelings so it is hard to tell what is she thinking. Because of these, I do not think she is interested in me. But I know that I want to be in a relationship with her, even long-distance, because of reasons I will not say. Even though it may not work out, I don’t care for now.

Because I felt like we were hitting it off I suggested an online date. He agreed and the next day we video called for 3 hours straight. I thought that that was a good sign.  Afterwards he told me he enjoyed it so I thought we were good.

After the online date we planned in a real date. After we planned it in, we talked for a little but after that day I didn’t hear from him at all. Since i was the one who initiated conversation 90% of the time i decided to wait until he finally Initiated. He didn’t. On the day the date was planned i texted him to ask if there was something wrong. His “hectic” schedule got in the way and he forgot about the date he said. 

No problem I thought, shit happens right? I asked him if he wanted to reschedule and he said yes. I told him that if he didn’t want to that he could tell me and that that would be okey. He told me that he did want to go on the date and suggested a few dates, we ended op choosing tomorrow. Now, we planned in the date for tomorrow (Tuesday the 14th of december) in last Wednesday. I wanted to see if he would take initiative to actually plan out the date but now it’s Monday and i haven’t heard from him at all since last Wednesday.

When I was young this was confusing to me since ""I want to be in a good relationship like my parents and they were fairly young when they started dating.  It's not a big deal if I hate not having a partner.""   However, the older I get the more I understand the wisdom in what they were saying.  Many older people (50+), who were friends of my parents or people who I am now close to, have never been in a good relationship in their lives.  Some of them have never even been in a serious, long-term relationship (&gt;1 year) despite their best efforts.  Many of the older people I know who managed to find a good partner and were with them for 50+ years outlived their partner by decades.  

Looking back, I realize that my parents were fairly independent and secure about themselves.  They desired a partner and didn't take their relationship for granted but they also were capable of living comfortably on their own.  Their relationship was very important to them but they didn't treat it like their only ticket to a good life.

I disagree with my parents about a lot of things but this advice they gave me made me feel a lot better about myself and helped me to not get obsessed about my love life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1136327,public,self,Some lessons I learned from my parents,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfa46j/some_lessons_i_learned_from_my_parents/,no_ads,0,,,

She is pretty damn attractive and has degrees from Harvard and Stanford (I like a smart woman) and works in tech like I do. She’s the kind of woman that I didn’t know was out there that I might want—so yeah, I got pretty excited about this one. Anyway, we set up a coffee date and she texts me in a manic tone at 3 am saying that she was on a work streak and asks me to reschedule…if I want to. Ok, a little odd but whatever, I’m a chill dude and I go with the flow. Anyway, we were texting, she hearted my last message, then I asked her how her day was going. Then she proceeds to tell me how “stuff came up with her family” and she can “no longer meet up this week”. Very abrupt and sudden, caught me way off guard. Anyway, things die down, but I texted her on Friday asking if she wanted to get that coffee. She must’ve deleted my number because she asked who is this. And I’m like it’s me, we were supposed to go on a coffee date…

She was impressed with my persistence and agreed to go on the date. Long story short, we reschedule twice. The morning of our date I’m all ready, and she tells me she has a migraine and asks for a rain check (it was also rainy weather today). Then she suggests we get coffee before she leaves town for the holidays. So she is apparently interested, but like what the fuck. Read on.

I just start texting her to keep the conversation going, and then out of nowhere, she sends this:

“Hey, I decided for certain I don’t want to see you in person. I’m feeling overwhelmed by the texting so I’d also like to ask you stop texting me. 

Just trying to be straight forward, not at all trying to be cruel or mean, I do sincerely wish you the Best of luck and I do hope you find what you’re searching for!! ☀️”

I (f,24) am out of 4 year old relationships. This has been a very serious ones, we were engaged and publicly very official. 

So first years of relationships with my ex, he was in the university for some program and had a group of classmate with whom he’d hang out, around 15 people. He wasn’t close with everyone but there were sometimes big gatherings where everyone would come and spend some time together. 

There was a guy (let’s call him B) with whom my ex was an acquaintance but never friends. We all (my fiancé brought me to the events, as many people would bring there significant other) hang out maybe 4 times. Including once when we went to this (B’s) house for a big barbecue party. Me and him were never flirty, max of what we could do was some friendly small talk, I did kind of like him but I’d never cross the line as I was in relationship. Even for my fiancé it was never more than that, they never hang out one to one.  

He was on my fb page and would like any of  pics I post but many good acquaintances are this way. Then, when we broke up I got on dating apps. Once I saw that this guy was on bumble and that he gave me a like. Then I also was on tinder, saw him and gave him a like too. He messaged me :”Am I wrong or we have met some time before?”.

I honestly didn’t expect him to message and I decided to go with a joke too. I said: “not sure, but I’m getting a feeling we might have met before” , he’s like : “ soho  bar in xyz possibly?” I’m like “most likely”. And final was that he’s like “ wanna meet for a drink over the weekend and talk about it?” And we set the meeting. So basically everyone understands everything but it’s all been a joke manner :D 

Do you think it’s okay to go out with or is it too much including the fact they never were friends and I like him and could give it a chance to talk and see how it goes?

Some backstory, I met this guy online and at first we were just friendly and somehow feelings developed. I never wanted a long distance relationship it just happened and I was hesitant in getting into it but we really connected on a level I never felt with anyone else before. 

I always felt the relationship was too good to be true (and well not to spoil anything but it was) he had pretty much lied about what he looked like from the beginning but I decided to look past that and give him a chance because I believed the emotional connection was more important. Since finding out he lied to he he swore to me things would be different now that I could get to know the real him. (I'm gullible I know). 

Since the beginning I have always wanted to call him and it to me was really the one thing I needed in the relationship to feel content and like everything was worth it and that we were finally going to start something real. (I live in the UK and he lives in the US, I was prepared to do whatever it took to make us work.) After 6 months of ""dating"" if you can even call it that he still hasn't called me.

Despite constantly being rejected by him and being led on over and over I keep going back and I feel like I no longer have any dignity, that I have no respect for myself as he keeps saying things will change but doesn't. He keeps telling me I need to be patient and stop expecting things to happen when I want it to. That his life is chaotic because his daughter is currently ill and I am being unfair for not being supportive.

I (f,24) am out of 4 year old relationships. This has been a very serious ones, we were engaged and publicly very official. 

So first years of relationships with my ex, he was in the university for some program and had a group of classmate with whom he’d hang out, around 15 people. He wasn’t close with everyone but there were sometimes big gatherings where everyone would come and spend some time together. 

There was a guy (let’s call him B) with whom my ex was an acquaintance but never friends. We all (my fiancé brought me to the events, as many people would bring there significant other) hang out maybe 4 times. Including once when we went to this (B’s) house for a big barbecue party. Me and him were never flirty, max of what we could do was some friendly small talk, I did kind of like him but I’d never cross the line as I was in relationship. Even for my fiancé it was never more than that, they never hang out one to one.  

He was on my fb page and would like any of  pics I post but many good acquaintances are this way. Then, when we broke up I got on dating apps. Once I saw that this guy was on bumble and that he gave me a like. Then I also was on tinder, saw him and gave him a like too. It was a month ago when we matched. A month after he He messaged me :”Am I wrong or we have met some time before?”. 

I honestly didn’t expect him to message and I decided to go with a joke too. I said: “not sure, but I’m getting a feeling we might have met before” , he’s like : “ abc  bar in xyz location possibly?” I’m like “most likely”. And final was that he’s like “ wanna meet for a drink over the weekend and talk about it?” And we set the meeting. So basically everyone understands everything but it’s all been a joke manner :D 

I’m thinking whether it’s okay to go out with or is it too much including the fact they never were friends and I like him and could give it a chance to talk and see how it goes? I feel that it is.

And rather than laying back down or going to the living room or something, he turns his fan off in his room, makes himself coffee and cereal and starts playing video games WITH THE VOLUME ON. While the only reason I'm awake is because he woke me up when he went to use the bathroom.

I think as you grow older, with any opportunity there is more risk on the table i.e. will I find another half-decent human being? 

&amp;#x200B;

Most recently, I spoke to a girl for 1 month and we had 2 dates in that time. From around the second week (after the 1st date) I identified a few things which didn't feel quite right, or were potential red flags (I wont bore you with the list). Like many people, I turned to Dr Google, reddit subs and family/friends for advice on these niggles. This of course created great confusion and stress on my mind. After the 2nd date, I spoke to her and we decided that although we tick a lot of boxes on paper, in reality we had zero chemistry.

Moral of the story, trust your gut instinct. If you feel uneasy, 9 times of 10, there is a very strong and valid reason for it. Your friends/family or redditors are not dating this person. You know best. When the right person comes along, you'll truly feel good and positive about it.

Afterwards I realized that I may have made back then an emotional decision, I should have handled the situation differently. I’m not going back to him. 

I talked to several guys after him, but it seems that the guys I want don’t want to commit. I admit I regret leaving A. Although it might not have had a future, I could have spent a few nice months or years with him. I’m not usually extremely picky or jealous, but I’m pretty emotional and wish it would finally work with a guy. Life is limited and love and relationship with a guy is on loan and doesn’t last for a lifetime anyway. I know I can’t force anything, but I feel the need to spend good moments with a guy who means something to me. It rarely happens that I get attracted emotionally and physically to a guy. Idk should I talk to A again?

I will soon reach 30 yrs and don’t intend to work until the end of my life just to pay taxes. I want to have a sincere honest LTR with a guy who loves me and whom I can give love.

This guy shows up at my apartment last night wearing a black cherry print dress to pick me up for dinner. 

I was totally caught off guard seeing him in a dress but he was nice and brought me flowers, so I didn't have the heart to turn him away at the door.

My hopes weren't high for the night, but it ended up being the best date I've ever been on. And if I'm honest, that dress looked amazing on him.

Still trying to wrap my head around it all lol. Should I go out with him again?
