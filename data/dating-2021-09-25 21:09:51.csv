We went on a date last night and while overall I had a good time, there was a few things about him I thought were a bit weird--however, I did feel like I wanted to be friends still. 

Today he said we should go out again, and a friend told me it was best to be upfront about how I felt. So I told him I would be open to hanging out again, and that I've enjoyed talking to him/spending time with him but I thought we would probably work better as friends...and he didn't answer (he is normally very quick to answer). 

As I thought about it more, I realized maybe I was too quick to judge and I should have just said yes to a second date and not said anything yet bc I did enjoy his company, and maybe the weird things he did were due to him being nervous or something. 

I was a little hurt he didn't answer my text asking to be friends. Is there some way I can take it back without looking super flakey/indecisive? Like explain that it takes me a while to figure out if I like someone and seeing him as friend was just my initial perspective and I was scared of leading him on but I would still like to see him again?  


TLDR: had a date with a guy that was overall good but there were some weird things about him, however i've enjoyed talking to him so I told him we should be friends after he asked to see me again.

5,pvl5ea,1632624047,"[30F] Men 27+ - how do busy, grown ass men react when they're truly into a woman?","Hi men out there. I'm a female who just turned thirty, got out of a long term relationship + 1.5 year ""break"" period and recently back into the dating pond. 

Question is -- since the last time I was in this game (when I was 25), just feels like things have changed so much???

Back then, when I meet a guy that I felt l clicked with, he would make it obvious about being excited, proactively texted and made plans, trying to win my heart by coming up with small favors/surprises -- which I would reciprocate and gradually turn it into a relationship.

Now -- I feel like most men are lukewarm. yes grown ass people are busy and probably are also bit jaded from past relationships. But then what are the responses should I look out for whether they are really into me or not???

For example, one guy I've met 4-5 times, texts only 2-3 times a week, says he doesn't know what he's looking for, &amp; definitely is not showing the old courting behavior I'm used to, but has invited me to a BBQ with his friends and invited me to another one next week. 

Another guy I've met 4-5 times. I was pretty proactive at first but seemed like he took it for granted. Does not flirt or flaunt me like I was used to, but loves to call me over and cuddle when he feels like it and tells me Im a really cool person. Again, lukewarm. 

I've already said goodbye to a guy that I was seeing for 3-4 months, because although we had great chemistry and some emotional connection, he was lukewarm about getting into a relationship.

Am I missing something here and only meeting men who are half assedly interested in me??? What signs should I look for in men who are mature grown adults??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvl5ea/30f_men_27_how_do_busy_grown_ass_men_react_when/

8,pvlc4i,1632624750,Should I make a move or not?,"Hi! I‚Äôm a 18 year old girl who got out of very toxic relationship some months ago with a girl who basically took advantage of me and kept confusing me about her feelings for me (she has commitment and trust issues) and left me completely destroyed. As of now, I‚Äôm just trying to find myself and I‚Äôve been going to therapy once a week since January. It has been a journey. I got out of this relationship officially in May, but just got over her in August/September. To put y‚Äôall in context, this girl made me completely lose myself and made me believe things about myself that aren‚Äôt exactly true. She was very possessive and wanted me to herself but at the same time, she didn‚Äôt want me to only like her or a serious relationship with me while sending mixed signals everyday. This relationship hurt me a lot and made me question my identity in every way. However, the most important aspect in this post would be my sexuality. When I was with her, I thought that maybe I only liked women and she also kept telling me that ‚ÄúI only liked her‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like men, you like me‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are gay. Only gay.‚Äù while I was very confused and well, as you can see, I was a very naive and insecure person so I just believed everything she said and told myself I was indeed that. (I‚Äôm very guilty of having people-pleasing tendencies). But now, I‚Äôm just rediscovering myself and questioning if my attraction to men is real. I‚Äôve found out it is, but I‚Äôm very afraid because I‚Äôve had a bad relationship with my dad ever since I was a kid. He wasn‚Äôt present and his personality has no compatibility with mine at all, he‚Äôs just a very difficult person to deal with and basically made me get used to the ‚ÄúI love you, but I kinda treat you bad sometimes‚Äù way of loving which is not okay (this is why I‚Äôm going to therapy, too). I think that my relationship with men has been completely affected by this, I‚Äôve liked a few from afar but I never really made a move on them because I‚Äôm afraid that all men will be like my dad or well, like my ‚Äúex‚Äù who isn‚Äôt officially my ex nor a man but yeah, she has hurt me a lot. Nowadays, there‚Äôs a guy in church whom I‚Äôm feeling a bit guilty to feel attracted to because even though I got out of my toxic relationship in May, I just don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äúusing‚Äù him to not be alone. I also still don‚Äôt completely love myself so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm also quite afraid of not knowing how to handle a relationship in which I‚Äôm also an important person/priority. A relationship where I‚Äôm not completely dominated :( Should I make a move on this guy by starting just as friends first and slowly (I really prefer that) or should I just focus on me?

11,pvllsw,1632625755,Bad first date. Now he wants a second date?,"I let one of my college friends fix me up with her cousin. She‚Äôs always told me what a great guy he is and he‚Äôs a good looking guy so I thought why not? So she gave him my number and we texted this week and talked on the phone a couple times. He asked if I wanted to meet up for drinks and I said sure. He was real low key about it so I thought it would be sort of a low pressure thing. Hanging out and getting to know each other. 

I get to the place and he‚Äôs there and I see he‚Äôs an attractive, fit, bearded white dude. Right up my alley looks wise anyway. A good start, right? So we‚Äôre chatting for a while. We‚Äôre small talk and he compliments my legs. Okay a real good start. I thank him for his compliment and tell him he‚Äôs got really nice eyes. We‚Äôre vibing. It seems nice.

We have a drink and more small talk. I ask him a few questions. Stuff about his family because to know his cousin. He asks where I‚Äôm from. So I say I grew up in Cleveland. He says no, like what nationality are you. I kind of laughingly say I‚Äôm an American, all Puerto Ricans are Americans. I think he took it as me being sarcastic but I really wasn‚Äôt. 

Ok so I try to smooth things over and I ask him about his job. Now he‚Äôs kind of quiet almost surly because I swear he thinks I was out of line with my comment. I again try to get things back on track by saying that his question didn‚Äôt offend me and that I hope he doesn‚Äôt think I was being sarcastic with my reply.

He says something like ‚ÄúAll these groups these days are so sensitive that as a white guy you have to tiptoe around everything.‚Äù And he continues by saying that white guys are the only group that‚Äôs not allowed to say whatever they want anymore. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond to that so I tried to charge subject. 

We watch some of the baseball game that‚Äôs on in silence and I‚Äôm feeling like good vibes I felt at the start are totally gone. He asks about my thoughts on our team changing it‚Äôs name. I tell him I haven‚Äôt really thought about it much. So he kind of goes on a rant about it. And I‚Äôm just sitting there quietly thinking that I can‚Äôt believe someone is so angry about something so unimportant as the name of a baseball team.

Once he‚Äôs done talking I really don‚Äôt know what to say except I really don‚Äôt watch too much baseball and I‚Äôm more of a football fan. So that sets him off and he tells me he‚Äôs boycotting the NFL because they protest during the national anthem. He‚Äôs getting angrier and I‚Äôm totally not believing this. Like the look in his eyes was just like he wanted to punch someone.

I say something like ‚ÄúI just like watching football because I grew up watching it with my stepdad and he‚Äôs a huge fan and our team was really bad forever and I hope they do good again this year because my stepdad deserves it.‚Äù So then we ate in total silence.

I was really shocked at how angry he came across. Like if we had been alone someplace and not in public I might have been a little scared. All my good feelings are gone. I think he got the hint because he tried to joke a bit with me and I smiled a bit but I just wasn‚Äôt feeling it anymore.


After dinner we said goodnight and while I drove I called my friend (not the one who fixed us up) and I told her about everything. Like I really get nervous when guys get that angry around me. My friend said at least you found out his temper on the first date.

Neither of us asked the other about seeing each other again so I figured he thought the date was a bust too. So I was surprised when my friend texts me that her cousin is hoping I‚Äôll see him again.

Now I have to tell my friend I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea. How should I explain this to her? Am I overreacting?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvllsw/bad_first_date_now_he_wants_a_second_date/

I just really need to vent as I feel so hurt. 

Was I being lead on or I‚Äôm being dramatic? 

1. a romantic song come up and she whispered me in my ear this could be us in the future 

2. Her saying flirty  stuff like I‚Äôm the only girl that make you listen to juice wrld cuz what we have is special 

3. One time I felt like she purposely misunderstood my question about the date (month etc) and turned the conversation into a romantic date. I said do you remember the date we meet because we meet on the first Phsycis exam now is the second one she said I never remembered because we never been on a first date. 

4. She opened about her depression and suicidal thoughts to me and said I was the only one she‚Äôs ever told 

5. One time I was in her room and she kicked my knees twice and I was on a chair and she started arching her back while texting so i thought they were signs that she was interested for sex and I got on the bed and she got up and want to clean the toilet. Not that I was going to use for her sex I wanted a genuine long term relationship with her. 

I was going to ask her out but I just found out the stuff she‚Äôs been saying behind my back. All these 9  points were behind my back. 

1. She said she‚Äôs found me annoying since the beginning 

2. She thinks I‚Äôm judgemental person 


3. She has never felt comfortable around me 

4. She knew I liked her so she said she was also careful about the stuff she said so she wouldn‚Äôt give me the wrong idea but I don‚Äôt agree as clearly she said stuff (listed above)  she shouldn‚Äôt have to someone with feelings for her  but she claims they were all jokes but this is stuff you should not joke about. 

5. She said she was never even my friend we are just classmates. The thing is I felt like she hated me from the start and only saw me as a work buddy and classmate so I asked her directly and she reassured me that wasn‚Äôt the case and we are good friends and she would put me in the middle of her list of all the  people she knows. 

6. She use to hide in different libraries just to not see me 

7. I was the only person she never come to visit when uni re started and she said she shouldn‚Äôt expect me to clear her schedule for her. I had a feeling this was the case as she even visited people she knew less then me

8. She would never date me because I‚Äôm a overreactor 

9. She said she would never start conversation with me and it would always be me. This one is so wrong though I always struggled to talk to this girl because I liked her and we don‚Äôt have many common topics so I would always wait for her to start the conversation and then ask her questions about the topic. 


I‚Äôm ngl all this stuff hurts so badly that the person who I looked up to and had a crush on felt like this towards me. I don‚Äôt even know what I did to her I was literally always so supportive towards her, always walked her home, bought her food when she was broke etc 

I‚Äôm so hurt right now this is so much worst then any girl saying no to you and this was my first experience hanging out with a girl I like more then a friend.

18,pvme7e,1632628907,Same catch twice,"Okay so heres the tea.
I (F26) have never really dated much. Two people ive liked before wanted different things so it never really materialised into a proper relationship. Tried bumble and found one okay person ard april 2020. We were in different cities but the connection was strong since day 1. I got a job in his city and moved here a few months back. We had been waiting for over a year to meet and had an amazing time when we finally did. Recently he started treating me differently and i tried talking about it. He said he had too many issues in his life right now and dosent know if he likes me anymore. I said okay and moved on. 

Rejoined bumble a week ago and have been swiping incessantly. Only found one okay person seconds before i exhausted the beeline and no more swipes were left. He seems nice and ive been getting to know him more. 

Heres the catch. Its constant deja vu with this guy cause everything is same as the previous guy. He and i have the same surnames which the previous guy also did. I remember how the previous dude joked that we might actually be related and i said god i really hope not and he laughed. Literally had the same conversation with this new dude yesterday. He is also a civil engineer who changed professions same as previous dude. He told me and i quote ‚Äúyou seem really studious which I‚Äôm not cause i was academically weak and have a problem with memory in general. So i started working right after graduation‚Äù literally same thing that previous dude said to me. When i met the previous guy a year and half ago he would say ‚Äòoh i keep busy cause there are some renovations going on in my house currently‚Äô and then would send me pics of his house. This guy also said and did the same thing last night when i asked what keeps him busy at the moment. When i swiped on previous dude he was in another city and we would often talk about how the best people live far away. Same thing again cause now that im in old dudes city, new dude is in another city and we also talked about the same thing. Both dudes have a similar sense of humour and way of thinking about life. Both said they make bad first impressions in person cuz they are shy and reserved until they get close. Both said they love colder whether cuz its good for cuddling and warm clothes. This guy also has one sister and so did the previous guy. 

None of these things were in his profile When i swiped right. Neither the surname nor any of the other details ive just mentioned. Every new piece of info i find out about new guy is the exact same as previous guy. Its so weird to me that ive managed to literally land the same guy twice out of so many other possibilities. Both guys had very little info on the bumble profiles when i swiped right. I only just liked how genuine their smiles were and that gut feeling that i look for when i swipe right on someone. The last time i downloaded bumble i only ever swiped right on one person (which was previous dude) and liked him enough to delete the app. Same this time too. Only swiped on one person and then exhausted the beeline. Deleted the app and weve moved to instagram. 

Its just crazy to me that without any background knowledge ive managed to land a version of the same guy twice in two different cities at two different points in time having selected them randomly out of thousands of potential options. 

For a hot second, I entertained the possibility that maybe its the previous guy impersonating someone else but its really not. Ive done my digging. 

Im kinda a little freaked out by this but also not letting it spoil things for me. Kinda makes me miss the old guy a bit more since every new detail reminds me of him but im trying not to let that interfere with how i perceive or interact with this new guy. I plan to tell new guy about this ‚Äòcoincidence‚Äô when its time too. And im also aware that once i get to know new guy more i will find that he is his own person deep down, but for now every new details has been eerily similar to old guy and i just wanted to tell someone about it.

Yes, if it‚Äôs been one month since the breakup, and you‚Äôve gone on zero/one date, and your ex was a very average person with an average career, little hobbies, passive personality, zero drive and not conventionally attractive, yes, it‚Äôs an illusion.

But getting someone that was a statistical anomaly, and messing things up with them, and then getting told that there are plenty of girls like her, when in 30 dates, none have come close to being as complete, athletic, creative, professionally successful or beautiful, you start to get ticked off because out of 30 women, one of them would have been better than my ex.

39,pvo4fg,1632636561,Advice for an overly loyal/ exclusive person on navigating dating,"I got on a dating app recently expecting nothing but I figured I would see what was out there- but day 1 I matched with a guy and things were going well.. we talked on the phone and that conversation was better than I expected. It's only been a few days but I did the dumb thing and snooped social media and found other chicks he's currently talking to. Pretty sure he's on other dates tonight and this weekend.

I know it's none of my business what a dude does when we literally just met and he owes me nothing but it just made me realize I really can't do online dating. I'm the type who is loyal before during and even for a period after a relationship- I can only put my focus/ energy on one person at a time so it just feels gross matching with people online hoping something will come out of it but knowing they're doing the same thing with multiple other people.

Am I just not ready to be in a relationship? I'm pretty sure this isn't a healthy way to be feeling. Logically I know I have no right to be upset about it but I just feel gross about the whole thing after getting deep into expectations and opening up personal info. Should I wait around and go on the date we talked about as a possibility in a week- assuming his other dates don't pan out- or should I just not even let it get that far?

He even said if we got that far but aren't sexually compatible it could be a deal breaker- understandable- but even though I was starting to actually catch feelings which I RARELY ever get and we have a lot of the same core beliefs/ goals I just don't want to let myself fall hard, have sex, and get dumped. I already deleted the app because I just don't have the energy to try again at the moment but I don't know if I should give this a chance anyways since he hasn't done anything wrong and I know I'm being unrealistic.

Can anyone has any advice for someone like me on how to calm down and not over think/be jealous // how to not emotionally put all my eggs in one basket. (I am seriously never into people/ call it demisexual or whatever but when I do catch feelings I fall hard and I think I was starting to let myself feel something but now I'm just very scared of getting hurt)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvo4fg/advice_for_an_overly_loyal_exclusive_person_on/

42,pvocuf,1632637688,Guys that like short women are lowkey douchebags," 

It seems like guys that like short women in general seem to only like women under 5'4 simply because they are ""small and short."" As far as I know most of you are actually hypocrites because you don't even realize that when you're saying you like short women you're lowkey indicating you like short women that weigh like 100 lbs or less. Just an FYI, let me discuss how the human body works. First off, as people get older their metabolism gets slower. Secondly, the smaller someone is, the more likely they are to get fat. Thirdly, the BMI for smaller women is actually different from other people as even 5 lbs more on a smaller woman's body is more likely to push her toward being overweight.

Fourthly, you indicate you only like ""petite"" women (under 5'4) but realistically, most adult women aren't actually petite or at least the ones pushing 30+ for the reasons I just stated, women and people naturally gain weight as they get older. In order to be ""petite"" you have to be under 5'4 and not be of a BMI that is overweight nor obese, possibly not even on the higher end of the normal BMI for your height.

So in this case, if all of you guys that like short women, you basically want her to weigh 110 lbs maybe even 100 lbs or less depending on how short. But realistically, its actually harder for a human being to weigh that low and maintain it compared to gaining weight as eventually you will end up gaining weight at some point if you weigh as much as a feather. So a good question to men that like short women, you would be perfectly okay with fat short women right? Probably not, point proven

. I only hear guys liking short women if they are like abysmally small weight and the guys that actually like short women don't want to indicate that they aren't interested in short women that don't have a ""small"" weight. Fat women in general aren't really much of a guy's liking, but when guys say they like short women they indicate they like all short women.

Would they be interested in a fat or obese short women? No. Would they be interested in an ugly short woman? No. If a woman is even like 5'4+, but not even ""small"" compared to other women guys won't go for her. Guys that like short women often end up fetizing them at some point. Guys that like short women pretty much make tall women feel like shit by saying short women are cuter, curvier, able to pick up and w/e the fuck else. Its all douchebag red flags and if I was a short woman, I would hate being one because the attention guys give to you isn't positive, its mostly negative.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvocuf/guys_that_like_short_women_are_lowkey_douchebags/

He and I got close during the pandemic and this summer we hung out a couple of times. It started with him asking me out for lunch, which sadly I couldn't attend. Then we played mini golf, went out for drinks and pool, and walks during the summer. I met some of his friends as well once when he invited me to come and join them to watch soccer. None of these occasions were labeled dates or anything so I went in with the understanding that we are just good friends that like to hang out.

He didn‚Äôt fight back, but when he was telling me this at a match earlier this week, I was bolder than I‚Äôve ever been in my life and said, ‚Äúwell, you should‚Äôve come up to be with me.‚Äù  His response was to pause and then say, ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve.‚Äù  We hung out for a couple of hours, and then he insisted on putting his number in my phone.  I immediately dialed the number to make sure 1) he also had my number, and 2) it really was his number.  When his phone rang, it already had my name in for the caller ID. 

So, I waited a couple of days, and texted him something quite benign.  A few texts back and forth, but nothing flirty.  Tonight, I ran into him at the matches unexpectedly.  He still greeted me with a great smile, but it was a bit crowded with people and I had my son (7) with me (he knows I‚Äôm divorced with 2 kids.)  When I got home tonight, I sent another quick text asking about his hand, because I saw him wringing it out.  Got a single sentence of a reply.  

So I‚Äôm confused.  Is this guy interested in‚Ä¶ anything?  To be flirting with me in public (where people have asked hey what‚Äôs up with you two?) but to not privately message seems a little backwards.  I‚Äôll admit, I haven‚Äôt started a relationship since before smart phones came out, but I thought perhaps I‚Äôd opened the door to communication by texting first.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvpu1v/so_little_experience_what_do_i_do_now/
60,pvpu71,1632644946,"I (F25) have a crush on my college classmate (M26). I feel pathetic and useless, why would he be interested in dating an average girl","So....I've recently developed a crush on my college classmate. He and I got close during the pandemic and this summer we hung out a couple of times. It started with him asking me out for lunch, which sadly I couldn't attend. Then we played mini golf, went out for drinks and pool, and walks during the summer. I met some of his friends as well once when he invited me to come and join them to watch soccer. None of these occasions were labeled dates or anything so I went in with the understanding that we are just good friends that like to hang out.

Most recently, he started working at a college bar and last week he texted me friday afternoon, asking me if I could come. I arrived and saw him in the bar and we chatted for like half an hour, laughing and joking around. When I went home that night, and the following week, I realized that I'm absolutely smitten with him, cannot get him out of my mind-level. 

However I just feel so patethic and useless. Why am I falling for someone who is just nice and treats me with basic respect? Why do I think I even have a chance with this guy? And if I try to make a move, it won't be reciprocated and there's a risk the friendship will end.

63,pvq7l3,1632646835,Should I wait a bit longer or start putting myself back out there again?,"I (28m) have been single since I was 14 (rough guess as I think I broke up with my ex before my 14th). So since 2007, I have never had a relationship with anyone else, haven't had a serious relationship before, haven't been on a date with anyone and never hooked up with anyone. Long post btw so please stick with it.

Made multiple attempts as a teen but got rejected all the time and pretty much gave up after I finished college at the age of 18 in 2011. Didn't really have any clue what I was doing back then, felt like I was completely useless with girls and figured that I'd be better off not making any more efforts to save myself from the emotional pain of rejection.

As an adult, I haven't bothered looking for anyone as my priority since 2014 was to sort my own life out. I had just been medically discharged from the British Army and opted to find something to retrain into and get a career out of. First couple of years I was in a well paying job that had a rotating shift pattern and prevented me from having a social life. Wasn't what I wanted to do but needed the money.

Got onto an apprenticeship in 2016 for Fabrication and Welding, so got my opportunity to retrain and get qualified but it meant a major drop in my wages from just over ¬£1600 a month after tax to ¬£7.50 an hour. Didn't see any point in looking for anyone due to my low wage and wanting to focus on getting the apprenticeship out of the way. Finished that in 2019 so got all my qualifications from that and was on ¬£9.50 an hour. Still didn't feel like dating anyone at the time and was about to move onto a HNC in Mechanical Engineering in 2020. But unfortunately, COVID came up and I opted not to do the HNC yet as I didn't want to risk catching it from the other students.

I have been ok with being single for the time being as I've been free to do my own thing, spend my money on what I want, not worry about commitments etc. But since September last year, it has been playing on my mind a lot and hitting me pretty bad as it has made me think really hard how long I've been single for and how lonely I really have been over the years.

I don't want to be single forever but at the moment I still don't think that I'm good enough to date anyone yet. Have changed jobs to something more worthwhile and enjoyable as I now do Vehicle Body Building but now on ¬£9 an hour for a 39 hour week and not sure when that is going to go up. I've been stuck living with my parents as I haven't been able to afford a place of my own yet, have wanted to move out for years but don't think I can afford to rent a place. My parents are planning on moving over to my Nan's place so that my mother can look after her mother which leaves the house to me and my brother to look after. So technically place of my own eventually but was hoping to do it myself and not keep sponging off of my parents.

Finally started a HNC in Mechanical Engineering and doing that as evening classes for two years, hopefully that'll improve my career prospects in the future and I may look at doing a top up degree afterwards.

So based on my situation, would it be a good idea for me to finally put myself back out there? Or would I be better off waiting until I'm earning more and in a better position?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvq7l3/should_i_wait_a_bit_longer_or_start_putting/

We met on hinge and he was the first guy that put in effort. Up until then, I have only experienced half assed attempts. 

I can‚Äôt remember how long we dated but we spent a lot of time together. We decided to be official and we had so much in common. A short while later, we discussed moving in. My roommate was on her way moving out.

82,pvrx70,1632655067,She blocked me although I felt we both enjoyed the date: what is wrong with me?," 

A while ago, I matched on Tinder with a French exchange student, two years younger than me. She was very beautiful: dark eyes, distinctively curly hair, thin, tall and an incredibly cute smile. She could have been a fashion model...

I immediately asked her out for drinks and she agreed, we exchanged numbers and went on a date at a bar. We were sitting quite close to each other, drank a few beers, talking all the time about any possible topic. She was smiling, laughing and joking around all the time, and said by herself that I was really nice and she was having a great time with me. There wasn't any moment of long silence or that I felt that I had to break the ice. In short, I can't remember of a first date where I had such good vibes with the other person.

After we left, we realized it was late and our bus would come in over half an hour. I walked with her for half an hour close to her place, and took the tram from a nearby station. We hugged, I told her that I really enjoyed the night and would love to see her again. She said ""me too"", with an incredibly cute voice (so that based on my understanding she meant it). She even told me that we would meet again soon, even the same week.

10-15 min later, as I got in my tram, I texted her goodnight and that I already miss her and looking forward to see her again, with a kiss emoji. She saw the message, but didn't respond. In the next morning, I checked on my phone when I woke up, and she still had not responded. 2 hours later, she blocked my phone number and unmatched me on Tinder.

I can list a few suspicions about why she was not interested:

\- We had such good vibes that I was touching her hand and arm every now and then, during the date. Though, she really did not seem to be disturbed by that (she did not pull herself away from me or so, and one time she also jokingly grabbed my hand and commented that I had no jewellery on it).

\- I have only two pictures on Tinder, two and one year old respectively. Admittedly, especially since the two year old photo, I gained 10+ kg (it was both due to covid and a health issue), therefore I look a bit different compared to the pictures. I know this can be perceived as deception, but the reason why I haven't uploaded a more recent photo is that I almost never take photos of myself or with friends, and for me it takes time to take an appropriate selfie because I'm not really photogenic.

However, it didn't really seem that she was irritated or disturbed, she did not show any sign of that. There were plenty of opportunities to leave (e.g. I once went to the bathroom and she told me she would quickly go out to smoke a cigarette, that could have been an opportunity for her to grab her things and leave). Also, every single time I have been on a first date and it didn't match, the girl showed relatively clear signs (e.g. they were not sure whether she will have time next weekend for a second date), and I tend to interpret these kind of cues correctly.

\- When we said goodbye and hugged, I might hugged her a few seconds too long. I was feeling such good vibes that I wanted to see whether she would reach her face closer to mine or show other signs that she wants me to kiss her. Though, her body language during the hug showed that she did not want to be kissed yet, and I respected that. I don't think that I hugged her in a weird way or was pushing too hard for a kiss.

Even if one of my suspicions applies, or there was any other reason she did not want to have a second date, I really don't understand why she did not bother to at least text me a short message that she does not see a fit.

Could it be the case that she expected me to grasp it by myself? (if all those vibes were fake, either she is really a damn good actor or I should reassess my social skills)

How can people be so inconsiderate? Have you ever faced such a situation before?

85,pvs21a,1632655719,I told my partner I feel like she's using me for sex.,"I (20F) recently told my partner (22F) that I feel like I was being used for sex.

A little background: In March, I was sexually assaulted (not by my partner) and could no longer perform sexually or do anything sexual for months as I dealt with my trauma. In the following months, there was a lot of tension between my partner and I because I was not meeting her sexual needs and she had not been feeling much affection from my end. During this period, she asked quite a lot if she could have an open relationship to satisfy her sexually. Later in June, after I told her she could not have an open relationship, she broke up with me because I couldn't have sex with her or do anything sexual (this was her reasoning then, now she claims it's because she wasn't feeling love). This made me feel reduced to a mere ""sex toy"". The feeling was also exacerbated by the fact that we'd always fight over my inability to do sexual acts and that I wasn't healing fast enough and my partner would complain that it's been ""months"". I shoved this feeling down for months because we got back together and I didn't want to fight‚Äîsince we fought a lot post-March.

A few days ago, we got into a very heated fight and I accidentally let it sip that she made me feel all she wanted me for was sex. Now she's really upset with me and told me I should've never shared this with her when she was improving.

Am I in the wrong for telling her how she made me feel during those months? Even though she improved?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvs21a/i_told_my_partner_i_feel_like_shes_using_me_for/

87,pvs9cj,1632656664,Is he not interested if he hasn‚Äôt texted me since our first phone call?,"Hi! I‚Äôm(F26) looking for advice with a guy(M40) I started talking to from a dating app. I don‚Äôt want to overthink things, but I really can‚Äôt tell if this guy is interested or just being nice. 

I matched with him on a dating app a couple weeks ago and we messaged back and forth on there for a couple days. We seemed to have a lot in common and had great conversation. He told me to text him. I got super busy with exams/working full time so it did take me almost a week to text him. I know this is probably a long time, but I wanted to make sure I had enough time to chat when I did reach out. When I finally texted him a few days ago, we texted for a bit and he then told me we should chat on the phone whenever I was free. I gave him a call that evening and we talked for about 30 Mins. The conversation seemed to go well and he said he‚Äôd like to get to know me. We‚Äôre in different cities, but he said he wished we could meet up for a drink and that we should play something when one of us is in the other city (we both travel a lot). He did ask me if the age difference bothered me and I said no. Everything seemed fine but he did end the conversation and said he would let me get some rest since I had to be up early. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since our call a few days ago. Im just wanting to get some opinions on whether this most likely means he‚Äôs not into me, or could just be busy. In the past when a man is into me, they do seem to contact me at least every day or two, but he did mention he‚Äôs busy. I don‚Äôt know if it looks too desperate for me to text him.

Over the last few weeks I've asked her out and shes said yes. We had our first date and it was a blast. Complementing each other, flirting and talking about normal life. But now she wants me to meet her parents and now I know she likes me for real. Our second date will be at her house meeting her parents which sounds weird but when should I ask her to be my gf?? That's what I want to know cause I'm really new to this stuff. I've known her for a month and I couldn't ask her out due to her having covid but now we are having great fun.

94,pvt1q4,1632659956,"He doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me (23, F, 22, M)","
It sounds bad but my boyfriend of 10 months sometimes has moments in which he ignores me or doesn‚Äôt text me. He says he does it to give me space and to let me focus on me. He gets cold and seems to distance himself from me. He suffers from depression. 

For example - when I‚Äôm on vacation with family he will purposely not reach out to me or text me at all. Not even to see how I‚Äôm doing. If I‚Äôm at work, similar except I call him everyday and tell him about my day.

I know it‚Äôs technically a good thing when I am busy but sometimes he turns into a cold stone wall when I try reaching out to him to tell him things. He won‚Äôt text back or will be dry. 

I almost always feel like an idiot texting him or literally wanting his attention when he gets like this.

Just because I‚Äôm busy does not ever mean I don‚Äôt want to update him on my life and what I do.

It doesn‚Äôt help that lately he‚Äôs been stressed over school and we have been arguing quite often.

So my advice here is: how do I prevent myself from jumping out and wanting his attention when he clearly does not want to give it to me? 

This situation is made worse by the fact that I am introverted around most people and not having anyone else to talk to; it sucks when we argue or he shuts down on me 

TLDR; my boyfriend sometimes distances himself from me and I want to stop begging for him to change or for attention",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvt1q4/he_doesnt_want_to_talk_to_me_23_f_22_m/
