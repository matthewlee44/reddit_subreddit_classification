Now because of this long time trend, I see the girl I am interested in a lot.... but in a group setting with no one on one connection through text, social media (besides following each other), or in person (just us two). I know the obvious thing to do is to begin to reach out to her to make plans whether it be alone or just group plans at first to see if there is anything between us. But like I said previously, her and I really have never messaged each other to make plans or just in general, it is usually done through the friend. I do think we have good chemistry, there’s been some light flirting, teasing and very subtle but frequent touches. I just don’t know how to go around asking her out.

Our second date was at brewery where we chatted for another 3 hours. Two days later he asked if he could join me while walking the dog, it was raining so I suggested a restaurant. We spent another 4 hours chatting, also on each of these dates I had my dog with me and he was amazing with him. Our most recent date was yesterday and without the dog. Had a great time together and spent about 6 hours.

he came on very strong in the beginning - showered me in compliments, always wanted to talk, made it clear he wanted a relationship with me. i was unsure at first since lovebombing is a thing, but after we went out a few times i ended up liking him.

every time we saw each other he seemed to be even more into me, so i started to let my guard down. this was a huge mistake because as soon as i did - responses were shorter, he stopped flirting, stopped asking me out. i asked him what was going on, he played dumb and continued to give me the bare minimum.

i asked him if we could talk in person about where this was going. we had both been honest from the start about talking to other people, but we had a mutual agreement that we only wanted to build something with each other. 

when i saw him to talk, he told me he had stopped talking to everyone else so he could focus on me, but felt we were moving too fast and that i would end up losing interest and really hurting him. this completely blindsided me as he had no reason to feel that way, especially when he was the reason we had even been “moving too fast,” which we weren’t at all. 

he told me we could still be “friends that kissed” (his words 🤮) until he decided if he could be in a relationship with me or not, since he was ""scared of his feelings."" i was obviously hurt and confused, so i made up an excuse for him to take me home. 

while this was happening, a girl i knew texted him. i asked him who she was to him and he said she was a friend. i didn't think much of it at the time considering he had always been honest and was sitting here telling me how scared he was of how much he liked me.

before he dropped me off, he tried to KISS ME, i obviously rejected it and he was upset but played it off. we didn’t talk until he texted me the next day. i told him i had changed my mind and didn't like the way things were going. instead of trying to fix it, he asked to be *just* friends and i said no, i couldn't be just friends after everything we had done together. he didn't say anything else, so that was that.

the next day he posted a picture with the girl that had texted him the night i saw him. i went to her profile and she had a vsco in her bio where she had posted more pictures of them, the first few from when him and i had first started to get serious. well, that explains a LOT.

In the beginning I was very curious about this guy because he wasn’t very sexually motivated and appeared to be really caring and nice. He would do all sorts of things for me and never expected anything sexual in return. He was happy to hand hold and cuddle which I did not mind. We finally talked about exclusivity 6 weeks in and he let on his ex gf and him are still friends and even though he is clear about it himself, She may still have feelings for him. He claims he cannot change her feelings for him and nothing he would do about it.  He had also begun dating other women after the supposed “ breakup” and he is seeing 3 other women regularly excluding me. I was shocked by this revelation and vast information but felt I was partly to blame for assuming otherwise. He doesn’t have nice things to say about his ex though I feel based on what he’s told me she seems to be quite nice to him. His exact words were “ I am getting bored with her” . By this time I must say red flags are already flashing all over as I try to process everything , how he treats women , his nonchalant attitude towards his ex who obviously is trying to get back with him and I also begin to realise that this isn’t a guy looking for a relationship. He is simply accepting women being nice to him and enjoying what he can and has no interest in making any commitments to anyone. 
A few days ago when we were talking he told me explicit details of the sex he had with one of the three women he was dating and finally he share that one of them had to get an abortion in dec. 
At this time I was disgusted and horrified but at the same time I felt maybe because I did invest some feelings and emotions in this guy because it’s been a couple of months now. I felt many feelings comprising of stupidity, anger and sadness . 
I felt very Angry with myself for not asking the questions I should have earlier , sad that this relationship didn’t work out because before the unearthing of red flags he seemed really nice and we got along.

Spoke for a couple of days. Went on our first date on Thursday and it ended up being a 5-6 hour long first date. Clearly liked each other’s company. 

Planned to meet up again, and invited her to come over for a movie and food evening on Friday. Had some home cooked dinner, watched a movie, cuddled and made out. Drove her home later in the evening. 

She hits me up on Saturday in the afternoon, and asks if she can come over. Saw a movie, talked, made out and just hanged with each other. And then she wanted to stay the night. 

So, we’re laying in bed. Start making out. Things do get a little steamy. She grabs my hand and put it over her boobs, and I start massaging them a little. Do it for a minute, and then she pushes my hand way saying she actually wants to take it slow. Totally fine with that. We’ll go at her pace, and whatever she is comfortable with.

Anyways, making out more. A few mins later, she grabs my hand again and this time puts it between her legs. I start rubbing her down there a bit, and she does the same thing again where she pushes my hand back. And again says, probably better to take slow. Again, totally fine by me. 

Back to kissing and all. Again a few mins in, she this time places her hand down my and starts to grab my penis. And then she does the same thing again and says, really should take it slow. This time I tell her, “Hey! We really don’t need to do any touching or anything, if you’re not comfortable. Better to just enjoy the moment, and let these things happen naturally. You’re clearly not comfortable, so let’s not do it until you are.” We make out a little more, and go to sleep. 

We wake up in the morning, still laying in bed and just talking about random stuff. Out of nowhere she brings up last night’s making out and the hanky-panky stuff and says, “I really want to do all those things with you, but COVID really has been a burden on my finances. Maybe we can come to some kind of financial arrangement.”

My jaw just drops. I am laying puzzled there thinking what she just said. I gather my thoughts for a minute, and then tell her, “Thank you for being honest about it with me, and I’m sorry that COVID has been tough on your finances. It’ll be over at some point and your life can resume okay then. But I don’t pay for sex, never have and never will.”

She says, “Okay! I’m gonna leave now. For my own sanity.” Gets up, changes to her own clothes and leaves.

So for context, I’m about to turn 22, and finishing up my bachelors. I’m looking at a nice 6 figure job in my company as a mechanical engineer. I’ve been doing engineering internships, apprenticeships, and research since I was 16, and just put half my life savings (low 5 figures) into my IRA, mutual fund, and some tech stocks. So I’m positioned to come out of the gate very strong and growth will be huge (fingers crossed)

I offer that context to my dilemma. Ever since high school I wasn’t the dating type. I was the quiet nice guy with his head in the books trying to make As in calculus rather than going to football games. Same story in college, couldn’t date because research and GPA were important for my resume. 

So I’m coming out of college basically new to the dating world, and I’m going to have to filter out a lot. I’m not going to bring up my wealth obviously, but when they see my Escalade or my parents 5000 foot house when I bring her for dinner, it’s going to be tough to hide.

I went on a date with a work colleague. I got there early and found a table and when he arrived I didn’t get a chance to hug him as he sat down pretty quickly.

He was very easy to talk to and we got a few laughs. We talked about ourselves but most of our conversation was about work (which I don’t think was good but anyway 😬).

We talked for about 2 hours and 30 mins. As it was our 1st date there were some little pauses but nothing too awkward.

Some context, he works in a different department then me so we barely knew each other anyway.

When we got up to say goodbye it was a bit awkward but we smiled and just said “see you at work on Thursday”. Didn’t get a hug in there as well.

The problem here is I've tried dating girls and dated few girls from my own country, but unfortunately every relationship never lasts for more than 2 months and it happens every time. At first I thought I've some issues or maybe I'm doing mistakes (ofcourse which girls find as a red flag). But after some thorough introspection, I've recognised few things such as Maybe I'm too gentle/friendly so ended up being in a friend zone/ Bro zone. Secondly I don't have that feature what people usually call ""Sex Appealing Personality"" which can be the biggest turn off nowadays cause we all live in Instagram world (I don't look either Timothee or Henry Cavill). In india as a man your Job status/Wealth depicts how much credible &amp; sexy you will be (I work in Telesales so chances are almost zero). I also don't do drugs, marijuana, LSD etc even alcohol I'm a teetotaler perhaps that shows I'm no fun or a boring mundane guy (Not even falling in bad boy category). 

So these were the major points which i found about me as a red flag. 

On the other hand I've also recognised some patterns from the girls side in my city where I live in, Here most of the girls choose to marry through arrange marriage connections (Ironically all of them had dated anyone before marrying to someone else) so basically they've tried to taste or tasted various cuisine/food before arriving in the traditional indian restaurant. In arrange marriage connections what generally happens is people search for marriage proposals through newspaper, Matrimony, and with the help of priests, so they can find better deal available in the market asap. So before finding the true love through this process, both the parties whether its a Groom's family or a Bride's family they present some terms and conditions to each other, if they agree on these terms and conditions then the deal is done if not then they looks for the other available options . {Terms and conditions be like :-
The groom has to earn more(monthly) than the bride's whole family (annually).
 The groom should be well settled in a first world country with the permanent residency Visa.
The groom should either have a corporate job in Maang companies or a Government job in the administrations.
The bride has to be slim &amp; fairer in colour, she should knows how to perform home chores correctly etc etc
 The Bride family has to offer atleast the expected amount of money before the wedding date and the rest of money can be given as bride gifts.(Dowry)
so it's sort of a Business deal or transaction from both the parties.}

In the scenario of love marriages or relationships, you only get to know that you found your soulmate successfully when your partner can afford a weekly holiday trip of Maldives/Dubai/Bali on vacations, if they can't  then the arrange marriage option is always open. In my city people love to pretend liberal but still choose the same lucrative options.

So in conclusion :- I've found that as an average indian guy dating is pretty much useless untill you've some other naughty agendas (FWB/Casual/ONS But these things only happens with those who are extremely attractive with higher sex appealing traits)  if I'm looking for a sustainable long term relationship in my country it can be real pain in the ass (but dating has to be fun, right?) and through dating, finding a genuine indian girl who can invest in a relationship for longer period of time is almost negligible (cause she got more options than any avg indian male, she doesn't have to put as much effort) not to mentioned Now-a-days there's a trend in india to marry a first world countries white male or female (obviously who got their shit together/Elite &amp; rich Indians go for that option).

The problem here is I've tried dating girls and dated few girls from my own country, but unfortunately every relationship never lasts for more than 2 months and it happens every time. At first I thought I've some issues or maybe I'm doing mistakes (ofcourse which girls find as a red flag). But after some thorough introspection, I've recognised few things such as Maybe I'm too gentle/friendly so ended up being in a friend zone/ Bro zone. Secondly I don't have that feature what people usually call ""Sex Appealing Personality"" which can be the biggest turn off nowadays cause we all live in Instagram world (I don't look either Timothee or Henry Cavill). In india as a man your Job status/Wealth depicts how much credible &amp; sexy you will be (I work in Telesales so chances are almost zero). I also don't do drugs, marijuana, LSD etc even alcohol I'm a teetotaler perhaps that shows I'm no fun or a boring mundane guy (Not even falling in bad boy category). 

So these were the major points which i found about me as a red flag. 

On the other hand I've also recognised some patterns from the girls side in my city where I live in, Here most of the girls choose to marry through arrange marriage connections (Ironically all of them had dated anyone before marrying to someone else) so basically they've tried to taste or tasted various cuisine/food before arriving in the traditional indian restaurant. In arrange marriage connections what generally happens is people search for marriage proposals through newspaper, Matrimony, and with the help of priests, so they can find better deal available in the market asap. So before finding the true love through this process, both the parties whether its a Groom's family or a Bride's family they present some terms and conditions to each other, if they agree on these terms and conditions then the deal is done if not then they looks for the other available options . {Terms and conditions be like :-
The groom has to earn more(monthly) than the bride's whole family (annually).
 The groom should be well settled in a first world country with the permanent residency Visa.
The groom should either have a corporate job in Maang companies or a Government job in the administrations.
The bride has to be slim &amp; fairer in colour, she should knows how to perform home chores correctly etc etc
 The Bride family has to offer atleast the expected amount of money before the wedding date and the rest of money can be given as bride gifts.(Dowry)
so it's sort of a Business deal or transaction from both the parties.}

In the scenario of love marriages or relationships, you only get to know that you found your soulmate successfully when your partner can afford a weekly holiday trip of Maldives/Dubai/Bali on vacations, if they can't  then the arrange marriage option is always open. In my city people love to pretend liberal but still choose the same lucrative options.

So in conclusion :- I've found that as an average indian guy dating is pretty much useless untill you've some other naughty wishes (FWB/Casual/ONS But these things only happens with those who are extremely attractive with higher sex appealing traits)  if I'm looking for a sustainable long term relationship in my country it can be real pain in the ass (but dating has to be fun, right?) and through dating, finding a genuine indian girl who can invest in a relationship for longer period of time is almost negligible (cause she got more options than any avg indian male, she doesn't have to put as much effort) not to mentioned Now-a-days there's a trend in india to marry a first world countries white male or female (obviously who got their shit together/Elite &amp; rich Indians go for that option). Therefore I'm starting to loose interest in Indian girls as a reliable partner (while living in this country itself) Where i can't see any growth romantically or strong sustainable bond in future. 

I really hope my new perception about dating indian girls will change in near future, let's hope for the best!

Plain and simple: If you make a new profile, and someone unattractive likes you first, you will be put into the bottom tier automatically and be shown a very unattractive discovery queue for the rest of your time on this app, unless you make a new profile. It's essentially First-come-first serve.

I've done this numerous times and it never fails: Make a new profile on hinge, You will see a lot of attractive people. Wait for the morbidly obese person to like your profile. Then watch your discovery queue. Good luck recovering from that, even setting the distance to 1 mile and working up doesn't yield good results in big cities.

On Tinder and Bumble, I am matching with very attractive women. On hinge, I am only shown morbidly obese women, or women who otherwise need some sort of immediate medical attention.  

Fraud:

I approached Hinge's customer support about their algorithm. As always, I was fed with a bs corporate wankery apology akin to 'sorry, we dont always get it right."" Customer support claims that the algorithm works by showing you matches that are similar to who you like. This is a blatant lie. I've had conversations with attractive women on Hinge prior to getting discovery-bombed. 

We all know that dating profiles are essentially fronts for data mining. Obviously the more profiles people make, the more data can be gathered from you, and hinge definitely participates in selling data. By using this algorithm, Hinge is essentially lying to their customer base, so that they can keep making new and new profiles until someone attractive likes them.

Well I have this sort of delima and need your advice on what to do. It's long because I'm going to give as much detail as possible to understand the situation. 

Back in 2018, I met this girl ""Tiffany"" online who lived 4 hours away from me. We had an online friendship for a few weeks and I learned she was very shy and didn't tell me much about her family when I asked about them. She told me at that time she was 29 I was 26. I told her I didn't want anything serious but agreed to just hook up, friends with benefits. We met face to face in December of that year, she drove to my house, and she was beautiful instant connection. She was very shy and so I made the first move on her. The sex and her kissing was awful, terrible and I thought I made a horrible mistake. We did go to dinner and she stayed over but I sent her home the next day which you could tell she was expecting to stay. 

Well I called her that night and we talked for hours and she told me something I wasn't expecting to hear. She told me she was a virgin but she was raped and molested as a child by her father and by her previous ex boyfriends. She said she was adopted and her family hid her adoption and she doesn't know her real birthday and she could be older than she says. I could see why she wasn't really good in bed so I was there for her. We started seeing more and more of each other and the sex got better and better. 

Fast forward to 2020,  I told her I was going to hook up with another girl and she got so upset at me started crying and hung up the phone on me. I called her crazy and jealous and I didn't like her that way. I felt too guilty to go because I was starting to fall in love with her but I didn't want to admit that to my heart because of previous bad relationships. Later that night I got a text from her friend saying she was in the hospital in a coma and didn't know was going to happen. I felt terrible I couldn't be there. She got out of the coma after a couple days and come to find out she had meningitis which effected her brain. I tried to be there for her but it's hard when she lives in another state from me. 

April 2021, she told me she was falling in love with me but I couldn't say it back and I could tell it hurt her. That night we fell asleep after a night of sex and I woke up to a text from my friend, ""Laura"" and she asked if I could have a child with her because her and her bf couldn't have children. Well upon getting this text, ""Tiffany"" got upset and wanted to leave but she was too tired to drive. Again I called her crazy and jealous. We didn't talk again until morning. 

December 2021, she came over for Christmas with my family and all had dinner and spent the holiday in good spirits. She bought my mom a beautiful necklace and bought my nieces and nephews gifts along with my brothers. On NYE we celebrated and I thought about about proposing to her until I found out she was chatting with me on IG but as some other female. When I questioned her about this she didn't denied it. She told me she wanted to know what I would say if someone messaged me and was flirting. I can understand why she did it because I'm not open with my feelings. I got upset and told her I needed a break from her and she left. 

Well the next couple days I was having dinner with my mother who met ""Tiff"" and really liked her and I explained how jealous and possessive she can be and my mother told me that she just might be afraid to lose stability in her life that she has with me since her whole life has been nothing but shit. My mom ever said she sounded like she may have a mental disorder she hasn't been treated for so I decided to ask her about it and she said she has been getting treated for depression, BPD, PTSD and cancer and all the medicine she's on makes her mentally crazy-her words- at times but she wants more than anything for this to work with me. She's a very sweet girl. Very rare, loyal, romantic and will actually take care of you and I've never been with someone so polite and actually thinks of me as more than money. She actually wants to be with me for my heart and soul and it makes me feel good that she actually does love me but I'm not sure if I can deal with all her baggage. 

I guess I just need advice if anyone has been in a relationship like this. I do love her but I feel like her disabilities and baggage bring me down.

I know what it feels like to be told you have to have sex you don't want. My rapist used my arousal and orgasms to say I deserved it and wanted it anyway. All that should have killed or at least changed my sex drive, but it didn't even stop then. That's how I know there's something wrong with me.

I've been single since 2018 after my divorce. I'm a single mom, work a ton, just bought a house and am constantly working on that, and I have weird hobbies that seem to attract men I'm not interested in. 

None of that *really* matters, but I'm just here to say how frustrated I am with my brain's random attempts at dating.

The first two times that I had some sort of connection, it was with guys who ended up being in a serious relationship. And what I mean by connection is a one sided crush that might have gone somewhere had they been single. One of them was someone who my friends had specifically told me we would have been a really good match and he was definitely into me pre- him getting a girlfriend. Right place wrong time. The next was someone who was just super friendly, we got along really well, and then as we got to chatting he obviously had a very serious relationship. Great guy, no bad intentions, I'm really good friends with him now and he's never even hinted at crossing a boundary. Had a great connection though, and I would say it would have had a chance. 

So it's not like I have bad taste in guys. I have *great* taste in guys, just turns out they've already been snatched up.

This most recent one is really making me laugh at myself though. I always thought people were crazy for being so gutsy and shooting their shot at a bar. It happens to me and I nicely let them down because, again, I don't have any interest in dating right now. 

But I'm dead serious when I say that for the first time in YEARS, I saw a guy and very quickly became interested and would have approached him. This is a big deal, I've never done that before. I was with my sister, was just doing some girl bonding and listening to karaoke. Turns out, he was the dj for the karaoke bar.  He got up to sing and it was AMAZING. Seemed really friendly with everyone, had a good sense of humor and would do duets with random people. He sang ""Be Prepared"" from The Lion King and I shit you not it was near perfection and he went full on theatrical. At first he didn't really catch my  eye aside from, ""oh, he is kind of cute"", but that's the kind of shit I'm into I guess, I was SUPER into him after that. I think he noticed me watching him, and I got all nervous. But for once I did not just hide behind my hair and pretend he didn't exist, I kept looking over at him and paid FULL attention when he was on stage. I have no idea if this is how you're supposed to go about this lmao, I was kind of just mesmerized. He announced that he would be back the next night. So I thought, ok, I'm going to pop back in tomorrow and strike up a conversation. 

He DEFINITELY recognized me when I walked in, because he was standing in line to grab a drink and when I walked in with my sister he straight on just stared and looked kind of surprised. I just walked by and got in line behind him and a couple of other people, and spent some time to just talking and not really paying any attention to him. I was actually just have a great conversation with some people, and of course, got pulled back in when I heard him doing karaoke. Was waiting til a bit later to talk to him, and thank god I did. Part way through the night a girl walks in and goes straight up to him and gives him a kiss. 

My poor little school girl crush heart. And I feel terrible because my brain keeps wanting to go back in and just enjoy the view/the singing and hope that someday he will be single and will approach me LMAO.

Anyway. Still no interest in dating, but I guess I can officially say that there is hope for me and I might actually start putting myself out there in the future!

Wish he would’ve just told me he wasn’t into it anymore nothing hurts more than not knowing what happened or why. I really thought we were going to become something real.

We met on New Year’s Eve at a bar, I approached her because she was standing there alone and looked upset, so I told her she needed a shot, we went shot for shot over 10 shots deep, shotgunned a white claw😂 then we started making our way to another bar, when I got sick, so she walked me back to my friends and put me in the car to go home, I got her Snapchat; because she said she doesn’t give out her number.

So anyhow, we talk on Snapchat for a week, and I ask to take her on a proper date. She told me all her dates end badly, so if I met her and her friend at a bar that weekend, her friend would decide if I could take her on a date. Went and met them, had a really good time, her friend said I could take her on a date. Still talking throughout the week on Snapchat, her communication is kinda poor in my opinion when she’s sober.

Date comes up, I take her to an nice restaurant, we talk without struggle. Make our way over to a bar, and drink and talk at the bar for the rest of the night. I challenge her to a game of pool for a second date; I beat her in pool, and she starts planning the second date. I’m a very blunt and straight forward person, I told her directly that I liked her and wanted to continue going on dates and spending time with her. She tells me honestly, she’s not ready for a relationship, she’s in college full time, can’t focus on labels or the stress of a relationship etc, but she tells me, 

“I don’t know when I’ll be ready, and it would be wrong of me to tell you to wait, I’m not saying never, I just don’t know when. I do like you too, I just don’t know how much yet.”

I respected that, it was honest and to the point, and it honestly just made her more admirable to me. So I tell her that I really have an interest in her, and would keep trying lol. 

Any how, back to the bar on our first date, we’re talking, she’s more open when she drinks, she tells me she likes me, but of course doesn’t know how much. Then tells me, “drunk me is telling you to keep pushing me to becoming more comfortable with you and all of this. My feelings are there for you, but not lust.

Two weeks pass after we talk every day and I ask her out. She says yes we go out and the date went well. 2 weeks later I hang out with her and her friends and nothing pretty much happened between us. The next day, schools started and our free time got reduced as you can imagine.

We were still chatting quite regularly and we hang out again with her friends after a month. (I should mention that before we hang out I had asked her twice out and she had some excuses not to go). Anyway, after that hang out I realise that I might be friendzoned. I sent her a message the following week telling her to tell me when she is available to go out because I wanted to say something to her in person. After that message she kept initiating conversation but never told me to hang out and she also said that lately she doesn't have time for anything other than school. I should also mention that she told to a mutual friend of ours that I wanted to tell her something in person and that friend even asked me about it.

A month later we chat and I asked her about what she did today and she told me she hang out that day. I then text her this message: ""instead of: I don't have time for anything other than school you could have told me: I don't have time for you"". The conversation we had pretty much didn't lead anywhere and it was something like a misunderstanding though I managed with the use of humor to make the situation more chilled so it would be considered as a fight.

A few days later I wish her happy birthday and we had a small talk. A few more days go by and she wishes me merry Christmas again leading to a small talk. We didn't talk for more than a week after that and that's where I decided that I had to figure things out. I sent her a voice message where I told her that I was kinda confused about what our relationship is like and I wanted to make sure we are on the same page

We have quite a conversation there and the main point is that she told me that she didn't have energy or time for anything more that friendly. I told her that we should find a field where our wants are aligned and that just friends isn't in that field. She then told me: So, I have to do something that I don't want, or cut off with you?
I reply with: same goes for me. It was kinda late when we had this convo and she told me that she had to to to bed. I told her: ok gn but we have to sort this out later. She replied: I know. Two weeks have passed including by birthday and i haven't received a text. I was thinking of sending her as I thought about it and staying friends wasn't that bad of an option for me after all but I didn't want to be the one to reach out once again, as I would be seen as needy if I wasn't already perceived like that.

I wonder what I did wrong about this. There are also some random things to mention here. She has really strict parents, she is pansexual and on the first hangout she told me she was more attracted to girls, the mutual friend I mentioned above told me that when he asked her if I had a chance she said:""he is handsome, plays 5 musical instruments and 3 sports.

Hello all, to give a brief overview, I (18m) started college in the fall. So far I have had a great experience, made many friends, and joined various clubs. I am happy with how things have gone and believe I am setting myself up well for my engineering ambitions!

However, with the New Year starting, I want to get out of my shell and start dating. I never dated in high school due to a variety of reasons, but mainly shyness and obliviousness to flirting. I’m also a very nerdy individual with my primary interests being math and physics lol. But I am also extremely active and outdoorsy (ran Track all 4 years of HS). 

I want to start bettering my social skills by starting to date, but I’m pretty awful when it comes to girls. I have no issues with my female friends, but I just don’t know how to ask a girl out. Like should I just approach a pretty girl I see around campus and ask her if she’d like to do something? I just don’t know where to begin.

I’ve also been insecure about my looks before, but I’ve been better about that. I have another post on my profile if you’re curious as to what I look like!

I feel tired and wanted to clean so i told him he can stay on the streets for 2 days or at some buddies with his ""headache"" and i'll deep clean this apartment with the help of hired housecleaners(it would have taken me a week to do all this job) and he got upset and ignored me for the whole entire day, am i the asshole?
