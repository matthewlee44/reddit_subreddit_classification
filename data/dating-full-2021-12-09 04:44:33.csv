OkCupid - not sure if I want to try this again, seeing the insane membership prices. I've heard they started limiting how many ""intros"" you can read or delaying them purposefully.

And as someone who is graduated I then tried online dating to see if I get any luck and completely wasted my time and now hate the concept of online dating and will never do that again. And so now at this point in time I just figured I’d say F it and will try to keep my mind on things that are actually worth obsessing over instead of the opposite gender, and if I do find a girl that I find cute again I will go talk to her depending on what’s going on.
Something that I will probably do is go to places where I can meet a lot of people that share the same interests as me but not to SPECIFICALLY get a girlfriend though, if I’m going to go a place to have fun and stuff it’s going to mainly be ,well, to have fun and I’ll keep talking to girls as a side thing.

So I started Hinge about a week ago and I’be had a lot of success with matches and even scheduled a couple of dates. The first date canceled day of and ghosted me despite pretty decent text chemistry and shared interest but oh well. The second one was actually really spontaneous but went really well and ended in a kiss. She even expressed interest in a second date. We met up again on Monday night and got food and talked for about 5 hours. We got into some deep conversation in my car and talked about what we want. She was comfortable with my putting my hand on her leg and we discussed intimacy. We’re both open about our Hinge experience and we recognize that we’re talking to others. She told me that she had gone on about 5 dates but ours had been the best by far and she said I was like an 8.8/10 compared to them averaging 5/10. At the end of the night I took her home and we kissed again. She told me she had a date the next day and I said that’s fine we’re not an item and right now it’s purely casual. We were texting throughout the day pretty well and then I got busy at work. By the time I got back to her i assume she was on her date and figured she’d reply after or sometime later. She never replied and this was at around 7:30 yesterday. I’m fine with her going on dates because I’m still arranging them myself but I felt like we really clicked casually at least and we made it clear we were fine with that. I’m especially surprised since she voiced that she really enjoyed our dates. I don’t want to “double text” her from my “What’s up?” On Monday evening but it feels weird to just suddenly lose contact. Should I wait a couple days and reach out with a simple message? Or just assume she ghosted and cut my losses. One important note is that she herself expressed wanting to be casual and I said that’s fine with me. 

TL;DR 
Went on two dates with a girl Friday then next Monday. 
Spent hours talking on both dates and ended with kissing
Voiced mutual interest
Voiced openness to casualness and seeing others but willing to commit
Texted relatively often then seemingly ghosted

I was kind of hurt by that but in the moment I was like, ya sure we can just be like booty calls or something. 

The next date we talked about it, and I guess she didn’t necessarily mean just casual, and that she was actually hurt by me just wanting to do like a booty call type thing, so we talked about it and she said she didn’t want to rush into anything and was scared of commitment. We settled on kind of seeing where things go and after that we made out for awhile and all was cool. She told me she’s not seeing anybody else and didn’t feel the need to see anybody else, but I was going on dates here and there at the time, but stopped bc they never went anywhere.

Also, something that’s been keeping more invested is that she’s been saying how much she wants to have sex with me, how I’m her type physically, and we talk about our desires, but she wanted me to get tested (which I did snd i just got the results yesterday). 

Our last date we went to a drive in movie theater, and we cuddled and then made out a lot, and it felt more real I guess.

I’m getting like this gut feeling to like ask for a relationship for some reason, and even though I’m not ready yet to commit 100% there’s something telling me to just put it out there. I should add that I’m going to be away for 3 weeks of December, so this our last date until Im gone for a little and I just feel like if i don’t do it now them things might fade away or something.

Their single friend (31M) must’ve seen me but maybe he was behind me because I didn’t see him. He had said I was “beautiful”. Apparently he’s a shy guy because they had to convince him to contact me weeks later (after finding out through my dad at the gym they see sometimes) that I’m single. Well he sent me a DM on Instagram and we have been chatting. He’s taken me to dinner twice and then we did a group date dinner and drinks downtown over the weekend (6 of us total, including the mutual couple/my clients). I feel comfortable with him he’s funny, simple, nice guy, he makes me laugh and is pretty goofy. He owns a house and has worked at the same company for 13 years. He holds the door open for me, has paid without hesitation, he texts me after our dates, we text daily (longer texts) and he asks me questions about myself and my small business. Also, he invited me to a friends bbq party in 2 weeks. 

But he seems to be nervous about physical touch and compliments. He didn’t kiss me until the second date which is fine, it was a peck. He hasn’t held my hand or put his arm around me yet. He has only kissed me at the end of our dates, no tongue. Tonight we drove around looking at Christmas lights (technically 4th date), laughing and chatting. But again, no physical touch except kissing me at the end of the date. I’ve been flirty, putting my hand on his arm or shoulder several times when he said something that makes me laugh. They did say that he’s a shy type of guy, and that he is divorced but him and I haven’t discussed our pasts yet. He also hasn’t given me any physical compliments at all; hasn’t called me beautiful or anything. Who I is come a lot of guys throw meaningless compliments at women. 

Maybe he is nervous to date? Maybe he doesn’t have much dating experience? Could something else be holding him back? Do you think the more time I spend with him he I’ll warm up to me?

Then he goes on to say how when people react like that it makes him feel unwanted but he totally understands where I’m coming from and why I asked that. I told him I want him &amp; that I was just overthinking. He fell asleep but I couldn’t stop thinking of it.. so I woke him up and kind of told him “im sorry &amp; I like you a lot and I should let something like herpes get in the way of that” he said “again bad timing haha im half asleep, but you’re sweet” he hugged me and then I left.

This chick that I met when I worked at this outlet mall. She worked in two of the stores out there, a bookstore and Hot Topic. The reason she's on my mind right now is because when I met her her personality her character was just like a breath of fresh air. When I first met her I had no intentions of trying to holla at her, get her number date none of that. I was new to the security company there and I just wanted to just dip into some of the stores most of which I ain't never heard of and just kind of introduce myself. 

I became cool with her and the older lady who ran the store which I found out later was a weed smoker like me.😆 So I knew I made a friend. Anyway, this chick has such a cool personality and everything that I just knew that we were going to be friends. I would dip into that store every day I worked just to say what's up. Still no intentions are trying to get with her or none of that, I just liked her personality. It's crazy now to think that for the longest time I didn't realize she had a body on her. For real, she has some ass on her! 😂 I didn't realize that for the longest time because I just enjoyed her company and just talking.

One day she was walking back to one of the stores she was working in and I just noticed she had some ass on her. Then from there I just realized Goddamn she got a nice body like hourglass shape. No bullshit. I started thinking... What did not realize this before??🤔 I'm security at this outlet mall I'm supposed to be vigilant but I didn't notice that?

When we spend time together, he is so affectionate. He cuddles me constantly, and is checking if I am comfortable and happy. Strokes my face, plays with my hair, drowns me in affection.  
We spent all Sunday together, and when we left things, he sent me a message saying he had a wonderful day with me.

However, since, I have noticed him pull back a lot. He isn't messaging me a lot and when he does, there is like, hours and hours gaps between. I haven't heard from him today at all, and I don't want to message first, as I have all week and don't want to be clingy.  
I am trying incredibly hard, as I don't want to ruin this one - I really like him.

I recently found feelings for a girl I re-connected with. I included her in my my friend group (which we all know each other from a study abroad trip). we all somehow ended up in the same city after college. I have a special bond with this girl, we have a lot in common and appear to flirt a lot. Nevertheless, she is also the mysterious kind, very beautiful but hard to read. (Btw she knows I’m into her but despite all that she hasn’t changed with me). I got her a present this year, and since she lives close to work, I plan on delivering it to her before I leave for my hometown. I’d love to leave her a nice letter with it. I really don’t want it to be a creepy “I love you letter” but more of a “Merry Christmas, you’re beautiful and I’m happy to have spent this year around you”. I want it to be truly a Christmas letter but also a nudge saying “hey! I exist, and I care about you because I feel so comfortable around you”.  My question for you ladies is…. What are simple things that guys have written for you that have made you notice them? 

Im also coming from a poisonous relationship where I tried too hard, she was my fiancé and then cheated and left me after calling me fat and insulting me. I spent the next several months growing mentally, finding my self love and confidence again. I went to the gym, got fit. Moved into a new city, made it to a job working with world leaders, built this wonderful friend group, got my own place and have been very happy. Having feelings again is a HUGE step for me, and I’d like my next relationship to come naturally and unforced.

We live far away so we don't meet all the time but we talk almost every day on the phone.
We have told each other how much we like and everything was going fine.
This guy traveled to another city for his vacations. He would send me pics in the day showing me what he was doing and in the night we would talk until we go to sleep. He told me everyday how much he wanted me to be there with him and constantly flirting.
The thing is, 2 days ago he told me a girl approached him at the hotel's pool and he felt good about himself and attractive. Nothing wrong with that.
Yesterday I texted him a good morning message and he answered back with 2 selfies with 2 different pretty girls (because we have this silly joke about me playing to be toxic over him).
I asked if he was testing me or something and he said he was testing my levels of toxicity. I let him know I didn't like this joke at all. He understood, said he was an idiot and apologized.
Later I saw a story he made with one of this girls (the one that flirted with him at the hotel).
I felt so bad about this but I said nothing to him.
In the night he texted and told me I looked very beautiful in a Pic I posted and told me how much he likes me and more flirting stuff.
Then, he said he was so sad about his vacations ending (he is in crisis because he's unhapoy about his job and life), then he told me about this girl, he said he was sorry for telling me this but he things he had a crush on her and that they kissed and he was feeling so sad to leave because of her too...

I felt so hurt, and also upset because he wasn't taking care of my feelings. I mean, he's single and he can do whatever he wants but why would he tell me about it??

Update is that I'm still grieving the loss of the potential relationship I thought I was going to have. We dated for 2 months, I definitely caught feelings, they don't want to pursue anything further and I'm having a hard time with it. Lots of tearful days! 
Some people told me to ask these people why I'm getting rejected and the answer I was given this time around was that they didn't want a relationship and dating me was starting to feel like being in one. They apparently think I'm great but they don't want to pursue anything serious with me. Really in my feels and torn up over this.

I went on a date on Tuesday night (hours after still crying about the other one lol) and they were really lovely. Funny story, I actually used to date their step brother 4 years ago and that's how we met originally. Saw them for the first time in 4 years that night, and we spent the entire time laughing and had a good night. I invited them out for a second date this Saturday...? So fingers crossed on that one.

I'm really commited to trying to move on from the last person I was dating as I am really hurt and think I deserve to be with someone that knows they want me. Anyone else in the same boat?

I got a lot of good advice last time, (and a lot of really bad advice too lol - yes I'm talking about people literally telling me I was too smart and should play dumb to get a man and that men prefer 'less intelligent women') and I think I'm definitely going to spend some more time and attention figuring out how I act with people to determine what's pushing people away. And perhaps there's needs of my own I'm not fulfilling and need to be catering to my inner child a little better.

Some people told me that my fitness and career in MMA might be what puts potential partners off... But everyone I date knows what I look like and what my job is in advance ! It's something I'm proud of. Also I am still a very feminine person, how I look in gym clothes and posing Vs me with my hair down and in a dressed up at the weekend look very different! I'm also an athlete not a bodybuilder so it's not like I'm massive! Just very fit (and happen to also have muscles).

Anyway, I'm just on my own journey here. I'd love to eventually find my person as I'm so exhausted by the constant rejection and failed talking/dating attempts.

I knew that I had to be careful with attaching myself to her, because I was aware of the 'rebounding' possibility.

We both lived (and still live) with our parents, so our dates would be in my car, spending on average 5 evenings a week together. At the time I felt like this was too much interaction, but I told myself it felt good and I didn't want to believe it was too much (or act upon it).

Up to meeting her I hadn't been in any serious relationship yet and I didn't have any experience working towards a relationship or dating in a healthy way, I just did what felt right. In hindsight, I've learned a lot from the experience I'm writing about right now. For example, I now know I have a ENFJ / Protagonist personality and I tend to either fall in love hard, or not fall in love at all. I fell in love with her hard, probably because she was open to it in the first 3 months (maybe because of wanting distraction / rebound feelings) and I'm the type of person who wants to give 110% of their love and (at least then) had trouble tempering my love-output towards her (even though she acted the same way until it ended).

The week before christmas 2018, I felt an unbalance entering our contact and around christmas we met up and she told me it was too soon, she wasn't ready and she thought I was the sweetest guy but that it wouldn't work right now. I was shocked, because for me it was like thunder in a clear sky. I was emotionally wrecked.

Me, being very unexperienced in relationships, dating and love, stayed in contact and in a desperate mind kept meeting up with her and proposed her to try friend with benefits. Again in hindsight, I only hurt myself more and probably gave her an even more needy image of me. After two months of contact after the 'break-up' and a LOT of desperately watching dating/relationship/break-up videos and posts on reddit I decided it would be the best for me to try the No Contact Rule.

I thought it would make her come back to me, or at least let her know I could move on. I told her when meeting up, but the way I told her, it felt too me like I gave her the feeling I was so in love with her I couldn't bear staying in contact (not moving on because of an abundance mindset, but to save myself from any more harmful emotional heartbreak feelings).

No contact was going on for exactly 2 weeks and her birthday came up (16th of february). I was still going with the no contact rule and hadn't congratulated her on her birthday either, because I thought that would break the rule. That night, I was at a friends' place and 4am I discovered a missed call from her. I called back 15 minutes later and she was drunk, going from the city to her parents' house. I asked her why she had called and she told me she would tell me the next morning.

The next morning came and during the day she whatsapped me and apoligized for calling me that night and she also replied that she didn't remember why she called me. I was confused by this and went to tell my mutual friend (who connected us) about the situation. She thought it was strange behaviour too and had a meeting with her to ask why she acted this way and strung my feelings along by calling me drunk on her birthday while she knew I wanted no contact. She told her she didn't know why, but also that her previous relationship was too fresh and she wanted to stay single and look around a little more. After I heard this from our mutual friend I decided I was going to keep no contact and try to move on.

In the next year there was one occasion in the summer where I would go on a boat on a hot summer day with a group of friends and our mutual friend asked me if I was okay with her coming with my mutual friend. At this point I was definitely okay with it, but the point was I still had feelings for her (even though no contact had been going for at least 6 months by then, I felt she was my soulmate at the time, maybe because she broke up in the middle of our honeymoon phase).

The day went by fine, and we (the group) ended op at the house of a friend she was looking after. During the night everybody left and somehow I stayed (in the hope of a special moment or something) and looking back I can see/imagine myself acting needy that night hoping for some sign or affection. When I eventually left, I felt horrible, like I had spent 6 months of no contact to throw it all away with such a stupid needy action.

Some months passed and when the winther of 2019 came around she, our mutual friend and her gf had a couple of nights as friends when we watched movies together but nothing special (even though I still deep inside hoped for a sign of her towards me).

During 2020 we remained in contact as friends, I was over her in the sense that I didn't fantasize/think of her and I could honestly say that I had moved on at that time. We used to meet up once every 2 months or so, had a great fun night in the car, drove around, laughed and had a good time (just friends).

However, I always, and still to this day, am convinced that she is a perfect match for me (at least for me) but that I acted unfortunate (needy, too-loving) during our short time together plus the timing for her wasn't right (3 weeks out of 2.5 year first relationship), her being young (19 at the time). She probably wanted to be single, have fun, enjoy her freedom after a 2.5 year relationship and I thought I met the girl of my dreams and was realy to fully love her and get into a settling relationship. She is everything I look for in a girl and based on the honeymoon phase we had I had the impression it was mutual.

Now yesterday I met up with her for the first time since maybe half a year and we had a really, really great time. We laughed, I saw her looking at me a certain way sometimes, it felt natural and good. She even had the perfume on I gave her 3 years ago! On the way to home after I dropped her off, I could only think about how to initiate something romantic again, or at least pulse how she feels about romance. On the other hand I don't want to be the 'always available, clingy' guy the relationship / break-up videos warned me about.

I'm torn between doing what I feel is best (because that didn't end up well for me in romance, going 110% on the love-throttle etc) and following someone else's advice (which might also not work out as I want to). One thing I do know, is that I dearly want to have another honest chance with her.

I learned a LOT from my my short time with her, because it was my first real serious short dating/relationship period (even though we didn't officialy have a relationship) and I learned to have balance and let the girl do the pacing working towards a relationship. I see my mistakes I made and the situation back then and I would like to have some reflection on my experiences or advice on how to best approach this situation.

If you are reading this, thanks so much for reading the whole story.

**TL;DR**

Me (27M) and her (22F) met september 2018 on a birthday of a mutual friend. Three weeks prior to meeting me, her first relationship of 2.5 years had ended. I knew that there was a posibility of a rebound, but it felt good so I went along. We met up at least 5 times a week, in my car and had the greatest time. I told myself it was too much, but I didn't want to listen to myself. I hadn't been in a serious relationship yet and next to that I am an ENFJ / Protagonist personality.

I'm the type of person who want to give 110% love from the start. This, in combination with her fresh ended relationship resulted in her cutting our being together off after 3 months.

I stayed in touch with her for two months, but after watching a lot of video's on dating/break-up etc I told her I wanted no contact (and in my mind I projected it as if I was so heartbroken I couldn't stay in touch with her because of my hurting). After two weeks of no contact I received a missed call in the night, I called back and she was drunk, she would explain why she called the next morning. The next morning she let me know she didn't remember why she called me. Our mutual friend who connected us asked her why she called me when I wanted no contact and also said her she couldn't remember but also that her previous relationship was too fresh and she wanted to be single and look around.

In the next year we met up through a mutual friend group once, it was fun and we ended up together at her friends place, everybody else had gone. I remember hoping for something and that way acting needy. I felt horrible leaving eventually, because I felt like I had thrown 6 months of no contact away for nothing. During 2020 we remained meeting up every month or two as friends, and I could honestly say my feelings for her were at an all time low and weren't bothering me.

Now yesterday I met up with her for the first time since maybe half a year and we had a really, really great time. On the way to home after I dropped her off, I could only think about how to initiate something romantic again, or at least pulse how she feels about romance. On the other hand I don't want to be the 'always available, clingy' guy the relationship / break-up videos warned me about. However, I always, and still to this day, am convinced that she is a perfect match for me.

How about this as a message to my new match:

""Hey I've just realised we have a mutual friend with whom I was recently involved with romantically and for her sake, feel it would be best to not continue to connect online like this.

Firstly - I can't stress it enough - **no mental issue is an excuse to be mean to others**, especially those who you love. It can happen, so when it does, apologize and do not do it again. Just don't. You are not responsible for your feelings but you are responsible for your actions. I will try to summarize things that helped me; alter it freely depending on your situation.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Admit you have a problem. You won't get anywhere if you choose to deny it and blame the cruel world and mean, horrible people around you. 
2. Find a guide. Therapist, friend, beloved author. When I find myself in a difficult situation, I ask what would my favourite writer do. But! If you choose a therapist, don't assume it's some kind of a wizard that would flink a wand and magically erase all of your problems. They're a complete stranger who sees like... six people a day. And they don't read your mind, they can't deal with your problems for you. They can ask the right questions, make suggestions etc. but the hard work is on you. If you won't do your part, nobody will. Work hard and have faith in you.
3. Nobody can read your mind. If you need a hug, just tell it. If you need to be alone, just tell it. If you expect your SO to ""just"" know you need something and know how you feel, and then rant about how they lack empathy, it's not fair. 
4. Don't get addicted. Flattering is like a heroin, you always need more. Keep in mind that while a sweet moment at the end of the day might be refreshing for both of you, constant begging for attention is lame. Think carefully on how much do you really need to feel comfortable.
5. Don't overuse help. People like to feel needed and people like to be heroes. But you are a grown up person, you can do more than you think. Use the energy you get from knowing your SO made this little great step towards you and try to do things on your own.
6. You are more than your diagnosis. That issue is just something that occured to you, not some major part of your personality. It might be there for a long time, but you don't have to be limited by that. Acknowledge your feelings, know their place, but don't let them guide you. They lie.
7. Feelings lie. They are real in a way but it's just an illusion. If you feel unloved, it's your feeling. Not reality, usually. It's your disease trying to take control over you. Feelings are just how we get inflicted by reality. Not the reality. (Note that intuition is something totally different but to know the difference you have to train a lot.)
8. Don't count too much on medication. It can help to stabilize your mood, help you with the worst, but it's a simmilar story as a therapist - you are the one who has to do the work. If you can though, try to deal with your issues without medication.
9. Even perfectly healthy people are not the same. What you might see as a problem, others may percieve as normal. Just be honest and try to act mature before flipping out.
10. If you feel like it, give a chance to an alternative approach. Personally, I found transpersonal psychology to be great: psychedelics and holotropic breathing (it can be illegal in some countries though). It helped me to see things differently. If you decide to give it a try, study the method thoroughly or find a specialist; beware of fake gurus and people claiming they will solve your problems.
11. Love yourself sincerely. It can be harsh to say, but you cannot have love others in a healthy way if you constantly hate yourself and beat yourself up.
12. Try to improve yourselves. Use the time you have to grow. Not because of others; just find your way and follow it. Live by your best conscience and do it for yourselves.
13. Make a list of your qualities, write it down and when you doubt about yourself, just read it. If you feel bad about it, or inappropriate, I'll start: I am intelligent, creative, great writer in my language, painter, excellent mother, good with money, capable teacher, great driver, can be awkward in five languages, inspiring, persistent and loyal.

Her name is Kristen (that’s not how she spells it, but I’m giving her at least a little animosity) and she’s 29 (4 years older than me). I figured why not shoot my shot. I got nothing to lose. Worst case scenario she doesn’t respond. I like her profile and send a cheesy joke about pick up limes with some lemon emojis because there are no lime emojis with Apple. To my surprise she liked me back and responded saying that was 9/10 and included 4 cry laughing emojis. We talk briefly and I find out she has 2 kids, which doesn’t bother me at all. I actually look forward to being a father (step or otherwise) because my dad wasn’t a very good father until he had my 2 sisters with my stepmom (they’re 23 and 24.5 years younger than me) so I get excited when presented with an opportunity to be a father figure in someone’s life.

I wasn’t surprised when he said it. He was really charming on our first date. 

After we hooked up the dynamic didn’t change. He’s made dinner with me 3x and met one of my friends and I out for dinner and offered to pay for it. Late at night when going to bed I stayed up later to do yoga by myself and he asked to join and did it with me (said he never did it before)

But he hasn’t taken me out on a date date other than when we first met. And that was just a drink and lots of walking around.

Although we text everyday often initiated by him he takes forever to text back, but is on his phone often when I’m around him. 

He has an insane amount of condoms it seems and last time I was at his place he had just moved into a new apt and the condom bag next to the bed was wide open where as it is normally zipped shut.

We talked and laugh so much with each other. We only had 4 dates but all of them were just great. We just kept talking non stop always knowing what how to keep a conversation going. Unfortunately we couldn't exactly work out as she stated to me she ""isn't ready for a relationship"" which I hope to believe as her best friend reassured to me she's not the type to date around and is always more of a very workaholic person in school that I greatly respect. She however did claim that she really does like me and if I remember correctly that there was nothing wrong about myself that she doesn't find attractive indicating that I way I see it is that she really did had a spark in her to attempt to possibly progress something further between us, but unfortunately her own career got the best of her and cannot balance it with dating for relationship. We remained friends as she wanted to do so and that we can still talk and I can hit her up whether its gaming, simply chatting etc. She isn't really sure about getting back to dating after finishing school or not. Also, I apparently was the very first person she has ever opened up to about her feelings and other personal issues that Im honored to. Was planning to see her this week  just to catch up but communication generally with her is pretty difficult as she's not that great of texter and a person to be on her phone all the time. I've even noticed when we had our dates as she was really focused on me barely taking her phone out unless it's waiting for me from the restroom or we get back in the car from our date for a short moment, even friends herself tend to have difficulties reaching out to her at times and notice she just does not take her phone out at all but they do accept her habit of not communicating back sooner. I know for a fact we had did not establish any label as we just had 4 dates still but, I really wanted to get to know her a lot more better about herself, and wanted to eventually allow her to get to know me further as well. She was someone I really enjoyed talking and looked forward on working it out to possibly be something more to her, but of course things can change.

We're friends but I do deeply miss her as I don't always want to talk to her like when we dated as I want to respect her space on her own, dating her gave me a drive to get my shit together and now I got hired to a part time job I ever wanted to experience in, that isn't to say that I want to rely on someone to get a boost but its only more of a bonus. I really do like her still even today, I trust myself to be platonic and respectful to her wishes, but I sadly do hope, and I know in ways its unhealthy to some, she is someone that's worth the wait to date again. But if it doesn't go well, I'll be prepared to accept it. I hope she's managing well there on school and importantly being safe and healthy no matter how much I may be really saddened or upset that she doesn't reply sooner with me whenever I try to reach out sometimes. I don't want to hold her back creating possible inconvenient issues to someone who's very career driven. Just again uh, hope me accepting to wait is really worth it.

Of-course there's also an indicator for those that don’t want to be bothered by others. (Red)

Since they are a wearable item, people can easily choose to not wear them if they don't want to or change their mind, unlike something more permanent like a tattoo or piercing. 

No, the colour of your other cosmetics like watch strap, choker, bracelets, necklace, fingernails, hair, etc, won’t be considered an indicator.

You do not have to wear multiple items if you want to use multiple colours. You can use an item that is split coloured.

The date was great, he was sweet and kind and offered to pay for everything, but he also told me a very weird story.
Please give me your opinions. 
1. He told me he has just got out of a serious, long term relationship. They used to live together and were supposed to marry this february, but he doesn't feel ready to settle down yet. Now they have technically broken up and they don't live together anymore, but he is still in love with her. They still see each other from time to time and he is trying to make up his mind. He has time until february to decide.
I thought, okay, this is pretty straightforward.  He is lying. He is still with his ex and wants to cheat, he wants me as his side chick, or they are really no longer together and he wants to use me as his rebound.
But then...

2. He told me he is a virgin (at 28!) because his ex, who is an albanian muslim, wanted to wait for marriage. I found this very weird, because premarital sex is the norm here and he is neither religious nor asexual. Who would sign up for a relationship like that?  I also found it odd that they lived together but never had sex. I mean, living together before marriage is also forbidden in islam. And how could they resist the temptation? But that could still be believable, I mean, people do weird things for love or maybe he was desperate and she was his only offer. I could have still bought that. 
However...

3) he doesn't know how to kiss. Didn't know what a french kiss was, didn't know you are supposed to kiss with your tongue. He kept giving me these pecks on the lips like a kid. I had to ask him ""why don't we try to kiss with our tongues?"" but he just didn't get it. I tried to teach him, but he was so bad at it. He just didn't know where to put his tongue. I've kissed plenty of inexperienced guys before and no one sucked so bad. It's clear he has never kissed. So not only he has never had sex with his soon to be wife, but they never kissed either?? Not even once? Despite living together??? It makes 0 sense, if she is so religious that she won't even kiss him before marriage then she wouldn't move in with him either. Also, who would be in a relationship like that??? But even then, how can you be so clueless at 28? Has he never watched a porn movie or a kissing scene in his life?? I learned that stuff in middle school. 
Plus, when I sucked on his tongue, he was mesmerized and said ""wow, how weird!"". Seriously??

4) he told me he wanted to leave his ex for another girl at one point. A foreign mexican girl who was visiting our city. He said she showed him more affection than his ex, but evidently they never had sex and didn't kiss either, so what was his logic?  Did he seriously want to leave his ex for a girl who lives on the other side of the planet and whom he has never even kissed? Also, I'm absolutely convinced that a strange turist girl who was here for one week at most was looking for a purely platonic relationship. Lmao.

5) during dinner he asked me if he could reply to a text. I managed to read the text. It was from his mother and said ""do we get to see this cutie at least??"", which clearly referred to me. So... this man who was supposed to marry somebody else in a few months and who just broke up with his ex has already told his mom about me
Before our first actual date. And they are totally enthusiastic about it. I mean who wouldn't tell their parents if they were jumping from one girl to the next??

6) on his telegram he has a picture of a red lights club. All his contacts can see it. So... did he go there with his virgin muslim fiancé? Was she okay with letting him go there without her? Is he not afraid that she will see it? 

So yeah, some things don't add up. This story sounds so fake. But why would someone would make up such an elaborate story like that?

We're both filmmakers, so we were talking about a movie that was recently showing in the theaters and I told him that ""If he wants, we can go to the film the same day"" and he agreed. So I was the one who proposed going together and mentioned the film in the first place. The morning of that day he texted me and made sure that I was coming. When I went to the theatre, he had already bought the tickets for both of us and we sat next to each other during the film. After the film, we talked a bit about the film while we were walking and he asked me how I was going to return home. I said with the bus but he didn't walk me to the bus station. He turned left towards his home when we arrived at the turn and just said a simple ""See you"". Also, while we were walking I mentioned that there's a really good burger place down the street and I was going to eat something from there. I could've just said, ""Do you want to eat something together?"" but I panicked and this was what came out of my mouth. He said that his family was waiting for him at his house otherwise he would join me. Then we PASSED that burger place while walking and I didn't buy anything. So it was a very awkward situation.

The thing is, I really like this boy. I never had a boyfriend before and I don't know how to act. And as far as I know, he didn't have a girlfriend before either. We are not very close because we met this year and only saw each other four times (including this ""date"") and only got to have a proper conversation once (when he asked me to have dinner with him and his friend after a film event). So I think it's better and healthier if we don't rush and move slowly. But I also fear that he's not interested in me and just wants to be good friends.

I am an overthinker unfortunately and I only have one friend to talk about these things and I wanted to hear the opinions of other people, especially guys, about this ""date"". Do you think this burger thing ruined the date and ruined my chances with him? Do you think he came to the movies with me just because he is nice and wanted to be a good friend or is there a chance that he's interested in me? I never sensed him feeling a romantic attraction. towards me, but he's a teen boy and teen boys usually think about these things. Do you think a 17-year-old teen boy might not think about romantic or sexual attraction at all when he's at the movies with an 18-year-old girl? Or do you think he senses that there's romantic tension between us? Or is he completely blunt to this? Also, I was the one who initiated this date, so should I text him for the second one or should I wait?

I know these questions might require some more background context about me and him, but that's all I can provide. I hope that guys out there who are more experienced than me can reply to my questions and educate me more about how teen boys think. Thanks!

I started dating again and I've noticed it is taking a toll on my mental health much more than I expected. I don't think I am able to handle the rollercoaster of emotions when I get excited about someone only to lead to disappointment. It doesn't happen often because I rarely feel chemistry/a connection with someone, but when I feel let down it puts me into a really dark place and I feel depressed and have a hard time handling the emotions that come with it. This self critical voice comes in and just feels really loud and I have this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Okay so context, been talking to this girl online for a couple of weeks now and want to take her out on a first date. She doesn’t drink at all and she told me a funny story about her childhood. Turns out when she was little she refused to eat anything unless it was blue. Her parents literally had to appease her by getting her blue lollipops, sweets/drinks or promising her they would otherwise she would not eat. Found it incredibly funny and i thought it would be a fun idea to re-create that for a first date. So i want to take her somewhere that she has the option of ordering something blue. I’m thinking cakes/cupcakes but i’m open to suggestions. Any ideas? Also i live in London so if you have specific places to suggest please go for it. Thank you

Next thing I know her friends just randomly join us for a drink at the bar. My nerves for asking her out were maybe 30% , 100% being difusing a nuclear bomb... my nerves for meeting her friends on the other hand... probably closer to 65%... I was fucking petrified. I thought, if I don't impress her friends now she's gonna leave me immediately and they're all gonna laugh at me. It's safe to say, I absolutely crumbled, I was stumbling over my words, overcompensating , changing my personality to be a 'nice guy' and kissing their asses.... this was the beginning of the end with this girl. But not because I didn't impress her friends, because one simple change in the dynamic completely threw me off.

If I could go back and tell myself something in that moment, it would he this. There is literally no losing when it comes to meeting her friends and family. People are not attracted to perfection, they are attracted to people who make them feel good, perfect people dont make others feel good they make them feel inferior and uncomfortable... isn't the most common compliment about popular celebrities  ""I love that guy he's so relatable "" it's not ""he's so perfect"".... think about it, would you trust a girl who always had the perfect thing to say? Who was trying hard to get your approval? No of course not. 

Truth is, being controversial is the most attractive thing. Other people saying they dont like you will make her double down on why she likes you, she your flaws will make her laugh, make her feel positive things which is what you want, as will hers. She will feel like an insider who understands something that nobody else does. And your flaws will bring her confort and make her feel at ease about her flaws. If you somehow managed to pull off being perfect (which would certainly just make you look insecure), she would just feel inadequate around you and would become resentful of you.

Finally let's imagine the worst case scenario,  you are complete yourself, but her family and friends hate you, they tell her how much they hate you and now your girl leaves you.... Good.... if she cares more about their views than her own , and can't be bothered to look past the surface level interactions her friends and family have had with you to see your good qualities.  Why would you want to be with her anyway? You've just polarised her and you can move on to someone who can see your positive sides.

And of course if they do like you, you've made more friends

Grew up in a strict environment + my poor mental health made me a late bloomer when it comes with dating. This sept. I started to put myself out there and went on a couple dates. There was this one guy who I have been talking to since. We talked for about a month via texts because scheduling did not work out for a while. Then we started on going on 1-2 dates a week for a month. He asked for me to come on a weekend trip with him for his birthday. My first thought was I'm not ready for that.

The main reason I didn't want to go is because I am not dumb, I know there is typically an expectation for sex with overnight trips. I was a virgin. I told him my reservations and he assured me I was 'safe' and that there were 'no expectations'. So I said fuck it, let me live a little and agreed. The trip was this past weekend, We were having a good time, towards the end of the night we both wanted to get some drinks. We took a couple of shots (5-6 each). Dumb decision, I know...but I was nervous. Things started to get intimate/sexual. At that point, I was fine with everything except for sex. I told him 'we are not having sex'. He was like why did you say it like that...in my head I thought we could do other stuff. I then proceeded to tell him I was a virgin. To give him an explanation of why I didn't want to have sex with him. At that point, I was waiting for a committed relationship before I took that step. Never been in a relationship. He didn't believe I was virgin. I said let me call my best friend and he wouldn't let me in a jokingly way.

The next sequence of events are blurry. I was really out of it at this point. I don't remember it all clearly. He took my pants off and was about to put 'it' in and the only thing I could say was to put on a condom. Which I guess at the time was me giving consent. I wish I stopped it at this point but I again was out of it. Then we had sex. It hurt me physically. He didn't finish, said he was too drunk. I told him to stop, he did. He went to shower, I cried immediately after and called my friend.

So im here because I know that what happened was ehh. On my end, I could of done things differently and same thing on his end. I just feel so numb and empty about how things happened. I have a tendency to avoid issues. It's been a couple days...feel like im coping with losing something that was super important to me. Other side of me is thinking super toxic like maybe I should do it again with him so I have all the power in my decision and autonomy. Or maybe I should with someone else.

I do plan on seeing a psychologist for talk therapy (not just about this but a plethora of things). but am waiting on my new insurance to kick in.

I'm wondering if I should take some time, put myself out there and keep dating, or see this guy again....

So now my friends made an Instagram account with the guys photo and messaged her, apparently she didn’t reply and just straight up blocked it.

I'm a content creator on the topic of emotional intelligence, dating and self-development. I'm doing a bit of research and I would love your input on something. Just a few questions I would love for you to answer.

**What have you done to improve your dating life?**

**What are your big struggles?**

**What would be different if you improved your dating life? What specifically would change in your life?**

**Have you hired someone to help you? Would you?**

Really appreciate your help.

Thanks guys.

The last time we spoke was when they texted me four months after I returned their stuff. They tried to have a conversation which I enthusiastically engaged in, only to be ghosted. Add two more months after that, they reached out again (ignoring the text I sent them before) and acted as if nothing happened. It was my turn to not answer them because I didn’t want to be tugged back and forth. They watched my IG stories until I went on a hiatus.

I can’t lie when I say they’ve been on my mind since then. I’ve dated others and resumed my life, but there’s a small of me that longs for them. 

Fast forward to now, we mutually matched on a dating app. I didn’t have any expectations but they were the first to reach. We started to have a conversation that didn’t want to come across too strongly in. I found myself asking the questions and his replies weren’t giving me much to work with in terms of continuing a conversation. They didn’t ask me any question showing any curiosity for my life. 

I told him that our mutual mentioned him recently and that it made me think of him. I told him how funny it was to bump into each other on the app.

He replied saying that they spoke to my friend because they were planning to move to the East Coast ( I live in the West).

I decided to close the conversation and told them that they would love it there and that I wished them all the best.

On one hand, part of me feels like if they want to talk, they will and pick up the conversation again. On the other hand, if they don’t then I will accept this as closure once and for all.
