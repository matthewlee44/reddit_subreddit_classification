I’m sorry to make a post like this, I know it’ll be hated but I just need somewhere to get these feelings out.

I’m a kiss less hug less virgin and this makes me feel so embarrassed and so very ashamed and envious that I just can’t be a normal guy. Normal college guys are hooking up with different girls and having the time of their lives. I’m some freak who can’t even get a girls number.

I’ve been using Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble for the last 2 years and nothing came from them. I’ve maybe gotten like 10 matches most of which never messaged back or unmatched within seconds of my first message. I feel so ugly all the time. I don’t even go after pretty girls or girls out of my league, I go after girls on my level and still none of them want anything to do with me.

Believe it or not talking to girls in person is so much worse. I’ve been Laughed at, insulted, have messages posted on social media, it’s all just awful and it’s lied to me developing a fear of pretty women so I avoid them in public. Still average abs below average women want nothing to do with me.

I don’t think I’m awful. I’m not grotesquely ugly. I think I’m like a 4 maybe a 5 on a good day. I have a good amount of girl friends who offer to put me on to their friends so I think I have a good personality, they at least think I’d be a good partner.

I’m so embarrassed of being like this. I’m always asked why I don’t have a girlfriend or why I’ve never dated or if I’m gay. Whenever I see my dad his first question is “are you talking to any girls” and then I have to answer no. I constantly have to find some excuse why I’m not trying to date because I don’t want to tell people that women just don’t want me. My mom tries to compliment me, she always does that annoying mom thing like, “I bet you can’t keep the girls away” and it makes me want to cry. It’s so embarrassing and even more demoralizing.

I feel like I’m going to die alone. I don’t want to spend the next 40 years of my life craving someone only for that t never happen.

And wish that someone had given me this advice at a time when I was feeling much more insecure and self-loathing when I should have been a lot more easy on myself and a lot less naively optimistic about dating.

The reality is as a guy, if you are not handsome, tall, socially confident and a healthy weight (and I mean all four), dating is TOUGH. If you're tall and decent-looking, but painfully shy and awkward, it's tough. If you're outgoing and funny, but a bit on the short side or pudgy, it's tough. And if you lack all four, it's even tougher. And don't give me examples of some short or overweight or shy guy who ""kills it"" with the ladies-we're either talking about someone who's famous or rich, dating someone they've known for ages, or a considerable anomaly. Guys make it a lot harder on themselves when they don't accept LEAGUES EXIST. Leagues exist and they are about looks, weight, height, and charisma and nothing else. It is not about how smart you are or how funny you are or how good a person you are. That shit is valuable if you want be a good friend or successful comedian or get into Harvard. But it's not relevant to dating. Hell, it's relevant once you're actually in a relationship or marriage, but to the game of dating we're all subjected, nah. 

What guys do is pretend leagues don't exist, or I don't ""belive in leagues"", or whatever, and then throw a tantrum when they get rejected by every one they make a move on. The same way class and institutional racism exists, that whether you like it nor it's easier for a white person or a man to get a top salaried job than a black person or a woman, your looks and confidence define where you're at in terms of dating and you've gotta be realistic. 

The problem is, men take accepting their league as being somehow a way of saying they're ugly or they're not popular, etc. That if they decide to not hit on every 9 and 10 they see on Tinder they must not be worth dating.

 The reality is: no! You, dude, are 100% a catch for someone, but you're a catch for someone in your league. And I'll hear guys moan, but I have handsome face or I'm tall or I'm funny, etc. But are you tall, handsome, skinny, and confident, and all four? If not, then dude, you're not an 8-10, you're a 5-7. And as a guy, if you're a 5-7, you're not going to realistically do better than that in the girl department. Why should a girl have to put up with something you're not willing to accept in the opposite sex? Too many guys are passing up totally adorable, cute girls who are not the perfect weight or have the perfect face cause of entitlement. 

And what I'll say, as someone who has dated outside of my league in the past, it's overrated as hell. You spend all the time feeling totally uncomfortable cause you're aware of the situation and know that person could be dating someone who's more of a hottie. Normal looking girls are just as sexy and fun in bed and romantic as the super hot girls, and they tend to be a lot more down to earth. Once you accept that leagues are real, you stop taking your lack of success personally and start realizing the game...that yeah, I am a catch, but not by these stupid social measurements. And then you start dating people in your league and suddenly you have people just as interested in you as you are into them. 

Losing weight and going for girls in my league exclusively is the smartest thing I've ever done. I'm not saying dating becomes easy. Being single can be hard enough without having someone to have a loving relationship or sex with. There's no reason to throw insecurity into the mix and take it personally.

Anyways went out with the pilot I met on tinder, he seemed cool and I was already on my way to get something to eat so I asked if he was available. Right off, guy convinced me to change my initial restaurant plans, ok no biggie I just wanted to eat. 
Said pilot uber’d his way there (important for later). Arrived at the restaurant and was informed they were no longer serving food at that time due to Covid restrictions and no where in the city would be anymore.
The very nice waiter was trying to help me find an available place and asks the pilot if we were driving (to get to the restaurant) now my audacious date replies that we are (at which point I just stare at him, because I drove there yea but that did not mean I was driving him anywhere).
So I was noping my ass outta there real fast, but the waiter came back to inform us he was able to convince the kitchen staff to make us some food.

The best advice I’ve learned is that the more detached you are from the person the less chance you have of actually feeling hurt or rejected.

I’m not saying treat your partner/potential partner like dirt.  What I’m simply saying is try your best to keep your emotions in check.  While emotions AREN’T logic, the way we process then CAN be.  For instance, when first getting to know someone, don’t put all your eggs in one basket.  Don’t start idealizing the person or give your all right away.  That way in case of potential rejection, the hurt stings a lot less.

Also, do your best to keep your sense of individuality.  Most people lose that once in a relationship and their partner becomes their world/savior then are crushed if something goes wrong.  Do things alone from time to time, take responsibility for your own happiness and your own emotions.  Don’t make your partner responsible for any of it.  

Is controlling your emotions hard? Yes, however it can be done.  The more detached you become, the less worried or anxious you will feel in the relationship.

We’ve hung out twice. 

She comments on my Instagram stories every time I post. 

She will ask me to hang out without me prompting. We will halfway set it up. It takes me asking two or three times to get her to actually agree to a time and come. 

This last time we had very loose plans. I sent her a Instagram dm the morning of which she didn’t read and wasn’t posting a story that day on Instagram and she  posts everyday. Later that night she says she is so sorry she just saw this and to call or text her. She also expressed how she was home alone and kept hearing noises and almost called me because All her family members that are guys are out of town. 

This is frustrating. I think she has interest but maybe not enough. Or maybe she is just busy as she always is with her family.

   So I’ve been with my girlfriend for years, I’m her first kiss, etc... her first everything besides a LDR between her and this guy she is obsessed with. She hid her displeasure and questioning of our relationship after I became depressed and relapsed on drugs. For a year she hid her that she was falling out of live with me and began texting this guy she was obsessed with and “dated” for two months before me. They never met in person, kissed, or etc. Though he said he loved her and would marry her only to ghost her multiple times and then for years until he messaged her near my relapse. We broke up but remained contact after I’d gotten I to rehab and she said it was the drugs but why’d she leave once I was in rehab, I feel she’d fallen for him and his lies again. But as soon as we broke up, he ghosted her again. I got clean and have been trying to get her back, and our relationship is basically back to normal except she refuses to be called my girlfriend and says she’s not. But we hang out, kiss, have sex, hold hands, go on dates, and she is possessive and jealous. She says there’s no one else and that she loves me with all her heart. She doesn’t call me cute nicknames as much or really much at all, doesn’t mirror me in texts by saying “I love you with everything.” If I say “I love you with all my heart and soul.” Or reply back with “I want to be with you forever” when I say it, but she used to? 

Do you think she never really meant those things when she said them earlier in our relationship and was only Viewing us a a fling and limited relationship, even though we had discussed marriage? Do you think that she is just wanting to maintain our relationship with physical stuff and etc... without the title? Is she just wanting to be able to choose to leave or get with someone else if they come along and by keeping us not official and acknowledging our being together so if she does leave or find someone else she won’t feel like she’s leaving a commitment and won’t feel as bad if we’re not official?? 

Please tell me your opinion! 
She also stopped mentioning me in social media, and deleted out pics on Instagram and etc... months before we broke up. I also feel she won’t tell me her true feelings or thoughts and hides things from me.

Please help!!!

Also! She is still obsessed with this guy, and it’s obvious she thinks him and her are a better match, but he’s lied and abandoned her so much, and they’ve only ever talked over text and phone. She says I’m the perfect guy, but maybe it’s that she thinks we are to different. I partly feel she isn’t necessarily obsessed or in love with that guy, more the idea/fantasy of their possible relationship.

She refused no contact when we broke up because she said she wants me in her life till she dies, that I’m her best friend and couldn’t go on without me without being devastated. She also couldn’t go an hour without kisses and cuddles when we were hanging out for the first time after breaking up. If she hadn’t begged me to stay her friend after the breakup we wouldn’t still be perusing this and I wouldn’t be so worried I’m in the dark or being deceived because I told her no contact is a must after break up and that I feel I can’t be friends with exes...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,821036,public,self,Is she hiding her feelings,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nu0a0n/is_she_hiding_her_feelings/,all_ads,6,,

Where do I start? I'm 27 and have been trying to explore dating and talking to girls for the first time since I've had a chance to. Both physically and mentally. And.. Well, i'm taking some clumbsy and jerry rigged steps but it's taking me closer to.. something. Problem is, and all details aside, I'm still having some of the same communication issues come up over and over gain. And it's been hard to get any better without any feed back.  

So. What's the problem? 

Well, I've talked to perhaps 30+ different women the last 6 or so months, on different medium(dating sites, snapchat, etc) and I've put every single one of them off. Even the 3 I've slept with. But that's a different story. You see, I have this problem with connecting. I don't know what it is, but, I'll put off texting a girl for hours while I roil and toil in my head to my discomfort about what to say. I over think. ALOT. And, I can't stop coming across as just plain wierd/rude/arrogant.(right?) I for some reason have this compulsive habit of wanting to say something interesting to a girl, to write her an alter life story, a novel, or to create some kind of movement, and I fall flat on my face. Especially when I say so much that they barely have time to catch up.

 And, I think I do it on purpose. I think I do it to distance myself from them in some way. Because I am, as if robotically afraid of building an  emotional connection. And.. I'm trying to over come this anxiety by trying to learn some basic principles of conversation that I can rely on when I can no longer think critically or empathetically.  But, and I don't know if this is a new problem or if I'm actually getting somewhere, I'm starting to be more consciously aware of a fear of being some how subverted by a female, of talking to someone who.. is disinterested and is only pretending to be to be nice. I don't know where to draw the line anymore, because of experiencing so much rejection?

 I recently came across as an asshole to a girl I had met at work whos number I got. I think she was interested and was humoring me by venting about something we had talked about. But one morning, I asked her if she was serious or was just trying to continue txting me for some odd reason(why would I even complain?, but maybe I just thought she was doubting me and took a stab first?) and made some comment about her getting up fucking early.  She hasn't texted me since. ...I .. am having an issue coming across as normal. I'm having an issue displaying interest in a woman and asking them about themselves and their life. I keep wanting to come across as interesting and putting in my .0001BTC. And I am afraid of communicating... normally? Boringly? Is that what it is? I mean, I don't think I'm a boring person at all, I've got shit tons of hobbies I'm passionate about,, and I keep alienating myself..   I'm not even trying to date a girl at this point. I'm just trying to be friends. Because, it's just unrefreshingly horrible how bad I'm getting at this. And, I think that's a necessary first step. Probably what I should have been focusing on the whole time.  Also,.. I seem to have this problem over text. The girl who I was an asshole too, we communicated just fine in person. I wasn't anxious at all. But, uh, when I got my fingers to a touch pad, it's as if something possessed me. Virgin Devil hands.  I think overall she's been shocked. And perhaps I have a personality disorder, of some sort. I've been told this before.

Also, I have this issue with.. being myself too much. Like, saying crazy shit and pushing boundaries just to test how a girl will react. Totally regardless of building any long term emotional connection based on shared interests. Perhaps. And.. it's scares me. I do. I think that I am a pretty radical thinker and that it is hard for a lot of people to keep up on that tip in the way that it bubbles and quazi rolls, sweet. And, I mean I like an orgy just as much as the next guy, but, who ever admits that? Anyway. Fuck my life, say it twice, anybody wanna be my wife?

I've got shit to think about. Can anyone relate?

I'll cut out parts I feel are unnecessary, but can elaborate if there are any questions or gaps.

I'm [30M], she's [24F]. We first met online in an MMO game through a mutual friend back in September 2020. A small group of us were in voice chat on Discord and when everyone else went to bed, she and I were alone and just getting to know each other for several hours. I've had a soft spot for her since. 

I asked if she was dating anyone at the time and she said yes - Another guy online for about 6-7 months at this point. I told her it was cool and ended that conversation. She felt that the mood shift and hoped that we could continue to be friends, to which I reassured that I'd love to especially now that we were playing more often together.

She broke up with her (ex)bf a couple months later in November 2020. Long story short, he belittled her feelings when she was sad, lied about where he was (work, sleep, etc) and she'd catch him doing something else, and would pressure her for nudes when she was clearly uncomfortable. Several second chances later, she ended it. She would tell me of these things as they happened, but I didn't know they officially broke up until late January or so. She also mentioned to me just around March or April of this year that she's asexual and that she was terrified that he'd force himself onto her if they met in person.

I did notice her tone change a bit towards me at the end of Christmas onward. We talk or call mainly on Discord and she'd send more ""cute"" emojis and gifs - lots of hugging, cuddling, light kissing, etc. and it made me pretty happy. A warm good morning and good night every day, pet nicknames, speaking a more cutesy way than you would to a friend.

Since then we've been hanging out more outside of just the game we play. We send each other gifts, set aside time for each other to watch movies, play new games or activities, or just call and relax. For the last 2-3 months we've also been falling asleep on the phone together when there's time to do so. It's really comforting. 

It's now been 9 months since we've met and 7 months since she's been single. So my concern is.. I don't know where we're at and I don't know how or what to ask. Finding the right time has been really difficult. This routine we've got going as is so comfortable that I'm worried I'll cause some sort of rift if I say the wrong thing. I am terrified of pushing her away by pressuring her. I feel pretty silly writing this all out, but it's the first time I've ever experienced this. In the end, I do want to ask her to be my girlfriend.

For anyone with concerns - She and I have both experienced and are comfortable with long distance relationships. I am more than willing to travel to go see her, but as of now there are still border restrictions in place into her country. I am also completely fine with her asexuality as I don't have much of a drive.

Can we just accept that SOME women are just a-holes and have a convenient excuse to use so they dont seem like one? Jfc when the genders are reversed, you never see people telling the girl that she is being a creep. 
2. Women are allowed to expect a man to be for their meal even if they just met. But men cannot expect sex. While I think this might be a false equivalence since paying for a meal and letting someone else use your body is not the same, I feel like this social expectation allows some folks to take advantage of others. Nobody should have to pay for the date's meal when they just met for the first time period.
3. If a woman is being passive in texting, people will tell the man that it is because he is not interesting enough and he should put more effort. If a man is being passive, the women is told that it is not her fault and that she should just unmatch.

So I 25F have had this “thing” with 30M. We use to work together so thats how I met him and well in December 2020 we started going on dates. Then conflict occurred. I found out that he may have also been talking to this other girl and well I confronted him via text about soon as I found out. When this was all going down I knew he was at work thats why I decided to ask in a text. Well he usually the type to message me back really fast and he didn’t. I then called him and he said he was busy and would call me later. Later came and nothing. Then I saw he deleted me on snapchat. And well I never heard from him again. I was pretty mad about it mainly for the fact that we had done sexual things on our last date and so to be ghosted now after finding out he may have been with another girl too..I was just mad. Well I went to his house and confronted him and he said I was giving him “red flags” and didn’t want to see me anymore. So that was that. 

A year pasts and well I messaged him I’m sorry for how I acted and to my surprise he messaged me back too. During this time I was getting over a breakup and well messaging him just helped with that. I thought I was over him but now I think I’m not. I told him (this was about 2 months ago) that I did use to want something with him but now I don’t and just want a fwb situation. Well he is not someone to randomly be having sex w someone so all we do is occasionally send nudes to eachother. But lately idk I’ve been wanting to see him and my feelings for him I feel have come back. I just feel like he doesn’t feel the same way...idk it’s all very confusing because I just never would have thought we would have started talking to eachother (as friends) again but we are. We have not seen eachother in person since all that went down over a year ago. And well now I’m just at a lost at what I should do. 

I want to tell him I have feelings for him but also its like after everything that’s happen and now with us being in this fwb not fwb situation I find myself totally lost as what to do.

I apologize in advance for the length. A little bit over a month ago, this guy reached out to me again for the first time in about 8 months. Our last contact before that mostly addressed the confession of my feelings for him. He had turned me down since he currently is in long distance relationship with another man. That conversation occurred over texting as we did not live in the same geographic area at the time. 

We met about 2 years ago online after he had just graduated and was staying with his parents. We immediately hit it off, we had great conversations and spending time with him felt just natural and all. I really think we share a special connection of some sort. Something he must have felt as well because he could never get enough of me and wanted to see all the time. Although we were not sexual often, he held my hand a lot and showed affection often. I would even catch him staring at me smiling here and there. However, we both knew this would eventually come to an end as he was moving to Nashville for work the following month. He tried having me come down for a weekend and offered to loop back to come pick me up because he “could not stop thinking about me”. I had to decline even if I really wanted to. 

Afterwards, we went without contact until Labor day of the same year, which amounted to a couple months. He had come back to his parents for the occasion so he invited me for a drink with his friends. He was pretty flirty throughout and even showed affection in front of his friends. A couple of hours in, we stepped away from the group and were intimate in the car. While I was giving him a ride home, he invited me to come down to Nashville, an offer I said I would be more than interested in. However, it never materialized as he never followed up on it. A lengthier period of no contact ensued. 

The next time I heard from him was a few months into the global pandemic. He asked about me and my family but the texting felt differently. We ended up having lunch during which we spent copious amounts of time staring into each other’s eye. He even play flirted by applying slight pressure to my foot with his under the table. Surprisingly, he mentioned dating someone, which was confusing given the flirting. He ghosted me a few weeks after by disregarding a picnic invite on my end. 

Comes late August, he finally deigns texting me again, urging me to meet for a late 9pm drink at a bar. We got pretty drunk and stayed until the bar closed. We were ready to get into our respective Ubers (no drinking and driving) when he gestured me to get into his. He then proceeded to have a conversation with the driver while holding my hand. We went back to his parents’ place where he set a bonfire. After some small talk and music listening, he started talking about how special I was, going on and on about all the reasons he thought so, which seemed legitimate and thought through. But guess what, he ended up ghosting again after planning to meet for lunch again. That bit was particularly hurtful.

I had had enough. This is when I finally confronted him and rubbed his nose in the situation. He replied I was too late, that he loved hanging out with me but that he was committed to someone else. This is a conversation I would have rather had in person than by text but with him residing out of state at the time, I had no choice in the matter.

I couldn’t help but get excited when he moved back to the area and texted me. I even thought he was single from the way he was texting. He is not though. He announced that he was on a break with his long distance boyfriend and that things were not going well. He texted pretty consistently for a little while and even hinted heavily at me coming over (to his empty house) on a Friday night. I ended up staying the night. In the morning he initiated a sexual act, which I ultimately cut short when he assured me it didn’t mean anything because he had no idea what he was doing. After an awkward brunch with one of his friends, he texted me it was great to see me and carried a small conversation afterwards. He has been ghosting me pretty much ever since.

Context: I am a 42 year old woman, single Mum of 2 kids, divorced 6 years ago.  

I've always had ""success"" online dating. I'm attractive, educated, have a good sense of humour, dress well, generally very happy and optimistic attitude, a little eccentric blah blah... all the ""right"" first impressions, for many people, at least. 

Recently I have been diagnosed with a neurological condition. This impacts my life on some days, others barely at all. I undergo a IV immunoglobulin treatment and will have to do so every month to slow the progression and manage the symptoms. 

Important points: 
I cannot work atm, but am financially secure and independent. 
I do not need any physical aids to function, but I will one day. I'm often in pain, but still fight on nonetheless. 
It is likely I will end up in a wheelchair in 15-20years or so. 
I am hopeful, optimistic, and grateful for my life so far and the possibilities ahead. This has not got me depressed. Just readjusted. 

I am not currently dating because, well, I feel unsure about when/how to reveal this to a prospective partner. I'm also happy and confident alone. 

The options for revealing this increase my own experience of rejection as we progress: 
1. in OLD bio - will clearly eliminate a number of matches, but makes the process quicker (I'm leaning toward this). 
2. in messaging, before the first date - obvious high risk of ghosting. 
3. first date - high risk that they may feel mislead.

I wanted to invite him to smoke (weed) then maybe make a move on him (which took some courage to convince myself I could do because of his age and because I'm a female). But I have no idea if he is interested in me. 
For context we always joke around and have good banter and rapport. I also recently got his number so we text a bit.
But right when I started this job (had this job for about 2 months now), a different coworker tried to make a move on me which ended with a meeting with HR, which I didn't even initiate, my other coworkers did. So I'm unsure how bad of an idea it is to tell him or make a move because of double standards.
I know you usually shouldn't try to date or try to be fwb with your coworkers but people have different opinions on this and I would plan to keep it secret from the other employees. I also think communication is super important so I would talk everything out with him and be mature and discuss consequences.

BTW this was our first date. 

It might have been a friendly thing as a way to say thank you but she had already thanked me and a hug is a bit of a step up from just thanking me. I've paid for girl's food before and I've never been hugged as a way to say thanks.

I (16M) haven't dated anyone because I am too scared to ask out a girl, but it may also be because of commitment issues and fears of if I am not good enough or can't be a good boyfriend. Also I know that I am still young and have a lot to learn, but I just need answers to some questions I have about the whole dating realm.

Anyways I was wondering if I should be think about long term when thinking about asking out girls. Anytime I consider asking out a girl I always think ""Can I see a future with this girl past the dating stage and possible marry her,"" but I have been told by some friends that that is bad and I should do that, so I was wondering if I doing that is actually bad or if it is fine.

Another question I have is, is it normal to feel guilty about sexualizing women, because any time I think about a girl naked I always feel guilty and beat myself up about it.

Another question, can any guy give me some advice about how to get over the fear of rejection and the fear that I may not be a good enough boyfriend, because I have no clue how to get over those fears. I am terrified of women because I have see stories of guys being accused of rape even though they clearly didn't do it but the girls word is just way more powerful than the guys word, so the guy loses and goes to jail. That makes me scared of women so I try and to not touch women or people in general and I try not to offend a women and I try and pick my word very carefully so they don't ever get the wrong idea, and when I say that I don't mean that all I am looking for in women is sex, because that is literally one of, if not, the last priority on my list when looking for a girlfriend.
