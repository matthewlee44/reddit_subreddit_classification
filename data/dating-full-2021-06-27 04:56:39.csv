He will get to experience complete and total joy and surprise.

Men, how much would you appreciate something like this?

Every man has their breaking point. As a 26 year old and perpetually single man with no relationship history, dating is nothing but a fucking anger inducing chore. Who the fuck wants to jump through so many hoops just to reschedule three times before meeting and then getting ghosted? ""Dating is supposed to be fun"" my ass. 

Since dating is a numbers game and if every organic encounter just ends with constant rejection, what do you resort to? Use online dating consistently to increase your odds. Still getting nothing? Try cold approaching random women at a bar or a coffee shop (most of whom you wouldn't be interested in). Still nothing? Try finding a social hobby that involves potential partners. What? Still getting rejected by those potential partners involved in those hobby groups? Try meeting someone through your friends? Oh, and the woman your best bud introduced you to stood you up? Well shit.

You're fucked, and by that I mean natural selection is telling you that you're not qualified and will be alone for the rest of your life.

Ive never posted on reddit before but I’ve been struggling recently and Ive got no one to talk to in my normal life. I by no means think I’m perfect. I know I have my fair share of flaws, issues, and things I need to work on but I’m writing this, so not only I can vent, but so I can have people who don’t know the situation with an outside point of view can give me advice and point out what’s wrong on both sides and what I need to change or if this is even good. I need help. I’m going to do my best to give backstory and then explain all my situations in detail.

BACKSTORY

I (23M) met this girl (19F) online. We quickly hit it off and became good friends but over the coming weeks I definitely found myself catching feelings. After a couple weeks of talking we both expressed to each other that we liked each other and from there on we’ve been sort of serious but we’ve refused to put any labels on it until we meet. Things got more real when about a month ago we planned our time to meet and I booked an airbnb for the first week of august. Plane tickets are paid for and everything is in place for us to meet soon.

About me. It has been awhile since my last relationship. It was a pretty toxic relationship and it definitely changed me and how I proceed into another one. Another big thing for me is my whole life I’ve struggled with trust. I was abused physically and mentally by my step mom, I was cheated on in a past relationship, and my last relationship was so mentally abusive and controlling that I almost gave up.

About her. For her its been about half year since her last relationship where she was also cheated on. This is where the situation with her gets a little tricky. She still lives with her parents and they moved states while she was in her last relationship and she asked her parents to let her boyfriend move states and move in with them. This was accepted and he moved in with her in her parents house. As I said they broke up about 6 months ago but he has still been living there because he didn’t have anywhere to go. I came into the picture and he’s finally leaving in 2 days so I don’t have to deal with that anymore. I’m gonna add in here that her and her ex have been friend since she was 14 and apparently he’s helped her a lot with issues she’s delt with and even though he cheated she forgave him and they are good friends now. Another thing i'll add is as I stated she moved states so she doesn’t have many friends where she is now so that’ll be important later.

SITUATION 1

This one doesn’t really have any meaning behind it anymore but I still want to type it out and reflect so I can see how it was handled.

I obviously didn’t like the fact her ex still lived with her and as we got more serious I started to take more of an issue with it. I never really got jealous like that before but for some reason any time I saw him while me and her were facetiming or heard him while we were taking or watching movies my whole mood would change. I would be instantly mad because I felt like she should only be focusing on me since they weren’t together anymore. I didn’t take into account their friendship or anything like that. They would still hang out as friends and I would get so upset and angry because I was just so jealous and maybe in the back of my head I was scared to trust her. He also didn’t like the fact that she was always talking to me now. He would get mad at her for being on the phone with me at nights and all of that.

I did bring up to her that I didn’t like him and that I hated seeing him and hearing him. I told her that I understood her situation but that I could never get used to it because it was something I’ve never dealt with and that I just wanted him to leave. We had way to many talks about the same shit over and over just because I was always upset with him being there but I didn’t know how to deal with it. I was always bringing it up and I definitely shouldn’t have caused so many issues over it because I don’t know what she could’ve done. I felt like it was always my fault and it definitely was because I was always mad about it. 

I do want to point out some things that she did. One thing that made me really upset was we would be in the middle of a conversation and while we were talking she would mute her mic and start talking to him. I told her that it was super disrespectful to me and that It was really hurtful. When that shit happened it made me feel like I didn’t matter. She would alway be muting her mic to talk to him even when no conversations were being had between us and I would still get mad cause I would tell myself she was hiding something. 

Dealing with him living there was a struggle and as it got closer to him leaving I felt like I was second. I know I didn’t handle any of that well.

SITIUATION 2

She has told me before we got really into talking that she had a lot of guy friends because she wasn’t really a girly girl and didn’t like having too many girl friends. I initially didn’t take issue with this but I realized what was gonna bother me was that she was still friends with her exes and I’ve always thought that exes should be left in the past.

Ive had bad experiences with exes still being involved and it never goes well. It would always make me feel like I’m not enough. I don’t want my person running to their ex to talk about our issues. I just hate having exes there.

We had a talk the other day and I told her that if after we meet and we do decide to date then I think I would want you not to talk to your exes. I told her how it would make me feel and she told me no. she said that was being controlling and that she doesn’t think about her past relationships like that anymore and they are just her friends. I don’t want to be controlling because I know how that felt so I just started apologizing. I felt I was wrong for telling her how I felt about it. She told me I was wrong for using my past relationship to dictate this one and I knew that. I know it goes back to trust but I just have a hard time.

I don’t like the idea of anyone I’m talking to still talking to people they have had a past relationship with. We had an argument the other day and she told me she hit up her one ex to talk to him about why she was sad and that’s what I don’t want. I don’t want our issues being brought up to exes and being talked about because our relationship should be our relationship.

I do understand her point of view. I said earlier that her and her most recent ex have been friend since she was 14 and that he’s helped her so why should she have to cut him off. I understand that it's just I don’t know honestly.

SITUATION 3

This one is gonna be quick. I stated in the backstory that she doesn’t have many friends where she lives now. Well before we met she was using tinder and met this guy on there. They ended up hooking up once but after that she said she didn’t want to be like that and just be friends. Now I didn’t know any of that until yesterday so keep that in mind. I knew about this guy though but what I knew it was just one of her guy friends that she liked to hang out with. We had a talk early on and I told her that it made me uncomfortable with her hanging out with him. I told her I didn’t like the idea of her hanging out with another guy one on one they same way she wouldn’t want me hanging out with a girl and I didn’t want there to be a double standard. She did stop hanging out with him but I know she still talks to him all the time and so that’s what I brought up last night and that’s when I found out about that they hooked up but it was all before me so I couldn’t be mad. My issues come now with I feel super uncomfortable with how much they talk knowing the past now and is that wrong of me? 

I also think back to when I told her about that I didn’t like her hanging out with him and how sad she was when I told her. She told me she only knew him for 2 weeks before we meet so it makes men feel weird knowing the full story.

SITUATION 4

This last situation Is mostly just observation. Me and her have had many talks because I told her I felt alone. I’m always asking her how she’s doing. Checking in on her, showing her I care and that I want to be here because she would ask for reassurance so I made sure to give it to her. I didn’t want her to feel like she was losing me. I was always giving giving giving and never receiving. I need reassurance too.

We had talks and I told her that she needs to show me she’s interested and that she’s involved because I was always questioning if she really cared. She just tells me I tell you I care all the time and I told her there is a difference between telling me you care and showing me. I told her I need action. She would never check up on me or ask how I was doing. She would never compliment me or give me that reassurance. Is it wrong of me to ask for some?

Ive caused a bunch of issues between me and her right now with everything I’ve said up until this point and the other day I asked her. I said can you please give me some reassurance because I need it right now and she told me no because she didn’t know what she wants. How am I supposed to be okay or be confident in what we have if I don’t even know where she stands.

Ive never had to ask someone to ask about me. I never had to ask someone to care. Maybe she does though and maybe I just don’t see it cause I’m looking for more and then that my issue.

I also feel like I can’t talk to her anymore. She always tells me my feelings are valid but it seems like every time I bring up something and how I feel she will continuously point out how what I feel is wrong and then I just feel like I’m the problem. Its frustrating because I always feel like I’m in the wrong with everything.

WRAP UP

It felt good to type this all out but I definitely feel like shit after reading it back because all I can see is just how insecure I am and how much I’m messing up. I feel like everything I say fault. Its just this past month I’ve felt super alone and like I'm worthless. I know I have a lot of problems but any advice is good even if you're criticizing me.

You're at the park jogging and take a break and sit next to a girl on the bench and open with a conversation. 

Not everyone has an extensive friend circle. We graduate high school and college and for the most part move on from these people. The friends that I do have from my coed sports team, well their friends are couples, and one of my best friends in that group is single. 

Another drawback may be living in a suburban American neighborhood. With the lot sizes of today, density is not the way it is in an urban environment. I get in my car to drive everywhere, and in big dense cities, a lot of people use public transportation which is a vector for social interaction. In many ways, those of us who grew up in these environments were robbed of potential social interactions with the opposite sex, which is why I'm intent on leaving the house soon.

Overall though, my point is that it can't be impossible to date or find a partner if nearly all of us were all brought into this earth by two people who liked each other enough to get intimate.

I contacted a guy I briefly dated in my early 20s to catch up with him, back then we were both very slim &amp; although I've maintained my looks &amp; look very young for my age, I've gained some weight since then which I'm currently losing. My ex had beautiful ringlet hair &amp; was slim with a nice looking face but he never was a success with the ladies, to be honest only I paid attention to him, I liked him a lot because he was an alt guy &amp; we shared the same quirky interests.
I now have very long silky natural hair that touches my butt &amp; he is bald, obese &amp; short. He has a pleasant face. To be honest I've never dated a big guy but I'm open to it as I've gained weight myself plus I am more interested in his quirks &amp; personality than his looks.
He opened up to me that he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly after we broke up years ago - he broke up with me &amp; was behaving strange at the time, which now makes sense. I was non judgemental &amp; have been supportive of him since he told me. In fact I've been very open minded towards him &amp; I've even tried to boost his confidence. We've hung out, discussed his problems &amp; he has become attached to me, asking to stay over at my place &amp; visa versa, we haven't slept together &amp; are taking our time.
Last night however we flirted by text, this happens sometimes &amp; he admitted to me that he won't date me because I've gained some weight &amp; he's looking for a 'nice woman'. This really hurt me but I didn't react negatively I respected his decision. However he then said if I lost the weight he would definitely date me, so I replied 'well you didn't want me back then when I was slimmer, so why would you want me if I lost weight now?'
He's gone silent on me.
I am now thinking he is placing too many expectations on me &amp; in a way judging me despite me accepting all of his flaws &amp; issues.
Also I am a 'nice woman' to him, so that seemed a bit mean.
Does that make me entitled to think he should accept my flaw (that I've gained weight since back then) or is he entitled to have so many issues plus he's lost his hair, is short &amp; is obese?

It was my first time being confessed to and I didn't know how to handle it at first. I didn't give an answer right away, but after thinking about it for a few days, I told him I wasn't interested and that I didn't see him in that way. I rejected him as politely as possible (I hate the word rejected, but let's just go with it) and I imagined this to be the end of it since he's usually really nice and understanding.

But it seems like I didn't make myself clear enough. I've tried to treat him normally, like everyone else. But he's just been so weird ever since then. He promised he'd treat me like any other friend, not because I asked him to but because he wanted to. But he's been making things so awkward for me.

He's friends with my brother and he constantly asks about me, trying to get peeks into my private life. If you really want to know, just ask me, but don't be so secretive about it, that's just creepy.
But what bothers me even more is that he's been trying to do me favors, which I always declined since I didn't want to feel like I'm using him. Simply the act of doing favors wouldn't be bad at all, it's just the context that bothers me.
It's because he doesn't try to do this to anybody else.

He's been trying to create opportunities for the two of us to be alone and he only really approaches me when I'm alone as well (which is quite often because I don't have a lot of friends haha). And his way of creating that situation is by offering me to drive me home.
That's how he confessed to me as well. While driving me home in his car.
Ever since then I've been avoiding stepping in his car. It makes me so uncomfortable. I have severe social anxiety and being trapped in a small space with someone who's asking me uncomfortable questions over a longer period of time is just unbearable.
And I know he tried to get something out of this.

When I rejected him he proceeded to list all of the mistakes I had made... And umm.. I never asked? That was so uncalled for.
This really changed the way I see him.

Before he confessed to me, he talked about how a girl in my grade told him that it was weird how he didn't have a girlfriend yet, since he's so nice and whatnot.
Well, turns out he now thinks he deserves to have a girlfriend and that anyone who turns him down is missing out on a nice guy.

Since it's been a year already, I hoped he'd already gotten over it. But yesterday on prom night he approached me again.
I was a bit drunk (I am of legal drinking age in Germany btw) and my friend had run off somewhere else. He had apparently been watching me the entire time because he managed to swoop in right when I was left alone. He tried to make small talk which both of us suck in, but it was really hard to hear due to the loud music. He then asked me if I wanted to go outside, which I said no to. I did want to go outside, just not with him.

A few minutes later he had already left the table and I started to make my way outside to search my friend. While on my way I sensed someone walking up behind me and of course this guy came running after me. I tried to make it obvious that I want to be left alone, but he just walked up next to me.

He was holding his phone in his hand and he had typed out ""are you avoiding me?""... Not this again.. I turned around and picked up my pace, but he still proceeded to follow me outside. Now he asked whether I want to keep in touch after school and I just shook my head.

I was honestly really scared. The guy clearly doesn't respect my boundaries. And while I don't think he's violent or anything like that, it was still a scary situation. Especially since we were drunk and alone in the dark. Luckily my friend found me and grabbed me away. She didn't even know what kind of uncomfortable situation she had saved me from, but oh man was I thankful.

I didn't see him after that and I honestly hope I'll never have to see him again. I hope he finally catches on. It's quite sad how much my perception of him has changed over the past year. I never would have imagined him to be this persistent.
He never took my no for an answer. And maybe I'm partly to blame. I should have been more direct with him. I did give a clear no, but maybe I was too nice about it.

Always aware since decades that consent is something really important, i wonder how you, people of 2021, are checking for the consent of your partner(s) (whatever the gender).

 Reading a lot of « hot » topics about it, it is nowadays a major society subject and world have evolved regarding this.

For me (old school), most of the time, i check by slowly initiating something, with care to see if it’s okay or if not, and respecting of course the not ok behavior. I.e : slowly kissing and caressing down on my way to the intimate parts to give an oral, or slowly sliding my hands along the back while kissing to go on the cheeks. If there is a problem partners usually grab my hand or head gently and it’s way enough as a sign of « no » to be respected.
Sometimes it’s verbal questioning, which is fine for e few, but sometimes feel like ruining the moment especially if there is a lot to ask. So it feels like almost needing to make a paper contract to sign for both before anything happens (pushing to the extreme but sometimes it’s like pished to the extreme if you need to ask every 2 mins « may we do this » during the act)

I just naturally assume I'm unattractive to anyone, which is probably true but how do I know unless I put myself out there.

I even had written my number on a piece of paper with the intention of maybe giving it, but how creepy is that?! Then yesterday came, she was there again so I thought ""I can do this I can do this"" and we ended up talking quite a bit again, but I couldn't do it.

I am a African American [27F] who has only been in one real relationship ever (lasted 4-5 years total). I admit I started the dating game rather late as I first dated this M when I was 21. Since ending this relationship I gave myself a proper amount of time to recenter myself before getting into online dating (a first). I did not know online dating was so hard. Like I make matches but when I start conversations they either not reply or ask for fwb. (Which is a big no from me)

The few times I did try to meet the males they were either quite possessive of making sure I contact them hourly or they ended up being creeps. When I mean creeps, I mean they ask for me to meet them for a quick coffee then try to take me some hotel. I admit I come across as very conservative to these guys because I prefer meeting a few times before jumping into bed. This is just my style and when I try to defend my stance I am told I am being outdated. Some even claim that because of my figure I should be lucky that I even got a chance to match them. I am not crazy overweight. (It is moreso I have a hourglass body with a small muffintop, but prefer to wear lose fitting clothing.) And having heard this I began to wonder if my profile is the problem or I don't know what type of profiles are the real red flags. 

Friends say I have good traits but I often do not know how to read body language of if someone is pursuing me. Like I confuse being flirted with  with normal friendliness. Anyway I am rambling.

I just recently turned 21 and have had no experience in going to bars, parties, or anything of the sort; therefore, I do not know quite what to expect after that fantastic evening. My friends and I ended up staying for approximately four hours, and I was extremely lucky in that the dancer and I spent a lot of time together despite him having to perform on stage regularly throughout the evening. What are the chances of us seeing each other again? What should I expect? Here is some additional information on the dancer and our interactions together:

* I approached him after us having made eye contact throughout one of his dance routines. It seemed as though we clicked immediately. We exchanged contact information shortly after introducing ourselves.
* He is an extremely attractive, muscular person and everyone thinks this about him.
* He offered to buy me drinks, but I do not drink alcohol. He was very respectful of my views and bought me water, instead.
* He introduced me to many of his co-workers and his friends; often referred to me as his ""man"".
* The dancer explicitly expressed that he had not been in a serious relationship in a long time, but that he was interested in being in one again in the near future. I am in the same position, and I also expressed this to him.
* He left after about three hours due to having become quite tired.
* A handful of other men expressed their interest in me, but the dancer was my favorite and I felt I had made this very clear in my interactions. We were together nearly every time an opportunity presented itself.

What are your thoughts? As I had said, this experience was entirely new to me and I am not sure what to make of interactions like this. Aside from the fact that he is one of the most handsome men to have walked the earth, I genuinely enjoyed my time with him and found that he has a great personality. I would enjoy being in his presence again and, if he wanted for us to become romantically involved, I believe I would greatly enjoy that. How likely is it that things could work out this way?

My names Matt! I'm a 31 y/o 6'3'' blonde haired blue eyed dude and have recently moved back to the U.S. from Canada. I'm a larger guy though I can say I know I'm not unattractive at least with facial features and have been told I have a great personality aside from my occasional pessimism and negative outlook on a lot of things... (Just something I've always struggled with due to lots of past childhood trauma.) I've been told I have a great sense of humor and I do enjoy making people laugh and smile.

Though due to my past trauma and such as a child... I've gained weight and now I'm around the 350's area. It's a work in progress but being your own personal motivator is definitely a challenge in itself. I've stuck to the online dating world because, lets face it, it's easier to talk to people over the internet when you don't have to be face to face right away... much easier to open up. But I've come to the hard conclusion that people, men and women, have become just too damned shallow and there are so many fake and unoriginal people out there. It's so hard to find an actual individual who takes the interest in having a conversation and making a sincere effort to get to know you. So many times I've gotten to positions where I start to run out of things to say because the other person just isn't offering any questions or responses to give much depth to a conversation.  


So this comes to my main issue... Why are people suddenly becoming so two faced and shallow? I have been on tons of sites... and I know, I've been told I need to get out more and not use online dating because that's just to be expected but It's not easy to just go out walk up to some random woman and try to start a conversation... not for me at least. I've used so many various sites like Bumble, Tinder, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Badoo, CoffeeMeetsBagel, MeetMe, Hinge, etc... I've used some paid plans even like with eHarmony... and it's always flooded with Bots and you get baited into thinking you have matches so you subscribe to it... only to find out they aren't even real profiles and or they aren't active anymore.   


It's so demoralizing when you try you best to put yourself out there on these apps/sites, change your photos, what you say on all of them, try to look into good conversation starters, try to talk to them about what they are into and less about yourself, try to be funny with random jokes or what not... nothing seems to work.. and all the women I've met in person end up just doing the same thing they do online... they just fall off the face of the Earth and Ghost you... like the type of people that ghost someone are real pieces of shit... you can't be an adult and just tell the person you aren't that interested and maybe give some reasons or something.... can't expect someone to know what's up with the situation if there's nothing to go on. And someone like me who has depression and anxiety and past trauma I end up beating myself up thinking it's because it's my weight, or I said something wrong, or I'm not good enough...   


Why is it that it's okay for women to put shit on their profile... like ""don't talk to me if you're under 6 feet tall, or you're republican, or you support the police, or you aren't a liberal, or you don't support gay rights, if you can't hold a conversation, if you are going to ghost me, If you like Pineapple on Pizza, yada yada."" And these are the same people who do exactly what they say they don't like other people doing. I've been ghosted by women who claim they hate when guys ghost them.... I've run into dead end conversation with women who claim they have so much to say, I've come across close minded people with people who claim they are so open minded.... It's like drowning in an ocean of hypocrisy.   


People really need to get their heads out of their asses and stop being hypocrites... Politics/Social issues need to stay off of a lot of social media and other things... it's really ruining the minds of people... people are so wrapped up about what other people think and feel and recognize that everyone has their own feelings and opinions... stop trying to force people into what you think and feel... we aren't a hivemind... If someone eating pineapple on pizza bugs you that much you may as well lock yourself into a closet and never come out... because that's just petty as hell. Things like Freedom of Speech and being able to express yourself really have been smothered by so many other people views and opinions... hell so many women out there think every guy who is ""nice"" is just trying to get into their pants and doesn't care about who they are.... and that's not true.   


There are authentic guys like myself who actually just treat people with kindness and say thanks just because.... It's called being polite and having a sense of morality.... I've turned down sex with plenty of women I just didn't clique with because that's not what I'm all about... I actually want to find someone to build a relationship with, be best friends with, laugh, cry, share memories and moments, build something with... not just coexist with... Like people really.... Is it that rare to find an authentic human being? Sure I have some baggage... BUT WHO DOESN'T IN THIS FUCKED UP WORLD? I don't condemn a woman for having a kid or so, and having some past drama,... it happens... but when I'm browsing on tons of sites and get matched maybe 1% of the time and rarely get any actual meaning out of it.... it really sucks.

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for around a year and a half and most of it has been long distance because of covid but we live close by so that bothers him that I can’t see him most of the time (eventhough this is because my family’s immunocompromised). But that isn’t even the worst part of it. 


For some reason, my bf is convinced that the world is out to get him and that he is bad luck and everything goes wrong in his life because of that so he obviously also never makes me forget that. We were friends first before we got together and he seemed like a completely different person. He was so calm and collected and just someone you can count on to cheer you up so all of this caught me by surprise and I didn’t know how to react to it. 


He would always argue with me about how his life sucks and would never get better and then when I try and convince him to look at the bright side he argues with me and yells and then sometimes apologises after that. I have been called many names by him including stupid and slow and he’s said multiple times that he hates me during arguments. While we are at the argument point, I feel like we argue about the tiniest things no matter what they are. For example, I was on the phone with my best friends who I barely find the time to talk to and I got carried away with the conversation and I forgot to check up on him in the way that he wants me to (keep in mind I still took the time to check up on him).


I honestly don’t know what to do anymore there’s no convincing him of anything and he just makes all my days miserable because of his awfully negative attitude I truly sympathise with him because he is going through somethings but it really is at the expanse of my well being so I just don’t know what to do.

Mid 20's woman here. But I met a guy on a dating app, went on a drinks date. He's 30. A few things:

1. I'm not really into him physically. He night have been sort of attractive if he had a different personality. 
2. He has a no-go dietary preference (I eat everything and love meat, he's a vegan).

During the entire date he's been pretty pushy in terms of suggesting things to do together in the future. This is only the first date!! He offered to cook food for me, to take me on a road trip to a different city, to take me to several different places around town... I tried to laugh it off but honestly I don't get why someone would do this considering I did not show any enthusiasm I would be down to do those things at all. 

So I have two questions:
1. What is someone like this hoping to gain by literally offering to take a complete stranger on multi day road trips right off the bat? (Comes of as creepy)
2. I need to let him off easy, but I feel like he is gonna given me some bullshit reason to continue to stay friends even if I pull the ""sorry I didn't feel any romantic connection card"". I don't know this guy well at all so hopefully he's not mentally unstable or something. He hasn't even been outwardly romantic (e.g. no romantic compliments or anything) but pretty sleezy about trying to get me to agree to go to all these places with him (a literal stranger).

I stopped OLD for a couple of months this year, shit dating gave me the rest.  First time ever a girl did not come to a date with me (happened twice this year...), got catfished (jesus lord that was horrible), and a couple dates I had were utterly shit or didnt look like on the pictures (looking at you excessive filter girls). Thankfully I have two hands and hot showers exist, so i stopped dating. But im still lonely in my heart and desperatly in need of affection. Especially after the last 1 1/2 years. I moved to a different city, no friends here, rona hanging still around the corner. So basically im alone. Happy life no wife? Just kidding, i knew what to do! I tried to throw myself back into the fray. After a couple of shitmatches with women not replying, I had some decent small convos and Im usually more keen to meet up than talk like ages over the apps. So yesterday I met this overall wonderfull girl. We had, ass far as I can remember a good date with walking and a dring for almost 3 hours. She laughed a lot. Did all those things you read should be the signms, like playing with her curly hair, touching me shortly and stuff, giggling. She gave me her number, agreed on meeting soon again blabla yada yada.  So I would say I was left with a good expression for a future date. I wrote her this day and then i got struck while I was singing Janis Joplin another little piece of my heart when I read the message, oh the irony of life.  ""Hej X didnt felt the spark yesterday, I know myself to good, you wouldnt leave the friendzone. Which doesn't change the fact that we just had a nice time last night, so if you ever need company to go into town or to the movies, if it suits you, feel free to let me know."" I mean its fine, I dont felt it ether but usually I give people and feelings time to develop. But that doesnt change the way I feel today.

My psych is shattered after years of dating. Well then, I am soon to celebrate my 2 year sex-free anniversary( YAY). I have tried plenty of different things, sport courses, apps and shit and I am just heartbroken now. Which I should not, its not like it meant something special or stuff. In the end i came to the conclusion for myself **""I dont want to date anymore""**

So I guess its not my outside. Maybe im just a dick? Do i just want to fucking hate the opposite sex? Do I have a shit personality? Maybe the things I say are unatractive towards women?

Over a while she started saying I was her favorite person and such, while she was dating a coworker that end up bad (she hated him for a while). She even go far to create an IG Fan page yes a Fan page of me and we weren't dating or sex or anything (well to be fair I dont mix business with pleasure). Over the years she always gives me longer hugs and keep saying she loves and misses me. There was times she gave big attitude in general, she has extreme anxiety and every protective of ppl close to her but she learned over the years I dont tolerate certain mess. Recently she hooked me up with credits on a major album with a MJ sample (my name in booklet) where she could of put my name on any track (been such a long time since I worked with that artist and dont remember song) she didnt even have to give me credit to best song but she did. In very recent times since pandemic we gotten a bit closer and told me if she died she glad we cross paths with 3 heart emoji. We work in different studio now but same area so we see each other. I notice shes get touchy when around other ppl and ppl think that we are a couple or a crush but I felt that's how she is with everybody until I started playing more attention. She really goes out her way for me even tho our relationship feels platonic sometimes or if its just her being hesitant and making sure I like her back. What you're thoughts and what would you say is the characteristics of a favorite person?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,863494,public,self,BPD or what?,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o91cy9/bpd_or_what/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,,,
