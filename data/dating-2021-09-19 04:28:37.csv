0,pr4uel,1632044034,First Date! Need help people üòÅ,"Okay so I'm 22 and this woman I'm going to ask out is 25, I have had a girlfriend before in highschool I was 15 but we already knew each other before I started liking her so it was easy to talk with her however I've never been on a actual date with someone I don't know alot about.

Basically I feel like I'm a pritty chill guy and will be okay once im there but at the moment I'm seriously nervous because I've never been on a date before, I don't need a playbook or anything but I just wanted to get some really insightful answers on how dates usually start off? Do you ask questions right away after greeting them really what do you say at the start? And the town I moved to doesn't really have many activities so also what do you's think would be a good idea like coffee?, lunch?, or just go to the park together after getting food? And talk 

I appreciate as much help as I can get I have had ocd for a very long time and it's especially worse when I'm thinking about things before hand 

Thank youüëêüèΩ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pr4uel/first_date_need_help_people/

2,pr54vc,1632045580,"Have you ever stayed friends with someone that rejected to you? If so, was there any positive things you got staying that way? And should I remain friends with someone I got rejected for good reason?","Had a valid rejection from a girl that I really clicked with very well because of her not really ready for a relationship and her other reasoning that she couldn't seem to balance on taking the time for it as she's a very workaholic person. She genuinely does like me and she really did enjoyed the dates we had with each other. Heck, she even got me addicted to a video game she fangirled over me. She's unsure of dating and may possibly get back to it after her school but she isn't firm and couldn't tell if she meant by me or just general dating other guys. She said she still wants to remain friends with me and we can still talk to each other on voice call or even do other things, but Im reluctant on staying friends as my insecurities may rise. At the same time apparently, I was actually the first person to ever hear her personal issues as she vented to me too about personal issues since she never emotionally opened them up to her friends or family. With my insecurities, first one being that she may end up dating someone else which would definitely hurt me and second with getting an unhealthy mindset with getting my hopes up believing that ""oh she will change her mind"" ""she'll want me back"".  I was reaffirmed from a friend of hers that she isn't the type to be dating around or even have time to think about guys as it always about work and school. She's also still relatively new in dating as she only dated one person in H.S but nothing happened between them as it was awkward. I and she was in fact the longest we ever dated each other, even though it was only 4 dates. All of them were so fun, we couldn't stop talking to each other. We even have voice calls to watch anime together.

Planning to wait for 2 weeks or more to decide if I'll be friends or not. As much as it may sound nice that I can be there for her since Im the very first person to hear her personal issues, some of you might say ""its giving her free validation oh thats bad"" but I still personally enjoy her as a person to be around, but at the same time there is the risk of me emotionally torturing myself if I were to ever hear she's dating someone else or bringing my hopes up too much.

I've been trying to date but I never have any luck on any dating site and when ever I feel I've made a connection with someone irl I get hit with the ""I only see you as a friend"" line. It sucks because I'm at the point where I feel like ill be forever alone, on side tangent I really hate when friends or family say ""its ok you'll eventually will find someone"" I understand that Patience is a virtue but it really hurts a guys ego when no one doesn't seem interested in me romantically, I honestly don't even know why I'm posting this maybe I just need someone to talk to, all I want is to have a companion.

7,pr5ha9,1632047307,AITA for not wanting such long FaceTime calls?,"Hello, I (m21) need some help with whether I‚Äôm a douche or not. 

My girlfriend (f23) loves doing FaceTime calls very early in the morning. I work usually from 12/4pm to 11pm-1am. She goes to bed very early in the morning as do I (1-4am). We work at the same job and work very similar shifts so on work days we see each other mostly our entire shift. But lately my gf has been FaceTiming me very late at night when she‚Äôs trying to sleep and they last over an hour.  I Pretty much have to stop whatever I‚Äôm doing and exclusively be on the phone with her the entire time. She says that she needs to see me and hear my voice to fall asleep. That‚Äôs normally fine but being on my phone, and having my mind engaged in something (like a phone call/conversation) makes it very very hard for me to fall asleep after. So I‚Äôm on the FaceTime, waiting for her to fall asleep while I‚Äôm sitting wide awake because the phone screen is keeping me up. I don‚Äôt want to be a dick because I love her and it genuinely seems to help her sleep, but I am busy most of the day as I now have a career internship and now all of my daily free time is sitting on FaceTime waiting for her to all asleep. I have to be up early now due to said internship, and it‚Äôs extremely inconvenient to have an hour of early morning time dedicated exclusively to her sleep schedule. For example today, after my 12 hour Shift I came home to do some internship work and had an hour of free time before bed. I wanted to listen to music and relax with a glass of whiskey (yes I‚Äôm texting her 24/7) but all of a sudden I have to be on a FaceTime call for 90 minutes looking at her sleeping face when I can‚Äôt do anything else. After it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm 30 minutes late to bed, lying in bed wide awake due to the screen and had 0 free time to myself because the FT call took the only time I had. 

I love her so much but it‚Äôs just frustrating because I feel like she demands 100% of my time without any regard for me and my life, but I don‚Äôt have the heart to tell her no because ahe‚Äôs a good girlfriend. AITA for wanting to shorten the FT calls to maybe 20-30 mins?

She has always told me that you cannot trust some girls' intentions even if they know you are in a relationship

Anyway, to get to the point.

My girlfriend studies graphic design and due to an ongoing short course at their college, the students from another class has to join theirs. A guy [M19] came into the class and now sits next to her.

He then left the class for a few moments and came back with an even better sticky note drawing of her and she has kept in her book ever since. 

They follow each other in Instagram, Spotify and I'm sure she has his number too.

21,pr6jur,1632052481,Advice/support for a LTR(?) with some hurtful moments,"(19 and 20) I've been with my boyfriend for just about two months. Location-wise we were pretty close at first but he moved to another city just an hour and a half away for university. I have no problem with LTRs. He is pretty new to relationships and kind of introverted, but I know he loves me because he lets me into his world and tries his best. I know he really does love me, he showed me to his family right at the start and most of his friends and he never hesitates to show me that he loves me. I'm quite close to his family and friends. We talk about big trips in the future and he doesn't seem to be the type of person who gets really interested in the beginning and loses interest as time goes on and he has a level of maturity that assures me of his long term commitment. It has been consistent ever since we started talking.

However my friends have spotted him twice on hookup apps and I had talks with him instead of yelling at him because I want to preserve this relationship. That my friends have spotted him on hookup apps more than once really f*cks me up. It makes me feel like he's starting to no longer find me attractive or that I'm not enough or I don't fulfil his desires anymore. The first time this happened, I checked his entire phone with his permission and our condom stash and found one missing (we counted them last time we had sex). Inside, paranoia, fear and jealousy really tore me the f*ck up, but I knew he was acting on impulse but he still truly loves me because of what he does for me and with me and especially in the presence of his close ones.

The second time was only days ago. I didn't cry when we called, but when the shock faded after it I bawled my heart out instead of sleeping. He only traded pictures but my friends showed me screenshots saying that he was willing to actually do stuff in person. I reacted a lot less harshly but I made it clear that I would vanish from his life if it happened a third time. Ever since, doubt has been eating me up like crazy. Any time he tells me he loves me or plays music for me, I feel like he is doing it to try and wash himself as an apology instead of sincerity. We're going to see eachother again this Thursday because he lives in another city. At this point I don't feel like checking our condom box because I just automatically assume at least one or two are missing. Doubt and paranoia have been tearing me up for weeks now. I cried a lot lately. It hurts me even more because I used to be the same kind of person as him in the past and I know what it feels like and why he did it.

In normal circumstances I would have already vanished. I know two months doesn't seem like a long time. Everything that I have just listed are legitimate grounds for a breakup. I know deep down he truly and sincerely loves me and he knows he has hurt both me and himself by what did. He just doesn't know how to be serious but he has every intention of making it clear to me, his friends and his family that I mean a tremendous deal to him. Being more experienced in relationships than him, I know he doesn't know how to act, but with the right guidance and support he will. I worry that, by committing ourselves to this relationship, I'm kind of trapping him and his desires because he's unfamiliar with commitment.

But I just got on the dating apps, and I've noticed an interesting trend of men being super sexual over text, and then getting offended when I don't reciprocate. I just have a couple questions: (1) Why are these men surprised that women don't like objectifying texts?? Keep in mind, I'm talking about conversations had right after matching on an app. Are there really that many women out there giving enough positive reinforcement to objectifying texts that it's SURPRISING when some women wouldn't want that? (2) I know this is a society thing but it honestly makes me so mad I want to cry: WHY DO MEN THINK THEY CAN SHAME WOMEN FOR NOT WANTING TO HOOK UP/SAVE SEX FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL? Like seriously, that's MY preference, and if that's not YOUR preference, MOVE ON! My personal experience is im recovering from an eating disorder, spent years and years of my life completely disrespecting my body, and having sex with randos was just another way I disrespected myself. So I made the decision to only have sex with people I care about, and it has seriously helped improve my self respect/recovery. It just makes me so mad that some men can't even begin to understand that and all they can see/hear is a blaring alarm in their head screaming ""SHE DOESNT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME"".

23,pr6u9o,1632053750,Would it be weird to re-initiate a text conversation that died over 2 months ago?,"TL;DR: Title pretty much says it: Is it creepy or weird for me to initiate a conversation over two months old that died?

I met a girl a few months ago on Hinge that I was very keen on meeting in person and getting to know. Unfortunately due to issues with my work schedule, her work schedule, then a COVID lockdown, that is still ongoing 10 weeks later, I was never able to actually meet with her. 

The conversations certainly weren‚Äôt dull; there was usually only about 1 message a day but they were substantial. There was around 5 or 6 different subjects and topics in the same message so it seemed to me that she was enjoying the conversation to a degree at the time. 

We had been chatting for upwards of a month and a half at least by this point. I‚Äôm not one to enjoy lengthy text chats endlessly without meeting the person, so I asked if she wanted to have a walk (which was allowed under the guise of ‚Äúexercise‚Äù under our lockdown restrictions). She said that she would love to and checked how far we were from each other, but unfortunately we have a limited radius that we can travel at the moment and ours didn‚Äôt overlap anywhere. I said that I didn‚Äôt mind going an extra few kilometres outside of my radius (it was a very small gap), but she said that she wasn‚Äôt comfortable breaching the health restrictions and responded with ‚Äòperhaps when things ease a bit‚Äô. I said that this was absolutely fair and didn‚Äôt push it any further. 

After this chat, though, she didn‚Äôt respond to any of the parts of my last message. I completely understand why she wouldn‚Äôt (I can sympathise: it‚Äôs tiring for me to maintain conversations endlessly with hinge/tinder matches that I have no idea when we will be able to meet), so I am not cut or upset about that. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt get hung up on dating app matches like this, but of all the ones I‚Äôve had, she was someone who wanted to meet and get to know and see if there was any connection the most. 

My question is: now that there is a light at the end of the tunnel with our lockdown, would it be weird for me to re-initiate the text conversation with something simple and asking how she‚Äôs been? I‚Äôve deleted hinge etc recently out of dating app fatigue, and I‚Äôve toyed with the idea of finding her on there again (if she even still is) and rematching, but this idea seems very childish to me. 

I‚Äôd just like some external input to know if right now my desire to have an actual date with her is clouding my brain and I just need to straight up let it go. I don‚Äôt want to be a creepy or needy person.

I have to admit I am very lost in the dating world and I am having a hard time figuring out where I belong in the dating pool.

I don‚Äôt have children yet. I am very open to the idea but I also made peace whit the fact it could never happen. All my friends have kids; most of them are on their second family. From what I see it really easy for them to get into relationship because the kid check box is completed. It hard for me to talk about dating whit them because our lives is some much different. 

I really like children‚Äôs and everyone agree I am good whit them. So having children in my life is no problem. But I do have a hard time convincing myself to date woman would already have one or some. The main reason is because I am telling myself that it hard to build a strong base for a relationship if children are involved from the beginning. Obviously, the woman would always prioritize her children‚Äôs and I wouldn‚Äôt accept any less from her. That why I think a relationship should start whit two peoples developing a strong bond between them, before moving on to expand the family. I am aware that most women my age already have children or are having the urge to have them soon, which I understand completely.  

If I am to have children‚Äôs, I would like to share this moment whit someone who hasn‚Äôt had any yet. To go against the unknown whit some at the same place has me. Also, and I know it really bias, I can‚Äôt get around the idea of being the second man to have children whit a woman. I am telling myself that if I met the perfect person and she has children, I would not care.

I thinking the solution would be to date someone younger who her family goals are farther down in life. But I don‚Äôt want to come out as a creep who want younger woman. That why I haven‚Äôt dated in a while.

I am not really sure where I am going whit this thread. I was curious what others were thinking. Am I crazy or selfish to think like that or am I not alone? I know I am an over thinker (I am a very analytic person) and it usually a good trait, except when it comes to relationship. I‚Äôd like to share taught whit peoples about this; any of you without children are whit people who has one or more? How is it going? For the women, what do you think about a man who thinks like me?

I don‚Äôt have children yet. I am very open to the idea but I also made peace whit the fact it could never happen. All my friends have kids; most of them are on their second family.

31,pr7iz1,1632056556,Texting to an another guy while dating with me,"I \[26M\], she \[22F\]. It's not a long journey we have met a month ago and we were started dating yesterday. Everything is super good with her, she is super clever, pretty, we are having a lots of fun when we are together, almost perfect to each other.  
So when i started texting to her, at the same time this guy was doing the same thing to her. Before we were started dating she did explain this whole situation with this guy, she was very honest. She told me, they are texting almost every day, but she is very passive, bc that's how she is wanna showing to him that she doesn't want anything from him. But this guy is pretty persistent. He is just keep texting to her.   
A week ago she told me, that this guy is still texting to her. I told her, if she wants to be with me, why don't just focusing to me, and block this guy from messenger, the answer was: "" I don't want to seem like a jerk."" I was like okay ... She was saying if i wanna read the messages between them she will let me, bc they are not talking about serious things.  
Few days ago this guy was met with my GF (not a date or something else, he was just waited her at a bus station), while she was going to home from work and brought her a bouquet of flowers (...) and she accepted from him, bc she couldn't handle this situation. She told me this whole thing when we were out to date. U can imagine my feelings ...   
Honestly don't rly know what to feel rn. She is really into me, super honest, because she told me everything about her situation with this guy. She could have chosen that to not to tell me this thing and just simply keep her secret, but she told me.  
We weren't a couple till yesterday, thats why i didn't say to her to ban this guy from messenger. But i think in a normal situation a person doesn't need to say things like that... If u want that person, focus on him/her not to others ...  
I have a feeling that she is keeping this guy as a ""B"" plan or she is just ejnoying this situation where 2 ppl are ""fighting"" for her hands. Or idk... it's so fustrating, we are a couple since one day and we already have this problem. I explained to her that this thing is really annoys me and she would not be happy if i were doing Tinder next to her while we are together ... I really don't wanna leave her, bc we  really like each other, but my patience is already running out bc of this situation.

Now we have started to develop feelings and she is open for a relationship, the problem is with myself, for some whatever reasons I am not decided yet in entering a relationship with her. 

The problem is that I can't make her wait for me to decided if I wanna do it or not. I've also took her out to meet a couple which are friends of mine, they both fell in love with her and the girl (which knows me very well) told me I'd be a fool to miss out on this opportunity because the she is smart and very understanding and it's clear we have chemistry together.

I called there bluff and blocked and reported and I don't see any evidence that they followed through but I'm still reeling with anxiety and just completely lost my appetite and don't know what to do.

40,pr7zhm,1632058296,(30M) Not really sure how to get into the world of dating/relationships after a lifetime of being indifferent to it,"tl;dr ... 30y/o man, never had sex, never had a real relationship, never looked for one, and never felt bad about it until the last year or so. I want to start trying to have something emotionally and sexually meaningful, but I'm afraid it's too late to start with zero history.

Why was I never interested in the past? I don't have a specific reason but it was just general low confidence + introversion. I also was always pretty busy with college, grad school, finding a job etc, and didn't feel like I had the energy to give up my ""recharge days"" to potentially emotionally draining difficult social situations. I started my first post-grad school job last year and its been the first time I've felt that I'm in a stable enough situation to deal with trying to get something more out of life...  I think I have become a fair bit less introverted and I want to take that risk now. In the past I was happy enough to get meet my fairly low social quota from just hanging out with my guy friends, and if I needed something physical, I could just jerk off or use a toy and get it out of my system. It also didn't help that I was obese until 28/29. I'm borderline normal weight now; still a little chubby but so are most people, and I'm still working on it. I hate gyms but I take a lot of long walks/short jogs and I love to go hiking, so I do exersize in some form. I also eat fairly healthy (now) and am a pretty good cook. I'm a fairly geeky dude with geeky interests and work in a STEM field, and I get along well with other nerds/geeks of all genders. Besides the weight, I'm okay looking, a bit over 6 feet, hairline at 30 not as good as at 20 but not awful... I'm not that interested in a meaningless hookup (not opposed, though...) but what I really want is something a bit more of a bonding experience, I want to truly understand, support, and accept a woman, and relieve the same in return. I never felt like I needed that in my life, I felt like those things were ""nice to haves"" instead of psychological human needs, but I think all that loneliness I shoved in the back of my mind is starting to overflow out of its container. 

I'm really hoping to meet someone more naturally rather than via a dating-aimed thing like an app or meetup. But I don't really know how to do that. There are a few single women at work around my age who I would be happy if they were interested in me, but I don't think they are, and I don't want to risk screwing up a valuable working relationship with an unwelcome advance. I started my job about 9 months ago and moved about 5 hours away... I lived in one region for my whole life until age 29, so I don't know anybody here apart from work. COVID hasn't made meeting people outside of work easy and I wasn't good at that in the first place. A lot of people at my workplace are in a similar situation, so we occasionally do simple meetups (like a rotation subsection of the ~50 of us, with a fairly even gender mix, will go to a bar or get dinner on a weekend or something, usually about 8-10 people at a time, maybe one or two times per month) and I'd love if something came out of that, but maybe that's just a fantasy. How do early-30s people who aren't beautiful meet singles? Do I just... go to a bar and ask women out? Ask out women I see walking around my neighborhood? That seems like something a creep would do.

Of course I also have no sexual experience but honestly I think the no RELATIONSHIP experience is probably a bigger red flag. Not really sure how to end this post, so I'll just stop typing.

Now 2 days ago, we texted again and I asked if we could reschedule to next weekend because I'm really overwhelmed at the moment with work (10 extra hours to make up), finishing college on the weekends, and a recent move (still haven't unboxed). 

I haven't had time to do laundry in a month and never have cooked food in the house. I would really like the weekend to myself to get my housework done, work-work done, AND school-work done.

Would it be bad (i.e lose my chances) if I just reschedule this date? I do REALLY like him and think we are a great match so I don't want to screw that up.

She‚Äôs gorgeous, hilarious, adventurous, and my kind of weird. I remember the day I asked her out years ago and unfortunately wasn‚Äôt interested, but still remained very close. We didn‚Äôt see each other often for the next few years due to going away for college however the pandemic brought us a bit closer when we needed some company during lockdown. Let me tell you, these last 2 years have been amazing. I was completely aware we were just friends and I wanted to respect her feelings. That being said we still were able to look past that and share some beautiful memories. We spent a lot of time doing long road trips, traveling together, learning to cook, and so many other fun activities. This past month things have felt different and I realized that I had some strong feelings I couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore and honestly it was starting to dig at me. When I look into her eyes I not only see a pretty face but someone whose chemistry is unmatched, shares all my favorite activities, and just really makes me happy. We were slow dancing on the beach last week (with a few drinks) and eventually kissed. I figured it was just the drinks in us and a spur of the moment thing, but figured it was something we should talk about if we were just friends. I also decided it was a good opportunity to be open about my feelings because honesty is the only way we can move forward from that. This week has made me very anxious because I was worried my feelings might ruin this beautiful friendship we have. Well, we had the conversation a few nights ago and I learned that she also had feelings for me over the past year. Neither of us wanted to act on it or even talk about it due to fear of making things awkward, but damnnn it felt nice to hear that feelings were reciprocated. We decided that we will give dating a try and I‚Äôve been so giddy since. She came over after the conversation and we just cuddled all night. I still feel those dang butterflies. Tonight we are going on our first formal date and I am so thrilled. I know it‚Äôs early to say this, but I really do see a future with this girl. We‚Äôve been spending so much time with each other over the past few years and share such a deep connection. She really makes me feel so special and I‚Äôm still expecting to wake up from this dream.

46,pr8n50,1632060617,Am I being too harsh?,"I (30f) met this guy (30m) at a work event. He asked me out, and I got to know him for a few hours over a drink at my work before giving it to him. 

Over the next few days we hit it off, talking for hours on the phone a few days. Well there is a few day stretch I don't hear from him and I figure maybe he's just busy.. I still show up for our planned date and he doesn't. I sent a text that was firm but understanding basically saying communication would be appreciated, but wishing him well (his mom is currently going thru cancer). 

He sent a long text sincerely apologizing, explaining how it was a rough few days with his family and mom, that he enjoyed getting to know me,  and he never blows people off and feels terrible. I  was understanding and empathetic, but maintained my stance that communication would have been appreciated at it takes 5 seconds to send a text that you won't make a date so my time wasn't wasted. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I reach out to see how he's doing. We talk about the possibility of getting together &amp; says he's busy but is open the following weekend and ""owes me one."" I text him a few days before the weekend he's supposedly free, and once again don't hear back at all. I gave it a few days. 

Last night I sent a final just saying that I didn't really understand him, that I totally get where he's at in life and wasn't trying to push anything but just to be honest with people if you aren't going to follow through. I get a phone call at 3 am then, but I didn't answer. He then texts explaining about how he's been a wreck with his mom &amp; he's depressed. He still really likes me, never met anyone like me and he's just really guarded. I was pissed he called me in the middle of the night and woke me up out of a dead sleep, and I called him out if he was drunk-he denied. We went back and forth and he just kept apologizing but all I kept saying is to communicate, and be consistent. That's all I ask for...cause I get he's in a rough place. He admitted maybe he's not mature and fit enough for me,"" and ended it with ""if you want to talk let me know."" 

I don't know if I'm being unreasonable here expecting communication? Should I give the benefit on the doubt? He has a lot on his plate, but it takes a few moments to send a text. I also see him posting on social media- like a golf trip one weekend so it's like you have time for that and can't send a text.

He showed it to me and said ‚Äúwould you like me throw it out?‚Äù And I told him it was up to him. He jokingly said ‚Äúwhen you get here you can analyze it and DNA test it of you want‚Äù. 

I think I might actually take him up on that offer, idk I just wanna know where the stain came from. I guess the fact that he‚Äôs not trying to get rid of it is a good sign. What do you guys think?

Naturally, as I've grown older, those same mentalities have stuck around. While I'm doing okay for myself, not great, I still feel the need to penny pinch or work additional hours if I can.

That being said, I'm not dating or looking for a relationship. But say I was. Is a man who's frugal to the core, something that is frowned upon? Is that celebrated in this day and age?

If I prefer a home cooked meal, where I cooked, is that being cheap or not living life to the fullest, because I dislike paying $280 during a date? Would I be turning off partners?

52,pr8zhb,1632061786,Idk what to do and im shy af,"Hello Guys,

im 18 and very Shy and have big problems talking to new pp.

2 Weeks ago one of my Friends sent me a Girls Instagram Profile he met at a Party and he wanted me to slide in her Dms.

I never did this in my Life and also i am not a Party guy.

But i still desided to go out of my comfort zone and write her and so i did.

And it went well we talked for some days a bit and she also gave me her number.

This is were it begins.

I am a terrible writer and cant keep up long conversations or even start one. I send her Memes and orher Videos and so and she seems to like it at all but i never get into conversations that last longer than 30mins. She also writes me Bbtw so it isnt completly one sided.   
And we also met yesterday at a Party (it was planed) and at first i was extremly scared and couldnt talk to her but after some time and drinks we started to talk but i was still extremly shy and couldnt be myself? I talked to but i never talked to her like i talk to my friends because ye im shy.   
She also asked me question like can you Look after me (she was a bit drunk) and if i can be her safe spot.

Over all it was a good Night and Party but it couldve been better cuz i still didnt was 100% myself.

For one i dont want to be this shy anymore. I always think ahead when i write her and never do it spontaneously yk. I always need a plan like i wirte Hey, then i ask this question, if she answers this i write this. Thats what i think if i try to write her. I think i do this because im scared that the conversation end what if does but im scared of it thats why i plan it ye cuz im scared and i think i can control it with making a plan but i cant.  
Also im scared that if i cant get into conversation she will lose interest in me and i rly like her shes Cute, very Nice and Funny but im extremly scared that i fuck it up somehow with me being to shy.   


She also didnt wrote me in days (i wrote her) but i think its because i wrote her so she didnt had to.

53,pr924o,1632062028,Quite possibly mentally scarred. In desperate need of advice.,"So, i'm a pretty shy guy and i always thought i'd never find someone who has a romantic interest in me. My first -and last- time dating someone was 3 years ago but given my age at that time, i was so inexperienced and didn't know what i was supposed to do regarding sex etc. Last night, one of my friends invited me to a party that his frieends were organizing. 2 hours pass and i see a gorgeous girl walking through the door. We get to know each other for a bit and as time goes by she gets absolutely plastered and vomits in the toilet. Being the shy guy that i am, i found myself lost between people dancing and enjoying themselves so i went out for a cig. At one time she gets out to smoke too. We basically started flirting (alcohol helped me massively on this, ngl) and the next thing i know she is on my lap, thrusting and grinding. We make out, but i must have been drunk too cause i think i had the whiskey dick. I feel she had a good time beause at one point her breath got really heavy and her legs started shaking. However, i still freaked out and went through a loop of me not being good enough and i spent the next hours sitting emotionless on a couch. Before me and my friend left the party, she was in a room with 3 other people 2 of them being girls. I once again freaked out and thought i let her down and that she was having fun in there so i stormed off and i waited for my friend on the front gate. She gave me her ig and that's the only thing i have right now. I'm pretty sure she was hinting that this was going to be more than an one night thing, because she said something along the lines of : ""now that i'm in your life it's all going to change"". What do i do? Do i try and contact her? What do i say?

I've been on 5+ dates with this girl, we slept together and we keep in touch daily (texting and stuff).

Things are really looking well, we just have a really good time and all. I already met her parents and she met mine (both when driving each other home from dates, no real formal introduction).

Lately, we've said that we both want to pursue a relationship but still need to get to know each other a bit better, so we want to meet up more frequently. It's like a 2 hour drive to her dads place (where she is occasionally), so some of the dates costs me and her a lot of driving time.

At the same time, we both do not want to rush into stuff, so taking it slow as well (the hell does taking it slow but wanting to see each other more means?).

Though, I do not want to invest a buttload of time (which seeing each other more often would mean) in a relationship, while she might still have flings on the side now. And I have a feeling she might have those.  
Yesterday, she randomly started telling me about a colleague she thinks is a funny dude with real cool body features and that she and him want to go running together sometime (both are avid runners).   
I also occasionally catch her texting during some of our dates.   
She's pretty young (23), really attractive for most dudes (I've heard multiple groups of dudes talk about it without them knowing I'm dating her) and she did not have that much time in her life yet to 'screw around a bit' (to call it that way), as she pretty recently got out of a long relationship with her high school sweetheart.

57,pr9gds,1632063387,what are some Problems women and men alike face in dating world TODAY?,"# 

I find that for many men TODAY are getting much fewer options than decades past. Many are lonely and are desperate. Many are reaching their 30s, where they dream of becoming a father and building a family , but instead living unattached , sexless lives where their only real interaction is behind a screen.

Whereas For majority women, they are getting more options than ever before. If they don't like someone out of boredom, or there are problems within the relationship, or they see a new shiny person there is no incentive to remain in a relationship. They do, however, have to deal with many unsolicited attention and many bad crops to get the ones they want. Their standards are obscenely unrealistic. Many love the idea of the marriage but don't actually want the marriage, or the man for that matter. Many want everything ( her career, the best man, the family , the whole 9 yards), otherwise she is settling.

I spent a little under 3 months talking to this girl I liked. She was blonde, blue eyes, slight chubby, freckles, and was the emo type. We would stay up till 2am talking about our favorites shows, movies, what we wanted to do with our lives, our families, we also began to start using faces like :3 and other emojis. It got to the point where she wouldn‚Äôt go a day without talking and one day she decided to finally set up an actual date. So when the date happens she also brings up the fact that one of my friends is also coming and i thought it would be like a third wheel type of thing so I didn‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable.
 
 I ended up being the third wheel.

The whole time they were just talking on and on and we‚Äôre connecting extremely well, and they had just met that same day. They would laugh and tease each other, he gave her a piggy back ride and I was just off to the side very silent. After weeks of priming the situation to be right she ends up just being all fun and happy with him &amp; with me she would talk serious and posture up and look at me with an expressionless face. Like she was not attracted to me AT ALL.

63,pr9qyf,1632064318,Adoption then dating.,"I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll adopt two kids soon, a boy and a girl, then after a few years of that has settled in, I‚Äôll start dating, to have another biological kid. I live close to the biggest middle school in the state. Good neighborhood. My kids will wear masks and know science facts aren‚Äôt optional. I have a secure science job. Only this time when the dating relationship ends, I keep the kids. Everyone should have prenups, background checks, credit reports shared, and eloping should be illegal, so the kids stay with the more stable parent at the time of divorce.

Kids are available for adoption in my state, and nationwide at a skyrocketing pace nowadays because adults, more and more are raised badly, then get into addiction, unprotected sex with the first available person, then become parents themselves. Which statistically leads to a few more adoptions every year. As a scientist I‚Äôm a huge fan of statistics.

I love and miss my 13yr. daughter 10 to 100 times more than I ever missed her other parent, so I live knowing the love parents have for their kids dwarfs anything spouses share. 

The dating scene in my state is a quagmire of meth addiction, distilleries, micro breweries, weed huts and republican zealots stealing state school money for religious school vouchers, which pops up faster than new house construction. The only real thing that matters is that children have a consistent place to come home, warm healthy meals, a safe quiet bed to wake up rested from and a parent who always does their best. The last nine years have been glorious because I don‚Äôt allow drugs or alcohol on my property, especially in peoples bodies. 

I am well aware of the friction adopted kids have with parents vs. biological kids. This however seems 1000 times easier to work on than dating an intentionally misleading adult. There are a lot of right wing religious people I could date locally (and have) and this vaccine hesitancy thing has finally shown me how scary that is. I now possess a much quicker question to figure out somebody‚Äôs science and political views.

67,pra5eo,1632065626,Was talking to this guy and he fully gaslit me into thinking I was crazy,"So we had been talking for a year. Met him all the way back in college so I‚Äôve almost known him a decade. What I can put together now is that I fully took it more seriously than he did. The kicker is he chased me for years and I wasn‚Äôt into it. Not because I didn‚Äôt like him but because he only ever wanted to talk about sexual things and I found it to be very immature. Our last interaction was me sending these huge long paragraphs to him trying to explain how I felt cause the entire year of us talking had been nothing but bullshit from him. But he‚Äôs so delusional I think he fully did not realize how in the wrong he had been the entire time. 

I just need confirmation and validation that I wasn‚Äôt the psycho one here. Here are some of the things he did while we were talking: 

When I first reached out to him, he completely ignored my texts but posted on ig that day. Turns out he was taking to someone. But a month later when things didn‚Äôt work out with her he hits me up saying ‚Äúsorry didn‚Äôt mean to ignore you, I just suck with my phone now‚Äù. 

He saved a handful of my nudes to his Snapchat then matched two friends of mine on hinge/tinder within the next two weeks. He added them on ig right away too (granted it could be possible that he didn‚Äôt know they were friends of mine). But he went on a full dating app binge right after saving the photos, matching and adding a ton of girls, but had told me I could send more photos any time I wanted. The next time I hear from him, I ignore him. He asks why and I explain that I was upset. He defends himself immediately, gets clearly angry, and doesn‚Äôt apologize. Two weeks go by then he sends me a Snapchat and a text right after saying ‚Äúsorry that was NOT meant for you‚Äù. Basically he tried to make it seem like he had sent me something risky meant to be sent to another girl, as a joke. So again no apology from him, but I get mocked instead. And again, when I didn‚Äôt answer was when he threw in a half assed apology.  

He had hooked up with a friend of mine in college and was still liking all her posts the entire time we were talking. Even tho her and I had posted stories together recently, clearly showing her and I were close enough to be hanging out. 

He invited me to go to a hockey game and said he‚Äôd get back to me in one to two weeks about it. Three weeks had passed and I heard nothing from him. Meanwhile I‚Äôm noticing that he‚Äôs still active on dating apps and adding a new girl on ig every other day. I confront him about not getting back to me like he said he would. He tells me he had lymes disease and hadn‚Äôt played hockey in three weeks. Meanwhile he had posted himself playing hockey two days prior, and when I looked at his hockey schedule he had scored goals in games the week prior as well. It was true that he had lymes, but he had been back to playing at that point. He even sends his doctors note as ‚Äúproof‚Äù which also had him out for two weeks not three. He gets furious with me and then unfollows me on social media. We forget to take one another off Snapchat. And a week later I get a snap from him like nothings wrong.

He invites me again to another game, then of course when it comes down to the day it‚Äôs supposed to happen I hear nothing from him. I text him and ask if he still wants me to come and he replies with ‚ÄúYou can if you want to,‚Äù followed by three other reasons as to why he needed to postpone it, which were full on lies. Let me just add that I was going to take off work early, drive an hour and sit through this hockey game that he was playing in, just to accommodate his schedule because he kept telling me he was too busy and exhausted to hang out with me anywhere else. 

By then I remove him off socials and am done with it. He says nothing for seven weeks then reaches back out to me because his parents aren‚Äôt home (yes he‚Äôs a 27 year old man who lives at home). Then when I don‚Äôt answer, he throws in an apology for cancelling the game again, but with no explanation as to why he did. Basically I tell him we can just be friends but that I‚Äôm not interested anymore otherwise. He tells me that he‚Äôs too attracted to me to just want to be friends. I kind of leave it at that, but we still would have small interactions over social media here and there which I tried to cut short because I was just so over the bullshit. At the same time tho it was hard not to flirt with him because I was so attracted to him. 

Earlier this week he reached back out and asked why I was so mad at him all the time. I asked if we could meet up so that I could talk to him in person, or over a phone call but he pressed me to explain it over text. Of course I couldn‚Äôt get all my thoughts together and I made myself sound like a dumb ass bringing up insignificant stuff, and just made myself look like an idiot. He again pretended to want to make plans with me, and then of course found a way to cancel. The fact he had cancelled yet again made me feel so incredibly insecure and like I wasn‚Äôt good enough for him. I don‚Äôt get why he would be the one to reach out if he was just going to cancel yet again. I had tried to be done with it so many times and each time he would be the one to come back. And what sucks the most is that I know for a fact he was able to follow through with plans with the girl he was talking to when I had first reached out, so it just consistently made me feel like there was something wrong with me. With me, he only ever wanted to hang out to hook up which was why we would always fight and why he would always cancel. So I sent him these huge long paragraphs explaining things and also trying apologize. He went hours and didn‚Äôt read it because he was busy. Then he finally replied with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt answer that right now‚Äù. 

So these are just the bigger things. Typing this out it sounds crazy that I even stuck it out so long. But he had a way with words that was believable I guess? I just really liked him and wanted to believe he was the genuine guy I had met in college. 

He‚Äôd complain that all I wanted to do was yell at him all the time and now I can‚Äôt tell if he kept bailing and acting like a dick to me because he lost interest in me cause all I did was call him out on his shit? I just need someone to tell me I‚Äôm not the mean one here cause he kept telling me that I was. He kept saying that I couldn‚Äôt let go of shit after he had apologized for it, and that I save all my anger for him.

However, I‚Äôm now working more or less full-time. I‚Äôve met a really cute, attractive guy who I really click with, who also works full-time. 

How the hell do adults actually date?? I wanted to see him ASAP because our first date went so so well, but it‚Äôs looking like we won‚Äôt even be free to see each other for another four weeks.

It seems borderline impossible. 

I feel like he‚Äôs going to lose interest in me because it‚Äôs such early days, and adult life is so hectic that I feel like a date every four weeks is way too little to properly get to know somebody, and texting doesn‚Äôt really cut it most of the time.

I think I'm ready to fire up the dating apps but I really don't want to see my ex on any (it'll just make me sad). As we still leave close to each other and we're close in age - it's super likely we'll see each other if we're on the same app. Is there any way to block certain people off apps? 
If I go on at work, which is further away, could I avoid seeing him?
Will the app track my data and match me with people close to my home?

We went to different colleges and would talk every now and then. We hooked up twice but never had sex. After not seeing each other for five years, he reached out to me and we would text for a few months. He would text me good morning every morning and ask me how my day was and even tried to FaceTime me. I wasn‚Äôt sure what his intentions were considering we hooked up years ago, but I always liked him a little bit. 

We finally met last year. He was living in a different state at the time and came back to my state to see his friend. I didn‚Äôt think it was a date, but we got dinner and drinks and we kissed towards the end. The date was great I would say. He held the door for me and paid. We then went on another date before he left to go back home. We went for a walk outside and danced and opened up. 

He then tells me that he is moving to a state even further away for a job opportunity. I initially thought there is no way this is going to workout and that he would probably meet someone there. He would continue to invite me to see him A LOT. I would reject because I was scared of Covid. He said told me that he understood; that he would treat me well and make me feel comfortable during the pandemic. But I rejected every time because I was very scared of it. I really wanted to see him. We would FaceTime every now and then and he told me that he hasn‚Äôt found the one but has liked me for a long time. I told him I felt the same. He then has a family member that passes away and comes back to my state. He invited me to the service and wanted me to meet his friends and family. Again, I said no because I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going to a gathering. I felt awful. He even invited me to thanksgiving with his family. 

We then went out separate ways. He stopped talking to me (don‚Äôt blame him) and met a girl. They broke up a couple months ago, and he reached out to me two weeks ago. We have been texting a little and snapping. But the only thing is that he is making it sexual sometimes, sent me a d pic, asked me for a nude. I didn‚Äôt.

77,prch5z,1632072865,Am I giving him too much credit?,"
So I‚Äôm a 22 year old girl and I‚Äôve been back in the dating scene for the past few months. For some background The guy I‚Äôm currently talking to I really like. He‚Äôs 23 and We had an instant connection we both opened up to each other about family, life, trauma, and school very quickly. We have been talking since July but things with him get hot and cold, he is very inconsistent. Some weeks we‚Äôll talk non stop and he‚Äôll show me off to his friends and other weeks I‚Äôll maybe hear from him twice at best. We‚Äôre both in college and we live 2 hours away and have busy schedules so I don‚Äôt see him often which I‚Äôm fine with. He had called me to make plans and told me we would go out to a nice restaurant. In the days leading up to our date he had expressed how he‚Äôs been feeling depressed and has been having money issues bc he hasn‚Äôt been able to get this job on campus bc of paperwork issues. I gave him words of encouragement and tried to keep his spirt up and he told me that he really appreciated me and couldn‚Äôt wait to see me. The night before our date it seemed like he was trying to get me to cancel so I suggested that we go to the nice restaurant another time and we can just go to the beach or something and that seemed to solve that. When we met up he went into more detail about why he‚Äôs been down and his money problems. We ended up going to his place and we slept together for the first time. On a previous occasion I had spent the night before and he didn‚Äôt pressure me for sex which is part of why I like him so much. We ended up going to this bar to get food and watch the game. Bc I knew he was having money issues I covered the tab it was about $75 for food and drinks (I think that‚Äôs reasonable). After our date we‚Äôre texting and taking about how we had a good time. But the next 2 days I don‚Äôt hear from him. I knew that week he had to go back home so he texted me when his flight landed and tells me he‚Äôs going to a party. He‚Äôs ask me how I‚Äôm doing then leaves me on read. I tried to FaceTime him the next day to check on him bc I know he‚Äôs been feeling down but no answer. He‚Äôs been active on social media so I know he‚Äôs on his phone but I don‚Äôt wanna keep calling and texting bc I don‚Äôt want to be clingy. It‚Äôs been days and I still haven‚Äôt heard from him. My friends are saying that I‚Äôm being used bc if he was interested he wouldn‚Äôt be ignoring me and why would he ask me out if he didn‚Äôt have any money. I didn‚Äôt mind paying for our date i don‚Äôt expect a man to pay for everything. I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep pursuing this bc his reoccurring inconsistency tells me he‚Äôs not interested in me like that. But the things he says when we‚Äôre on good terms makes it seem like he really likes me. But I feel like If I backed away while he‚Äôs going through things that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to him bc I know he‚Äôs dealing with a lot rn and can‚Äôt constantly give me all his attention. My friends are saying that I‚Äôm making excuses for him. I genuinely like him bc he has great moral quality‚Äôs and is one of the few men who are interested in me beyond the aspect of sex.

93,pre4me,1632078049,How to start dating after college with no experience?," TLDR: Quiet, introverted guy who failed at the college dating scene, and has been rejected his entire life, is trying to find ways to start dating.

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that croud (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pre4me/how_to_start_dating_after_college_with_no/

96,preics,1632079248,Questions about shyness and taking initiative in relationships,"Hello :) I'm an 18 year old autistic guy from Switzerland and I have a few questions when it comes to dating and relationships. I've never dated anyone, never kissed anyone,... and I sometimes worry I'll never find a girlfriend. But that's another topic. I don't really care if it takes time for me to get a girlfriend if I just get a girlfriend eventually (That sounds quite weird the way I formulated it but I couldn't think of another way. Sorry for that). As long as it's a loving relationship where both give and take and all that, I'm fine with waiting. I also believe that I'm currently not in the place for a relationship anyway. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 1.5 years and I'm only recovering slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the general society there are some stereotypes when it comes to (heterosexual) dating/relationships such as that the male partner should be the one who takes initiative or that the male person is the one who asks the girl out on the first date etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't want to seem as if I'm unable to learn to take more initiative myself but I think my potential in this area is somewhat limited. I am naturally quite shy and therefore am quite anxious with initiating conversations. I also don't really know how to initiate them tbh. And I have no idea how to flirt. So I'm quite unsure how I'm supposed to get closer with someone emotionally. Once I am in a conversation I think I can hold it most of the times.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I am this shy and anxious (I also get overwhelmed by new things and loud sounds and all that quite quickly) I'd find it great to have a very proactive and supportive partner. I also have difficulties organizing things. I definitely don't want to seem as if I'm unwilling to give anything back in the relationship but I do struggle more with everyday things than a non-autistic person. So in a way this contradicts the stereotype of the male person being the more initiative part in a relationship. This leads to a few questions:

1) How present are these stereotypes still in todays society? (Are they even true?)

2) How could I get more courage with approaching people?

3) Do I have to be the one who invites the other person out?

4) Are there girls/women that could be into me?

5) Is it strange for me to want these things? (what I wrote in the 4th paragraph)

6) Are the things in the 4th paragraph even realistic?

7) How do relationships generally develop?

I'm also quite awkward but I try to embrace it rather than hide it. It's the most genuine version of myself and I want people to see me as the person I am.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/preics/questions_about_shyness_and_taking_initiative_in/

99,preqe3,1632079952,I was asked out on a triple first date,"I (28F at the time) had moved to Tennessee in 2018 and was only there for a month or so before I started using Bumble. I had been on a couple of first dates that didn‚Äôt turn into anything before I started talking to this man who had just moved there from Ohio, let‚Äôs call him Byron (20‚ÄôsM). It was only a handful of days that we were messaging when he asked me if I wanted to go watch the Browns game at a local bar with him, his friend, and his roommate. A public place with a group of friends seemed like a low pressure first meeting, so I accepted. He asked if I wanted to meet an hour before the game at a brewery right next door to the sports bar, so that we could get to know each other one-on-one, before meeting up with his friend and roommate.

I get to the brewery first but wasn‚Äôt waiting long when he got there. He looked like he did in his photos, a little shorter than I had expected, but height isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for me. The conversation was the normal getting-to-know-you stuff but I knew fairly quick that it wasn‚Äôt a particularly great connection so I wasn‚Äôt thinking it would go anywhere. What sealed my decision on that was at some point he found something very funny and when he laughed it was SO LOUD and his face turned into something out of a cartoon. Huge, top and bottom teeth showing grin, eyes wide open about to pop out of his head type of laugh. I remember myself sitting back a little bit in surprise at the outburst of laughter and thinking ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a no.‚Äù I have a strong want to never feel embarrassed by the person I‚Äôm with. And his crazy, loud laugh made me want to turn to everyone at the brewery and announce that we weren‚Äôt together. 

After about an hour of us talking at the brewery he said his friend texted him from the sports bar and was saving a table for us to watch the game, let‚Äôs call her Brittany (20‚ÄôsF). I wasn‚Äôt surprised by this because he did say we would be watching the game with his friend and roommate. When we got to the bar, Brittany and I instantly hit it off. She was so welcoming to me, giving me recommendations for good food and drink in town since I was still new to the area and we had the same sense of humor so we were cracking up in no time. Byron was mainly watching the game, which was fine since I‚Äôm not a huge sports fan and had Brittany to talk to. 

At some point, Byron goes to the bathroom and while Brittany and I were talking she asked me how I knew Byron. I told her we had only been talking for a few days on Bumble and this is the first time I‚Äôm meeting him. She giggled a little and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny, I have been talking to him on Tinder and this is the first we are meeting each other.‚Äù I WAS SHOCKED. He had invited two women out on a dual first date under the same guise of watching the game with his ‚Äúfriend and roommate‚Äù (Brittany confirmed he had told her the same thing). I felt disrespected for Brittany and myself for being asked here under false pretenses. It‚Äôs alright if you want to date other people but at least be honest about it. Did he think we were that dumb that we wouldn‚Äôt figure it out?! 

Before he got back from the bathroom, Brittany and I both agreed that we were having a great conversation, so we exchanged numbers to hangout again. When Byron got back to the table we didn‚Äôt say much to him. I started texting Brittany under the table to ask her if she wanted to leave and go grab a drink at this bar down the street where I had heard a cover band playing 90s hits. I was prepared to tell Byron that we figured out his dual first date and that we were leaving. Brittany and I had our tabs open at the bar so we both got up to close them out. While waiting to close out at the bar, Brittany turned to me and said, ‚ÄúYeah, I might be into him if it wasn‚Äôt for that fucking laugh.‚Äù I started laughing and said, ‚ÄúThat fucking laugh, right?!‚Äù 

We get back to the table after closing our tabs but Byron looked like he was waiting for us to get back and said that he needed to go downstairs (we were on the second floor of this bar) to grab his friend who had just arrived. I had assumed it was this roommate he had told us about so we waited because people were quickly taking any tables that opened up. He came back with his friend, let‚Äôs call him Billy (20‚ÄôsM), and Brittany and I start talking with him. He was so nice! He worked as a nurse, loved ciders like I do (I‚Äôm allergic to hops, so can‚Äôt have beer. It sucks.) and he and Brittany were giving me cider brewery recommendations in town. He even got me a Washington Apple shot because he bought everyone else a round of beers and I had mentioned I grew up in WA. All of this was going on while Byron was just watching the game and not really talking too much. 

Brittany leaned over to me while the guys were distracted by the game and asked if we could actually stay because she was liking Billy. I told her, ‚ÄúNo problem, I‚Äôll be your wing woman and keep crazy over here entertained.‚Äù After that whispered check in, while I was talking with Billy he said something that had made my gaydar go off. Just wanting to give Brittany a heads up, I leaned over and mentioned that she may strike out with Billy. I said I could be wrong in my feeling though so we agreed just to leave it and see how the night went. 

A little bit after that Byron goes to the bathroom, again. Brittany then turned to Billy and asked the same question she did me, ‚ÄúSo how do you know Byron?‚Äù Billy said that he and Byron had been talking on Tinder and this is the first time they were meeting each other!!! Brittany and I whip our heads towards each other with this knowing look of utter amazement that we were in an unbelievably, crazy triple first date situation! We just kept laughing hysterically because we didn‚Äôt know what else to do! Billy probably thought we were kind of crazy but hadn‚Äôt asked about the outburst of laughter. 

Right when Byron got back to the table, Billy left for the bathroom. Brittany then turned to Byron and said something to the effect of, ‚ÄúSo, Billy told us how you guys met!‚Äù Byrons face dropped and instantly went white. He then stood up, started clapping and cheering at the game but I looked and nothing was really even happening on the field and no one else in the bar was cheering. I think he just wanted to not be in that awkward moment. Brittany then looked to me with a smile and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to leave now.‚Äù We said our goodbyes to Billy who got back not long after Byrons cheering and Byron barely even looked us in the eye as we left. Looking back, I wish I had clued Billy into what Brittany and I knew and asked if he wanted to come grab a drink with us. He was such a down to earth guy and easy to get along with. I think I just wanted to get away from Byron as quickly as possible.

Brittany and I went to the bar with the 90s cover band and they were appropriately playing ‚ÄúBye Bye Bye‚Äù by *NSYNC, which we sang very loudly together and had such a fun end to the night. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years since then and Brittany and I are best friends. We are both happily in committed relationships and I‚Äôm going to be in her wedding next summer! 

I‚Äôve always wondered, what were Byrons reasons or motives for setting up a triple first date? Did he want to get the first date out of the way with the three people he was talking with and then decide who he wanted to see again? Or was he hoping for some foursome action if we all got along together? Maybe he was wanting to play the odds and hoped to go home with at least one of us that night. Whatever the motive, I‚Äôll give it up to him that it takes some balls to try a setup like that!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/preqe3/i_was_asked_out_on_a_triple_first_date/
