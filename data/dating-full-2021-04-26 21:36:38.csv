I (31F) been talking to a guy (48M) who i met on Tinder for a couple of weeks now. Hes about an hour away, but cute, seemingly normal and nice. We have been texting sparingly, but consistently (at least once a day) since we exchanged numbers. We’re both pretty busy with work and kids, and do not have eminent plans to meet, but have both said that we would like to do so at some point. 

Something made me google him last night, and i unfortunately found out that he was arrested about 3 years ago for a domestic violence incident with his ex-wife and her boyfriend. Neither party pressed charges, but this was reported on because he has a public job. 

I understand that it is somewhat unfair to judge someone solely based on a one-sided account of what was possibly one of the worst incidents of their life, but i no longer wish to speak to him anymore, because 1) I’m fairly newly sober, this incident involved alcohol, and i fear this could be a triggering behavior, and 2) i have been in a relationship where domestic violence occurred, and i would like to do anything within my power not to open myself (or more importantly, my children) up to that possibility ever again.

I have so many different reasons but the dating coaches say you should pick the most important issue and base your break up on that. Can you help me determine which is the most significant enough means to initiate the break up off of?

Here is a list of reasons why I’m leaving

1) He has admitted to being emotionally unavailable. 

-Context: a few months ago I told him that this isn’t the connection I’m looking for. I mentioned I’m looking for something deeper. He said he does want something deeper as well but is emotionally unavailable due to a personal issue and Covid (Covid was worse before). He said he wanted to keep trying in hopes of turning it into something more serious because he “likes me a lot and does not want to lose me.” 


2) I’m not getting enough attention. We have been in the talking stage for a year now. Throughout the whole year we only met up 14 times. In between seeing each other we have small talk every 4-5 days. He has called me a few pet names before like ‘cutie’ but other wise doesn’t pay attention to me 


3) he completely ignored Valentine’s Day and my birthday 

4) I’m a planner and he likes to just go with the flow 

5) he says he used to be a player but now he can’t unequivocally say that he is not a player

I’ll make it brief but would love some female advice here. I (23M) have been seeing a girl (23F) for about a month now (4 dates total) . She’s a friend of a friend. Basically the dates have been going great  and this past weekend we spent a lot of time together (spent the night Friday, hung out with our mutual friends Saturday night and she slept over again). We’ve been hooking up everytime, texting basically daily, and I know she thinks I’m super fun (our mutual friend told me that before this weekend). 

Anyways, I dropped her off yesterday morning and we were texting throughout the day more or less. This morning I continued the conversation and she just liked the message. She then snap chatted me asking for a picture of my dog cause she “missed her” so I sent it and she opened and didn’t respond. 

I’m just curious if I’m overthinking things here. She has never gone with just liking a message and then not following up all day but I’m wondering if maybe she just wants some space after a lot of time together. It seems a bit abrupt because last night she was initiating tons of conversation. Wondering if it’s a indication she might be getting cold feet about a relationship or something. Just curious what people think I should do

So I finally started investigating a little on our last date and asked him what his longest relationship was (he told me a year) and said most of them were only a few months. I asked him if he ever wanted kids/ marriage which I think is a pretty fair question by this point, and he just said “ I don’t like to label things, if it happens it happens” I was a little taken back by that answer after having spent so much time with this guy. This is where I realized I was just a warm body to him, even tho he would let me stay over after he left for work and would cook me dinner almost every other night. It meant nothing to him.

That was the status quo and I'd been fine with it.

Then this last weekend she invited me to go on a ""walk"" one afternoon, without any of our other friends, and I was like sure, that'd be fine. So we go, it was a cool walk, more of a hike though, to the top of a hill with a decent view over where we live. We watched the sunset, then headed down the hill and that was it. I figured it was at least something along the lines of a date, and I figured best way to know was to just bite the bullet and actually ask her, why did we go on this walk, like I asked, was this supposed to be a date? To which she got pretty weird and honestly didn't ever answer the question, then we got back to the cars and went our separate ways.

I've been pretty out of dating for a few years after a pretty discouraging breakup from my last girlfriend, so I'm assuming I'm just rusty on picking up on social cues and clueless in general when it comes to dating.

We all exchanged info, my friend and I with these two girls.

She'll snapchat me and all that, text me as well. And I guess my friend and her went out once, and he told me it didn't work out. He found himself not really into her.

So some background info: I (25F) have been seeing/dating this guy (26) on and off for the last 2 years. The only on and off portion was last year where I moved out of the city for a job. I moved back in April once covid shut my job down. We reconnected and picked up where we left off. 

Before I moved I had asked him what we were doing - cause admittedly I had/ have fallen for him pretty hard. He said I don’t want to ask you to be my girlfriend if your moving. That’s totally fair! 

Now fast forward to now. We see each other 2-4 times a week, we talk every day. Recently he has started to say more “we” things and has been wanting me to meet his friends and stuff. 

I recently met a whole big group of his buddies and their girlfriends. They all referred to me as his, and they told me he called me that to! So thinking it’s finally happened, I bring it up and he shuts down immediately and says he’s concerned about the pressure a relationship and the label “boyfriend” causes, and doesn’t want to prevent me from meeting someone else, which I thought was strange. I pushed a bit further and he says he hasn’t seen anyone else since we have starting seeing each other. I haven’t either. The only difference (I can see) is that he still has the dating apps on his phone and I have them deleted.

Today I was helping him move and I found this little paper heart I took from the pub we were at on Valentine’s Day, with a little note saying: “I ❤️ you”. 

I have feelings for this man, we have fun together, and enjoy each other’s company. 

So here is where I need the advice or some outside opinions:

I’m confused. All his actions - the keeping of trinkets, the wanting me to be more involved in his social life - point to it being like a boyfriend/girlfriend situation. But the issue with the labels and the pressure has me confused. He wants to keep it “whatever” . Is it a bad idea to just continue as we have been going? What does this all mean? Am I being too pushy or am I overthinking the whole scenario?

A little story: Back in 2015, I saw this beautiful girl in my office building. She worked for a different company than mine. I used to see her whenever she used to come down stairs for a smoke. We had eye contact several times and I felt she seemed to be interested as well. One day I made a move and approached her. I don't know what happened to me at that moment, I froze, lost all the confidence and straight away told her she looks beautiful today. She looked at me for 5-10 seconds without saying anything and then started looking at her phone. She ignored me. I didn't expect it and I didn't know what I could do, so I said sorry and left.

I went on a vacation the next day(it was planned) and came back a week later. When I joined back my office again, I saw she was coming downstairs for smoking. I saw she was looking at me. My ego striked and I started ignoring her. She came very close to me and stood there. There was enough empty space but she still chose to stand next to me. I was happy but I don't know why I brought my ego in b/w. This happened for a couple of days—she used to make eye contact with me and come close to me to smoke. I was enjoying this but I didn't know what was coming after it. One day she started ignoring me and pretended as if I didn't exist. She never looked at me again and maintained a huge distance. I regret it soooo much now.


It's been 5 years and I still can't stop thinking about her. She was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. I really really really liked her, and I think I still do. I tried sending her friend requests on FB/Instagram but she never accepted them.

Today she came to my dreams and I'm going crazy again. Should I try again to contact her again? What should I do without being creepy? Please help! Thank you everyone for reading it.

I know that I only watch stories of people I’m somewhat interested in maybe not sexually but some kind of interest, in someee way. Maybe it’s different for each personality tho ...I for the most part follow about 1500 accounts and watch like ten ppl stories. Do you really just “click through mindlessly watching everyone’s so the notification is gone” is that really a thing ? I’m genuinely curious. 

I typically mute the stories of guys I like so that sometimes I miss their story and sometimes I’m hours late at checking.. ect. Or else they will just pop at the top within minutes of posting and I’ll look eager. 

Anyways, this is all as a segue into a question.:
Saw this guy for some months went on dates hung out a lot, hooked up ect, morning texts blah blah. Then I felt he was falling back a little in romantic sense...so I texted basically saying “ i had fun with you, but I’m not looking for fbw, we’re both kinda all over it seems” he replied “that’s not fair can we talk about it, what are you looking for?” 

I never replied and then he double texted next day basically saying had fun as well and he’d respect my wishes. 

That day forward 1 month straight never looked at a story at all, I assumed I was muted but now he looks at them again. Curious, what are the reasons you’d just stop then start again? 

I had unfollowed him immediately, but he kept following me. Even though he only follows not very many people. If someone unfollowed me I would also, maybe that’s immature? But if I really didn’t care and stopped viewing immediately, I also wouldn’t start again either? 

What are your own experiences with this and what is your opinion on watching in general and your take on this also.

A bit of background... we’ve known each other for nearly two years, dated and then became boyfriend and girlfriend. We went through a lot together and ultimately broke up because we were both dealing with our own recovery issues. We’ve been through a lot together in terms of those issues and more. We didn’t speak for 1.5 months, but ended up reaching out to each other and meeting up a few times/phone calls during our breakup. He ended up moving to another city and I had moved back to my hometown. (We said goodbye to each other) 

When I got back home he reached out to me asking me to come see him and although I was hesitant I eventually let him convince me after talking for awhile. It seemed like maybe this would be our fresh start and we were both on good paths (we didn’t breakup because we didn’t care about each other or because feelings weren’t there) and we have been in contact ever since. 

I’ve been down at least 5 times now, and every time it’s great. Things feel so right and we are so connected, and we just fit together, but this is no longer fulfilling for me as I’m starting to develop more feelings and the thought of him with someone else drives me a bit crazy. He doesn’t want to be in a serious relationship right now and although we have discussed plans of me moving there, it seems like It’s just a fantasy. (I do want to move to his city for school but I still have a lot of things to do before that can even happen) I know that this isn’t a healthy situation for me because deep down I want more, and ultimately don’t think we should be doing the visits anymore until we both decide to be serious about each other. 

How can I communicate this to him? Has anyone else been in this situation? It’s difficult because we are friends as well and I don’t want to stop communication completely but I don’t want to put the effort in anymore, I don’t want to be a texting buddy, and I want to live my single life fully (not dating a bunch of men, but putting myself first and being the best version of myself that I can be, and being open to new relationships, which is hard when you are constantly thinking about someone else, etc.) without this “relationship” holding me back. I truly care about this man to the point where I’m starting to put my own what’s and needs on the back burner. I don’t want to feel like an option which is hard with the distance, and I don’t want to get hurt if he ends up meeting someone else. I don’t want to put my heart in the hands of someone else.

I could use advice and words of encouragement, the last 6 months haven’t been easy for me and I’ve overcome so much.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 3 years, and I don’t know what the problem is here or what to say to him. 

He’s been friends with this girl, for privacy purposes I’ll name her Leah. Leah and my boyfriend would hangout all night and drive around until the sun came up. He would leave my messages on delivered for many hours until he was at his place alone for the night and he’d be very short with me. Over time, I felt uncomfortable with this and I had a strong feeling something wasn’t right (he doesn’t even do this with me either). I decided to open up to him about how I feel, yes I was firm with him but i wasn’t being a total b#### about it. He ended up telling me that he had feelings for Leah, so we took a break from dating for a couple months. 

In those couple of months, my boyfriend touched her *lower area*, they’ve held hands, he gave her a peck, they slept together and they hung out every single night. That’s all that happened **that i know of. **

Now, he keeps switching between blocking her and going back and hanging out with her all night, same thing. It’s a constant cycle and because of it i’ve been having more anxiety and i’ve had a fair share of panic attacks. 

***An important part of this is Leah’s had a boyfriend for about 5 years and when my boyfriend and I were in an argument Leah told me that she hooked up with another guy as well. She’s told him and I several times that she will never break up with her boyfriend for mine and that she’s not interested in dating my boyfriend. ***

She talks to my boyfriend like she likes him, they have “songs” they listen to together and she always tells him she misses him and is thinking of him. 

I heard all of this and I tried telling my boyfriend that she seems like trouble and I think she’s using him and other guys for attention- but is she? Or am I the problem? What should I do about this? 

He keeps seeing her no matter what and he’s willing to break up with me if i can’t accept it; yet he doesn’t want me hanging out with a male friend.

So me and my girlfriend value honesty between us a lot. we dont like to sugarcoat things for eachother, we tell it like it is.
my girlfriend has been getting a lot of piercings which is completely fine by me. she can do whatever she wants with her body, but i have never found piercings to be very attractive. in fact, i find them extremely unattractive in some cases. conventional ones dont make me feel any type of way such as ears and the like. 
she recently got her nipples pierced which im not really into but i still find her as a whole attractive. she wants to get a bunch more such as the nose piercing that goes where your nostrils connect and the ones where they stretch your ears which i reeeeaaaally dont like but i support her regardless. she always asks me if i like her piercings expecting me to give an answer besides no. im not rude or harsh about it but i tell her the truth that i do not like them or find them attractive. this in turn obviously upsets her and makes me feel horrible as well. i dont like to upset her and she recently told me that the fact i dont like any of the things shes done with her body, it destroys her confidence which i dont want at all. its not completely one sided either. i got a tattoo recently which she made very clear she thought looked stupid but i just didnt take it to heart and got it anyways and everythings fine.

The thing that bothers me the most is that all three dates were nearly flawless. We just went out where ever, and just hung out, cuddled a shit ton(all sorts of physical attention), just talked, did fun activities at like parks and stuff and it all went smoothly. 

There was one red flag, she straight up told me not to get committed, which IM AN IDIOT FOR NOT LISTENING... doesn’t change the fact that I still like her. 

Then she just told me that we should stay as friends as that she isn’t over her ex yet, and then she has been just distant (it’s been about a week, I haven’t been texting her almost at all)

As the title says, this guy who i've known for about a year at this point ghosted his friends for over 4 months after lockdown. He also ghosted me since we were texting and sort of flirting at the time too. 
His friends (who are all pretty wonderful supportive people he has known since childhood) were really worried about him and believed him to be depressed. They tried reaching out multiple times at the beginning but were rebuffed. He wouldnt answer the phone and eventually his sister would simply answer and tell them he was busy with work so couldnt talk on the phone. Eventually they let him be and he slowly started getting back into contact with them about a month or so ago. 
Fast forward to a week ago, his sister let slip during a gathering which he wasnt present at that she had been staying with him after lockdown, that she was feeling empty and depressed during that time and so to distract themselves she and her brother conducted a few social experiments ""like for example"" and then she looked straight at his friends, like she had just remembered they were present and trailed off then changed the subject. 
They are now suspicious that the ghosting was one of these ""experiments"". It might just be a misunderstanding but something feels off about the whole thing and i just felt really weirded out by it. I already made my peace with the fact that he changed his mind about liking me when he ghosted and decided to treat him as a friendly acquaintance as i am now part of his friend circle (i should mention one of my best friends is also one of his and that's how we met) but this new piece of info made the ghosting seem worse to me because he not only did it to me (barely an acquaintance) but to his friends who i've known longer than i've known him and who i now consider good friends as well. 
I just found the idea of it being an experiment disturbing. Are we all overreacting to a simple misunderstanding or is it a red flag ?

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 4 months, and she is from Europe. She’s in the US until August for a lab placement (she is a biochemistry student). I am a dental student, so we had “chemistry” (pun intended). 

We’ve decided that our relationship does have an expiration date (when she leaves), and that we’re gonna make the most of the time we have together. 

Anyway, I have a lot of friends in general, and some of my female friends have been messaging me on Instagram and Facebook. My girlfriend saw me responding to them, and she said she was “jealous” semi-playfully and even wanted me to send a flirtatious text as a prank to them. She also said I need to find someone to replace her. 

She even said I have a “queue of girls after me” and that I’m a “Casanova” (playboy in Spanish, she’s from Spain). 

It was honestly so weird, she did act kinda jealous, yet she wanted me to flirt with other girls.

I M(20) and my girlfriend F(20) have been dating for about 6 months now. She was my first while I was her 20th. I really love her and I do see a future with her, and she tells me the same. She says she’s never actually loved anyone and I can tell she loves me a lot by her actions and reactions to things. She also tells me about nightmares she has where I talk or sleep with other girls, and I have had to comfort her. She’s genuinely afraid that I will get bored of her and leave her (as other people have done in her past).

We’ve had some problems in the first few months of me being jealous of her past. I was able to get over it to a point where it wouldn’t outwardly bother me and I wouldn’t bother her about it. It still eats away at me inside sometimes. At first I was sort of unjustly angry that she had been with so many people before me and a little disgusted. I never thought this would be a problem for me, I never understood it, until I got in a relationship. I wanted her all to myself the same way she had all of me. But now I’m just jealous of her experiences. I understand I have no right to be angry about the things she’s done in the past and that she has a right to expect monogamy out of a relationship but I just want to explore more myself. 

We recently stopped using condoms and I contracted chlamydia through her. Apparently she’s had it for at least two years now unnoticed while I developed symptoms within a month. I’m kind of pissed, but I kept that emotion to myself and showed no signs of it to her. I feel like this is really what triggered me to write this post now. Her past literally hurts me both physically and emotionally.

I think the main problem now is that I’m certain this is the woman I want for the rest of my life. My problem is that I never expected that to happen with my first girlfriend. She tells me she’s never been serious with anyone but me. I want her in the long term but I also want to experience other people. I’m not bored of her sexually nor as a person. I just want to have more experiences so that I could stop being insecure. I feel like I’ve missed out on my teenage years (as I didn’t hookup or go to parties often) and it still kind of haunts me. 

I know this is a situation about having your cake and eating it but I just need a place to rant as well. You can roast me in the comments if you have to. I know feeling the way I do is small-dick energy and childish or whatever but I literally cannot help it. It’s turning into a very slight resentment of her. I’m afraid asking for an open relationship would cause some major damage.

TLDR: girlfriend has been with many people, I have only been with her. I’d like to experience more people through an open relationship (bc I love her and don’t want to let her go), but girlfriend is too insecure so I’m afraid to ask and ruin everything.

anyways we spend a lot of time together bc we have a lot of the same classes and we’ve become pretty close this semester, although, at times our friendship feels one-sided and more focused on him which is a bit frustrating.

i’m going to reiterate that i don’t have romantic feelings for this guy, but i will admit the attention feels nice and so i mighttt bait him a bit sometimes...whoops

things took a bit of a turn lately when his gf went home for the weekend &amp; we got super drunk/high in his dorm room...one thing lead to another and we ended up having sex. he initiated it and i’d say it was consensual because even though i was a little hesitant and extremely under the influence i never expressed to him that i felt unsure about it. so far i haven’t told anyone that i’ve slept w him. we both kinda promised to keep things on the DL.

to continue the story, we’ve had sex one other time (sober) and THIS was the time i started to question my decision of being intimate with him.

for starters, the act really seemed all selfishly about him. any input i offered him was disregarded which honestly felt disrespectful. i told him i wanted to use protection to which he said okay but then he didn’t even bother to do so. there’s other issues i have about the past two times we’ve “done it” but i’ll save those details for the sake of tmi. he also made me leave immediately after because he didn’t want his gf to “smell another girl” in his room. i guess i can understand where he’s coming from but also...not even a little time to debrief? i was pretty turned-off to say the least.

after that i was upset but i’m not sure if i’m allowed to be upset because i kinda did this to myself but that makes me feel more like shit honestly. i also don’t know if i can tell even him how i feel about it either.

so yeah...i think i’m gonna try to end our affair. hookups/fwb just don’t seem to be the thing for me. also i’d rather not be a seen as a ”homewreaker” he’s a good friend to have around but it also seems like he’s “mooching” off me both in friendship &amp; sex and it’s super draining.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,739708,public,nsfw,sooo i slept w him &amp; now idk how to feel...FWB?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mzhgqc/sooo_i_slept_w_him_now_idk_how_to_feelfwb/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,

This girl (20) and i (m 22)  have been texting for a couple weeks now, super flirty at first, said all the right things about wanting to meet up, even said she wanted to take a “nap” with me. 

However she’s been super flakey about meeting up, keeps saying she’s busy cause of school work etc. Said she was “busy” this past Saturday and working Sunday but that she’s not working this upcoming Saturday. At the advice of my friend, I did not reply to her for almost 24 hours, after which I replied how I was sooo “busy” and that she should hit me up the next day. 

Hilariously, she plays the same game, waiting exactly 24 hours to hit back! We talk back and forth, she asks what I’m doing I say chilling in bed, wish she was there with me, to which she responds she wishes she was and to “invite” her. She says how drunk she is and I say “next Saturday. U and me. We’re gonna get RIPPED hahahaha” to which she replay “hahahaha yes I wanna” 

See a pattern here? All the right things being said but I still feel like she adds the “I wanna” in there cause she’s still not all in. Despite saying she’s off. Why can’t she ever just give a straight up yes?? 

So I then met a girl at the yankees game, took a pic with her and put it on my IG story to make her jealous. She saw it but didn’t unfollow or anything.

I have not reached out to her since posting that pic in hopes that not giving her as much attention would entice her to follow through this time. So it’s been almost a week. Was planning on hitting her up again Wednesday to see if she’s (finally) down to meet Saturday (day SHE said she’s off). 

What do you guys think about this whole  situation?? Does it sound like she’s gonna meet up?? Why does she say how excited she is to meet and all this flirty shit and then push it off?? Any and all input would be greatly appreciated.

I’m a developer from an Asian country and planning to create a site/app for us average people to date. I’ve experienced and read about all the issues we face on current dating apps. So If I’m planning to develop an app with following features

1. You can add photos from the gallery. But have to add a photo taken from Camera(So we’ll be seeing the real person, not just the best photo of them)

2. No bs long texts in profile description. Maybe a 20 character string for simplicity. 

3. If you match with someone you have to message them. If not it will counted as a penalty after 72 hours. 

4. After 3 penalties you get blocked for a week

5. In a conversation either one can report if other person is just wasting their time, and admins can monitor the chat to take a suitable action(i know this is a privacy issue, but suggest a better way?)

6. You can’t send photos over the app. There’s an option to share the phone number. 

7. You can filter only using sex,age and distance

8. List of people who have liked you will not be hidden behind a paywall (monetizing need to be done in some other way, maybe later)

Please provide your opinion towards this. Will it grab any attention? Or does this make no sense?

On the second date we spoke quite a lot and on the train home she even was lying on my shoulder while we were chatting. I paid for everything on both dates as i chose to. 

We speak every day on snapchat (that's just our main way), i do have her number and what not but yeah. She works a lot and is always busy and on top of that she lives about 40 mins on the train away (not too big of a deal), however it can be hard to just catch up in the afternoon or plan to just hang out for an hour. I feel like sometimes the conversation can be really dry and sometimes really good, sometimes she replies quick and sometimes it takes hours (mostly during the day when she is working, which is normal). After our second date (last friday - 3 days ago) she told me we wont be able to do something for 2 weeks as she is quite busy and that's good and all and fair enough.

I feel like everything is going good, she's still talking to me so i think she likes me and we have hugged and stuff a bit (we almost kissed at the end of the second date but she told me she doesnt really kiss anyone til she is in a relationship and thats okay, i can respect that). I'm not trying to be pushy or clingy or anything, just trying to be me but sometimes i feel like i come off needy or something when i dont mean to, i have backed off with how quick i reply to messages and what not (she is the first girl i have dated in over a year and a half).

We both agree that honesty is super important and last night i told her i liked her cause its been on my mind and i wont be able to see her for at least 2 weeks so i just said it to her. She told me 'I appreciate the honesty, i like you too, i really do' followed closely by on the topic of being honest that she has been/or has seen others (i cant remember how it was worded) since we arent exclusive, and its true, we aren't its only the second date. It threw me off a little bit but i had expected it and since we aren't exclusive it's expected.

I guess i'm just a little confused with the signals, she tells me that she likes me, held my hand on first date, hugged me and talks to me every day but still (maybe?) seeing others. Is this a normal thing? Am i over thinking?
