We dated for nearly a year. It was my first real relationship and not just a hookup or a stupid fling. I still see her frequently because she’s my sisters best friend and I’m friends with my sister. I just can’t get past her. Nobody seems as good as her or as compatible with me as she was. We got into exploring drugs together but I ended up getting addicted to cocaine. It scratched an itch I didn’t know I had. Eventually she broke up with me because I was being an asshole constantly and it was well deserved. I even made her feel like a bad person for it and I regret that. I was horrible. I lied to her about my use. I wanted her to do it with me because misery loves company. I was absolutely a negative force in her life. Before I started our relationship felt great but it was a downward spiral. I’m planning on apologizing soon because seeing her brings up so many emotions. I still love her even though it’s been like 4 years. There just seems to be nobody who understands me like she did or anyone who I understand like her. I’ve been on dates with so many people since our relationship but I can’t find anyone that I love the way I loved her. 

The worst part about this is that after I got sober she asked to get back together and I rejected her because I wasn’t ready but now I can’t get past her. Even now we have great chemistry but I still haven’t tried to fix our relationship. 

I’m mostly just venting because I can’t help that I love this person that I’m afraid won’t work because of our past. I don’t feel like any advice is going to fix this situation.

I kinda ignored it, but we hung out once more at her home when she called me &amp; another friend for lunch.

I've heard when in an LDR , either the heart grows fonder or it goes kaput. I really don't wanna be a homewrecker, but the girl's pretty and just because there's a goalkeeper doesn't mean you can't score lmao. 

Just asked her to hang again for the weekend (not a date), where I just happened to something on the lines of ""Btw, you wanna hangout over the weekend? I haven't gone out much since I came. Let's go sightseeing if you're up for it :)""

Her reply ""I'll let you know because I have two submissions due this Monday if I make good progress by then, we can go"".

We go in for the kiss and she pulls back saying she’s super awkward at making out and meanwhile I have no idea what I’m supposed to do, we then go in again and our lips just touch and then that was that. Things get awkward, we say goodbye and go our separate ways. A few minutes after I dropped her off she sends me a text apologizing for leaving like that and tells me she had a good time and hopes I have a safe drive home. I then text her not to worry about it and that I had a good time too and would love to do something again sometime. Then with iMessage she loves my text.

He and I never really talked much over the years that I’ve known his sister. With him being six years older than me our paths rarely crossed. I always thought he was really cute.

When Erica got married back in June I was a bridesmaid. Hank and I hit it off at the reception and spent most of the night talking, joking, and just having a nice time. We danced a couple of times too.  

At that time I was still dating my ex Kevin (24 m).  Right before the wedding we had a massive fight over money (of course) and he refused to go to the wedding with me. While I did enjoy my evening getting to know Hank a little I made it clear to him that I was dating someone.

At the end of the night Hank told me to remind my boyfriend what an awesome girlfriend he had. He hugged me goodnight and we went our separate ways. I was left feeling really confused. On one hand I had just had this wonderful evening with this handsome, funny and charming guy. On the other hand I had a boyfriend who I’d invested the last two years in.

I was determined to try to make things work with my Kevin though. Our first year and a half he’d been so good. I thought we could recapture that feeling. We tried, well I tried. But Kevin and I had one huge fight in July and he got so angry that he punched a hole through my bedroom door.

I broke it off with him right then and there. I went no contact with him and it’s been six weeks since I’ve seen or heard from him. So my mind kept going back to that night at Erica’s wedding. I wondered how Hank was doing and did he fell that spark I felt at the reception.

Last weekend Erica suggested I should call him. So I got his number and called him last night. We talked for 2.5 hours! We talked about our previous relationships. We both expressed interest in each other. We both also think it’s a good idea to move slowly for various reasons.

So I asked him if he’d like to have dinner with me on Saturday night and he said he’d love to. This is going to be my first real date in so long. Kevin and I never went out for dinner or anything since early in 2020. I’m really excited to see Hank again. I really am hoping that spark I felt will be there Saturday night. 

I’m also really nervous. I keep telling myself to calm down. I know he’s into me. He made that clear when we talked last night. I want to make it clear to him that I’m it doing this as some sort of rebound either.

At the time of the wedding I was in a relationship that was on the rocks. I had a huge fight with my soon to be ex Kevin (24 m) right before the wedding and he refused to go with me. 

So I spent the whole evening chatting with Hank. We laughed a lot, talked a lot, and we even danced a few times. I realized that he was a really funny guy. Very charming.

Kevin and I finally split up in July after a really scary fight where he ended up punching a hole through my bedroom door. I’ve gone no contact with him since then. Erica suggested last weekend that I should call her brother. So I did.

This was great because immediately I thought she was perfect. She is smart, witty, funny, and not to mention beautiful. As we have talked and texted our relationship has developed and grown so that we are inseparable and spend very much of our time together. This is something we both started doing in the relationship a lot and before we realized it we were texting every day seeing if we could put something together between us. The only set back is until now, our relationship is entirely online.

Here is where the relationship gets difficult, recently I offered for her to visit, and I could tell this was something she wanted to do but because of our relationship with covid guidelines this has become less likely to be able to do. I would like a relationship to happen between us but given the current situation we are in this has become more difficult to sustain and finding a solution is something we would both very much like. I will preface this by saying I am vaccinated and so is she. For now, we are taking extra precautions, so we don’t get our families any unnecessary exposure. 

I am trying to think of a perfect date for her that allows us to work within these boundaries. My initial idea was to mail her a gift and see if we could get a video call in place. We have mainly texted and snapchatted up until now where we both have admitted wanting to see each other more. The gift would probably be something considerate of our conversations that she could enjoy. As of now I haven’t figured out what this gift idea would be. Maybe an iphone accessory but there are tons of other ideas worth considering also, our conversations are always very vibrant so I know the more I think of something the easier this idea will be. I always take tons of time to listen to our conversations and think about what she may be interested in. 

Here is where we reach a standstill in our relationship: she makes little to no effort at going out of her way for me. I usually start and end all our conversations and where she does appear to be interested in dating me, she hasn’t gone out of her way significantly to give me the impression this is a two-sided relationship. I appreciate when we spend our time together and absolutely light up every time, I receive a message from her. For her to not take any steps to show me that she wants to continue or grow our relationship with each other, I have become hard pressed to continue to find my own motivation to start conversations.

What is the best way to see that she is interested without me always pressing the topic? We have already spent enough time to get an idea that we want to see each other, and I have asked her out on a date. She was jubilant about this when she received the message because at the least, she knew someone was thinking about her. I do want to send her flowers and gifts and she has agreed that she enjoys gifts such as this. Is a good idea to send her these items so as to make her feel more appreciated and respected without asking for anything in return?

I love face timing and video chatting with her as our relationship stands right now, I only wish we could move things further between us so we could have more of a relationship with each other in person.

He got my number and I hooked up with him and we slept together on our first date. He initiated everything and he is really smooth and confident that he can sleep with me. He did not seem nervous at all. I am thinking that he must have done this regularly.

I thought he would have dumped me right after the hookup because we did not really have sex (tried to but I am very inexperienced). He took me home the morning after and we went for a walk at the park.

I just texted him to say sorry about what happened last night and I am not looking for casual sex. He texted me and said that he is also looking for something serious. He came out two more times and hung out with me. One time during the day but the other time, it was at night. I think he was trying to hookup with me again that night, but he did not really pushed me to have sex.

He works in another city and after he left, he still texts me daily and check up on me. I guess that is one positive sign that he might be serious about me. I mean he is not getting long distance sex, but he still seems to put in the effort (very minimal effort). I ask him to call but whenever he calls, it is either him going to work. It never last more than 15 mins. I feel like if he actually wants to talk, he can call me after work when he’s making dinner and actually have a conversation. He also sucks at replying to messages.

I am afraid that I will actually like him back (I am starting to put in a lot of feelings) and he end up being a fuckboy so I do not respond to every one of his messages anymore. I told him that if he is busy, he is not obligated to text me everyday. He still text everyday to check in.

He is coming back to my city for work reasons next month. He offers for me to meet his friends. His parents are also here next month, and he offered me to meet them through Facetime. I wish I can trust him but he talks like a player (and calls me “sexy, hot etc”)...which sounds very sexual.

We were both in LTR at that time. We were in the same group of friends but we became super close last year after both our relationships ended. At first i never considered the idea of dating him because i have dated people in my circle of friends before and after the break up it was pretty messy and awkward and ended up losing some friends.  Also he's not really the type of guy i usually go for.

We basically started doing all the shit a couple does (watching tv shows together, having brunch, long convos, picnics, going to the cinema) minus the sex. I was really hesitant to engage in this because i tend to get way more emotionally attached doing this kind of things than actually sleeping with someone. 

And boom, Today he actually told me he had started officially dating someone he was super into and it felt like a slap. I honestly feel like he's been leading me on without realizing it, because i never initiated anything between us , (He did) and he never even metioned he was seeing someone ( he started seeing this girl MONTHS AGO) , to be clear i have a lot of male friends and my friendship with them is very different and much more platonic.

I specifically asked her if she’d like some space to figure things out and she said no. I asked her if she wants me to stop being around and she said no. I asked her if she had feelings for me and she said her anxiety is overwhelming her. She couldn’t pinpoint what she was anxious about.

I just found out that the guy that I am currently talking to and I’ve been on one date with so far is really good friends (since like child hood) with a guy that I exchanged nudes with on Snapchat before. The guy and I never hooked up or anything and we never even hung out or anything and it was 5 years ago. To be honest he slid into my DM‘s and we exchanged Snapchat accounts and we would occasionally flirt and one night he sent me a dick pic and I sent him back two nudes. This was on snap chat and we obviously were both intoxicated when this happened and we were in college. we are still friends on Snapchat but haven’t really talked or even snap chatted each other in like five years. Do you think that he will eventually find out from his really good friend? And if so do you think it will even be a big deal? Again we never hooked up or anything. And it was 5 years ago

We talked for hours over dinner and a couple drinks each. Afterwards, we walked to the beach nearby at night, before I walked her back to her car. 

My biggest mistake was not going for a kiss, but she straight up said things like, “Well, next time...” and “When we hangout again...” So, I sort of figured I’d just play it cool and go for it on the “next” date.

She was pretty slow to respond, as these stories usually go. I kept it light, trying to use texting mainly for date logistics/planning. The thing is she was slow as texting in the week or two prior to us hanging out and even postponed the first one, leaving me hanging for five days before we actually met. Which was no big deal, just saying.

She often double or triple texts, so at least she puts in some effort, but after I suggested the following Friday, she said she may be out of town and would get back to me. Which seemed like the nail in the coffin, so I basically just told her no worries, worth a shot, no pressure. I figured I gave it a shot and left the ball in her court.

Anyways, that was over a week ago. I assume I’m as good as gone in her mind. She even paid for dinner, to which I insisted on the spot to cover half via Venmo. But again, she said, “Get me back on the next one.” And even spent more time with me after at the beach, so I figured she was actually having a good time.

I’m no longer anxious about socializing with people…I can do it with confidence and maturity.

I don’t know what to say to spark sexual tension; I am so used to keeping to myself. I’m that quiet, calm and focused guy that you see all the time but who no one really knows. 

So there are plenty of other people who are also interested in casual hookups, on occasion, with no serious overlap of each other’s lives. That’s what I want to indicate without being obnoxious about it or building a social reputation for that but I guess I lack the social skills to do that, and girls do not really ever approach me but do tend to visually acknowledge attraction.

I know this might sound both cheesy and cynical as hell, but hear me out. 

I’ve asked people in my life why they love their particular partners and no one has given me an answer satisfying enough that it would not be interchangable with other people. 

Sociologically speaking, if you name all the traits you love about your partner, it’s not unreasonable to find something similar or even better in other people. My sister has said she loves her boyfriend because, compared to all the partners she’s had, he genuinely cares about her. My parents stick with each other for practical reasons, like needing a place to stay, financial stability, etc. My frat brother has told me love just is. While this is the only answer I’ve found to be close to satisfying, it doesn’t justify why people choose to stick it out with their partners through the thick and thin.

Personally, my answer is that I have attachment issues and my girlfriend has helped me feel safe to be vulnerable. But then again, is the contrast with other girls because of a positive about her or is it just due to a problem with myself? Both? But if either of the two is true, I could always be able to find a safe place elsewhere. 

Generally, we can say that it’s our experiences with our partner that’s really unique. But who’s to say you can’t build other experiences? 

Ultimately, however - and this is both what scares and amuses me - I believe love is just a product of statistical probability. It’s just a leap of faith we take and that uncertainty is what makes it exciting. It’s like a game of Deal or No Deal, except you already know what your initial case is worth, you choose to play the fool and stick with the other person no matter what (for the most part), and you know they’re doing it for you too. That mutual choice is what makes the experience worthwhile.

For clarity's sake, I don't want to leave my girlfriend. Sometimes, though, it can just be hard. While I can hold on to this idea, I can’t help but think there might be something else more motivating. 

So humor me, why do people love? Why do YOU love?

She’s been my online friend for like… wow, almost two years now. Longest standing friendship I’ve had. We did fall apart just cause of busy life on my end and personal shit I was working through. We’ve recently reconnected. 

I was feeling a bit down recently and she went out of her way to cheer me up/distract me and I actually felt a lot better after the end. Usually when I say I’m down, on the rare occasion, most people say “damn dude, sorry.” and do nothing about it. She actually took the time to make me feel better, which honestly, only one other person in my life has done and they were a past partner. 

I’m starting to find myself liking this person. I know I’m just a friend to her and I think recently I stepped even more into the friend territory…. Recently, she showed me some items she wanted to buy and a few of them were very intimate. I pointed out one or two after she said she wanted to appear a little more.. sexy basically (in this context I just assumed for her boyfriend).

The thing is, being a woman who games, she’s constantly being hit on and she showed me some dms from some people and I felt sorry for her. I know I’m seen as a safe haven and someone she loves spending time with( talking like 3-4hrs online most days, hanging out in a voice chat, and I make her laugh.. A LOT - half the time unintentionally)… but I’m frustrated that now I’m starting to have feelings for her and I don’t think there’s a way for me to bring it up without destroying what we have especially if I’m to take her at her word (which I’ve done) that she has a boyfriend still.

The reason why I’m finding myself doubting this statement, is cause she works when she’s not studying for University. Then the rest of her available time is often spent with me.

I've met this girl that I really like, she's super nice and we're getting along great! We've went on one date, it went like this.

Met up at a minigolf place, played some minigolf and had a few drinks. We then chatted alot during the date, on a personal level both about our past and what we want in the future. We had alot in common. We then rented a hotelroom and spent the night, no funky business, but we sat upp all night chatting in bed together. I tried offering her to cuddle, but she kindly told me she doesn't get physical on first dates. I said that was allright and it didn't get awkward. She sent me a message directly after the date and said it was unforgettable and one of the best nights she've had ever, and that she really wanted to meet again. She seems genuinely interested.

&amp;#x200B;

We then agreed on a second date, and are going to a cabin by the lake this weekend. We both have kids the same age and agreed on bringing them with us. (No babysitter avilable).

We've been chatting daily on snap during the week, with both of us using hearts and similar emojis. Now I just want to make sure I don't mess it up and becoming just friends instead. Any tips on what to do, or what not to do to make sure she understands that I'm interested in a romantic way? Also not sure if bringing our kids is a sign that it's directed more as a friendship, or that she likes me that much so she wants to introduce her kid this early on. I just want to make sure I don't ruin this and ruin our chances of becoming something more than friends.

I got zero matches when I had my prefence to women, but I changed it to men to see if I was truly ugly but to my surprise I actually got quite a few matches! I've also been approached many times by gay guys, been complimented on my body by men and solicited for sex by gay guys many times. Yet I've never even had a woman intiate conversation with me unless she was asking what I wanted to order. Never in my life have I met a woman who was interested in having a coffee with me. I've never made a female friend because in my experience women are very stoic and seem to want to be left alone. I have a plethora of Male friends because guys actually want to talk with me!

I've creeped women out before simply by meeting their eye and smiling at them. This whole notion about treating women just like they're people is flawed, because they do not behave like men. With men I have no fear of making them uncomfortable, but with women I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around them. Furthermore, its laughably easy to make Male friends. Just ask them what they thought of the football game last night, chat, ask them if they wanna hang out sometime, bang Male friend acquired.

Nowadays I don't even look at women out of fear of creeping them out. I really wish I was bisexual at the very least but even the thought of being with a guy makes me sick. Feels like fate is playing a cruel game with me.

I have been dating a guy for just over four months now. We are both over 30 and just after we met covid lockdown started so most of our dates have involved walks in the park. Before covid, we went dinners and managed to get away for a night. We have a strict lockdown so we haven't been able to meet each others friends or families  but where we are I am not sure if he is even ready for it.
My issue is, we meet each other once every week, even though we live 10 minutes away and he seems to be OK with it. Both of us still live with our families which is another issue but in our culture it is normal. I have mentioned it to him 2 months ago that it bothers me that we see each other once a week and he said we need to see each others more often but nothing has changed. He works nights sometimes which is fine but he had a week of and hasn't asked to see me once but mentioned that he met up with friends and slept a lot.
I have asked couple of times if he has told his friends (I know some of them and they know me but we are not friends just seen each other around) and he has never given me concrete answer. I think some of them know based on information he gives them when they call him but he never says he is out with me, gf or anything, just says he is out. 
He is a bad texter which is something I have raised with him so he now calls once or twice a week and we exchange texts here and there. 
We have chatted over fb but he hasn't added me as a friend and his status still says single. I never had a status on fb, mine is just empty.
He does tell me about his life and his family and his goals and asks me about mines but I feel like we are not involved in each other's life as much as we should be at this stage. 
We have discussed exclusivity and what our life together would look like and I feel like he is serious but he just seems a bit guarded about including me in his life and seeing me more. 
He was engaged about two years ago which broke off and he has admitted that it broke him but he is ready to move on. In my case I was also engage but mine broke off over five years ago.

We are finally supposed to see each other next month. Not only is this my first IRL date with this person, but first time ever going on a date with a woman.

I’ve been hearing about how awkward first dates can get real fast. Not to mention all those awkward first date fail videos on YouTube freaking me out despite the fact that we are super comfortable with eachother at this point.

I’ve been getting more nervous as the day is approaching. I definitely don’t want to mess this one up and make sure we have a good first date.
