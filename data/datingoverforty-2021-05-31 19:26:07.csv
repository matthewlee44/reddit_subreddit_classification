0,npj9j3,1622513455,Weed and relationships,"Is it possible to have a long term relationship with someone when you have completely opposite positions on recreational drugs?
Not looking for a debate about weed. 

I (F40) am completely against all drugs and alcohol, its never been a part of my life. My bf (M 42) has smoked weed since he was 16 and continues to do so regularly. We dont live together but I'm worried that when we do it will become a big issue. I don't want it around me or my children or in my house.

Its legal here btw...

1,nplrml,1622522079,When to get physical when starting to date a new person.,"Wondering when people have their first sexual encounter when dating. So far with me dating it's been anywhere from date 1 to date 3. I'm a woman. Is it still the somewhat old fashioned belief among men that being DTF means I'm not a good long term companion? It's just not that big a deal to me; even after physical (safe) playtime I'm still assessing our compatibility, values, lifestyles, and deciding on whether I will be investing in the relationship. Still wanting to text and talk and hang out etc. Not sure how to play the dating game. I have limited time as a parent and don't like the idea of waiting too long to find out if we click in all departments. I can tell it's turned some potential companions into just wanting to be physical only, rather than moving the relationship forward and that becomes disappointing, so looking for feedback or thoughts on this.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nplrml/when_to_get_physical_when_starting_to_date_a_new/

11,nprso5,1622547054,He Had A *Friend* Visiting,"Met a new man age 44 off the apps. We have had some  fun dates and we have had sex. We are not dating exclusively. I understand he is still exploring other connections. Last Tuesday he mentioned he had a friend visiting for the long weekend so he couldn‚Äôt see me. He normally mentions his friend‚Äôs names by name as in my boy Chaz, my friend Skip. Ok. So I assumed this was a woman friend. She arrived Fri and left Mon. We had plans for tonight Tues. But I knew we would have sex. Ok he sent me a text about the sex we would have. He has a one bedroom place- I know they probably stared a bed. Goodness we are adults- we all know they did more than share a bed. 


I am not upset but I feel like I just need more space than 24 hours between her being in his bed and me coming over. I wouldn‚Äôt have any problems seeing him next weekend (because time and space helps that sloppy seconds vibe go away) but he leaves out of town for two weeks this Thursday and then I‚Äôm on vacation for a week. So I felt like I needed a boundary here and simply suggested skipping our Tuesday rendezvous this week and said Let‚Äôs rally in a few weeks when we are both back in town. He said he understood- said yes he only has one bed and he and this friend will randomly stay with each other to visit over the past 5 years. 


So I feel good about my decision. My counselor and I are working on boundaries. Boundaries are put in place not to build walls but to keep my peace- to feel safe- and to respect myself. Before I would have accepted low level behavior and saw him to seek validation even if it made me feel bad about myself. I would have went to his bed wondering if he washed the sheets.

He said all the right things and got up inside my head.  Travel was no issue he said (I don't drive) and that he was going to do everything he could to have a relationship with me.  

We didn't go places due to restrictions so mostly came to my house.  Went for a walk once but it mostly felt like, sit in my house, drink beer and have sex (sex was mind blowing).  I thought we had a connection but obviously, I realise now that it was only just sex to him, nothing more.

In hindsight, I ignored red flags.  He never smiled (I put it to nerves) on our 1st and only video chat whilst I was beaming like a Cheshire cat.  But even meeting him, he barely smiled, so serious.  He also stated that he knew I came a deprived background (whilst he was right) it's a pretty s****y thing to say.  He made no effort to find out about myself or my life.   I had moved into my flat after nearly 3 years being homeless because my husband of 20y left me for someone else, AGAIN.  I threw all my life in the bin and have started from scratch.  He was very upfront on text but like a deer caught in the headlights f2f!  Was engaged more than twice and not married once.

If I'm really honest with myself, I have been on guard with him.  Didn't really feel like I could be myself after his deprived comment.   But it still hurts.  I know I will get better.  I'm giving myself some time to heal and I have learned a lot by this experience, including about myself.

1) STIs - I just got out of a long relationship and since I have been single I have not have sex but a little oral on me a few months ago &amp; then a few guys I made out with. My fear is herpes. I have never been tested for all I know I have it &amp; I am afraid to approach this with possible partners in the future because I am afraid they will not be truthful. I've noticed on reddit this has been brought up and that when someone is honest with someone they decline an intimate relationship and then go on to be with someone who is unaware or doesn't share ( like 80% don't even know they have it) 

 I know the best way once and for all is for me to get tested but the fear of that knowledge ( and I would share it) just drives me to deep despair because of the stigma. I just don't think mentally I would be able to handle it. 

2) Emotional closeness- I don't want to have sex with someone looking to use me. It is a very special act for me and I fear getting there and never hearing from them again.

Yet inevitably, when issues in our relationship arise, they are unable or unwilling to talk, often going silent for several days despite my attempts to reach out. It ends up causing strain and ultimately the end of the relationship.

I'm an introvert and rarely go out; my hobbies are things I can typically do at home (tinkering with computers, playing music, that sort of thing).  I also like photography sometimes, though that also doesn't usually lend itself to being around a lot of people.

Over the years, I never really thought of joining a group to go out and do things, and lately I feel like maybe I should have.  I feel a little awkward going out to do activities by myself, though I recently (in the past few weeks) went out to a trivia game and a bingo game alone.  I sat with some people at a table for the trivia game, which was fun.

We text back and forth most days. He seems intelligent, I find him attractive, he says he finds me attractive and intelligent. 

However, I keep getting these little cringey moments with some of his texts. He's been asking me to send him selfies, ""send me a pic of you right now"", type of requests. Sometimes I send one, other times I don't. When I do, he starts saying how he can't wait to kiss me and that he doesn't think he will be able to resist once we meet. He asks if I want to kiss him. My normal reply in my head is ""dude, I've never met you, how would I know the answer to that"", but I am more polite via text. There are other things he says, talking about how he can't wait for me to rest my head on his chest, etc.

Glass of wine turned into dinner (he asked). Hug and a tasteful kiss goodnight. Fellow church goer and a lot of great parallels. Attracted to one another also. He then was heading out of town with teen daughter to visit parents for first time since early last year. Totally understandable focus needs to be on that visit. We had a coffee phone date before he left and plans for Date #2 lunch on Monday after he returned. Sent a few brief texts to keep in touch while he was gone. Perfect. I always respond back happy to hear from him and looking forward to hear how his trip went, safe travels back etc. Met for 2nd lunch date. That was great conversation more in depth and we were also on the same page and sharing about things that were happy stories and laughing. Parted ways also with hug and kiss. He waved from his car happily as I passed him down the road to reach my turn. He was getting back into his work routine for end of month (finance). Understandable that is busy. Nothing rest of day then late yesterday a check in text. I was free later if he wanted to call. He said he had a migraine and would ""try"" then no reply to my sympathetic reply about his having a migraine. Now the next day, no call and no text. The ball was left in his court at that point. Yes, I could send a quick Hi how are you feeling? And I may do that and only leave it at that. However, this is overall ... 1) why I do not talk to one man at a time 2) why I no longer have guilt over going on 2 dates or so per week. 3) why I don't push the bear up the mountain (prefer traditional dating and men that subscribe to that dynamic). Rather than sharing this out of any level of irritation, moreso why the way I approach OLD dating works best for me. I'm warm, friendly, great conversation, appropriately affectionate, make sure they know that Im interested in continuing to hear from them and see them. I dont beat my head against the wall. A person saying they have a migraine after a second date could be sincere. It also could be the backburner if they are getting through other 2nd dates or spinning plates. While migraines can be debilitating, whether a man or a woman - you have ro use your best judgement and intuition as to whether people are creating excuses.

I say learn the person you are  dating, if they mention issues about commitment. Listen to understand.
If you use your good judgment, and not group them with past experiences, or listen to what has worked or has not worked for someone else. 
Not all are the same, timelines vary from person to person.

46,nrbe6u,1622720481,Ambivalent About Dating,"I'm not proud to admit that I don't really know how to date very well. In fact, I loathe the whole process!  I have a loooooooong history as a serial monogamist. I generally hit it off with someone, we have sex at some point &amp; then we're in a relationship.  Notably, most of my pairings have involved strong chemistry &amp; significant dysfunction.  I've dated a few cheaters &amp; my last major relationships were with a narcissist (6 years), an alcoholic (12 years), someone with significant mental illness (2 years).  I've been working on healing my codependent tendencies &amp; unhealthy relationship patterns.  

I got back on dating apps a couple of months ago to distract myself from the FWB because I was trying (again) to cut things off.  OLD is pretty dismal in your 40s.  I kept matching with guys in their early 30s (maybe I should adjust my filters) but I'm not really looking for a young guy for a summer fling, I want companionship.  Someone to go for walks, bike rides, to watch sunsets, watch movies, etc. 

I was just getting ready to delete my apps about 3 weeks ago when I stumbled upon a guy on Hinge who was very attractive to me &amp; only 4 years younger. He gave me his # the next day &amp; we started texting daily.  We've had a couple of phone calls, too.  Conversation flowed super easily &amp; the vibe was entirely different than the anxiety I felt with my FWB.  I told him I think he's my kind of weird :)  

We met up for a walk/lunch about a week into communicating.  I was nervous that I'd be blinded by chemistry (again)  While he's a good-looking guy, I wasn't blown away by physical attraction (thank god!).  But I liked his chill vibe &amp; openness.  We're much better aligned than the last guy.  My closest friend thought I wasn't interested because I wasn't talking about him incessantly after the first date. I'm usually ***super*** into someone right away or definitely not.  This is a grey area.  I definitely like him, but not because of chemistry, because I like him as a person. What a concept!  Honestly, what's most attractive is what a dedicated dad he is to his 12-year old daughter. He also told me early on  that he's not a fan of dating, either.  He just got out of a 2-year toxic relationship; it sounds parallel to my last experience, 

I'm trying to determine his interest level. He texts every day, but it seems to be less voluminous than before we met. He sends selfies pretty regularly; including some chest/torso shots of him in bed--but nothing inappropriate. He also sends me videos of him playing guitar &amp; piano, he's a really talented musician. But he hasn't suggested meeting up again.  So at the risk of sounding totally clueless, I'd like feedback from those who are less ambivalent daters.  Does he seem interested?  Should I just ask him out again--I was planning on it. I don't just want to text, I want to meet up &amp; get to know him better, even if he ends up being just a friend.

We‚Äôve been on vacations together, met each other‚Äôs families, and everyone involved knows we are together. I went to her son‚Äôs HS graduation with her and her other adult children last week. There is no doubt we are in a relationship. 

We live about 20 miles apart and it‚Äôs only about 10 minutes from where I work so it‚Äôs not particularly far. We both work really challenging hours so it is not unusual for us to have gone 2 or 3 weeks without physically seeing each other but we talk or text every day. We always have a great time together but I have a question. Every time we have seen each other for the last several months it is because I have made the effort to make that happen. I‚Äôve gone to her house, made plans, set up a date, etc. She has probably been to my house or driven to see me less than 5 times. The last time she has been to my house was in October and that was only because our flight got cancelled and we had to wait to leave again the next day and I live closer to the airport.

This man and I are both members of a Facebook music fans group. We live near each other, have a few Facebook friends in common, and ended up Friending each other. 
Recently in Facebook Events, I said I was interested in seeing a concert in the park nearby. This afternoon, this man messaged me and asked if I was going to that concert and wanted to meet there. 

After checking my calendar ‚Äî and wondering if this could be a meetup for locals in our Facebook group ‚Äî I messaged him back saying yes, I was going. 

And as I waited for a reply, then I thought, could this possibly be a date?!? After wondering if or when or how to finally start dating after over a year of isolation, could this be something?

He replied saying he was waiting to find out if one of his friends was going. And his wife wasn‚Äôt sure yet if she was going. 

So once again, someone seems interested in me then tells me he has a wife. People never seem to believe me when I tell them this happens nearly every single time a man approaches me. And no, I absolutely do not want to become involved with a married man. Or any man who almost immediately tells me he‚Äôs already involved with someone. Not that they ever do ask me out in the first place. 

We women often tell men about non-existent boyfriends or husbands when we want a man to leave us alone. But why have so many men done this to me since I was a college freshman? Am I giving off some sort of ‚Äúleave me alone‚Äù vibe? Are all of them really taken? Do I have the world‚Äôs weirdest worst luck? Does this happen to anyone else as often as it‚Äôs happened to me? I don‚Äôt understand it at all.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nrouqs/the_story_of_my_life_or_it_happened_yet_again/
68,nrpx7y,1622759594,He‚Äôs acting weirdly...üò≠,"Dear all, 
Please i need your advise.
I have been dating for 3 weeks a man that (for the first time in my life) seems very promising. We share the same culture, values, we have the same age and we want the same things for the future. Our communication was naturally since the first minutes we spoke, he‚Äôs affectionate and kind, calls me for hours, every day, we are attracted by each other but... yesterday he started to act weirdly.

First of all, on Monday he said that he was going to have a very busy week and the he was going to go ‚Äúoff‚Äù the phone.
I understood because I know his planning for this week and it‚Äôs truly crazy (he‚Äôs moving and he‚Äôs also very busy with job and kids).
BUT yesterday night he sent me a text on WhatsApp at 23:36 saying that he was going to sleep and that I would be the last person he was going to have in his mind before sleeping.
I felt happy. But at 00:10 I wanted to see again his last messages on WhatsApp and, when I checked, I saw him online.

So I sent him ‚ÄúI tough that you are sleeping and that I was the last in your mind before sleeping, I see that I‚Äôm not the only one‚Äù.
He answered ‚Äúpardon???‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt reply.
This morning he asked me what was happening and I explained him how I felt after having seen his actions not matching his words.
He said that I mustn‚Äôt jump on conclusions, that he‚Äôs not a liar, that he cares on our relationship and doesn‚Äôt want to spoil it with suspicions. That the fact that he was online didn‚Äôt mean he was talking to other women, that his mother had called him (at 00:10?) to tell him that he‚Äôs father, who‚Äôs suffering of Alzheimer, had left the house again (it‚Äôs a problem that I knew already).
He said ‚Äúnext time you have a doubt, instead of jumping in conclusions, please ask. I want that things works between us‚Äù. We agreed on this.

So this night he was supposed to pack his stuff with his daughter. At 23:14 I sent him a good night message and saw that he was online on WhatsApp. But since we had had that conversation, I was serene.
I checked my emails on my phone and at 23:25 (9 minutes later) I received a notification from Signal (the competitor of WhatsApp). I opened it and signal was announcing me that (him) had just joined Signal.

How can I avoid to jump on the conclusion that, for the second night in a row, I found him on WhatsApp late at night, the week where he is supposed to go ‚Äúoff‚Äù the phone as he‚Äôs so busy, and that he just installed signal in order to avoid that I see him online again on WhatsApp?
‚ÄúIn case of doubt, just  ask‚Äù he had said... so I went on WhatsApp and I asked him ‚Äúhave you joined signal?‚Äù His answer ‚Äúyes longtime ago‚Äù. To which I replied ‚ÄúI have just receive the notification‚Äù. 
At the same time he sent me a pic of his ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù with boxes, so I said good night.
He answered that he likes me a lot and wants that things works between us.
I didn‚Äôt replied.

What I am supposed to think? And to do? 
I really believed in him, he seemed so ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù. so ‚Äúhonest‚Äù compared to the men I‚Äôve met until now (in 2 years of OLD). Am I crazy or he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs hiding something?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nrpx7y/hes_acting_weirdly/

73,nrwf0q,1622780503,Building physical intimacy,"Is there any hope of building a physical connection if it's not there from the beginning?  

Here's the long explanation of why I'm asking:

About 6 months ago I met a very nice man my age via OLD. We went on 4 dates. Pros: We got along very well, had a lot to talk about, have compatible lifestyles and goals etc, and he was very kind, mature, and respectful. Con: I didn't feel a ""spark."" But I was willing to see if one could develop. 

We kissed a little on date 3, and did quite a lot of kissing/making out on date 4. It was just ok - not bad, but definitely not great. I felt like there just wasn't enough of a physical connection to continue seeing each other so a few days later, I told him that I felt like it wasn't the best match. I also said that I had decided I wanted to work on myself and focus on my daughter before continuing to date (which was true). 

Well, it turns out he works for the same organization that I do (different location but just down the street). About 2.5 months ago we ran into each other and reconnected as friends and have become pretty close. He is great about boundaries and was proactive about saying that he understood I only wanted a platonic relationship and that he was very happy to have me as a friend.  

Since we reconnected, we text literally every day and have also had the occasional phone call and in person visit. I actually like who he is as a person, which isn't easy to find these days. He treats me with respect; he has integrity. He's funny and thoughtful and generous. The more I get to know him, the more attractive he is. 

Most of the time, I think he's ""just a friend,"" but today I realized that I would be pretty disappointed if he started dating someone else. 

If kissing him 6 months ago didn't turn my crank, am I fooling myself thinking that is going to be any different now? In the past, a physical connection is something I've either had with someone or not - I've never been successful in forcing it. But I've also never really been motivated to work on it either. Now that I know what I want out of a partner and how hard it to find it at our age, the equation is different!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nrwf0q/building_physical_intimacy/
74,nrx0l0,1622782774,"Chatted with the Ex today, mulling over some of his perspectives- input welcome, esp from those who date single moms","Today I saw the ex (3.5 yr LTR), he came to get some things and also for us to chat.  Deciding if we can have a friendship-  No ill will at break up.

Among the many things we discussed, two things left me pondering and I'm struggling with his perspective versus mine. I'm trying to grow and learn from our relationship so I'm taking things in, curious what others think about these two aspects that contributed to our break up:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1- my parenting time w/my son.  I have a 7 yr old (ex has a 20 yr old son who lives far away in college).  When we started dating I had 50/50 custody and thus a decent amount of free time.  Last July I took on 85% custody, my son is only away alternating weekends and some holiday.  His dad is not interested in more time w/our son and moved 40-min away, so overnights on school nights are not feasible.    
My ex -bf was pretty great, IMO, of rolling with the change. Due to his flexible schedule (he has barely been employed since the pandemic started), he was coming  to my place a lot, and he knew my son   
 by then.  However, I feel it was more quantity time than quality time overall, including with my son.  He engaged with us but I wouldn't say he went out of his way to spend time building a strong relationship w/my son.  I did make arrangements a few times to have my parents watch my son (who live an hour away and my dad is disabled, being cared for by my mom so it's not easy) so ex and I could go on some extended camping trips, and my ex accompanied my son and I on a few trips. Not gonna like, his presence added some stress that would not have otherwise been there.

  
He said today that he felt that I made no effort to try and get less time w/my son so that he, as my partner, could have more of it.  I'd never thought about that.  I know it changed things for us, but I didn't know it upset him.  But I also feel like I didn't have many options. It's COVID times- not a lot of babysitter situations would work. I was already spending $950/month on care while I worked anyway, so not a lot of extra cash for extra child care.  All my friends who were in our ""bubble"" have their own kids and are overwhelmed so taking my son for a day or two is not a fair ask. Am I being selfish for not seeing his need for this?  Is it common for a single mom who is dating to look for ways to spend more time with SO and less time with kiddo?  I really like having this time w/my son and I think it could have been more fun for all of us if ex had tried a bit more, but maybe I'm off base? Plus, we had nowhere to go during lockdowns (I live in CA, lot of restrictions) to get a babysitter for anyway.

\#2 - one of the deciding factors for me in our break-up was a lack of words of affirmation.  He never said I love you to me, and always got defensive when we'd talk about it, saying that people lie about loving each other so it's stupid, only actions count.  But it wasn't just "" I love you"", it was positive words in general.  He was very lean on the compliments and heavy on the criticisms.  I'm big on words of affirmation (backed with action, duh). He told me that if I really cared, I'd accept him for who he is and leave it at that. My statement today was that if he really cared then the relationship would be not be 100% of how he needed it to be and 0% of what I needed, there is room for middle ground. Am I off about this?  I know in the end that out love languages are just really different anyway, but is meeting in the middle some kind of antiquated romantic notion I have?

I suppose I'm venting/asking all of this b/c I've only now dated 2 men in 19 years- one I married and was together for 15 yrs, and then my most recent ex. I'm feeling defeated and somewhat like I don't have my bearings. I didn't see the kid time issue, and I am wondering if I'm way off for wanting words of affirmation. I've forgotten what it feels like to have my partner just tell me something positive about me or that he appreciates me, and I don't want to live my life longing for that, but is that a silly, naive, ask?

I'm also discovering that I'd like to have a partner who also has kids in a similar age range, as it might help to have someone in the same life stage as me. My ex is 55 and pretty untethered.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nrx0l0/chatted_with_the_ex_today_mulling_over_some_of/

84,ns8sjy,1622823081,Mental illness or ghosting,"I started seeing a younger man (8 years younger) and, surprisingly, we really hit it off. We were going out every few days and really enjoying our time together. During our dates and some text messages he told me how overworked he was and how it was really negatively impacting his life. He was working at least 50 hours a week. Prior to this he was a primary caretaker of one of his parents during their chemo/radiation (during COVID) and he was also divorced a little over a year ago. I'm sure it's a lot to take in and I tried to be supportive of his stress. I shared my own story of difficulties this past year and after my divorce. After our 4th date we slept together which was surprising because I don't like moving that fast but I felt comfortable with him. Our next date he told me he didn't sleep with people that quickly but things were going well between us. Over the next few days everything was fine then he cancels our date that evening because he is working late. I was supportive and we planned to try and get together the next night. He canceled that one too and that's when I said it was okay but to let me know that if he wasn't feeling it anymore that'd I'd be okay with it. He told me he was but his work schedule was debilitating and causing him to be in a funk. I said I was glad we were on the same page and to get some rest. After that he seemed to keep retracting. His texts became less frequent. After I hadn't heard from him in a few days I sent him a text checking in asking how he was doing. He was traveling for work and just sent me his schedule. It was so off and cold. I told him that I was concerned about him and wanted to talk but if he just needed space he needed to tell me or if he just wanted to end things just let me know as I didn't want to stress him out. I also said that I'd like to continue seeing him as I'd been having a great time. A few days later he apologized and said he does this when he is stressed and wants to continue seeing me and needs to clear his head. We chatted a few times but didn't see each other. He went mute again shortly after and I reached out and told him I was concerned with how he was and I didn't deserve to be ignored. A bit about me, I was a social worker and had seen these situations end badly in the past. I didn't tell him but no communication is somewhat of a trigger for me. I haven't heard from him at all since then. After a week of no communication I decided to started a new OLD profile on a new site and saw that he was active on it too. The only text message I've sent to him recently was one checking in on him and still nothing. I've deleted his number but didn't unmatch from our OLD connection. I do have attachment anxiety and working on it along with trauma therapy. OLD has not helped with the anxiety at all. I was trying to be supportive and really felt we had the beginnings of something. Would someone go to these extremes (saying you're depressed, etc) to just not have to see someone again? I've been ghosted in the past but not anything like this. I am trying to be supportive and I think I did make it about me the one night where I said I didn't deserve to be ignored. I thought by reaching out and checking on him was the right thing to do but now I just feel like I bugged or ticked him off. It's hard to know what to do in the future or if he is going to come back since he said he wanted to continue to see me. He didn't explicitly say he wanted space but I should have taken clear my head to mean space. Any suggestions?

It‚Äôs usual for women these days so you just try to ignore it, laugh it off or say you have boyfriend, or if it‚Äôs come to the worst use the i‚Äôm married card. But never say you not interested it‚Äôs only fuel them. Anyway, I had bunch of old men giving me compliments and hinting on taking me out and this is absolutely sickening. I just laugh it off but in my head I just wanna cry. 
So, it‚Äôs my job to be mildly nice to customers, they don‚Äôt require us to be fake nice(so at times even with my mild niceness customers said that I‚Äôm the only nice employee there).
Yeah and for many customers (men)(I don‚Äôt wanna sound sexist, but it‚Äôs always them who do that) it indicates that I have a micro interest in them. Yeah it didn‚Äôt happened that much or that often. But I have plenty weird stories.  
Sorry for losing track. 
So this close to 60yr old man came at my register he saw me stretching my bag and said he had orthopedic office and can offer me free massage. I was like ‚Äúthe hell‚Äù in my head, I said I can pay for it with no issues. He look left and I just threw the card away. Couple weeks later he would just come at my register often and leave generous tips. I did not pay it any attention. Then he found me on Facebook (really scary when people do that) and at first I thought it was someone from my photography class(because it was picture of someone behind the camera) so I added and by the time I realized it was him i had no choice but to talk to him. But also it would allow me to avoid unnecessary interactions with him, by saying that I don‚Äôt work certain days even if I do. So I was trying to ignore messages from him, but he would come and ask why I don‚Äôt reply to him. I would just say I‚Äôm busy. He would come at my register and touch my hand I would just ignore it or pull away before he could do it. I told him couple times that I don‚Äôt like people touching me, he seems to play dumb. Was I unclear??. He offered to go out to restaurant, or buy me food to bring to my workplace or my apartment( hell to the no I got nosy ah neighbors), or to come to his house, or to go on vacation with him or to the house he brought in another state. All those times I said no. At some point he got mad and said something along the lines‚Äù you should say sure‚Äù or ‚Äúyes‚Äù). And after many times me saying no he just keeps asking like I‚Äôm going to ever change my mind. It‚Äôs getting annoying but I‚Äôm not gonna break. I just ignore it cuz what the actual hell. he wanted to buy me camera or bag or some gift. But I refused because I live with my parents even if I didn‚Äôt. It just smart to never take gifts from the people no matter how much they claim it‚Äôs from the good of their heart. I confronted him saying to stop trying to buy me off, but he declined saying it not why he doing it, something about just being friends. He kept saying how he just wanna be my friend (bunch of bologna ) and buy me gifts that my other friends can‚Äôt. So it was happening in the beginning of pandemic and I was stressed with classes and it all went online, working with customers got more challenging . And on top of that I got into car accident in the beginning of the year. So I was really stressed. I was getting mad at him and especially at myself because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle situation. So couple times he gave $100 for Christmas and new year, I did not wanted to take it but it was during my shift and I had no choice. (So now I‚Äôm thinking could I be put brought to court (people be crazy in this country) or require to give it back if I block him without explanation, since I don‚Äôt work there anymore so there won‚Äôt be any awkward interactions with him). And I told him nice card but no need for money he said something about being friends and all that bs. Also, one time when I was at the register and he came and afterwards he texted me on Facebook saying we almost kissed I was like the fuc I just leaned closer cuz I couldn‚Äôt hear what he was saying since everyone wears mask and it‚Äôs hard to hear people. even thinking about it makes me vomit. 
So how do I proceed with this ? Block him? Or tell him beforehand not to try and get any information from my previous employer and if he attempts I will get authorities involved ( just bluff him) I don‚Äôt wanna get police involved unless he will start stalking me or threatening.  Maybe I missed some details but I can‚Äôt type much since I got into roller skating accident a week ago and broke my arm.

92,nsh9to,1622845733,Lost my last chance at love,"My brother took his own life 6 months ago. Then my mum almost died of cancer and also her mental state was affected and she turned in me in a very abusive way. 

She‚Äôs doing better now but is still terminal. In this time I got close to someone from work who I‚Äôve known for about 4 years.

We have had a tumultuous ride . We fall out a lot over silly miscommunications but we got over some big hurdles and it made us so much closer over the last couple weeks . We had so much hope. It was beautiful . I haven‚Äôt felt like that in years. I hadn‚Äôt felt anything . 

I really like her and we both feel an intense connection . On the phone for hours and hours everyday etc. I just turned 40 and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm having a teenage romance in some ways . She is 29. I feel like I could really fall for her (I may have already ). 

But last night we had such a horrible argument and she basically kicked me out of her flat . I got angry and defensive because she like to take the piss out of me all the time time as ‚Äúbanter‚Äù and I just don‚Äôt have the mental strength for it . 

My grief has made me very sensitive , I can‚Äôt take much judgment . But she constantly ribs me and I usually laugh it off but it builds up and I get stressed out at her . 

In return I give her constant compliments. She is insecure and also has a big ego so she‚Äôs always praising herself anyway. 

I have told her about 2/3 times that I am very sensitive at the moment due to my grief . It doesn‚Äôt seem to sink in. 

She didn‚Äôt react well to me telling her last night to stop it. She was very cold and at the time I was my most vulnerable in front of her , basically asking her to stop, she made me feel like total crap. 

Ever since I have had such bad anxiety . I do every time we argue . I don‚Äôt think she will be willing to repair it this time. And I know I shouldn‚Äôt either but I do like her so much and also I‚Äôm obviously a desperate loser . 

To her credit she did try to address my issues . But I was so overwhelmed by my emotions last nite I couldn‚Äôt think straight . I just felt so weak and exposed and I needed kindness and sensitivity and I didn‚Äôt get it . 

She did say she didn‚Äôt realise , and so on and how she can‚Äôt do anything about my grief but wished it hadn‚Äôt happened to me. 

Her words were ok it was just her tone didn‚Äôt sit well with me . It was not kind. 

Is it even possible to pursue a relationship at this time . Have any of you managed it . Everyone tells me I need to be on my own right now but that‚Äôs alright for them . I‚Äôm the one struggling every day on my own . She brought me some much needed happiness in an otherwise desperately empty life . Should I just apologise to her and say I over reacted and hope for the best ?

Just wondered what you thought , thanks for reading , I‚Äôm very low.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nsh9to/lost_my_last_chance_at_love/

Same age. 
Both had military ties. 
Both attend church regularly. 
Both of same culture. 
Both transplants to the area. 
Both hail from same state originally. 
And more.. 

All wonderful so far, right?!

It's going well and he offers his phone number, if I'd like to share mine. Before I ever exchange numbers. I always say something along lines of 'hey, I regularly update my profile. If you dont mind, take another look at it, to be sure it makes sense for us to move to connecting by phone.' (Only logical as I have a paragraph with a positive spin of what I'm looking for) this script serves me well as some men write back super excited. Or....

Well, I did not even mention politics but I guess he read an answer on one of the filter questions and went the heck off on an unnecessary tangent not even knowing if I was for or opposed to certain things. üòÇIt was ridiculously lengthy and I just parted ways with a Ok. Roger That. Best of luck. 

And without giving out my phone number. 

A lesson in why we all at ages 40+ should bravely complete our profiles and filtered questions on OLD. Don't worry if it repels some people. Lol",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nsmg2f/and_this_is_why_we_complete_our_profiles_a_tale/
