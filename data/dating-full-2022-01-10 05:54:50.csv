I have only had a tiny handful of serious relationships in my life. Whenever those ended, I flatly refused to even consider getting involved with someone else until I had taken some time, at least several months, worked through my feelings and moved past it - because I knew that if I did not, I would just end up making things worse for myself, while also hurting someone else in the process.

*If you're still not over your ex, then you're not ready to even be thinking about being with someone else*.

It's not going to help one heal in any way. Quite the opposite...

How do people fail to realize how horribly unfair it is? You're literally only setting two people up for even more heartbreak...

I ended up blacking out drunk that night, so I don't remember much of anything. The only reason I know is because one of our other friends recorded everything. When I left, Jim told everyone that he thought I was cute and wanted to hook up with me. John got upset and told him that he liked me.

The next day, everyone told me what John said. I was really excited, so I pulled John to the side and asked if he liked me. Turns out, he actually had a girlfriend the entire time, and he denied ever saying that he liked me. A girlfriend he never mentioned. Jim and everyone else didn't even know he had a girlfriend. They were shocked. Later on that day, I was embarrassed about asking John, and that they knew I was so forward with John. I was being very quiet. I was hanging out with Jim and them and he asked me why I'm so quiet. I told him, and then he asked me what I liked to do.

After the vacation ended, I requested John on instagram. I figured that we could at least be social media friends. After all, we live in different countries. And, if he truly didn't like me, nor say anything about me, there really wouldn't be an issue, and my question would just be a misunderstanding. After two weeks, he rejected the request. I got upset and I blocked him. The next day, Jim messaged me asking me if I was alright. He didn't mention John, but his question was a bit out of the blue.

I feel bad, because knowing that he was flirting with me the night I met him, and then put all my eggs in one basket for John, I indirectly made Jim second choice. It's just because I already knew and had a crush on John by the time I hung out with Jim. Now, I feel like my chances are ruined with him.

second time: she went to party with her girl friend, and we both went to the same place LKF( well known place for clubbing in Hong Kong) i met her after the party, we went for kebad, but i still didnt do anything.

anyway fast forward to 

third time( i showed her some games i play on switch) and she seems interested and ask me can she come over to my place and we both agree to meet up friday night after i finish work. on my way to where i live we were taking a bus, she told me she was sleepy and during the traffic jam she was laying on my shoulder (first hint i guess but i thought it was becasue she is a touchy person she touched my head quite a lot of time). when we got home after had takeaway, we went to my bedroom to play games she jump straight to my bed without hesitation, we played mhr on switch for an hour and she fell in sleep for an hour, then i just man up and asked her does she wanna cuddle and sleep together and she said she doesnt mind (maybe second hint), then we cuddled and slept for a bit and she took of her shirt only the bra left told me that she felt way too warm, then i told her i couldnt sleep becasue imagine as a straight man a girl who sleep next to you only wearing a bra, can you sleep well, for me no!!!. and i tried to escalate things up like asked her for a kiss but she said it in a cheeky way and then i kiss her neck and ear and she seems enjoying so much, then i asked her to take off her bra and she said ok and i sucked ber nipples and slowly moving my hand down there, she keep moaning, as i fingering her we were doing all those things around 4am till 5am saturday morning , we didnt have full sex intercourse but i did enjoy those foreplays, as she awake  i did fingering her once again and this time she actually achieve orgasm. (third hint) i saw the contact list on her phone my name has a heart emoji next to it and we were holding hand while on our way to where she lives.

overall  it was amazing but i still want some advices  do you think she likes me and want me as a potential long term partner or not. becasue i told her i am still living with my parents and the place where i live is not that spacious, but she doesnt seem like bothering about it at all. thankyou for all the poeple who managed to read the whole post in advance",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1151069,public,nsfw,First time brought a girl to home (still living with my parents tho),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0e760/first_time_brought_a_girl_to_home_still_living/,no_ads,0.0,,,

So I had my first sexual encounter with one Tinder guy and we’ve met a few times, but I’m still not sure if I like the sex or not. Our arrangement is quite clearly for the sake of sex and intimacy, he definitely sleeps around and isn’t looking for a relationship.

Like it’s fine at some points, but tbh I can’t enjoy it fully as there are some things that mismatch. 

He’s not very honest or open about how often (or does he even) gets tested and I know that he sleeps around.

I also feel like the sexual energy/chemistry between us is lacking for some reason. He’s very hot, but he just doesn’t get me aroused that well and I feel like foreplay is often for him - we just make out, I try to sit on his lap and grind on him and such, but he doesn’t grind back or tease me back in any ways, just basically kisses me or my neck. 

During sex he doesn’t talk at all or dirty talk, which I find boring. For instance, when I was teasing him by sitting naked on his lap while he still had pants on and thus teased him, the only thing that came out of his mouth was “Will I get a blowjob now?” 

Like idk but it feels way too transactional/boring for me. I did get wet but he didn’t make me horny, if I had to word it out.

Afterwards we talked about kinks and I wanted to see if he’s into something rougher (because the sex is very vanilla, no dirty talk, no any roughness, he just penetrates basically and changes positions every now and then, and that’s it). I’d like to try choking, degrading or praising me or something like that, so I mentioned handcuffs to him and joked about us roleplaying. He laughed it off but later said seriously that he’s “absolutely never doing handcuffs or role plays”

What’re everyone’s thoughts on this?

Fast forward to now, I’m not a bad guy, but all of my nice guy tendencies are completely gone, I have a totally different mindset with dating and boy, this escalated quickly. I recently met a girl through my friend, he introduced us to each other right before thanksgiving. She said I was cute, I’m 28, 5’5 Black male.  She’s Black and Puerto Rican, and she’s about 5’9 to 5’10. She said she doesn’t date short guys but she thought I was cute. We hit it off, had sex.

This past weekend we were all at the club, and while they are drinking and turning up, I was chilling, not doing much just watching them. She sat down bedside me and said she had something to tell me, I asked what, and she said she’s falling in love with me, that there’s something about me that’s making her feel that way and she hates it because she’s used to having her way with men. She said she thought she would get a few sex session out of me and send me on my way but her plan backfired. Meanwhile in my head I’m like falling in love with me?

**Pros:**

\- Somewhat smart and have a high paying job in Software/Tech.

\- Parents are wealthy from a large real estate portfolio, so I've never had to worry about money but I don't really like to flaunt it nor do I want someone to know I have wealthy parents unless its a serious relationship. 

\- Pretty fit from going to gym, I cancel and rejoin often but it's still kept me fit over the years. Also not too ugly, pretty average looking and well groomed / well dressed.

**Cons:** 

\- No active social life. Literally only have 3 friends since High School and 2 of them are in serious relationships and 1 moved to a different city. They barely have an active social life as well, they just spend time with their SO, go to work and then play video games whenever they can. Also ive had to work from home since COVID. 

\- Always the shortest dude wherever I go.  I'm 1.65cm (5'5) in height. Personally I would be happy with a shorter girl, but it does severely limit my dating options.. 

\- No experience with a girlfriend. Virgin &amp; Never kissed a girl. I went to an All boys Private High school, then studied CompSci in Uni which is like 95% male enrolment and then have since worked in Tech Firms where all my colleagues have been male. Basically never seen any women in my teen &amp; adult life.

I think the biggest problem is meeting woman, but with my situation it's almost impossible. I have profiles on online dating and do get matches every now and then but the best I will get is a 'Hey' ands that's about as far it gets. I have no clue what to do. Feels like nobody knows I exists.

We were living together in his home town.
I realised I just couldn’t do it anymore, told him I was done and packed my things and left. I simply ghosted him for weeks. I received constant messages from him saying he would stop drinking, etc. he even sent messages to my family members. 
I was so cold and didn’t even give him the time of day even though he was a big part of my life. We just weren’t going in the same direction, we couldn’t communicate and drugs + alcohol took over our relationship.
I had never touched weed prior to meeting him but through our relationship I became severely addicted to it, morning and night. I’ve now been clean for almost 1.5 years. 

We did start talking about 3 months after we broke up and caught up here and there. We started sleeping together and then I found out he was sleeping with another girl, in the same unwashed bed sheets in-between the times I was going to his FAMILY house.

She never messaged me. Also, I got ghosted by another girl. Not gonna lie, it kinda hurts and I kinda just wanna wallow in self-pity. Luckily, I have this tiny thread of hope that keeps me going. I like to think I'm a decent person and I'm always open to meeting new people, so it's only a matter of time.

I started talking to this girl at work. She was looking at me a lot, so I thought why not. I was totally surprised when she started asking me questions about myself. I was like, ""What the fuck? This never happens."" Usually, I'm the one asking all the questions. She seems very nice and genuine and I enjoy talking to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19 by the way. Never dated and I've only just started to not hate myself. I'm surprisingly optimistic about the new year. I want to study and go out and meet people.

Then during university, my priority was studying and taking care of my 14 y.o. sister, I did the same two jobs and worked a lot of hours to support her, during this time I never dated at all simply because I was far too busy since I was my sister's only breadwinner. My father was a drunken loser who only came by to collect the support checks from us, and he said If I didn't give them to him he would kill me so I didn't really have any other options.

Anyways, now I'm 24, and I just finished my nursing degree, and I've gotten a graduate role, since I did nursing/midwifery I registered as both, and I'm doing a dual grad year thing where I can work in both fields. Anyways, my sister recently turned 17, and she said she wanted to join the army, I asked her if that was really what she wanted, and she's told me I've looked after her long enough, and she wants to make her own way in the world. I had to sign her permission form since she's under 18, and I saw her head out to her recruit training, I realize now I'm pretty free to do whatever I want because I only have to feed myself now.

I've been on a few dates, and most girls ghost when they find out about my lack of dating experience, I dread the past dating history question. I feel like I've missed the boat and that It's too late for me, I don't think I'm a boring person, I've recently discovered that I'm into karate, boxing, history, and dancing.

He is 6 hours away from me but we have been seeing each other monthly. 

He texts me good morning first thing every morning and we text throughout the day. When he doesn't get a respond in our convo sometimes he would double/ triple text me (but not forceful). He is also a man of his word - he never said something and not do it, even it is something very small.

I would say we are progressing everyday / every time we see each other and he has been consistent. We have had sex, spent the Christmas and NYE away, holding hands, intense eye contact etc. He has done many other things that have showed me he cares and is putting in the effort. We have also said 'I like you' to each other (very sincerely). He is always excited to make our future travel plans (like a few months away).

We had our talk the other night when he came see me and he said he ''wants to take things slow and get to know me more'' as we only met a few times. He said he ''doesn't want to get hurt as relationship can be very painful''. He basically said relationship should happen naturally and we are 'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS' right now (and can be exclusive with this) but he also doesn't mind if I have sex with other people. When asked if he sees himself potentially dating me, he said he can't say anything as he wants to be 100% sure if he is going to say that. The other day however he was crying to me as he said the thought of losing me in his life is very painful.

What does this sound like to you? My friend who knows the whole story saw our conversation thinks he is 'really into' me and just taking his time to let things develop. I can also see us progressing gradually.

The other me on the other hand thinks he is ACTUALLY just seeing me as a FRIEND the fact he said we are FWB and could not even answer if he sees himself potentially dating me. I am just really confused as we are doing things what couples do and he has been putting a lot of effort in this 'relationship'. Could he really just be taking his time to let things develop? Or is this a dead end?

I know he texts many other girls and I am in general not happy in the situation. I want to just let things go. I am very insecure and I am not even sure if I am self-sabotaging by overthinking.

a) do nothin now and wait for her return and then ask her when I see her?
b) shoot her a message on Instagram to say good luck on her trip and to say we should catch up when she’s back?

I haven't spoken to anyone else because its just hard to explain the situation and for others to understand. I started posting on reddit a few months ago and I made a friend in the same community. It wasn't anything more in my head but just someone to talk to about a topic I couldn't with my irl friends. Moreover, they could answer my questions and I had received some bad news so it felt like an escape.

Except it changed. Slowly a couple conversations every week became every day and then all through out the day. Then it moved to instagram and then face timing. Now believe me when I say that this messaging wasn't just back and forth I'm talking voice messages and texts over 100 times in an hour - and it was balanced. At no point did things feel unnatural or out of balance. I don't wanna bore with details but eventually we confessed feelings and then it became more. after 2.5 months of this consistently we had begun watching shows and calling for 6+ hours. I know it sounds so teenage first love but I promise it was just a very natural conversation. We have so much in common and just were happy. Except we live on completely opposite sides of the planet.

We talked about meeting but with corona its more likely 6 months to a year away. Now three weeks ago we did but didn't say 'i love you' because we haven't met. We aren't a couple. Yet we were? This week a lot happened. Communication had issues and my mental health for other reasons began overthinking. Meanwhile he had his personal life become a lot and didn't tell me because I was already emotional. The last two days were intense but not in the screaming 'omg you don't get it' type way just more I want to help you but I can't even hug you. We had an emotional conversation and it basically boiled down to us finally saying 'I love you' but then him saying 'I don't think I can do this'.

Maybe its because it's so new but usually in a break up I get it. Logically I understand this pain because when you love someone and cant even touch them it hurts. Yet, I just don't feel like this is right? I just can't believe out of all the dumb luck how this person just came to be in my life and now I'm supposed to move on.

This is the number one reason why you aren't getting laid...

**You aren't social enough**.

That's it.

That's what it all boils down to in the end.

If I asked you how many new women you meet on a regular basis every week, you might give me a single-digit answer (if any women at all).

And if over the next 30 days you:

* Got **dafuq** off of Reddit/YouTube etc
* Stopped playing video games
* Got out of the house every day and spoke to new people
* Said yes to every social invitation you received

Your results with women would improve.

You would get more socially confident/charismatic through sheer practice alone.

You would increase the ""new women number"" tenfold (&amp; you would get women hitting on YOU).

Your whole lifestyle would shift and you would be getting laid regularly as a bi-product.

But if most people were honest with themselves, they would admit that this life shift is **scary as fuck.**

It's easier to peddle some excuse, be a victim and sit in your room saying...

*""Women just want the tallest dudes.""*

*""Women don't like me because I'm not white""*

*""Money &amp; looks are all that matters.""*

*""Dating sucks these days (and that's why I'm single despite not leaving my house in weeks)""*

All of this is bullshit serves the sole intention of avoiding the emotional pain involved in the journey of becoming a genuinely attractive man.

And until you get the hell out there and meet new people (not just women) - you will avoid the journey and stay hopelessly stuck exactly where you are.

Remember this, **women are moved by men who move the world**.

That's a man who is capable of influencing the world around him.

And you can't become a man like that that while you're stuck in your room.

So I challenge you to get out of the house this week for a whole day.

If you did that every week, things would start to shift.

Good luck brothers.

Hope this helps.

So this girl who went to my school last year, but we never really spoke to each other until we vibed with each other in a post graduation party a bit, invited to me to a pub crawl with two mutual friends of ours.

We both got completely hammered, laughed a lot and shared some past relationship trauma with each other, and then while I was waiting for an Uber to go home with her after the others had left, I kinda asked her out and she kinda said yes. 

I’m honestly not sure how to feel about this. Like we get along ok and she’s kinda cute, but I’m not sure if I actually want to date someone again after a really shitty breakup I went through last year (Long story), and I also dont know how I’m going to feel about this once my hangover headache clears up and I don’t know how she’s going to feel about it once she sobers up

Like I’m interested in giving it a try just to see how it goes, but I’m really not sure if I’m ready for a relationship again after what happened with my ex (Who I was really in love with and not completely over). What do you guys recommend?

Heartbreak doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t ask if you dated and for how long. Heartbreak doesn’t care for labels. It doesn’t feel any less real just because they weren’t your boyfriend or girlfriend. Sometimes it hurts, even more, getting over someone you were never with solely because there’s that what if factor that plays into it.

When relationships have labels you’re either together or you’re not. You’re either single or with them. But when you’re emotionally invested in someone who won’t commit to you or give you what you need you constantly seek validation through lines that are blurry and rewritten time and time again.

You hold onto hope that one day it will be something.

But then you get hit with a cold reality that this thing you are so emotionally invested in has come to a dead end.

The hard part about endings is when there wasn’t a beginning to compare it to. Suddenly you were just emotionally invested in this person with no going back.

Then it’s over and you’re just expected to be okay.

You’re left having to mourn a relationship that wasn’t actually one but you loved them like it was real. Feelings are real and you don’t need a label to justify that.

Don’t let someone make you feel guilty for this heartbreak. Sometimes we love people we didn’t date deeper than anyone we did.

It’s not a breakup but it feels like one. You aren’t sleeping at night. You find yourself crying at three am. You wake up tired looking at your phone remembering when they used to be that text or notification you woke up to. Now your phone it a little more silent. You miss them but you also miss the possibility and belief that this could have been something. The pain is a little deeper but you can’t express these things publicly.

You can’t break down becauseif you do people will try and justify this reaction and say something like, “well you didn’t even date?”

You don’t have to date people to fall in love with them. And you don’t have to date people to get hurt by them. When your heart is invested in someone the pain feels exactly the same.

But the hardest part is trying to move on when they don’t realize you are hurting. When they don’t even realize how much of an emotional toll you took on them.

So you answer their texts. You try and be strong. You pretend that you accept the circumstances and you guys can be friendly and cordial.

But it’s destroying you every time they reach out because seeing them is this reminder of what you’ll never be. And you’re losing sleep over someone who is probably sleeping with someone else.

I know how much it hurts. I know what it’s like to replay everything in the past wondering what signs you read wrong. I know what it’s like to spend time with someone that you might not even have had a physical relationship with but emotionally it couldn’t have just been you that felt it.

And I know what it’s like to not be able to clearly articulate this pain that consumes you. You got your heart broken by someone who should be easy to get over. But when you love someone and you really wanted to be something more the pain you feel is something that will take time to get over. And that’s okay. But what isn’t okay is you trying to be strong by keeping them in your life.

Maybe they notice as you pull away. Maybe they realize you aren’t talking as much. Maybe they call you out on it wondering if something is wrong.

And part of you wants to scream yes. I’m hurt. I feel completely broken. You destroyed me. But you stay silent because something about mourning an ending when there wasn’t actually a beginning makes you look like a fool. But it’s not all on you. This person led you to believe something was there. Had they been completely honest from the start you wouldn’t have fallen so fast but they didn’t. Instead, they knew how you felt maybe they added fuel to the fire. Maybe there was a physical relationship there without a label. Maybe they told you everything you wanted to hear to keep you around because your presence boosted their ego.

Regardless of how it applies to you and your situation, someone let you fall for them when they had no intention of catching you. So don’t feel guilty for these pain you feel you have to repress just because there wasn’t some label attached to it.

Cry as hard as you need to. Feel things as deeply as you do. Pull away without an explanation because you don’t deserve this pain and they don’t deserve you.

But be sure that when you do heal and your tears dry you never allow them to make you feel this way again.

Because just as you deserved a relationship in all this, you also deserve time to heal even if they weren’t yours completely.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1151169,public,self,The Honest Truth about Heartbreak and being Lead on.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0mdtw/the_honest_truth_about_heartbreak_and_being_lead/,no_ads,0.0,,,

For the past year I have only been on one date. It went well in my opinion but he didn’t show me he wanted to take it further.

It doesn’t feel like I’m doing anything necessarily wrong but I keep telling men “sorry I don’t think we’re compatible”, “I think it’s best if we both move on” (I say this when they apologise and attempt to minimise what happened) or if it’s within the first 2days just blocking them and being over with it.

Anyway it’s happened again. I started talking to a guy literally less than 24hrs ago. The conversation flowed but he seemed a bit standoffish. 

Of course I gave him the benefit of doubt but the longer it went on the less of a spark I was feeling. There was no energy from him, I was trying to impress him (I mean I was interested enough to keep responding) and he was trying to play it call and look like the “cool, blunt guy”.

Anyway he asked me what I was looking for and I said “I’m pretty open to having a connect naturally with someone” “are you looking for similar or…lol” I sent this at 6:45pmish after work. He ignore me until 11am and said “so when are you free”.

And that’s terrifying to think about because I am a naturally hypersensitive person and the last guy I experienced limerence with led me into a incredibly deep depression when it didn’t work out. I spent sleepless nights crying about him and I even contemplated suicide. That happened in 2020 and I am just now coming to grips with it. And I wasn’t even in a relationship with this guy. This was simply a good friend who didn’t return my affections.

And now I am imagining me being in a 4-5 year relationship with a guy who I really do love. Someone who I can’t imagine my life without.

Let me introduce my  background first. I've been pretty successful with girls since I'm 20 yo, had a lot of adventures, and also a relationship (about 3 years). Let say that being good looking and having good intellectual qualities helped, but I also really pushed myself to go towards girls whenever the occasion arrised (bar, club, street, beach, etc) for the past 8 years.   


About 5 months ago, I hit on a girl in the street and directly picked up a girl as she was walking, in a pretty smooth fashion. I could tell she was pleased about the approach, and gave me her number. We then met for a drink a week later, she told me her age and I thought that we might be at different phases of our lives. I still gave it a chance and met her a second time at my place (as it was raining) and noticed that she was particularly smart, sweet, elegant, sharing the same interests than me, had the same vision of life, and on top of that, damn hot. I understood that she was not really into casual dating (only had one or two serious relationships before), but I kissed her and we spent the evening in each other arms, learning a bit more about the other.   


The next day, I was quite excited about this evening, and much more than after ONS with girls I had met in the past months. But three days later, as I was asking her out again, she told me that she preferred to be friends with me, as she was not feeling ready for anything beyond, and asked if I was okay with that. I was quite surprised but told her that there was no problem and I would like to keep meeting her anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then we both went to holidays, I forgot her a bit as I met some girls in the meantime, we were texting a few times, but I could tell she still wanted to see me. So back in September, we kept going for walks, having some drinks, watching movies, or playing music together once in a while. I sometimes tried again to kiss her, but she was leaning back each time, telling me that she preferred to be friends, that she wanted to be on her own atm etc. However, me and some other friends could tell she was interested by the way she was behaving around me. I thus met her once before Christmas, and it was definitely a date, with restaurant and then at my place. I told her everything about how I was feeling about her, I went all out. And still, even though staying close to me, being triggered, she kept boundaries and repelled the offer. I decided to move on and stopped texting her for a while. But then, since the new year, she turns out to be initiative, wants to meet me more often, and I can tell we're not really friends anymore. Last night, she stayed until late, after having spent the night with me, talking about us, staring at each other, cuddling, etc.   


And here I am, now, thinking about her madly, dreaming of kissing her or sleeping with her, even though I could meet other girls easily that definitely want these things with me. This girl is gold to me and I want to stick to her, I know that this is going somewhere, and even though it takes so much time, that nothing is happening yet, every second I spend with her is amazing. I don't know if she's testing my patience, of she's playing a game, or being over cautious, but in any case, it's working. I'm definitely into her now, as we start to know each other more.

What do you guys think, should I just keep seeing her, and keep building the connection, without making any further move, and let her come to me? Or do you think it's not worth it after so much time, and that it might never happen?

We sat beside each other and ended up chatting since it was a pretty long commute. Surprisingly we had a lot of things in common and had a great time talking for over an hour.

As we were leaving the station, I asked for her number and told her we should go ice skating at some point. (she mentioned she always wanted to get better in our conversation). She said ""sounds good!"" and gave her number to me. 

When I got home we chatted for a little bit over text, and she said she would be down to go sometime next week because her friend has her skates, and won't get it back til then. 

We left the conversation at that on Monday, since I didn't really want to build a relationship over texting, and we already had kind of a date set up like 7-10 days out. 

I didn't text her until Friday, when I was out with some friends and decided to shoot her a text asking if she was free to grab a drink. All I said was ""hey you free to grab a drink tonight?""

Unfortunately, she read the text a little more than a day after, and still hasn't messaged me back yet.

I know that it should be a dealbreaker but believe me when i say that things were great between us before he started that job. The last time i saw him he was confessing his feelings for me. 

I believe him when he says that was why. He started to not reply to my text messages ( i was putting a bit of pressure in him in these messages, i would ask him if he would reach out when his mind and life cools down) so i stopped and didn’t text him for a month. he didn’t reach out during that time. Basically he was just to busy to be dating me because i was too needy.

I texted him on new years and said “i hope everything is going well and i’m wishing you the best” and he replied “same for you (nickname he gave me), happy new year, un abrazo (a hug) ❤️” and i just liked the message. Then I asked him how he was doing and he said “quite busy but okay, you?” Is he just responding to me out of pity or because he cares? What should i say?

My intentions are that I do want him back (i’m not going to put my life on hold for him) but i know he’s not capable right now.

We've had some phone calls and texting here and there, nothing consistent tho

Last Friday he sent me a text confessing his feelings for me, which threw me off a bit because it was unexpected. Shortly after we were having a phone call discussing the situation

In a nutshell the call consisted of him telling how nervous he was sending the first text, what our views about dating is and what would be the realistic approach in our case. Also mentions about if we are even compatible, and our current life situations

*He lives in one city, i kinda live in the another. I travel weekly 2h by train (one way) to go to a dorm but i still have to travel back to spend weekends at home*

He straight up asked if i like him, and i said no, i haven't thought about him in that way. We're going to have face-to-face discussion about our situation and talk things through (even more). I haven't been in a situation where i have to reject someone, so i'm worried about the slightest possibility of him thinking i'm leading him on in the future, which brings me to my next problem

Even though i haven't thought about dating him or even going on dates with him, the idea of fwb has crossed my mind a few times (starting before his confession)

Normally i would never bring this up to him, but because we are going to have a honest conversation (around this Thursday or Friday) and just share our thoughts and feelings about each other, I've been on the fence about it

On one hand i would feel relieved to tell him about it, but would it be cruel for him?

We both are fairly inexperienced on dating and things regarding it, but I've had a few experiences with crush/almost-dating situations in the past (in the emotional aspect tho). And by what i understood, he has not had that

Regardless he would want to take things slow (same with me) and build a good foundation, which i appreciate. I still think we are too different and don't really have much in common to date in the future

*We are only friends because of our mutual friend, who always like to invite new people over, in this case the new person was me. I continue to hang out with the group every now and then, because the hangouts are so far from each one (i'd say around a few weeks). If i would go to the same school, i would not be the type of person to hang out with them daily*

Both of us are still in our late teens, him being a year younger than me

\-

Basically the things that i mostly keep thinking are, how am i going to tell him that i'm not open to a relationship, how to prepare for our talk and is this even an okay approach? Overall any outsider comments would be appreciated, I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts about this

 It honestly blows my mind how there are a ton of filters when you want to buy a frickin book online, but there’s seemingly no dating app that lets you do the same with people. No, I don’t want a smoker and no, I really don’t want kids. The same way they don’t want me because I don’t want kids, and they also don’t want to waste time on swiping left. 

Does anyone know of an app that lets you do this? Thanks.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1151210,public,self,Looking for a dating app/platform with filters,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0qd38/looking_for_a_dating_appplatform_with_filters/,,,,,

I’m f19, consider myself as quite attractive (I have my own style), I’m quite “mature” for my age, have a large friend group and social life and still, I’m confident and still, it doesn’t seem to work out with guys.

I mean I don’t really have a problem with that, sometimes It’s just a bit hard to see Friends of mine in happy relationships..

That’s it. 

If I think back, I always had crushes, but kinda on the wrong guys. 

At 16, I had I huuuuge crush on my teacher, Back then I really thought I’d love him. Now, 4 years later, I know it wasn’t that deep/real. (Although, after our graduation last year he confessed that he if I was 10 years older and he 10 younger, it probably would’ve fit)

Then, I was “in love” with a classmate my age, he never felt the same - I was totally heartbroken. Whatever. 

Then, last summer, I spent 2 months abroad and met another guy. It was amazing, the first time someone liked me back. Well, it turned out he just wanted something casual, since he just broke up with his gf. Well, so just a hook up then, fine (Long distance wouldn’t have worked so it was fine.)

Now, it’s a co worker.. I don’t know where this one will lead, but he seems to like me, but I have to strong feeling that he wants to hook up too... Idk, maybe I’d like it though.

Oh, did I mention a good friend of mine who has a gf and still wants to have some fun with me?! 

That’s my “love life” haha, appreciate your thoughts :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1151209,public,self,I always fall in love with the wrong guys -_-,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0qjb0/i_always_fall_in_love_with_the_wrong_guys/,no_ads,0.0,,,
