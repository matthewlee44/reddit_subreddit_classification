I've only been in one relationship so far, we got to know each other online and fell in love instantly (both for personality / soul and physical attraction). It was quite obvious for us and we decided to be a couple when we met. Been in this relationship for 8 years.


Now, since then I haven't been in a relationship again. Lately I've gotten to know a sweet guy. (IRL, not online)

I didn't fall in love with him but I think he's kind and attractive.


I asked him if we could hang out sometime. He replied that if I mean it in a platonic way he's not interested - he'd like to date me.


Now here comes the problem.
I don't know what dating even means.

Is it a trial phase to later decide whether or not to become a couple &amp; what kind of relationship it can become?
Is it a ""casual"" thing like just hanging out and having sex?

And do you think it's normal or a red flag that he immediately said he's not interested if it's purely platonic?

I'm rather hesitant and shy about this and I only want to enter a relationship if I truly feel it.

I can imagine being casual for a while even if there are no deep feelings involved, but this is an entirely different thing than love, right?

My partner (29m) moved away a month ago and we're temporarily doing long distance until I (25f) move there as well in two months. Due to grad school, I couldn't follow him directly but 3 months seemed super doable in the beginning.

Now the problem is, once he got there, he goes so preoccupied with making friends and going out that he started disregarding me, which after having lived together before that kind of threw me off. I understand that he's somewhere new and needs to make friends but I couldn't stop how I felt? Upon that, he initially hid the fact that his current group of friends consists only of girls (except him). And he also left me hanging over multiple occasions to go hang out with these girls (in some instances, it was also alone with one of them). And to give you an example of why it got bad: In one instance I asked him to stay around to discuss the issue and he begins to ask what I felt, forgets the question, and ends the call because he was late to go to the beach with the girls. Upon returning he blamed it on me, saying I was only trying to keep him from having friends. Note: He asked a question, forgot AND hung up mid-conversation so they wouldn't have to wait for him)

Since then, we've talked about it, he has apologized to me profusely and has been trying to make up for it. This only happened after me breaking down and asking for time away (around 2 weeks of arguing where he insisted I was controlling and jealous). He later realized his mistake and has been very supportive of me getting better.

The problem I have now though, is I get instantly uncomfortable still every time he tells me he's hanging out with the girls. Not because he is, but because of how shitty the weeks before made me feel and I cant seem to overcome this feeling. For that reason, I asked him not to update me on what he's doing daily (since he only does stuff with them anyways), to avoid going into feeling this way and making him feel controlled. But obviously, this is not a long-term solution and it will only create distance between us.

I don't know how to get out of this phase and what to do to eventually feel comfortable. Any help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: He hid the fact that it was girls on purpose, 'to avoid conflict with me'. Which he later agreed was because he realized it would be uncomfortable for me but didn't want to have to deal with it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160986,public,self,Partner (29m) hid stuff from me (25f) and I don't know how to get over this feeling,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/szjsmg/partner_29m_hid_stuff_from_me_25f_and_i_dont_know/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,

If you are pursuing someone in hopes that it will lead to a relationship- do you sleep with 4 other partners on the side while seeing someone, or do you genuinely get to know this person and commit to just them until things progress or come to an end?

My view on dating is that when you're getting to know someone you're getting to know them, not 4 other people. When you're having sex with numerous partners on the side I truly believe that you do not like the person as much as you think or you just don't see any potential relationship. I like to see one said person as I get to know them, if it doesn't work out then I result back to possibly finding another person, etc. 

This guy I went on a date with last month and I hit it off pretty well- except we did hook up on the first date. After our first date, we talked every single day, it was like we couldn't run out of things to talk about. I did find a couple of instances where I wouldn't hear from him for like 8+ hours so I assumed he was at a girl's house or something. We had a discussion about our views on dating, where he informed me he was sleeping with someone else while seeing me. He told me that we're not exclusive (which yes, is true) and only went on one date- but he kept saying to me that he sees us as a couple and wants to do these things together as a couple, etc. I told him I wasn't interested in seeing him anymore since he is talking to other women while I was taking him more seriously. He then asked me what we could possibly do in order to make this work, including becoming exclusive. He told me him and this girl were not exclusive, but yet she was mad he didn't take her out for valentines day... aka: she definitely likes him a lot. 

So I genuinely feel like I'm just being played and being told whatever I need to be told in order for him to keep me in his roster of women.

So I started dating a girl from a mutual friend group about two months ago and we had since known each for awhile and hung out as friends with the group for a few months. 

Anyway, we started dating right before Christmas and since then, we’ve had sex a lot, I’ve met her parents and also poured out our hearts to each other about our feelings. Recently however, I’m beginning to feel like she isn’t the girl I imagine spending my life with. I really enjoy her company but honestly I’m not sure if I see myself marrying her. The problem is, I’ve met her parents and she’s met mine. Her family is super nice and they love me, so if I break up with her, they will think I’m a jerk etc. she also got invited to an out of state wedding in April that she wants me to go with her to, although we haven’t bought airfare or anything yet, but she’s already looking to buy a dress and even rsvp’d us both to it. 

I enjoyed my life as just me and doing what I want, when I want, and now I feel like I don’t have that like I did. I’m also really busy so having this relationship makes my life even busier.

Again, I really like her company and do have some feelings for her, I just don’t see it long term that much. Also, she will be absolutely crushed and heartbroken because she’s SUPER into me, so it will be very difficult.

Also maybe dating advice and tips from other domestic violence survivors? Like what would you recommend if I plan to do online dating, what are some common red flags, how has your criteria changed, etc.

I’m 25F, only had one relationship with 35M that I just escaped because it was very abusive. Have a restraining order and charges against him. It was 3.5 years. Extremely happy to be out. I am experiencing symptoms of PTSD but therapy is helping.

I would love to find the right guy. I’m older than my naive 21 year old self, wiser, and my red flag radar is better now. But I can’t say I’m not a bit scared of dating, mostly because of the trauma and also I still have little experience dating.

I’d like to try online dating. I’ve never met up with a person from online before, and I’m a bit hesitant.

* what’s the best and safest way to meet up with dates? Should I only meet up with a friend with me or is that too much? 

* is there a red flag that you think isn’t as commonly thought of that might help me to vet potential dates better?

* when did you start to introduce the person you were dating to your friends and family? (My ex’s family never met mine in those 3.5 yrs! Big red flag 😣)

We have never been on the same page regarding covid and the pandemic. I believe there's a virus but that its overexaggerated and the governments are fiddling with numbers to make it worse than it is, and making money off the back of lockdowns (which dont work imo). My BF strongly disagrees with me on this and we've had small arguments about this so we just avoid the topic so as to not continue to clash. I am not getting vaccinated, at least until the trials are complete in a couple of years. I believe that it can cause fertility problems and no-one knows the long term effects yet. My BF however disagrees and has tried showing me that its safe but I am pretty decided on my stance so he has let it be and we get on fine. Me and my family all feel the same way in that we are angry with the whole pandemic and the collateral damage that's been had.

My workplace had a covid delta outbreak - when it was new here - with a number of pupils and staff testing positive and so it was shut down and they sent testing teams to test everyone at the workplace - regardless if you were an identified contact or not. Essentially anyone who works at or lives with someone who works there could get a free pcr test. I was not identified as a close contact by track and trace, a couple of pupils in one of my classes had to isolate at most. My bf argues that there's potential that a lot of students dont self test either so its hard to know how many are infected. When he found out about the outbreak he had asked how the tests went, and when i told him i'm not taking them because i feel fine and healthy he called me out saying i wasnt considering his and others health?? I've never felt so insulted. I never take the twice weekly covid tests offered either as I dont believe in asymptomatic testing, of which he assumed i would be taking as precautions and said was irresponsible given my job as a teacher. He had also kicked off as we had spent time together earlier in the week when this was all occurring where he had assumed I was taking the routine tests. I found this rude and can't believe he's called me out on my own medical decision. I called him out on being controlling, and that none of my ex's have ever treated me this way. A colleague of his supposedly died from Covid a few weeks prior to this all happening, which he brought up, but why should i get tested because of someone i dont know? Why should i risk my health with a covid test?

After a few back and forths over text I told him if he was that worried that he should get tested himself and that i'm not responsible for his health. He then messaged that this relationship no longer works for him and ended it over text. He did eventually offer to meet up at a later time which i refused, but I cant believe he did this over message all because of a test for a disease with 99% rate?! 

Has anyone else experienced something similar where a partner can't respect your opinion or been controlling? Was I in the wrong? It would be good to get some impartial opinions.

Today I was looking up things to do with the new guy I'm seeing, and I have found so many restaurants and pubs that I love that were special places for my ex and I, and it almost makes me not want to go to some of them because of how special they were to us (ex. one restaurant is fancy so we rarely went to it, but we went for all our special occasions like anniversaries and birthdays, and the owner even recognised us).

The worst part of it is how sad it makes me feel.

I'm recently divorced (2years ago) out of an abusive marriage of 8 years (my choice) and have always had confidence issues. I grew up in a rural environment and with no female role models such as sisters or a mother. no women that I could have a positive life long relationship with to build an understanding and security with women. To this day, even with women I work with, I still lock up and get inside my head and have an irrational fear about repercussions of misspeaking or offending someone. So instead, I'll often not say anything outside of normal work stuff.

More so, I grew up in what I would call extreme poverty for an American. No phone in the house. electricity going out for months at a time. The house was a shack that had no separate rooms, just a big open space with furniture strewn about. Feeling a deep shame from it all that has had a lasting impact. When I pass anyone on the street, I'll often feel that I'm beneath them somehow.

FYI: I've been in therapy for several years and I know that these are hurdles that I have to overcome in my life. They wouldn't be called challenges if they weren't challenging.

I'm still in between careers thanks to this pandemic. I was in Event Production and trying to get into Video Production. I currently work at a Restaurant/Bar food running, dishwashing, bar backing, and cooking on weekends. I make enough money to get by, but not enough to make me feel like I have something to offer someone. I also can't shake this feeling that my value is based on how much money I bring in. So, when I don't feel I have enough to entertain a date, it works against my self worth.

On a typical weekend when my shift is over, I'll sit at the bar where I can find a spot that doesn't bother anyone and I'll have beer and then hope someone will want to strike up a conversation with me(since I'm not feeling confident enough to do it myself). There'll be many times that I'll want to have a conversation with an attractive individual, but will get stuck in my head trying to think of a way to engage and never executing. So I'll just pull out my phone and that is usually the end of it.

I recognize that I'm responsible for my dating life and can do something to address it, But I also feel like I won't be authentic and presenting a false personality that I'm not to whatever would be partner.

I talked with her for a month before I met her in person, while still looking for others.

After we went out 3 times together, she told me that she had feelings for me, and I didn’t want to let her down because I didn’t want to lose her, even though people on Reddit were telling me to. I was getting nowhere with any other dating apps, and I knew that there was someone who was interested, even if I didn’t feel the same way. I went out on one more date with her and then on the one after that, I made things official with her. This was the first relationship I ever had in my life.

During all this, I was interested in someone else who I was attracted to, and they seemed to show interest, but she had a boyfriend and made no effort to leave him for me. I think she was just leading me on, which is why I didn’t start a relationship with her instead.

I kept telling myself that it didn’t matter if I wasn’t physically attracted to her, because she was my best friend and I loved spending time with her. We did make out once, and I did enjoy it. I also liked it when she put her hair in a bun. But other than that, there wasn’t much that appealed to me physically.

Why did I do this to her? I was desperate to have a girlfriend because my self-esteem was at an all-time low, and I wanted intimacy as well. It also seemed like everyone around me was partnered up and I didn’t want to be left out.

A few weeks into the relationship, I broke up with her, because I realized that what I was doing to her was unfair. I made the effort to drive to her house and told her to get in my car so that I could tell her that she deserves someone who truly loves her (and she does). I felt like just a text would have only added to the disrespect. She seemed okay, but then she unfriended me soon after.

It has now been one year since I last saw her, or dated anyone at all. I’ve occasionally done dating apps every once in a while, but nothing more than chatting has occurred, and even that was rare. I’m thinking about just getting off dating apps as a whole, in order to try and preserve my self-worth. Physically, I have changed my glasses and I recently started trying to grow a beard.

I also moved to a new city about 2 months ago for work, and I’m about an hour away from where I used to live.

I think it would be nice to have a partner, but I sometimes feel unworthy of one because I took advantage of someone all for my own selfish desire of having a relationship just because I want a relationship.

Hey guys!

A few months ago i stared being a regular at a bar where one of my best friends works. We started talking with the bartender and he showed some interest- nothing extra just eye contact and some touching. One night, he becomes very intimate with me coming very close to my face to talk and touching me with every chance. By the end of the night he grabbed me and kissed me in the mouth twice, in front of his co workers and the people who know him.

Some background story about him. He has a girlfriend for around 3 years now. And the people that saw us kissing know that he does. However during summer they were on and off with her. They went on a trip together to give their relationship a chance, and a week later he kisses me. After the kiss he told my friend “she was fire, she drove me crazy, it happens once in a while”. I asked two of my friends who know him very well. They told me that in the 4 years that they know him they’ve never seen him being like that with a girl. I know these people and they have no reason to lie. He’s really not the type of bArtender who sleeps with a new girl every other night. That he surely likes me but the timing is not good. Another friend told me though that it’s the first time he has seen him so committed to try to save a relationship, so i shouldn’t get my hopes up.

I have seen him maybe 3-4 times after the kiss. He’s not uninterested but definitely not as intimate as he used to be. He sends me mixed vibes and after taking my friends words into consideration it drives me crazy.

Do i have a chance with him?

He’s 40, i’m 27. His girlfriend is 29.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161042,public,self,Do i have a chance with him?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/szp2bk/do_i_have_a_chance_with_him/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,

I’m sure this has been asked in a similar way before, but I didn’t know exactly how to word it.

I work for a pretty large organization and there’s this girl that works on the same floor (but different department) that I have a pretty big crush on. We do know eachother and have talked before, but we’re on opposite sides of the floor. We run into eachother maybe once every other month at most. Plus, I think she works remote a few days a week, so that doesn’t help. From the interactions I’ve had with her she is warm, friendly, talkative, and pretty. As far as I know, she is single.

I am friends with her on Facebook and we follow eachother on Instagram. However, she barely posts. I think the last time she posted something was a picture of her cats in September. Even though she doesn’t post, she is online pretty much every day consistently.

My question is, seeing as how we barely see eachother and she barely posts on social media, how can I reach out to her without coming across as completely random and weird? I’d definitely want to take it easy and not rush into asking her out right off the bat, but how do I get a conversation started? She liked a picture of my cat I posted over the weekend. Is that a good starting point? 😹 I’m just at a loss of how to start.

So I started dating a girl from a mutual friend group about two months ago and we had since known each for awhile and hung out as friends with the group for a few months. 

Anyway, we started dating right before Christmas and since then, we’ve had sex a lot, I’ve met her parents and also poured out our hearts to each other about our feelings. Recently however, I’m beginning to feel like she isn’t the girl I imagine spending my life with. I really enjoy her company but honestly I’m not sure if I see myself marrying her. The problem is, I’ve met her parents and she’s met mine. Her family is super nice and they love me, so if I break up with her, they will think I’m a jerk etc. she also got invited to an out of state wedding in April that she wants me to go with her to, although we haven’t bought airfare or anything yet, but she’s already looking to buy a dress and even rsvp’d us both to it. 

I enjoyed my life as just me and doing what I want, when I want, and now I feel like I don’t have that like I did. I’m also really busy so having this relationship makes my life even busier.

Again, I really like her company and do have some feelings for her, I just don’t see it long term that much. Also, she will be absolutely crushed and heartbroken because she’s SUPER into me, so it will be very difficult.

We weren’t “official” yet, but I wanted to change that this weekend. Marrakesh seemed like the perfect place to ask someone out.

Eider is from the Basque country in the north of Spain. I don’t know how getting a girlfriend works in Spain. In Ireland, you go on dates together to check if the other person is your kind of crazy. After a few months, you ask the other person out. You hope they say yes. But asking someone out seems too formal for Spain, a country that sleeps most of the afternoon.

Was Eider as serious about us as I was? Movies have taught me that Spanish people have multiple lovers. Was she dating other people? Was I just an English teacher to her? I pushed those dark thoughts to the side.

I didn’t ask her out on the first day because we fell for every scam on the plus side we pretended to be married so they wouldn’t stone us to death for sleeping in the same bed.

On the second day after saying no thank you to every shopkeeper trying to sell us knock off clothes we needed some Irish medicine. We found a bar. Walking up the stairs, it was like a 1920s speakeasy. The only light came from the candles on each table. Happy hour, every hour, wine was flowing. The server dressed in all black set us in the corner. French, German, and English voices filled the room. We sat an arm’s length away from a French couple. Eider started rolling a cigarette. Preparing to smoke inside for the first time in her life.

Was this a good place to ask her out?

Best-case scenario: Eider would leap across the table into my arms. The different nationalities in the room would clap and sing their national anthems. The French couple would soak us with champagne.

Worst-case scenario: I would ask Eider out and the room would go quiet. No music or foreign accents. Looking like she just drunk some out-of-date milk, she’d explain that we were just friends. She’d throw the happy hour wine over me. She’d grab one of the German tourists to walk her home. They would fall in love just in time to use our bed. Leaving me with the bill covered in tears and sad wine.

Eider finished rolling her cigarette.

This wasn’t the place. I didn’t want to risk it. We kept drinking our wine. It was one of those perfect nights I’d remember while the dementia was kicking in.

Walking back with my hand over her shoulder, I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But I had two more days.

The next night I found a romantic French restaurant “Nomad”. We went through a maze of streets to find it. We arrived early. The first time Eider had been early in her life. They squished us with the other tourists like children in the backseat.

It was a romantic dinner for me. For all I knew, Eider couldn’t figure out why her strange blonde friend kept suggesting romantic restaurants.

Eider was midway through a story about her friends. Not listening, I decided it was time to ask her out. My heart pumped like a techno speaker. I had to ask her before the dark side of my brain booted up. But, how do you ask someone out? I looked down at my beef tagine. A typical Moroccan dish of meat and potatoes. This tagine also had some dates. The dried fruit things. Was I going to look her in the eye and say, “Will you go out with me?”. Or was I going to use this dried date as a pun. I paused, still ignoring her story… I had to go with the pun.

While she talked, I balanced the date on my fork, lifting it up and with a wine filled Irish accent I said “do you want to date?” She scowled, wondering what the hell I had said this time. After a few seconds she said, “like boyfriend/girlfriend?”

*Abort, abort, abort*. “No, like a date,” I said, pointing at the dried piece of fruit. *OH MY GOD,* what have I done? She said “No, I’m fine thanks, I don’t want that”.

Did she not want to date me or not want the dried piece of fruit? I pointed at the food and said “date”. She looked at me with a blank expression. I realised she didn’t know what the English word was for a ‘date’. She went back to talking about her friends. Her tone didn’t change at all. I wondered if I jumped from the terrace would I kill myself.

I forgot about asking her out. We enjoyed the rest of our evening. My weird ‘date’ moment was just a glitch that was never mentioned again. We still held hands, flirted and kissed during and after dinner. Maybe she just wanted something casual? As the night went on, I put it down to a miscommunication. I hoped I could still ask her out.

Our last night was a trip to the desert. Eider had booked the trip through a Spanish website. The entire trip was in Spanish. Every one of the other guests spoke Spanish. I do not speak Spanish. In English, if you’re near me, I’ll talk for days. In Spanish, it’s hard to tell if I have a disability.

But life is a movie, and I wanted a romantic scene. Even if I didn’t understand the subtitles.

The romantic in me knew I had to ask her out on the holiday. While the dark-side screamed, she’d choose one of the Spanish men who could speak her language.

We got on the bus and the driver played the weirdest English music from Ed Sheeran to Snoop dog. I was the only person with blue eyes.

The driver stopped in the desert at a place with one shitty tent, some camels and a quad. This wasn’t the dream romantic location I’d thought it would be. The good news was Eider had booked the trip, so she’d have to go out with me from the guilt of dragging us here. I didn’t need to speak Spanish to know the location did not impress the others.

The driver drove off. Not explaining why we had stopped there. We didn’t need an explanation. The van ended up driving along a dune. Tilting too far to the left as it went around the corner. If this thing tipped, I didn’t like my odds of a Spanish person saving me versus one of their own.

After the extreme off-road adventure, we arrived at a desert utopia. Eider had nailed it. The tents were massive, with bathrooms, double beds, and heaters. Each couple had their own tent. I wouldn’t have to compete with the other Spanish couples in the bedroom. Our tent was the last in the row and looked out into the desert.

This was the place to ask someone out.

We got set up and were told to go to the fire. A Moroccan man wrapped in blankets and holding a guitar was there. Beside the fire was a giant neon heart. Eider choose a seat where the smoke blew in our faces. Even as we were choking on the smoke, it was hard not to feel alive. The Moroccan man started singing. His voice carried through the whole desert. He blew everyone away. If he wanted, he could have taken Eider or any of the women in the circle.

Eider got a special celiac soup made for her. The hot soup battled the cold while the singer warmed our hearts. After soup, we moved inside for a candlelit dinner. The stars above us were aligning.

They held the dinner in a big tent. Everyone couple sat at their own table, facing each other in a circle like an arena.

While we were eating, I planned. We’d have dinner, finish our drinks and then I’d ask her out under the stars. Some old school romance. Could today be any more perfect?

But then it happened. The scariest noise known to man… Belly dancing music. Out of nowhere, a blonde woman who didn’t look Moroccan appeared. She danced in a circle, moving her hips to the music, making eye contact with her prey.

There was a Muslim woman at the party sitting in her hijab eating dinner by herself. She stared at the belly dancer like an Irish grandmother who found out her granddaughter was gay. The belly dancer wiggled even harder when she looked at her.

The dancer circled over to the Spanish group and grabbed the big Spanish guy. He jumped up. The Spanish group cheered. She signaled him to copy her without saying a word. He tried his best, but he wasn’t enough for the dancer. She set him back down. She looked for her next victim.

I turned my attention to the bread. If I just focused on the bread, I’d become the bread.

In the corner of my eye, I saw the belly dancer come towards me like a cat closing the distance with a trapped mouse.

Please don’t ruin this for me.

On a normal day I’d have no problem getting up there and embarrassing myself. It was a tradition for me to take over a dance floor 45 minutes before anyone else. My showstopper is the Russian dance where you go into a deep squat and kick your feet out. But I wanted to hide that weirdness till after Eider agreed to go out with me.

I looked up from the bread. The belly dancer was still there. She signalled for me to get up. I was face to face with a lioness without a gun.

I looked at my bread. Pretending like I hadn’t seen her. She stayed right in front of me. Belly dancing music blasting in the background.

My heart beat so hard it hurt. “No, thanks,” I said, and tried to smile. The Spanish people booed. She stood there, not moving.

She turned her back on me and moved to the next table.

The only thing worse than bad dancing is no dancing. All Eider could say with a look of disgust was, “that was strange”.

The belly dancer pulled out two Spanish girls and started a more complicated dance. We all watched as the two girls struggled with the move. I had fucked up and needed to fix this. Eider was thinking she should have dated the Spanish guy who got up to dance.

The lioness danced over to our table. Not satisfied with the two Spanish girls. This time I did not touch my bread. If I was going to die, I’d die a warrior.

I looked the dancer straight in the eye. She looked me in the eye. No one in the room existed anymore. She signalled with two fingers, drawing me in.

Eider was expecting disappointment. The Spanish people were ready to boo. The room was ready to send me to the dessert. There comes a defining moment in every man’s life. This was my moment.

I grabbed the handles of my seat with my sweaty palms. Took a deep breath and pushed hard with my shaky legs. I stood up. The Spanish people cheered. I walked forward like a soldier on the front line.

The lioness pulled Eider up as well.

Now there were four of us: me, Eider and two Spanish girls shaking everything we had.

I don’t know what happened… But the dancing just clicked. Against the odds, the Irish guy could shake his ass better than the Spanish girls.

The belly dancer ushered the three girls to the side.

The belly dancer upped the pace. My ass wiggled like jelly dropped on the floor. I don’t remember looking at anyone else in the room. The belly dancer spoke no words, but said more to me than any other person.

This had gone from my worst nightmare to my greatest moment. The belly dancing music in the background continued thumping. It was getting louder. The beat sounded like it was going to drop. I kept shaking everything.

I looked over at Eider and she gave me the look you’d give if your racist white uncle surprised you with fluent Chinese.

My whole life had led to this moment. I knew what I needed to do. It was time for the Russian dance. I calmed myself. Keeping eye contact with the belly dancer. I focused on the music. One final breath and then I dropped into a deep squat. Balancing on one foot and kicking out the other. Switching the feet to the sound of the Indian drums. More in sync than Justin Timberlake. I pounded the floor.

The crowd erupted.

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot… This was living.

I stood up from my Russian dance expecting an applause from the dancer. She didn’t react. There was no clap. She broke eye contact and put us back in our seats. I’d never feel a connection like that again.

Eider no longer looked at me like a dog that she knew she’d have to put down. After that performance, Eider would ask me out.

As Eider and I left the tent for the stars, I knew it was now or never.

The fire was on its last legs. This time, there was no smoke in our faces. We wrapped up in blankets. Cupid’s neon red heart looked over us. I thought about my future career as a belly-dancer.

This was the moment to ask her out.

I had one last choice to make. Would I ask in Spanish or English? My Spanish sucks. But it’s Eider’s language. Was it more romantic in her language? But how do you ask someone out in Spanish? I should have googled it. I didn’t want to mess it up and ask her to be my wife instead of my girlfriend.

It had to be English. But I had the same problem. How do you ask someone out? What do they say in the Movies?

I remembered the ‘date’ incident from the day before. Did she not want a boyfriend, or a piece of dried fruit?

We had sat in silence for too long.

In a panic I took a quick breath and said: “I have a question”.

Fuck, it sounded like I was proposing. I think she was expecting me to get on one knee.

I need to do something… I took a sharp breath and said: “Will you go out with me?”

Eider looked confused.

Oh, my god. I’ve been dating a beautiful Basque woman and I’ve ruined it all by trying to label us.

She paused.

“Yes… but what do you think we’re doing now?” she said with a laugh.

Yes, she said yes.

“I don’t know, just wanted to be sure. Haven’t even thought about it,” I said.

Eider said we’ve been hanging out for months and we’re on holiday together. She then roasted me, calling me a teenager saying someone hasn’t asked her out like this since she was in school. She explained Spanish people don’t ask each other out. It just happens.

I fought back, saying it was romantic. I had risked it all. Stood up to the possibility of rejection. I was a soldier volunteering for a dangerous mission.

In the background of our perfect moment, someone stumbled out of their tent to throw up.

She said what does ‘going out’ even mean? I said I don’t know, while thinking it meant no more multiple lovers for her. What will change? I said ‘nothing it will be the same’, again thinking no more lovers for her.

I thought it was perfect. She thought I was a loser. But that didn’t matter.
