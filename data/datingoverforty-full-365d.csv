I thought that there was no such thing as the perfect woman (at least for me) and figured that I would grow old alone and die in my home with no one around.i decided to try the dating app on FB and within a few days I had someone that thought that I looked like I might be interesting. I checked her out and she seemed to have a lot of the same qualities that I have been seeking. 

After we matched she and I began texting to get a feel for each other, she asked if I liked Marvel movies ( I own them all) and I said yes, so I returned with the question do you like Star Wars. She said yes and at that point I asked if she wanted to meet somewhere. She agreed to a time and place and while I was sitting in the parking lot waiting a car pulled up next to me. At that point I got a text that she was at the place and gave a description of her car, the very same car that had just pulled up next to me. 

I sent a text back saying where I was and got out of my own car. We ranked about everything (our families ,past relationships, and things we've done, places we've been etc.) . The wind was blowing and her hair kept getting in her eyes and without even thinking I reached up and brushed her hair back.

The chorus goes like this:

I’m feeling good from my head to my shoes
Know where I’m goin’ and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view,
I got a new attitude!

So, recently by chance, I met someone.  The experience was so beautiful that I had drafted a  long detailed summary of how this came to be, which I was going to share via post here, but decided not to, as it’s such a special moment, sharing it haphazardly feels as if it would diminish it’s significance.

Instead, I wanted to share my thoughts on how I feel that our meeting came to be.  To do that, I’ll share two small details as to kind of paint the framework.  

Earlier this month I went on vacation with only two intentions; one being to finish studying for an exam that I’m taking which will allow me to make a mid-life career switch from profession to life long passion, and two being to complete the work of accepting and being completely comfortable with where I find myself in life at 44.

While on vacation, I was completely centered, at peace, and noticed that by completing the work of accepting my current situation, the energy that I was putting out into the world was being reflected back by how others were receiving and greeting me.

By chance, I happened to meet a fellow traveler.  We discovered that we both had been going for walks each morning, and decided to walk together the next morning.  That walk turned into a four hour excursion, in which we met each other on an emotional level of pure transparency, vulnerability, and complete acceptance without judgement of what led to both of us being at a position in life in which we found ourselves.  That experience continued with a five hour dinner/chat the next night.

Upon returning from my vacation, I shared the long, detailed version of my experience with a beautiful like soul that I met through, and had been having a month long chat with, via a previous post.  We both found ourselves at a similar point of growth in life, which she described as “Radical Self-Acceptance” (I love that!).

Which brings me to Patti LaBelle and what I feel has been a life changing lesson learned.  While on vacation, a shift occurred in which I not only learned to accept and be happy with my current situation in life (I.e. I am exactly where I need to be at all times, I am at peace with the present moment, and open to and accepting of whatever the future may bring), but also accept others and where I happen to meet them on their journey.

I feel that this shift has caused me to attract a different type of energy; people who are more aligned to, and receptive of me in my natural state, and I of them.  I feel that this shift is what caused me and the fellow traveler to cross paths.  But the shift has transcended someone who I could possibly date; this shift has affected my interactions with both family, friends and complete strangers, if that makes sense.  

From colleagues to my parents, everyone has sensed a shift in my energy (I was already pleasant and positive, but what has occurred is akin to my existing positive energy being compounded).  In turn, it is as if they’ve shifted their energy to meet me on this new level.

I’m not sure if I’m capturing the essence of what transpired correctly, but the best way to describe it is it’s a feeling of “the universe will conspire to meet you exactly where you are.”  

If you are at peace with yourself, the universe will bring people into your life who are aligned with and in tune to your sense of peace.  If you are anxious and full of angst, you will meet people who further agitate that angst.

This newly learned revelation has completely changed my outlook towards dating over forty.  Having been in a self-imposed year long dating hiatus, I now find myself open to all possibilities, whether they be remaining single, or meeting someone who is a good fit for me, and I her.

My fellow likeminded Redditor and I continue our month+ long chat; she telling me new chapters in her story of growth (and offering sage advice), and I filling her in on my latest chapters.  

As for the woman whom I met while on vacation, we’ve continued our experience (via daily emails) of two journeymen who happen to be walking side by side at this particular moment.  We haven’t tried to define what this is, nothing physical occurred, and it may not; we may wind up remaining friends or we may wind up dating, we don’t know and that’s ok.  We simply have committed to continuing an open, honest, truthful and non-judgmental dialogue without any expectations.  We’re simply allowing the path to direct our next steps, and it feels great!

So I wanted to share that with the group as we’re all trying to figure out how to navigate through these waters which sometimes shift from smooth sailing to extremely choppy at times.  

For me, the best approach came by first, identifying my current location on the map of life, second, aligning my compass with my current position, third, rotating my compass towards my desired destination and charting a path.  

The final piece was to follow and trust the bearings of the journey, but I don’t feel that would’ve been possible without step one; both identifying and accepting my current location.

But it was all the telltale signs, early promises, pet names before meeting, long delays before replies, torrid story of ww spouse and lost millions, never reciprocating answers to Qs they asked- like most of the signs except for money which I’m sure they were working towards, and lots of pictures of them doing their project, pics w no identifying info at all, and a Textnow phone # linked to a 75 yo woman in a tiny Tx town, and projects all over the world even tho we are in Tx... it was just weird.

I’ve been happy doing my own thing but now I’m thinking about actually dating. 

I had some success on OLD back in the flip phone days but reading here it appears the dating apps are hot garbage nowadays so I haven’t signed up. Meeting someone in IRL ideally would be the best way to go but just seems like some long odds.

I just don’t think I could ever feel comfortable approaching a stranger at the grocery store or somewhere similar and try to start a friendly conversation in hopes that it might lead to something. I live in the South so the majority of people smile and make eye contact with you so it doesn’t really mean like hey I’m open to chatting or anything. At least with OLD you know that someone on there is looking for someone whereas the woman at the store is just there to shop.

I walk my dog on a walking trail on a regular basis and imagining that I would have a chance meeting with a woman who was single, my age plus or minus 10 years, that I was attracted too, that’s interested in me and somehow manage to come up with a conversation that gets her attention as we are walking past each other in opposite directions seems far fetched at best! I live in a smaller populated area so there’s not a ton of people to begin with! 

I used to live near both a Panera and a Barnes n Noble. I spent a lot of time at both and don’t remember ever witnessing anyone trying to approach someone and those are places where you see plenty of people alone. I think most people want to be left alone unless they are actively meeting people like maybe at a bar. I’m not much of a bar guy myself. 

I know the meet up groups are recommended here a lot but is it okay to try to date people in a group? It doesn’t seem like that’s what they were set up for? 
I’m not typically a joiner but maybe I need to change it up some!

My best IRL scenario is the workplace which would most likely blow up in my face lol I work with mostly women and quite a few of them are single and I get along great with them but have never wanted to get into that potential drama. 

I would like to hear stories of people that met someone IRL that eventually became a date. It seems like I see a lot comments where a guy will say I flirted with someone at the store or I got smile or laugh but that was it or a woman will comment that I got hit on today which was flattering but I wasn’t interested in him.

I met a cute guy through Tinder in the mid of a pandemic last year. We hit it off right after the first virtual date, and after two weeks of daily virtual dates he said he was falling in love with me (too soon).

He's a fun fella and we kept each other pretty happy during lockdown. But I picked up things here and there that made me hesitate. For example, he told me about a close relationship he has with a female ex-coworker that made his ex-gf of 4 years very jealous and think he had an ongoing sexual relationship with that said coworker and her husband.

Although he was very attentive and tried to be very polite with me as he said I was classy and different from the women he used to date, there were things that screamed ""douchey"" about him... For example, he said he had sex at work with co-workers because ""life is too short"". Anyhow, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and thought the past was the past. He came clean and deserved to be forgiven.

When I came to visit him, I found that he only had pictures of a baby girl on his fridge. I asked who that was, he said that's the daughter of his friend - The woman who he used to work with at the same clinic for 8 months about over 10 years ago. They then went on to go to the same university to get an undergrad degree of the same field. She then got married to another guy and had a daughter. He even requested his mother to make a quilt for her baby. For a guy who doesn't even remember his mother's birthday, that's kind of unusually caring.

I wasn't jealous about that, but he kept bringing her up in our conversations regularly. And it crossed my mind that he seemed to have an unusual attachment to that woman. It made me wonder why his ex-gf was so jealous about that and accused him of sleeping with her and her husband (pretty sick, right?), but he stayed in that relationship for 4 years until she left him. As a woman, I would not stay with anyone who accused me of sleeping with someone I didn't, and wondered why he stayed. They said, there's no fire, there's no smoke.

Our relationship lasted only 2.5 months and it left me a lot of grief and I have stopped using dating apps.

I've been seeing someone for the past couple (almost 3) months who is fairly guarded.

There have been times when she has been feeling unwell and otherwise unavailable to meet up, and I've been patient, though I had started to feel she was uninterested in me (and therefore feeling down).  Recently, however, she said I'm the nicest guy she has met and really likes me a lot, and she wanted to tell me she can seem distant because she doesn't know how to take compliments and affection, and she just needs time.

I feel like this is both a success story and a learning experience.

I've seen benching done with all sorts of gender and various sexual identities.  


For those unaware, benching is the term used when someone has a number of matches on OLD and dates each one at different times until they choose who to select for a partnership.  Each of these people is essentially on the bench waiting their turn for dates and is competing with the other people that the person has matched.  Think of the shows The Bachelor or Bachelorette except the benched people have no idea they are in a pool of contestants trying to date this person. 


I've never used benching in my dating life.  I have always started with talking to multiple people on apps, and when one of them seems like a match for a first date, I'll usually stop talking to other people and wait until that date ends to either continue on to a second date or, if it didn't work out, start again with talking to other matches.  In my opinion benching really contributes to the FOMO (Fear of missing out) that makes OLD such a shit show.  Things could be going really well with one person, but the fear of missing out on something better with another match just continues the vicious OLD cycles. 


When I've talked to people about this however, they say that it's a common part of OLD now and it is almost expected for much of the dating pool.  I can't get over how bad it feels to be benched and it isn't something I want to do to others; ""Hey I had a great second date with you, but my third date with this other person just went a little bit better so bye"" is such a shitty thing to do.

In this third and final installment, I’d like to say that the criticism gave me pause and inspired me to reconsider such an endeavor. And those that supported the idea brought up great points too, which I am further considering.

A key thing I noticed in the discussion was the point that a “certain type of guy” dates internationally. Maybe he is middle aged, a bit quirky, maybe not especially handsome, and certainly unlucky in the US at meeting women.

So the fundamental question this: Should this guy merely accept his lonely fate in the US or should he try to go where he is celebrated, not merely tolerated? Should he go where he might be selected rather than rejected? 

So if dating domestically had not worked for someone for years. Why be insane and do the same thing over and over expecting different results? Why not branch out, try something new. Explore new opportunities for oneself and give new opportunities to someone else potentially?

I’m incredibly short, four foot ten, and often due to my size and until I hit forty, very youthful appearance have a history of people not taking me seriously. It’s actually why I’ve developed into such an outspoken person. To me being called cute calls up those feelings along with my own bias against the word as to me it equates to saying I look “fine”

The loneliness is more than simply being alone.  You can easily feel alone in a crowd, with friends,  etc.  Being lonely isn't a crime or being broken, desperate,  or anything negative about you as a person.  

We are humans, a very social species.  We depend on each other.  We are biologically built on being social.   When we feel alone or are alone we feel anxiety, pain, fear.   Our bodies go into over drive.   Blood pressure goes up, adrenaline,  and cortisol go up.  Most people go through this from time to time.  Prolonged loneliness leads to health problems and often death especially for older people.   Not to mention sucide and addictions.

I have been single almost 4 years after a 20 yr marriage.  Aside from the conversations on dating apps and the dozen or so coffee dates and two women I met 3 or so times, I've been alone.  At times it is almost unbearable.  Days go by feeling alone and hopeless followed by weeks of trying to live and not think about it or feel bad.  

In the next few weeks summer activities (work and home projects) will largely keep me too busy physically and mentally to think on these things.  So I feel decent until October when summer activities go away.  

Some out there suggest hobbies or other activities to fill the time and replace the thoughts.  Problem with that is if you stop trying, stop thinking, stop looking, time will pass until you wake up 20 yrs down the road at retirement without anyone to share that time with.

We are no drama.  My visits are typically for two weekends at a time.  I stay for the week between those two weekends and I try to optimize that week, during which Munchkin is in school.  There are good ski resorts within day-trip range.

This is one of those optimization week.  We had a blast skiing last weekend for the first few hours of the morning until the sky had diarrhea.  We have plans for the long Easter weekend and chances are that the sky will hold off just enough to keep the slopes viable.  Everything according to plan.  And then this:

Monday morning the school's principal is informed of two dozen confirmed Covid cases among students.  Good reaction: shut down school immediately.  No lunch break, kids remain in their class-bubble until transportation home is arranged.  Parents who can (me included) rush to pick up kids instead of letting them bus home.  More information follows in the evening.  List of affected class-bubbles and sports programs.  None of them is Munchkin's.  Plan for the rest of the week: Tuesday and Wednesday remote teaching.  Thursday PD day.  Yay, more fun with Munchkin.  I book tickets for another skiing day on that PD day.

Tuesday evening: the school is in the 5PM news.  Public health, conspicuously late and absent so far, decided to mass-test the whole school for Covid.  Parents were informed after the media.  Munchkin's grandmother knew before the email was in my inbox. Changed plan: Wednesday Covid-testing, Thursday remote teaching.  PD day cancelled.  Very gracious ski resort: refunded quickly, even if not legally required.

Logical consequence of testing: must self-isolate until results are known.

Wednesday I drive Munchkin in for testing.  No provision for parents/family testing.  So now waiting for Munchkin's result.  Being so close and so isolated from Munchkin hurts.  Waiting for the test results is daunting.  Can't focus on anything but checking email and phone and test portal way too often.  The thought that test results may not arrive before the weekend, and therefore ruin further plans, is daunting.  I know there is a non-zero probability that Munchkin got Covid at school, and I understand and accept that this would totally change our plans.  But I can't help being nervous waiting on test results.

But I don’t think this any more. A lot of people are just not drinking for health reasons, or other equally valid reasons. As long as they are ok with me drinking socially then it shouldn’t matter. As I age I can see myself drinking less and less. At this point I mainly drink socially and never in excess.

Trouble is, I really can’t think of a better first date than a drink. The second option is coffee, but I actually am very sensitive to coffee and tea (even decaf). Most of them give me horrible headaches and keep me up at night, and some cause allergic reactions (now I’m the high maintenance one!). Herbal teas are ok, but most just aren’t very good. And definitely don’t provide the same kind of mood as alcohol and/or good food.

What are some date suggestions other than alcohol and caffeine? I also don’t want a sugary drink. A meal is ok I guess, but I prefer the short “sip-n-see.” I also love hiking and strolling in the park, but would so much rather sit and face someone and talk to them. Know what I mean? 

There used be a coffee house in town that was also a gig spot and they served coffee, tea, and alcohol! But they closed down during the pandemic. In my town we only have coffee shops that close at 3, breweries that only serve beer, and sit-down restaurants.

  I am a 45 year old man. I have four kids from two different marriages. (Starting out bad already). My 2nd wife and I were divorced in 2011 and I’ve been single since. I’ve had a few flings here and there but nothing that was actually a relationship. As most men know child support is a kick in the nuts on your own. So it’s been a struggle but I’ve managed.
     After our divorce I watched my ex have so many men in and out of her life that the kids were confused and often scared. Some yelled a lot and some were violent. She is a good mom that just seemingly wants something she can’t find. I basically for the last eight years have opted to not dare. I didn’t want to confuse them or make them question when they were with me. 
     So that has also meant I haven’t been intimate with anyone in that 8 years. I have finally gotten to the point where I’m happy with my life. Happy with almost everything in it. Except a few. I’ll explain below.

     First off I have been gaining weight due to a thyroid issue that I have been getting under control. I am not happy with this aspect but I also know I can’t fix it over night. So that is the first issue.

      Secondly I have no idea how people date these days. I mean we have online dating that bases things off of your picture. You put some info there and then hope people see past the bigger you in the picture but most don’t. And admittedly I have a preference that I do the same shit. It’s frustrating and more like a grocery store than dating. So I’m lost. Today it seems if you look in someone’s direction you’re ogling them or whatever or your thirsty. I mean what in the hell am I supposed to do? This new normal sucks ass.

      Third, My sex drive is that of my teenage years. I can’t even explain just how bad it is. Women are beautiful and I enjoy looking and on Reddit it’s not hard to find many pictures of whatever interests you. I just can’t stop enjoying the beauty. Now in my opinion this isn’t healthy it just makes it worse. So then I limit the looking and wanting. Now that I’ve stopped doing that I find myself more attentive to sexy women in real life. I don’t stare or anything dumb but I notice EVERYTHING. It is making me nuts. The worst part is a most all of my friends are married. And their wives are mostly attractive. So then I find myself going to a place I shouldn’t in my mind. Now I may fantasize or wonder but I would never cross the line. Never. 

      Basically I would say I’m lost on where to go. So many people are like go out or so this online dating site. I have my youngest son at home so that makes it difficult to go out during the week. The grocery store was another one. I’m like not thinking that’s a good idea either. 

       One thing that has been bad for me is porn. Yes I watch it and I have had to slow that down too. I have found that when you watch enough of it you start to become self conscious about penis size. Now I’m an average guy but all of the things out there really take a toll on perception and how some people feel about themselves. I’m a pretty confident guy and don’t really have too many hang ups about myself. I have created the size one myself apparently. Some are size queens some say it doesn’t matter and I honestly don’t really care but reading posts on here and how people act it’s not very comforting. 

         In a nutshell I’m looking for direction. Yes I know where the gym is. I am looking for some suggestions or thoughts maybe even some insight. Not looking for negative stuff here.

-Want a woman to move in instantly for a serious relationship.

-Revolving door of women that they meet on social media, pretending they want a relationship to have booty calls.
-Flat angry about everything in life, particularly the ex-wife or ex-long term girlfriend who left them (newsflash, happy women don’t leave).

Sometimes it is a mixture of the above.

From what I hear from my guy friends, it’s very similar for the guys. One guy told me that women in their 50’s only want sex and not a relationship. Other guys complain about the false advertising in women’s photos (filters, body edits, etc.)

He has an ex-girlfriend that he was with for ten years that he is still close to. They broke up five years ago because they were at different places in life. He says she is his family, her adult kids are his family, and refers to her four grandchildren as being his grandchildren also. Families come in all sorts of flavors and compositions and although I don’t love any of this, I do my best to be accepting. His ex is 14 years older than him (hence the grandchildren) and has not dated anyone since they split up. I have not met her and I know my boyfriend is hesitant for us to meet. I think because his “worlds will collide” and it may change his relationship dynamic with his ex. She has expressed interest in meeting me.

I do not think there is anything romantic going on between them. What bothers me is that I feel that, in many ways, they are still each other’s go-to person. She is his emergency contact. She’s the beneficiary of his life insurance. When she needed help putting up a fence last summer he was there every single weekend, busting his ass in the blazing August and September heat to do it. She needs a ride to the airport on Saturday morning at 4am and asked him to take her. This means he and I can’t spend the night together on Friday but I doubt that was a consideration for him. This has been really bothering me since he told me last night. 

I don’t like this. I feel like I’m dating someone else’s person and she’s still his person, not me. I am new in his life and she’s been in it for well over a decade. Although he says he loves me, I know he would choose her and her family over me if it came down to it. 

Am I crazy to be bothered by this? It’s not that I think driving someone to the airport is problematic on its face, but I wouldn’t ask someone else’s partner to do that for me. I’m 100% sure that never even crossed her mind because he’s always helping her out and I’m sure I’m all but irrelevant to her.

I started to refer to her in my mind as “my Irresistible.” Then I observed others, many others, doing similar things, or others would tell me how they went through something like this.

For instance I knew a woman who was engaged to a man. But when her Irresistible would breeze into her life it was like she lost her mind and would cheat with her Irresistible.

Maybe an irresistible is one specific person or maybe it’s a type. For example, a female friend of mine was talking to a real good guy. She said she was already starting to “feel official” about him. But she took a road trip to visit family. And along the way she stopped, met a guy who was her “irresistible” type and she immediately had a one night stand with him — like forget about the other guy!

I've been seeing someone for the last few months who I've gotten to really like.  She's really relaxed and chill.  I feel like she has been a good friend.  We've both told each other we like each other and enjoy our conversations.

She has a couple issues affecting her health, one of which is trouble sleeping at night, which sometimes makes her very tired during the day to the point where she also gets bad headaches sometimes.  She has said she has had to take time off work to go rest.  She has had to cancel plans to meet with me a few times, which she has felt bad about, but she still gets together with me to hang out.  I've been patient, and several times she has said she feels like I'm a great friend for that and she really appreciates it and wishes she had met me a long time ago.

There have been a couple times when I've texted her to see if she'd want to get together, and she wouldn't respond until very late or the next day, and she'd say she was sleeping (due to her sleep condition).  She'll occasionally say sorry she missed my text and she would have enjoyed/loved to hang out.

We've tended to see each other about once a week, often on the weekend but occasionally once during the week.  And as mentioned, sometimes she hasn't always been available to meet up.

I've felt like I've gotten mixed signals from her as for whether she really likes me or not.  And recently, it has seemed like she has been a little more withdrawn.  I was starting to feel like she might not be very interested in me, and thus have been feeling a bit down.

Recently I had mentioned I'd be up for hanging out during the week after work if she wants.  She said she often feels tired and enjoys just relaxing after work.

We met for dinner recently and she told me she really does like me a lot and that I'm the nicest guy she has met, and she just needs time.  She said she knew she had been distant the past weekend when we hung out, and she said due to the way some of her family has treated her growing up, she doesn't know how to take compliments and affection.  She said she just needs time, and she said she's working through this with a therapist.  I told her I've been falling for her, and she said she has been falling for me too.  I felt relieved when she said that and felt better about where our potential relationship might go.  With what she says she's dealing with, I felt like she really does like me.

Then, in the middle of the week, I texted in the evening asking how her day went.  She said work was slow so she decided to go meet up with a friend who lives in another city about a 3-4 hour drive away.  She spent the night and texted me this morning and said she was almost back in town and was going to in to work.  I was surprised, as this seemed very spontaneous for something during the middle of the work week, particularly since she has sleep issues and she has said she's usually tired after work and wants to relax.

After she mentioned that, I started to wonder about it since it seemed unusual.  My feeling upbeat from our earlier conversation went back to feeling a bit down, and I wondered who might she be willing to drive that far to see and spend the night during the work week?  I know it really could just be a friend, but honestly it has been hard sometimes having feelings for her when things are going very slowly.

TL;DR: I've been patient with her, and we seem to really like each other, but as stated, she said she needs time.  She is guarded and seems to need time to open up due to past trauma.  I've been patient but it has been difficult for me.  With a sudden spontaneous visiting a friend who's a bit far, I've honestly wondered if she's seeing/talking to someone else, or if it could just be a good friend.

I'm asking the ladies. 

I know most men would simply reply to a question like that, and say ""I'm fine, thanks for asking.""  

Not sure why every woman has a problem with this simple, polite, introductory question, or why they're profiles say not to ask that, or they won't reply.  ""Ask me something about my profile"" they say. I would love to talk about your kids or travel plans, or your interests. Just not sure why saying ""hello, how are you?"" first is a problem. 

Isn't that how we talk in real life? 
I don't just walk up to women and start talking randomly about their interests. I would say hello first, to see if they are polite, and decent to talk to, then I would ask about their interests AFTER the initial greeting. 

I just don't know why women who are half way through life, and are still single, are dismissing totally polite, normal dudes who simply say hello to get the wheels of conversation turning.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,43776,public,self,"What is so wrong with saying ""Hi, how are you?"" on dating sites.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mi3jml/what_is_so_wrong_with_saying_hi_how_are_you_on/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been on dates in a relationship, but it's been a long time since I've been on a date seeing if I want to get into a relationship with a relative stranger. New experience.

Unfortunately, I read here about everyone's quirks and triggers to dismiss someone, and their frustrations and disappointments at not finding anyone.

*To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;*

*Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth*

*With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:*

*If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;*

*If lost, why then a grievous labour won;*

*However, but a folly bought with wit,*

*Or else a wit by folly vanquished.*

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I already won, going somewhere new, meeting someone new. Even if she blows my balls off with a shotgun when she first sets eyes on me, I feel like I'm ahead of the game. We'll see if she can interest me. I've had a lot of fun watching what my mind does in anticipation of this first date.

I hate the fact that people, especially in the world of OLD, think if they don’t get a text back quick enough or with enough words that the other person isn't interested and just a plain loser with no communication skills. 

This is damaging! 

And it’s simply not true!

In the old days before cell phones, potential love interests or even actual couples who weren’t living together or married weren’t tied to each other with an electronic leash. 

They had the freedom to breathe and explore life as an individual so that when they did communicate with the other person they had stories to tell. They were able to continue to grow individually, live life without the pressure of having to reply to texts in a timely manner or with enough sentences. And that’s perhaps just one of the reasons that relationships worked better before cell phones.

I hate when I hear someone blabbering off “It takes ten seconds to send a text, it’s rude to not text!” 

But does it REALLY take 10 seconds? 

If it does you’re not really communicating with the other person are you? Your satiating your need for attention, quelling your worry and discomfort that they don’t like you by hearing that ding with a “Hey how are you?” one-liner. If a text-only takes ten seconds you aren’t getting to know that person on any level that would lead to a fulfilling conversation... much less a relationship. You’re laying your comfort at the feet of someone else, instead of living your life, seeking your happiness inside, and THEN communicating with that person in hours-long genuine and intimate conversation, not ten-second one-liners. 

Texting IS time-consuming. 

Maybe the person you’re waiting on a text from has a job that requires a lot of them and when they get home they just want to mellow out and veg out in front of the screen and not have to think. Maybe they spend lots of time being present outdoors. Maybe they spend lots of time being present with loved ones (children, aging parents, lifelong friends, pets). Maybe they get buried in a book or daydreams. Maybe constant texting goes against their values and they’re more old-fashioned. Maybe one-sided texting isn’t anything to do with the person not texting but the person texting and their inability to self soothe. 

Examining my own texting habits and they’re pretty poor compared to most people and never does it have ill intent. I think it’s important for people to recognize that texting should never be a major form of communication nor should it be the be-all and end-all of what you form your decision making on whether or not to move forward with a developing or existing relationship. Texting means NOTHING, especially if you haven't met.

Now I am 40 and divorced (3 years), with kids. I live comfortably, but I don't feel able to divert large amounts of time, energy, or money away from maintaining my basic lifestyle and my kids' needs. I am unsure what I bring to the table for a potential partner. Also, I don't know how to develop a new philosophy for dating at my age, so I don't have any concrete dating goals beyond a vague longing to have someone other than my kids to hug randomly, and to feel that someone has my back.

On both Tinder and Hinge I've had the situation where you match with someone, send a message and just never even get a response probably four or five times each, which is annoying, but it is what it is.  What has been really frustrating is the matches that have resulted in days long text conversations that then inexplicably ended in ghosting.  I've had a few where a conversation started with some banter going back and forth ""Hey, how is your day going, what do you do, are you from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ originally, what do you like to do for fun, etc..?"" where the conversation seemed to flow easily and was not one sided.  A couple of those just literally stopped mid-stream.  After texting for about 30 minutes I asked one woman what she liked to do for fun besides (I referenced one of the things listed in her profile) and the conversation ended there-never heard from her again.  Another went on over the course of a couple of about a week-we talked about our favorite local restaurants, how our days/jobs were, etc...so finally this past Tuesday I asked her if we could meet for drinks at a local place we both liked.  She said sure and we set a date of this coming Saturday (tomorrow, at this point).  Wednesday morning I sent her a good morning message and heard nothing all day.  Nothing on Thursday, and then nothing today.  Sent a message around noon today, ""Hey just seeing if we're still on for drinks Saturday night?""  As of this writing, nothing...

I get it, women have their pick of whoever they want on these apps and there are plenty of other guys who are younger, better looking, in better shape, with more impressive careers than me.  My assumption is that these individuals found someone better to devote their time and resources to and that's fine-they didn't fall off of the face of the earth.

He cut straight to the chase and asked me out. I decided to take a chance and we agreed to meet Sunday. I didn't hear anything from him since, no chit chat, nada. Saturday night he messages to ask how am I placed for breakfast, but I don't find the message until around midnight. 

I've kinda lost interest because of the radio silence. It feels awkward because I have no idea who he is or what we're going to talk about. 

I interpret the silence as a lack of enthusiasm or interest. But I guess it's fair to say that went both ways and I could have messaged him and asked questions to try and navigate around the lack of info on his profile.
