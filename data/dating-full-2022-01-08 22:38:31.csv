We hit it off really well and I feel like we have a lot of chemistry. I could tell by the get go he was intrigued by me and we started to flirt. I developed a crush on him. He mentioned in passing in the beginning stages that he had a girlfriend, not as a defense mechanism — just came up organically in conversation. So I was like okay, maybe he just likes to flirt. But then I would catch him like lingering so he got the chance to talk to me or time things so we’d end up somewhere in the office at the same time. I catch him looking at me from across the office all the time. I can’t help but feel like he has a crush on me too. So then, after a couple months, a close friend of mine died and he found out. I was visibly upset the next time I went into his office and he saw me from afar. We didn’t talk that day. I think he was nervous because I was upset. So then, I left the office when I was finished and went out to the parking lot to my car and he ran out to me. He said he was so so sorry for what happened and if I needed anything to let him know — like take me out for a drink. I said you know what that sounds great. So we planned to get drinks at a later date. Drinks happen. Great conversation. We flirt and there is some major sexual tension. But nothing physical happens and we don’t acknowledge our feelings for eachother. Just innocent flirting. He mentions his girlfriend during drinks and proceeds to tell me she’s very jealous of other girls — which leads me to believe she did NOT know he had taken me out to drink or even know I exist. But while he was complaining about their aspect of her, I don’t get the jist that they’re an unhappy couple.Our friendship gets stronger after the drinks and I still notice him going out of his way to get in front of me and have conversation every time I’m in his office. He still playfully flirts and will walk me out to my car when I have a lot of stuff to carry. He covered drinks when we went last time and I wanted a follow up, so one day when he walked me out, I asked him if he wanted to get another round of drinks, my treat. And he kind of got a panicked look on his face and said yeah I’ll let you know, I really want you to meet my girlfriend. And so I was like okay, that was a shut down if I ever saw one. I was obviously upset but knew it was a long shot — more embarassed than anything. I was more worried that he was going to get weird and our dynamic would be over because I just really enjoy being around him. So the next time I saw him, I was nervous what to expect but he acted the same as always and we’ve even gotten closer from that point. I have curbed my flirting with him because when he turned me down for drinks, I just felt like he was establishing a boundary and I wanted to respect it. He still finds a way to flirt with me. Still goes out of his way to talk to me, still walks me to my car sometimes if I have heavy stuff, and I catch him looking at me from the across the office all the time. So basically, I just need some insight from an independent third party. I’m getting somewhat attached to his friendship. And I believe he’s going to be promoted soon and he will be moved to another location that I don’t go to for work. I have so much anxiety about this happening. I just feel like we’re on borrowed time and our friendship only exists inside the four walls of that office. I understand he’s in a relationship and I want to respect that but I also just love being his friend. I just worry we’re not going to be able to keep in touch because of his girlfriend for obvious reasons. I am sad thinking about how he might not be in my life at all in a matter of months.

This is my first time on Reddit, and kind of hate that I admitted to writing a post. I have just been really unsuccesful in my dating life and kind of don't get it anymore. Sorry for the long story, I just also feel like venting a bit.

Here is the situation. I live in the Netherlands, and back in November I was invited to a neighbor's party in my student building. There I met a girl from Finland who I seemed to click with. At one point I noticed her sitting on the hallway, seemingly in pain. I asked what was up and turned out she got in a car accident a while ago, got a whiplash and was in pain. I offered her to take her to my apartment downstairs, to allow her a quiet place. We watched a movie that night and I let her sleep on the couch. Next day I proposed to take her home, but she said ""I would actually like to stay"". So I proposed to watch Netflix and at one point I decided to push my luck and ask if she wanted to come sit with me. She didn't hesitate a second and we cuddled the rest of night. She even slept in my bed with me and even though no sex happened we cuddled the rest of the night. Next day she had to go back to Finland for three months for her internship, but she said ""So I guess I will be seeing you again then?"". Of course I said ""Yes we will."".

But with all the bad experiences I've had with people, I learned not to have any expectations. I decided to keep focusing on myself, and while still wanting to reach out to her here and there, remain at the background a bit until she would back by the end of January. Every day though, she would text me on her initiative. Showing me stuff of her life, and asking how I was doing. I already know some of the advice dating coaches give and decided not to text too much, not to initiate it, and not to be too available. I prioritized my studying and only replied in the evenings or otherwise the next day. This was also not lose myself in this girl too soon while things are so unknown because of the distance.

We talked every day, mostly some boring small talk. Sometimes though, we did have more personal conversations and we both told each other some really personal things and our connection grew over text. Very often she would hint on seeing me again, saying stuff like ""I think we both feel the same way"", ""I wish I could see you now"", ""I actually miss you"", ""If you are gonna make that trip I would love to join"", ""If this thing goes the way I hope ..."", ""We will make it happen"". And much more. Slowly I fell into the trap of trusting this girl and got a bit of feelings.

This all continued without change for two months. This Christmas break she went to Switzerland for a ski trip with her family. She still kept talking to me every day, but slightly less (of course because she was skiing). Still, every single day she would ask me how my day was, until December 31. Nothing had happened between us but I got no reply back to my last message (she didn't even read it either). I thought she was with family as it was New Year's Eve. But when it became midnight and the year 2022 came around and I sent her happy new year wishes, I did not get a reply back. Last time I had heard from her was December 30. I started feeling a bit uneasy and convinced myself I was feeling like that because of my relationship traumas and insecurities, and that probably nothing was up. But I also knew this girl tends to get into accidents (she really does, besides her car crash) so I was worried she got into a skiing accident. I texted her again at 6 am when I left my friend's house after a new year's eve party, asking her if she could confirm she was okay. No reply. I went to sleep and decided to call her at 10 am, nothing. Called at 2 pm, nothing. Noticed she was online on Whatsapp, but had not read my messages. Sent two more texts saying ""Could you please text me you're fine, I am really worried right now, please. I feel really shitty now"". Maybe coming on a bit too strong there (first time I ever did that btw), but again I was really worried as she tends to get into accidents and it's nothing for her not to wish me a happy new year. Something in my gut told me this was off. Well I finally got a reply a 3 pm at new year's day. She said ""I had some semi shitty days and I need some time away from people."". I said I would support her if she needed, but to take her time.

That same evening I got a long text saying that not her, but her dad, got into a skiing accident and ended up in hospital with a broken eye socket. He was awake and not in a life threatening situation. They also managed to get him back to Finland. She said the accident had already happened December 28 (when we were still talking fine), that she got into a lot of fights with her grandmother over there in the aftermath of the accident, who called her ""selfish for wanting to go out on New year's eve."" She ended the message with ""I just need time away from people right now, especially my grandmother. I just need another vacation far away from anybody I know."" I again said I would support her if she needed. I asked if she managed to get back to Finland, to which she replied ""Yea"" on January 2nd. This would be the last time we talked.

I did not respond to that message because, apparently, she communicated she needed space. I wasn't sure if that meant space from me as well, but she said ""time away from people"" so I assumed yes. I thought if I would just wait a few days she would come around talk to me again. But it's been a week now and she still didn't. My gut is slowly starting to tell me something is up which has got something to do with me too, and not just her dad.

I get that this is a shitty situation for her, but would it make sense for her to need space from me too? But why three days after the accident and not right away? And would it make sense for her to stop talking to me too, while the situation is in her family and has nothing to do with me?

How do I deal with this situation? Do I ask her how she is doing? Or do I keep quiet, like I'm doing now, because she ""needs time away from people""? 

I know this is ""technically"" not ghosting, as she was the last one sending a message, but I cannot respond much to ""Yea"", plus she is the one saying she needed space. I have respected that so far, and not made any stupid moves yet. But I really don't know how to interpret this situation. I feel really confused and it makes me question my every move, but I really couldn't think of something I might have done. Our communication just changed out of nowhere, and I don't get it.

Is this ghosting, and does it seem like she is pushing me away? If not, how I deal with this?

If it is, it would really suck to have yet another shitty experience, and to have fallen into that trap of a girl making you believe they are trustworthy and that you are important to them. Happened to me so many times before (also with people in general), that I really don't know what to believe anymore from people.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150324,public,self,Is this ghosting or not?

On Saturday afternoon I texted her asking when she would be available on Sunday for the date and she replied a few hours later saying she was busy with her son and she would talk to me right away. That day she didn't talk to me after that. She then changed her Whatsapp profile picture, uploaded a few photos on instagram and at 3 am she uploaded a story on instagram having a beer with a friend, I think they were in her house.

On Sunday, the day of the date, she sent me a message at 3.30 pm telling me that she was very busy and her parents would be back home at night so she couldn't leave her kid with them and then asked me if we could meet when she came back from her vacation.

I didn't reply and we haven't talked since then.

A friend of hers told me that she never replies on time and that it's not personal.

We share a number of interests and have good chemistry on dates and amazing chemistry physically. We slept together after the first date and again after the second. After the second date I'm starting to grow more attracted to her and want to get to know her better and am interested in our connection beyond just the sex. However, I can't tell if she feels the same way. I feel like I am investing more into it than she is in terms of displaying eagerness to see each other and keep communication going when we're apart via text.

She seems interested in me on our dates, asks me a lot of questions, we laugh a lot, she is attentive, hasn't blown me off, we held hands and kissed more often on the second date, etc. However when I ask what she's doing the next week in order to set up another date she acts very playful and coy saying something like ""hmm I don't knowww"", leaving it to me to initiate everything. Also both times after we've had sex she is quick to leave my apartment, seeming like she's in a rush, and says she has a busy day at work the next day and needs to get home. When we are not together the texting game is pretty odd. She never initiates texts, and doesn't really respond to any flirtations I send over text. She'll respond to my texts pretty quickly if I send a question or if I haven't messaged her in awhile, but a lot of other times she won't respond at all if I send something that is a little random or something light-hearted like a joke (for like days and then I'll message again to break the silence) .

Knowing her profession she is indeed likely really busy during the work week and seems to have a very active social life on weekends. However, the weird texting and her being coy and having me initiate everything has driven me to start to overthink everything and I am wondering constantly if she's actually into me or not. I don't necessarily want to dive into a heavily committed relationship at the first opportunity, but of course if it's someone I really develop feelings for I'm totally open to it.

i just found out the guy I’m seeing was diagnosed as a psychopath at 4 years old

so I’m visiting the guy I’m seeings moms house. we go through some old stuff and find a big, thick binder. we open it and it’s full of full length paragraphs and daily notes like a journal. probably 100 pages. i come to notice these pages are documentation paragraphs, and documents concerns of (let’s call him John) John as a child. the papers went on and on. they seemed to be documentation of him at a Psychiatric facility. I keep reading and I see tons of hand written notes by doctors and psychologists. they had numerous quotes stating his violent behavior and actions. he was 4… in preschool. the notes read “we are extremely concerned about johns behavior. he continues to threaten, be violent, and cause problems daily. Our concerns for John are that he violently harms animals, small children, the adults and staff at the daycare.” “John shows absolutely no remorse for his actions, and when in “that mindset”, John will harm others and destroy students work with a big smile on his face”. 

What I’m saying , is that this kid checked off every box for being a psychopath at a very young age. 

I keep searching and i find notes about how he would threaten to kill the other students. One day, he said “I’m going to kill you joe.” And shoved his teacher off a tall loft. There were more notes about how we would purposely and unprovoked hit and shove others to harm them. He was seriously violent and had to be removed from many schools. He was taken to a university hours away to be researched and evaluated. This was all documented…. In a thick binder. I’m freaking out. I confronted him, and he says he’s not like that any more after years of therapy. I have no real clue when it all “ended” and he became normal. He’s never struck me as threatening or dangerous , but this completely changes my mind. The sad part is I know he had a difficult childhood, and this is mostly a reflection of what he grew up around. But i have no indication if it is deeper than that, and he still buries these feelings to this day and hides it. 

Look, i know kids can be scary and weird and it means nothing. But this seems extreme, and i wonder if it affects him today because i don’t think that shit ever goes away. He was kicked out of daycares due to violence, and needed special teachers that could handle him. Help please.


TLDR: so this guy I’m seeing i found out by a file in his moms house that he was evaluated by a mental facility and researched on because he showed every sign of being a psychopath as a child. hurting animals and hurting other kids, violent and angry, non sympathetic and no remorse. it freaked me out I really like him though, it’s hard to know what to do. he clearly isn’t like that anymore",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150327,public,self,i just found out the guy I’m talking to was diagnosed as a psychopath,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzd3lh/i_just_found_out_the_guy_im_talking_to_was/,no_ads,0,,,

I am recently out of long relationships, I was engaged and my sexual life was pretty frustrating, so now I’m kind of experiencing and compensating for that. 

In December I started kind of seeing one guy, we slept pretty fast, continued hanging out and being pretty romantic afterwards. (Going to restaurants, for walks, having more sexual experiences) 
However, we never had “who are we” kind of talk and didn’t promise anything to each other. He also is a very nerdy, IT type of guy, workaholic (even though personality otherwise is sweet and respectful) , so for relationships he definitely doesn’t give me enough attention and that was same problem he had in his previous relationship. I considered him more being a “lover” for me. Then he left to his home country for a month. We never could text well (he just doesn’t know how to do it), all communication was happening live. When he left, we almost never communicated, very dry checking on each other. 


So during his absence another guy asked me out, we had a little pre-story, we were in the same social circle but both in relationships. I went out. On the second date we ended up sleeping with each other. After that day he also had his vacation booked and left the country for a week. During the whole week he was trying to maintain contact and even invited me to join the trip. He came back now, we met and had more dates, one more intercourse. I truly don’t know if we will be a good match as a couple, I’m still looking. We kind of communicating very cheesy romantically, but there never was who are we or exclusivity talk either. 

First guy has returned from his trip though and asking to see me right away. 

If I had been in a talking stage with these guys, I’d totally go on dates with both. But now that I slept with both and kinda maintaining it, it feels wrong. Even though technically I didn’t promise anything to either one and they didn’t ask me also.

The date went for about an hour and she said that she wanted to run out to do a few errands. She said she didn't have much to do after the date and she asked what I was doing for the rest of the day.

She said something along the lines that she can't decide now as she's thinking about her errands. (Basically, a no.)

I went to to rehab, had three years of probation which I completed no problem. I’ve been clean ever since. Luckily only one small local news website published my case when I was arrested 5 years ago. It was posted on their Facebook page and man, people were really nasty in the comments. If you google my name there is a link to that same story. Luckily though there’s someone with my same name who is much more active online and the story is now on the 4th page of results. 

I’m not trying to hide it from anyone but I’m also not sure when to bring it up. I’ve been to therapy about it because it was a pretty complex case. It wasn’t just me having pills that weren’t mine and the cops found them. The whole experience has left me with PTSD according to my psychiatrist.

Quick warning, this is going to be a LONG post, to simply set a timeline, and to explain my situation in full. I'll include a TLDR at the end to save your poor eyes from all that lengthy ranting.

I am in desperate need of advice. I have never been so emotionally spent and exhausted, and the waves of despair and anger are starting to drive me to the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do anymore, and what emotions are fair to feel and which are not. 

Let's start with the beginning of 2021. I am an active duty military member, and I began with a lovely deployment notice. Not such a huge deal, my branch and my position does not really get very dangerous deployments. It was supposed to be a piece of cake. It was not. 

To explain myself, I am someone who is very self conscious about her self image. I am 19, barely out of high school, and I married someone who I thought would be my lifelong partner in sept. of 2020. We had been together since I was thirteen just after my mother’s passing, and I thought that he was the best thing to ever happen to me. He knew I felt that way, and it is what I give credit to a lot of our issues. His arrogance, and my baggage. And things were okay, for a little while. I enlisted to provide, because it has always been my dream to have a happy, perfect and well cared for family. He was injured previously from his own failed enlistment attempt whilst we were still in high school, (though all doctors said he was fine..) and that was a common excuse he used not to work and only allow me to. The image I projected to my co-workers and family that I was happy was far from the truth. We fought often, and he constantly verbally abused me, and there were occasional instances of physical abuse. Gaslighting me because I had issues with the way that he refused to work and did not cook even, or look after our dog. And then, to top it off, cheating on me by sexting with multiple women online. 

I didn't see the issues until I deployed and met people who, thankfully, knew me too little to not be totally honest with me. They helped me see that I was not in a normal position and that the manipulation ran deep. I could do better.. And by July, I informed my husband that by October when I came home, he was to leave our apartment and I would be filing for divorce. 

If you would expect that to have been it, honestly, same here. But, enter a friend from Japan who had confessed to me whilst I was engaged a year prior, though I had no feelings for. I trusted this friend a lot.. And I expected those feelings to die, with the passage of time, and our multiple lengthy discussions about how I did not feel the same way. I needed someone to talk to-- anyone. I trusted him. But, once he found out about my divorce, he started to change almost instantly. He started making countless advances toward me over text despite the many times that I warned him I felt uncomfortable, I wanted to be treated as a friend, and that if he continued down this path, he would be hurt (to which he consistently and foolishly stated, “I don’t care.”). I cared for him deeply and the last thing I wanted was his pain. But.. he would always stop for a little while.. Before continuing before I could realize it, and lines were getting blurred no matter how hard I tried to keep them strict. I am not all innocent in allowing this to happen and occasionally even partaking in a comment or two. However.. His persistence and my weakness of not cutting him off out of fear I would lose him resulted in a horrid fallout, all rooting with a choice to visit in person once I returned after he saw his family, in what I thought would be a warm hearted friendly reunion. 

Before this friend of mine and I visited, we can call him A. I was to see my own family a couple of states away for my brother’s big wedding. I was excited.. My brother deserves happiness more than anyone I know, given all that he and myself have been through. But, whilst I was there, I made a connection with a childhood family friend, and my eldest brother’s best friend, who we can call J. I have known him longer than even my husband, and he has always been (as cringe as it sounds) ‘My older brother’s cute friend that is way out of my league.’. He’s kind, understanding, and always makes me laugh. He has always been very sweet to me, but for the first time it felt as if he were flirting with me during my stay.. Though, I don’t value myself much. I kept telling myself I was imagining it, and there was simply no way.. And then I went home, and my cursed visit with A began. 

Off the bat, as soon as I saw him in person, The air around him changed very much compared to how it felt when I knew him for over a year at this point prior. He brought many gifts to me from overseas.. But it reeked to me of an ulterior motive past just just being friends. I appreciated them.. But they made me feel a little uncomfortable as well, and I felt guilty taking them at all. But I knew it would only hurt him more were I to refuse, or at least, that's what I thought. Following the course of the week, he helped me move apartments, and insisted on paying for many things, despite me telling him over and over again that not only does he not need to, I don’t really want him to. But he did anyway.. He helped me move, and things were a little awkward from there on. He seemed to be passive aggressive because I had him sleep on the couch as if I were supposed to just let him hop into bed with me, and eventually things exploded into a big confrontation. We had a conversation about how I felt about him.. And how I didn’t, and tears were shed on both sides. We didn’t talk.. We avoided one another in my own home for a day or two before I gently suggested (i didn’t kick him out) that maybe he would spend more time with his family, and off he went. 

In turn, once he left, J came over to visit to check on me from my home state, about 5 hrs away, because we had discussed him visiting anyway when I was down for my brother’s wedding. I was in a rough emotional state.. And he was worried. He spent four days with me, and nothing super strange happened. We ate out.. I cooked. We explored the town.. And eventually, he confesses to me. At this point I had emotionally cut ties from my husband about five months ago, and I really admired J. I felt love again, despite thinking I was not deserving of it. Maybe I still am not ready.. But I wanted to take a leap of faith. And I did.. And I don’t regret it. I have never felt so respected and heard and genuinely loved before.. And I feel happy in that aspect. It has been three months since then, and we are making the distance work. 

Suffice to say, when I told A about this over the phone, he exploded. He said that I was a terrible, toxic person. He said that I wasted his trip, time, and his money (despite him originally coming down to visit family anyway..) and has been publicly bashing my personality on other reddit pages, without mentioning my name. He said that he hates me more than anyone else, and that I wasn’t really happy with J. That I was just filling a void, that I was a piece of shit, and that everything that happened was my fault. He said I could never be happy, and that he would like nothing else but to watch me burn, and watch me fail. Due to the stress of my divorce, A promotion board that came up, and other personal matters, I began experiencing heart issues and arrhythmias that pre exist in my family. I’ve been in and out of the ER, and my confidence and happiness has taken a big hit. Of course as soon as A saw this on my page, he touted my health issues as proof of how shit of a person I am and seemed almost happy that my health was declining, saying that it was because of “what i did to him”. And things were quiet for a while.. But eventually, we made contact about a month later. He called me horrid again and was accusing me of being some alt account who reached out to him randomly, but after clearing it up, we were.. Okay, for a few days. I thought we could really make up.. Apologize, take blame where we both needed to. And whilst he messaged me in discord feigning concern and kindness, he still continued to publicly bash and call me horrible things. At that time.. I said nothing, and simply removed him. 

Some people might even be able to work out who I am based on this.. And If so, I hope that you can have an open mind about there being more than one face to a story. I am not a monster. I am a person, and I didn’t simply add fuel to the fire just to watch it burn. I’m hurting, too. And I just want this to get better, or at least easier. 

For advice.. I want honest opinions. I know I must stop reaching out to him to try to fix something broken beyond belief, and I think starting now.. I am done with it. Once I saw what he was continuing to say about me, I couldn't. My heart hurts so much, I can’t comprehend how someone I cared about so much could paint such an awful image of me and say those things, as some things cannot be excused out of heartbreak, in my opinion. I don’t hate him, even if he hates me. I just.. Hurt. I hurt so much. Please, tell me what I did wrong, and what I could do better. Is this all my fault? I keep blaming myself. I won't let the pain swallow me whole anymore. I have grown past that. But not allowing it to weigh on me at all is cowardly. 

And any advice from someone who has gone through anything similar on how I can continue this relationship that I have found without letting the toxicity reach me would make me so happy. Some of the things A said really do get to me. I.. I know I am happy with J, but sometimes those words come back to haunt me. I don’t want to worry about anyone else in my life who has nothing but toxicity to add, I want to fortify this newfound happiness and work on myself.

I have had a kind of long history of dating, but this time was different, and felt like the real deal.

Both of us shared the same likes, and both of us found eachother's hobbies and intertests super interesting, both career driven, and somewhat stable.

The thing that made this different compared to the other women I had dated was the mutual acts of service - she brought me soup when I was unwell, I'd bring her lunch when she was working from home, making each other coffee in the morning, etc.

Things looked like they were ramping up, sex was amazing, she had introduced me to her friends, and she even had a polaroid of her and I up on her fridge.

We had spent Christmas Eve together, enjoyed a great meal cooked by her, cuddled up on the couch for a wholesome christmas movie, exchanged gifts. My family doesnt really celebrate the holiday, so for me, it was a great feeling that someone wanted to share their Christmas with me.

Later that evening, when intimate, we both told each other that we were really into each other.

The time between Christmas, she spent time with family, and visited friends. During this time, we had made plans to see eachother and do things when she had returned from visiting her friends. I had opened up letting her I know I was a little down because I couldnt arrange plans for NYE, as my friends live far and wide/ are isolating. I also told her that I miss her and that I'm looking forward to seeing her again. I also mentioned that I had really appreciated spending Christmas Eve with her, as explained above that my family doesnt really do Christmas. You know, words of affirmation, nothing too clingy or cringe. All I said that what I missed her, appreciated her, and tat I was looking forward to seeing her.

Three days after christmas, she asked to see me, came over to my place, explained that this was not working, that I'm more open with feelings compared to her. That she might contact me in a few weeks, and that we were breaking up.

The following day after exchanging a couple of messages, she explained to me that during the time that we had been together, she should have been feeling more strongly about me than she really did, and it didnt feel that those feelings would change, and that she felt that it was unfair to pretend otherwise.

Not long after that, I reinstalled a dating app and she was the first person to pop up to swipe on. That did feel like a bit of a blow. I know I deleted mine when we were dating, but I didn't ask her to delete hers - so I'm just assuming that the profile was still active while we were seeing eachother.

If she was feeling this way for a while, why make plans to see eachother when she had returned, why tell me that she was really into me - only to backflip a couple of days later?

I'm also unsure why she still follows me on instagram. Maybe she'll contact me in a week or two, maybe she's following to keep tabs on what I'm up to, maybe she just has not thought about it and just has not unfollowed.

Being someone who has dated quite a fair bit over the past few years, I dont understand why people need to put a timeline on things - I mean I'm happy to just pursue a friendship if it looks like a romantic relationship isnt going to continue or to form. It seems that everone is just looking for cliche movie fireworks, and are less interested in taking a step back to let a friendship grow. Especially being in my thirties, already finding it difficult to establis new frienships in a new city.

I'm looking for answers that I'm not going to get, I just felt that venting to random people on the intenet may put some things into perspective. I'm feeling quite empty at the moment, and I'm a bit of a husk of my former self.

Recently he expressed concern (which I share) that our relationship is too reliant on the physical, and he wanted to make an effort to stay away from sexual contact for a while in favor of planned intentional dates. He confessed to having major commitment issues in previous relationships, and would end relationships in the past when they became too difficult.

Of course I wont go around telling girls this. And of course I wont hype myself too much only to dissapoint. Even though it makes sense for me to just do my thing and leave... I dont want to dissapoint.

I pulled him to the side when I found out and asked him if that were true. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. I was disappointed, but since we live in different countries, I figured we could be internet friends at least. However, he rejected my Instagram request. I blocked John for a couple of days.

The day after, Jim messaged me asking me if I was okay. I wasn't. I told him that I hated John. John should come clean about his feelings, and tell his girlfriend that he's an asshole to her, and let her go. I was crying, and I said a lot of things I shouldn't have. I told Jim that I about my bulimia problem, and my suicidal thoughts. That I was really struggling, and that I think about ending it almost every day.

Jim was definitely shaken by what I said, but he still tried to be caring and empathetic to my situation. However, he told another friend, and that friend told John. John knows what I said, and he hasn't done anything to me, but all I know is that he broke up with his girlfriend. I don't know if he told her about me, but they're not together anymore.

However, when I was 17 I was SA’d by a classmate but I couldn’t identify it as that-resulting in me (stupidly) proclaiming that I had my first kiss. It caused a rift between my best guy friend and he was very upset to say the least. 

I’ve never actually told my guy friend that is what really happened. I couldn’t. 

For the next 7 years, there was a lot of argumentative days between him and I-and he’d flirt with my friends. I hated it.

I saw my first love back in November and I realized then I would always love him, but because he was in a relationship with another girl, I’d never tell him out of respect for his relationship. 

When I saw him in November, I was worried because of our history that he wouldn’t even want to see me. But he did, and he came back from working out and when I walked in, I immediately felt calm around him. 

The whole time that I was at his house, I could feel his eyes on me when I was talking to his family. In the photo we took together, he has his arms around me and is holding me close. 

When I left, I was a little nervous. But he wrapped me up into a hug and held me there for a few minutes. 

I posted the photo on Facebook, thinking it was no big deal, and tagged them in it. 

He and his girlfriend broke up recently after 5 years, and I feel bad because I feel like I caused it, even though I never directly told him that I have feelings for him still.

For:

-long term relationships beat short term relationships in terms of overall value and significance.

Against:

-that doesn't necessarily mean you need to be ""married"" to someone in order to form a long term bond.

For:

-it takes care of the reproductive question so you can focus on other things. Instead of constantly having to learn a new person, you have a go to person for your intimate relationship needs.

Against:

-you are arbitrarily locking yourself to someone who may change, who you may not be compatible with down the line.

For:

-it gives you stability 

Against

-it restricts mobility and freedom becaus everything you do must work for both of you.

For:

-you can make exponential more money since you combine finances and grow together. 

Against:

-whoever makes more is taking a significant financial risk and may end up paying money to someone whom they love but can't see anymore.

For:

-I have fun in relationships and love spending time with my girlfriend 

Against:

-that still doesn't mean we need to get married to keep enjoying each other

For:

-its a religious sacrament and seen as spiritual and holy

Against:

-I am not very religious anymore

I am in NO way interested in dating this girl as I don't find her attractive in terms of looks(yes I am a superficial @$$hole sorry😂) 

Another guy and her are developing something during this trip(and probably before it)and I find it great for them and I am happy for them especially if it goes well  but I am just a bit jealous that I don't really get the same chances to do something like that. I am trying to meet a girl my type who I could like who happened to be single at that time and it never happens and when it does it never seems to progress much further for whatever reasons 

My social l skills are mostly fine, I am average appearance wise etc. 

My social life needs some work but I am working on it. 

The point of the post is that I just felt jealous. Not in a toxic way but I just thought"" How great for them that they just clicked like that"" I am trying to find something similar while improving  what I want to improve and  it is just not working.I am not feeling like it is hopeless but it just hasn't happened but I just felt a bit unmotivated and helpless.

Just wanted to let u know the full context of this situation. 

I recently got out of a 3 month long relationship. She was exactly what I wanted but things just ended up not working out and she left me. I took it pretty well and it doesn't bother me. But I've been a bit lonely bc I'm stuck with my parents on winter break until college starts up. I feel like things between me and her got cut short and that I won't find someone like her again.

Me and this girl are buddies at work and we chat about relationships a lot. She said she's got a friend that hadn't dated before. We talked about it and eventually I suggested that her friend and I should get to know each other. She thought it was a good idea so she gave me her snap.

I'm planning on texting her tomorrow and seeing where it goes. 

The issue is that I don't really know what I want at this point. I haven't had sex in like 5 months bc my ex didn't believe in sex until marriage (which I was cool with). I also want to hook up a lot bc my ex before this one slept around a lot a while after we broke up and a part of me needs to do the same to get even. She's starting to eat at my mind. I was fine while I was with my last girl but it's creeping back on me now that I'm alone, probably bc she's the last person I had sex with and was the only person I had sex with for close to a year.

My co-worker says that she's a shy good girl which is my type. But a part of me feels like I shouldn't jump into this bc if she doesn't want to have sex then I'd let her down by either breaking things off or replacing her with another girl.

From the pictures I've seen, she looks real cute. 

I just don't want her getting too attatched early on or jump into things too fast. I'd need to know what page she is on when it comes to sex first before we're committed.

Another things is that my co-worker's got another friend whose open to hooking up but I already got this girl's snap so I don't wanna seem like I'm hopping to all her friends.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150429,public,self,My (19m) work buddy (18f) is hooking me up with her friend (17f) but idk what I want,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rziq7p/my_19m_work_buddy_18f_is_hooking_me_up_with_her/,no_ads,0,,,

They both were dead silent and I looked around like ""Wait... you guys went? Why didn't you tell me?"" They awkwardly scrambled to explain it but eventually just stopped talking and we all just sat there in a silence. His girl texted me saying ""I'm so sorry I didn't know they did that. I'm so sad right now."" The amount of anxiety I was feeling built up until I broke the silence, telling them what they did was really shitty and asking why they didn't tell me they went. I got up after saying that and went into the bedroom. His cousin and his girl left not even 5 minutes later. I would have just gone with my friend if he had said he was going to watch it so it made no sense for him to lie.

After a while he decided to end things so I had to move on. Now I’ve discovered 5 months later he’s following relationship advice videos even though we were super into each other but he did not want a relationship at that time…he still checks out my social media and stalks me sometimes.

I met up with a guy I had matched with on Facebook dating. The first thing I disliked was he kept talking about how much money he has and my friend was with me. He offered to buy us things….I felt he was trying to buy me. I never had someone offer to buy me something. I immediately found this a red flag, I honestly felt uncomfortable. I was honest with him about rescheduling the meet up since I have not been working. He insisted he didn’t care and really want to meet me, He paid for my friend and mine movie ticket. While waiting for the movie to start, we were talking about the clothing store shein. He said he recently ordered about $300 worth of clothing. I saw he ordered mostly woman clothing and accessories. I thought to myself maybe that’s for his sister. Then when he closed the app I saw a girl and a caption that said “I love you”. She was showing a lot of skin….I immediately felt disrespected. I lied to him saying my brother needed the car back since I was driving his car. He said “that’s fine” and proceeded to leave with me. That’s when I said “we should go out separate ways. He said “alright” then walked away. I texted him afterwards telling him what happened and to take care. He replied with “you’re very immature, u don’t even talk”. He blocked me immediately after I replied. I don’t usually talk a lot to people i have never met before. At the same time I feel I dodged a bullet. Never have I dealt with this before.
