I live in an urban area, I have a nice bachelor pad, lots of space, very charming. 

However, I find that I'm clashing with city women because I don't want to get vaccinated and I believe the coronavirus stuff is largely a pile of bullshit and it's enabling the government to severely infringe on civil liberties. 

On the other hand, conservative country girls like the one who flaked on me today, they're looking for something different. Not me, and I guess I'm not looking for them either.

I'm not poor, but I'm not into the whole ""poor people are lazy"" shit either, and I think that's where I clash with those types of people. I also am not willing to live in bum fuck nowhere despite coming from a small town area. 

So where is the in between? This seems really difficult to figure out. I'm open to different types of people, but it seems like everyone else around me is so rigid that if I don't check all their boxes they just aren't interested. 

I'm not an ugly dude either, women approach me in public places like bars. I do OK at Bumble, and I know that's something because a lot of my friends never get a single match.

Let me preface by stating that I am writing this post while flying back home, so if there are any grammatical and/or mechanical errors I am apologizing in advance. 

I started dating this guy approximately three months ago. Although it has only been three months, I haven’t felt this safe around somebody before. He’s somebody I wasn’t expecting to find in my mid-twenties. Basically, what I am attempting to admit to myself is that I may be in too deep with this one. I’ll save you guys the spare time and not focus on the mushy content and outline the two significant problems that’s impacting my mental health and emotional well-being at the moment. 

Pt. 1 
A few weeks ago, I had located his secure text messaging apps where there were hundreds of messages from individuals where they were exchanging flirtatious messages (think rated R). I didn’t mention anything to him until a couple of days later to recollect myself. When I inquired about it, he had lied a couple of times until I threatened to leave his apartment. He finally admitted to it and confided in me that he was embarrassed about it because he had been doing this since he was lonely (yes, I do believe this man). I told him we would work through it. Then, I realized he downloaded &amp; installed a pass lock app after I mentioned what I found. I understand that I invaded his privacy, but whenever I asked about it he said that had been installed for awhile. This is yet another lie. At this point, I don’t know if it’s worth continuing to improve and strengthen our relationship when I might be incapable of trusting him again.

Pt. 2 
(No judgement, solely advice please) 
I have been “sugaring” for the past couple of years. I was raised by a low SES family and was deprived of experiences that my friends had while growing up.

I was in a terrible place emotionally at this time, as is apparent by my decision to cheat on all the partners I had. I've gone through a bit of therapy and am continuing to seek higher levels of it for PTSD.

Fast forward to today, we've been friends for over a year now, have had some platonic fun together, but I find myself being attracted to the qualities that she has as a human being, obviously without any sexual contact. She's a sweet person, caring with her friends and family, and as a single mother, she's attentive and caring for her very young daughter. 

She's recently come out of an abusive relationship, as have I, and we've been supportive to each other in our recoveries. She's also been supportive of my journey through cleaning up from hard drugs and my struggle with alcoholism.

We recently had a brief discussion about having an interest in each other again, but there's something I'm really worried about. She has a chronic sti from her abusive relationship. I'm concerned if we do decide to try a relationship that involves sexual contact, and I end up with the sti, but the relationship doesn't work.

I value her as a person, but I am also concerned for myself. I've come so far in turning my life around, and I don't want to end up with something I can't beat if she and I don't work out.

She was disappointed in me because she felt that I promised her things that I couldn’t keep and now she can’t trust me when I tell her that my goal is to go Israel and be with her .  2 weeks ago she told me she can’t do this long distance relationship anymore that she loves me completely but it’s to hard for her and she doesn’t want to feel this way. That she needs me there with her . So we broke up. Even tho that’s the last thing I wanted to do.

I was devastated. I felt like I was being broken up with again . It’s killing me inside the thought of losing her and all I want to do now is move on.  So here lies the question . Should I tell her yes come visit me for two weeks and meet my family and friends and let’s have a great time together, so then you can leave and break my heart all over again ?

After he moved, we didn’t talk for a whole year, he came to visit his family and tried seeing me. We hung out, hooked up, and afterwards I told him I think it was a mistake because I caught feelings again and I knew he was leaving back again soon. He agreed to go no contact again.  
  
We didn’t talk for four years.  
  
He moved back here 8 months ago and almost immediately reached out to me. He’s asked to see me a lot the first few months but I’d always decline. I was skeptical. I had finally agreed to hang out 3 months in to us talking. I almost immediately caught feelings again. I’ve been trying to keep my distance to spare my feelings, and not rush in to anything, so I would only see him once a month (we both work a lot so it’s not abnormal to him when I constantly put off seeing him, he knows and respects my schedule) but I’ve changed a lot since we first dated. Seven years ago I was okay with not talking about our feelings and just going with the flow. I am not that person anymore. I’ve been wanting to talk to him and ask him what are we (as corny as that sounds). He seems to be fine with just not ever talking about how we feel about each other but it’s driving me crazy. I don’t know if I’m just convenient for him or if he actually has missed me all these years and wants me. I don’t know how to even ask him what’s going on. Does anyone have any advice on how I can approach him with my feelings? I’m going nuts because I feel like I’m falling for him all over again but he has no clue, and I have no clue what he’s thinking about us. I’m scared of scaring him away.

His friends are dbags and it’s surprising because I don’t get how their personalities match at all. But I would hate for him to date someone who hates his friends, and idk how well I’d do hanging out with them, like how to seem happy to be there. I don’t mean to sound judgmental and I’m trying to tell myself it doesn’t matter that I don’t get along with them, but realistically I think it would have an impact. Anyone have a similar experience and what did you end up doing about it?

So me and my ex-gf were together for almost 7 months. We broke up because I felt kind of insecure and because she spends 16h a day working so thinks were kind of not happening the best way it could be between us.

We broke up last November and she said that she expects to suddenly feel the urge to kiss and hug me and so on and that she expects change both in me and herself. I started going to therapy and I believe there's a positive change in myself.

Beginning of January, she caught COVID so for the entire quarantine (2 weeks) we spoke pretty much 24/7 even when we were asleep, we were still on a call. She said I'm the reason why her quarantine went so well and that she has never relied on someone else as much as she relied to me. While in quarantine, she asked me a few times to show myself on video so she could feel happy.

Last saturday, her quarantine ended. We went out but I realized I dont exactly feel the same excitement towards here. Despite of that, she asked me to spend the night over at her place (nothing happened) and the next day asked me to go out with her and a few friends of her. While we were out, my ex mentioned she wants to celebrate her upcoming birthday in a non-standard way and one of her friends said that she should be careful because she did something similar and it costed her an 8 year long relationship. My ex said it doesnt really matter because she is not in a relationship so I kind of realized that maybe we won't end up together. 

Today, she finally got my things back and she eventually asked why I behave like I'm mad at her. I said I'm keeping my distance and that my feelings are slowly fading away and that I can't keep waiting for her. I could see in her expression that she felt sad and told me that she THINKS we should be together but doesn't really feel the ""wow effect"" anymore. I eventually decided to kiss her to see how both of us are going to feel and I could say that I still have feelings for her. She kissed me back, however, but after that she said ""how is this going to help us?"" She asked how I felt after the kiss and told her I believe we could make it work, however she said she still feels something, she THINKS we can make it work, but doesn't believe she is going to FEEL the same way. Also she said that we waited too much for this talk and that we eventually  had to define it. I tried to bring this topic a few times, but she didn't want to think about it or discuss it so I don't blame myself on that.

Well, yeah, I believe thats a firm 'no', but then why she would ask ME how I feel and tell me she THINKS it could work out but doesn't FEEL so? I'm really confused how you can spent so much time with someone and still not feel like you could make it work... It feels like she wasn't entirely sure but then again, why would you say a firm 'no' if you doubt it...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155982,public,self,What is going on?

This woman where I work asked me to lunch after we chatted a bit. I said yes because I thought it was just casual. She's mid 30s with kids.

I'm not sure if I'm over thinking it or what. I just didn't feel that click that I have gotten in the past. You know, when I feel like I'm on the same wavelength and conversation really flows.

What do you think? Just me? Maybe it's just because I haven't been out with someone in so long. Especially in a one on one scenario.

He promised me he would excuse himself from the group if they ever went to said establishments. I don’t think i trust my partner when he is drunk. Sober him is one of the greatest, most sincere, and genuine people I have ever met. I truly believe these instances happen because he just doesn’t think smartly when he’s super drunk but where does that leave me? Now I’m at a point where I don’t feel like I trust him when he’s out and getting drunk. 

Should I talk to him about this?

We hit it off immediately! We chatted on the phone for 2 hours the first night. The second night we FaceTimed for an hour. Then the third night we went on an in person date for 3 hours.

Now, it’s the 4th night and we’ve hardly texted at all today it’s been reeeaallly slow. I told him my intentions today and that I eventually want a long term relationship. He said we are still very new but he has really enjoyed getting to know me. But his texting is so slow and he’s only said that I am really cute and so nice to him. 

So I am making sure to give him space, but I really like him. 

He also invited me over tomorrow, but then he said he wasn’t sure if we could hang tomorrow because of a big work project. I know he has the big work project because he was talking about it when we FaceTimed on Friday.

If I were to focus more on my dreams, I wouldn't have to stress a lot about getting a girlfriend.

The reason why I am saying this is because for a while I have lacked self discipline and haven't really been focusing a lot on my dream job, but instead I think I just let my mind take control for a while and it caused me to be very desperate for a girlfriend in which I think was really not good for my mental health. I had the mindset(and most likely still do) that I will never find my significant other if I don't try.

So here is what I'm going to do.

I'm going to FORCE myself to take courses online for my dream job(In my case programming, game dev, and game entrepreneurship) and primarily just try to focus on that and of course some other things too.

I will still TRY to find my partner but will definitely not make that my main priority everyday.

I'm going to try to train my mind to just focus more on my dreams.

But will still talk to girls in which I find attractive when I run into them and will take a few on dates if they are interested.

I think I just need to find something else to obsess over because I really don't think obsessing over getting a girlfriend is good for my mental health if that's the only thing.

I told him no bc my ex threaten to blackmail my nudes (thankfully he didnt) and how I cant trust anyone nor take photos of myself like that for anyone. Besides i never saw his face, and i never had phone calls or anything. Today again he asked me if he can have a photo of me. I gave him one where I am fully clothed and normal. He said
""Great! Are you home?""
""Yes""

""Oh I dont rly have any other than some, barley any cleavage showing but I am not showing anything else""

We both treated each other well, understood each other like no one else ever had, and loved each other deeply... but there was no path forward for us to continue international visits indefinitely or moving to the other's country, for a variety of insurmountable reasons. On our last video chat, our last words to each other were, ""I love you.""

That said, I expressed to him during that final chat that I would like to be his friend and support him however he needs, whenever he needs - and that he could always reach out to me. He said he didn't think he could do that because it would be too painful for him, especially if he ever saw me in a relationship with someone else in the future. So, I respected his wishes, and since we broke up, I have not contacted him.

Now, I am struggling greatly in my life and I want nothing more than to talk to my best friend (yes, he was my best friend in addition to my love), but out of respect for him I will not contact him. We understood each other and supported each other like nobody else could because we both have similar viewpoints and mental and physical health problems that other people usually cannot understand. Now, that's all gone. How can that all be given up just because we can't be in a romantic relationship together? Why can't we continue to be there like that for each other in a platonic way?

I simply cannot understand how two people who say they love each other so deeply can pretend like the other doesn't exist and give up that level of understanding and support when neither did anything wrong to lead to a breakup of the romantic relationship.

TLDR: A great relationship ended - nobody was at fault - and my ex doesn't want to be friends, making us pretend like the other doesn't exist and giving up the potential to be in each others' lives in any way.

My previous relationship ended because my ex wanted to take advantage of me while drunk and when I told him to stop he kept going, this caused for me to not trust him anymore as I was scared of what he could do to me. When I started dating my current boyfriend he bragged about all his sexual experiences and showed me photos of the girls that he has had sex with. This made me feel very insecure and I basically felt like I was nothing as I have only had 1 sexual partner. I then felt pressured to please him so much, have sex whenever he wants as I wanted to be better than all of those other girls. During the relationship his ex contacted him saying she missed him and a FWB also contacted him to fuck. Another girl from his past (who currently has a boyfriend) was also acting weird and sending him invites to things and even told me he is with me because “we are similar” which is not. I have acted in bad ways because of this which I am not proud, saying hurtful things to my bf like “ I know you want to fuck them”, “you only want to go to that party bc she’s there” etc. Because of these actions he has threatened to break up with me 3 times (note that he never intended to break up with me). My anxiety and insecurities grew so much because of the girls he slept with and feeling like he can break up with me at any point but I just live with it as I love him. Fast forward 11 months, I was talking about the sexual assault with my ex and my boyfriend said that I did that to him. I made him explain as it is a strong accusation.

We decided to meet at a Casino I frequent because gambling was one of the things we had in common. 

When I met her, she looked about 50-60 lbs heavier than her pic but I didn't wanna be rude so I figured we could just hang out for a bit. 

She started to tell me about how she gained weight since being off meth and that she moved from Washington State to here in NY as part of her rehab program. I felt terrible about her situation and she wanted me to stay with her a week later at another Casino Hotel for her b day. I told her we'll play it by ear. Once she left we still texted friendly. 

Fast forward to the next week she texts me on her B day from the Casino saying she lost all her money and she's been having the day from Hell afraid she'll relapse. Telling me she has a room there and needs to pick me up. I was completely not in the mood to deal with any of it and wasn't that emotionally invested but didn't wanna hurt her further so like an idiot I ghosted her and never responded to her last texts saying ""Are you there?!!""  ""Please tell me you're there??!!"" 

Ever since then iv'e wondered whatever happened to her, I know I should have just ripped the band aid off and been upfront with her but she seemed so pitiful in her situation that I just froze. 

The old me would have went outta my way to accommodate everything but since iv'e been thru people Iv'e had literally years invested in abandon me I now have this ""I always come first"" attitude. Maybe I'm not cut out for this outlook if I can't handle it? Do you think she relapsed? Is it my fault?

There’s a girl I like at my job and it’s just been a small gush because I’ve never been able to get to know her. I always work on registers and she’s always fixing up the merchandise around the store so we’ve never had a chance to get to know each other. On top of that I normally work like 12-5pm and she works like 4-9 so we don’t clock in or take our breaks even close to each other. Yesterday when I was working she actually was working on registers and I somehow managed to work with her for 4 hours straight and finally broke the ice with her and she’s even more amazing then I originally thought. I used to think she was just cute but while I was talking to her I remember thinking “she’s literally a girl version of me” her weird quirks and experiences are just like mine and she seems like a different form of me which made me fall extremely hard because I felt I could relate to her. I wanted to ask her for her Instagram before she left but I wimped out. She’s very shy so idk if she was trying to wait for something but before she left her register she was like “ok...I’m gonna leave now” and just sat there with her hands kinda in front of her waist in a shy way and it was so cute and now that I think back on it idk if she was waiting for something or not. A big reason I didn’t ask for it was right before she left she talked about how she got creeped out by middle aged men flirting with her. And while I’m far from middle aged I didn’t wanna seem like I wasn’t listening. And now the problem I’m facing is causing a huge problem and idk where to go. My days have been cut and I only work 2 days a week so I barely work let alone see her and when I do see her it’s just seeing her walk around in the distance. I legitimately don’t know how to make the next move because like I said, I don’t wanna walk up and shoot my shot cause I’m scared I’ll make her uncomfortable which is the last thing I want. Idk what to do. I’m stuck with no way to make a move and it’s making me really sad and I’ve felt depressed the last 2 days and have cried a few times because I’d rather be rejected then wonder what could happen. I’m not scared of rejection, I’m scared of creeping her out because she’s so sweet and innocent, and the only word I can truly describe her is..fragile? She seems kinda awkward and nervous so I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. What do I even do going further? I’m really sad that I can’t figure out where to go next and need help

Eventually, they stop texting me more frequently and tell me, “hey, I think you’re an awesome guy but I don’t think I can be in a relationship right now” or “hey, you’re an awesome person but I don’t think I want to commit to a relationship right now”.
