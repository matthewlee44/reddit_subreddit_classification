I ask because the last guy (m 25) I (f 23) dated seemed to have a reserved/passive nature.  I’ll overall be wondering why he seemed like he was attracted to me but came across as lukewarm, both of which conveyed by his actions.  He almost always initiated texts (esp good morning messages), would compliment most of my snap stories, and admitted to feeling nervous after our first date (because he found me pretty).  But while he initiated texts, I always initiated meeting up.  His texts would come across as dry as they’d be short, but he would seem like he wanted to keep convo going even if it was falling off.  He’d ask me questions about what I’m doing (and was probably a bit better at asking questions about me in person), but wasn’t exactly as inquisitive as more outgoing guys I’ve seen before.  He was slow with physical contact but admitted after our second to wanting to kiss me but not sure how I felt.  And he did initiate the kiss on our third but it was a peck on the lips.  Cuddling was something on one of our meets also initiated by me, and he and I were mutually excited over text, but on the day of hanging he agreed lukewarmly before doing it (but apologized that particular day  for being low energy as he had a headache from bad sleep the previous night).  Sexting was something that’d be mostly initiated by me as well but once by him.  And the overall vibe he gave was that he’s open to anything but not hungry/passionate-like he’d be down for/agree to whatever I suggested our arrangement to be (like casual dating/fwb) but have no particular desires or expectations of his own to voice.  When he started going through personal things, he’d still want to keep in touch, but while he wasn’t necessarily curt/cold, he wouldn’t seem to excited about doing stuff either.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,981657,public,self,Should I stay no contact?

He showed up to my place this morning with coffee and a muffin, I didn’t expect him to be at the door, so assuming it’s my roommate I answered the door in a big tee and messy hair. My arm was exposed and when I reached for the coffee he saw my arm. It’s pretty obvious where it came from because the cuts are only on my left arm and I’m right handed. I can tell he felt uncomfortable and I turned my arm inwards to hide the marks. It’s bad because I have some fresh ones from a couple days ago and I’m pretty upset at myself because my previous scars are almost unnoticeable but I did it again and now I have to go thru this process of hiding while it heals. 

I invited him inside even tho I felt pretty shitty, he grabbed my arm to inspect it and just took a deep breath. I told him I was sorry idk why but I did feel the need to apologize given the circumstances and how it’s hard to see that. He said “you’re too pretty to be doing this to yourself. I didn’t expect this.” And he picked me up and kinda bear hugged me then left. It makes me feel like our relationship is tarnished now because he probably thinks I’m mentally ill and need help. We haven’t slept together yet but I’m sure he isn’t attracted to me after seeing that. He texted me articles on cutting and basically carried on with like it was no big deal. He still wants to see me and said it wasn’t a turn off for him. I still feel a bit down about it and kinda want to cut him off. Should I continue on pursuing this connection? I really like him but I’m so used to ppl saying they aren’t bothered then throwing it in my face or trying to push boundaries because they think I have none for myself.

I am not perfect at all but after a few days trying to enjoy our vacation together she kept on saying that she was not weak and if I wanted to leave her that I should go, after several times of her saying it I actually took off and left her behind, I truly regret my action to this day because it is not me at all but my handling could have been different, could have stayed in town and just do my thing but instead my feelings of being unappreciated took over and I wanted to go home, I did a very childish thing but at the same time she has told me that she understands why I did what I did.

In the end, she said we took this vacation too early in our relationship and if we could be friends, I don’t hate her, I think I tolerated her because I do like her, but I know she needs work just like I do.l, so she probably tolerated me as well.

We took a break from May 2021- July 2021, and recently just got back together a month ago. The breakup was horrible and we both knew we missed each other. I love him so much and I think us getting back together really made us both realize we want to be together for the rest of our lives. Anyways, the point of this post is recently he has been texting his friend named Alyssa. Which of course I don’t mind because I have guy friends as well. He isn’t a cheater and I know this for a fact because he never has cheated or never has given me a reason to even think he was. I’m so grateful to have a loyal boyfriend because I know sometimes it may be hard to find these days. He was the one who wanted the break and just felt like we needed some space away from each other so my trust with him lately has been hard because I never would have thought he would want a break. My point is my trust is low and is slowly being redeemed back since he broke up with my a few months ago. He said he wanted to hang with his friend Alyssa sometime this week and at first I wasn’t really happy about it because it’s another girl ya know? I don’t feel comfortable with them going to the mall alone. Maybe I’m being dramatic and they really are just friends? We talked about this cams he told me that he loves me and only me and just wants to hang with her because they have been friends since they were kids. I have really bad anxiety and have trouble with overthinking everything all the time. Will something happen between them? Are they really just friends? We are so so happy together and like I said before he has never cheated and told me they are just friends and it’s not like that at all. But my head is telling me over and over somethings going to happen between them and I hate how my mind plays tricks on me. I trust him i just don’t know the girl so I’m having a hard time trusting her. So can I just have your guys opinions? Is it normal for a boyfriend and a girl to hang out as just childhood friends? Am I thinking too much of It? He specially said he loves me and we just got back together and he was the one who came back to me. So would he really risk losing me again over something like this? All I’m asking is to let me know if I’m overthinking this or not. I just don’t wanna lose him again to anything especially another girl even tho he keeps saying over and over he’s not going anywhere and they are just friends and always will be.

I'm trying to learn from an experience that I had and would like your feedback. I'm going to try to describe things in chronological order to that I/we can try to assess where things started to potentially ""fall apart"" and because I'm wondering if the situation is salvageable. 

Some background in case it matters: I'm generally a secure, confident person and people around me tend to pick up on that. I've been told I'm good looking, tend to be outgoing, and I'm sociable. Lean, athletic build but could gain some weight. Parents were strict growing up and I didn't get much dating experience, but I tend to be well-adjusted socially and typically don't feel as though I need someone in my life to make me happy (none of that ""you complete me"" garbage haha). 

Anyway, I started school a few months ago and met a girl that I was immediately attracted to. We saw each other in our lecture hall a few times, did the whole ""look, look away, look again"" sort of thing several times, then met within a few days through some mutual friends. First conversation was good, there was clearly some chemistry right off the bat and I could see that she was friendlier with me than she was being with other people. Few days later, we were leaving class and right as I got to my car I saw her again and so I started talking to her. I asked her if she had any weekend plans and she immediately asked me for my phone number. We wound up hanging out with a group on Saturday night at a bar (she invited me) and again I could feel a good deal of mutual attraction (strong eye contact, continually coming together again to talk, physically close to each other, etc.). The next morning she texted me first and we talked a little bit more. I suggested that we do something again together (I suggested trying a sport that I like that's pretty easy to learn and a lot of fun) and she showed interest in that. 

Over the next few weeks, we wound up seeing each other most weekends at a friend's house. I asked her out to get coffee (over text because I was kinda impatient) and she said yes. It was a good talk and it was clear that we have a lot in common. Date ended with a hug and her suggesting that we do something again after exams. 

From early on though, my texts were longer than hers (I tend to write a lot - as you can see here - but I generally try not to send multiple messages without a response). Since many of our classes don't overlap, I think I may have still wound up over-texting a bit just because I felt like I wanted to talk to her. We still talked pretty often, but it was generally friendly, about school, dogs, occasionally a mildly flirty text (calling her beautiful, teasing, etc.), but nothing too out there. We made plans to spend time together during a lighter week, but she wound up needing to study for a test so things feel through, but that was understandable. 

Early last week, there was a day that we spent most of the day together and it was really great. There was clearly an attraction between us, playful teasing, genuinely wanting to be around each other, and so on. We ran into each other the next morning and walked to class together and things were still good. However, the next day she seemed a bit distracted and somewhat more distant from me - though it was after we got a test back and that may have had something to do with it. 

Anyway, later on last week, I asked her out again (wasn't going to see her for a couple days so I tried calling, but wound up texting), and called it a ""lunch date."" A few hours later she replied that she thinks I'm a really great guy, enjoys my company, and so on but that she wants to be friends. The next day, I did wind up seeing her and we talked a little about it and I made it clear to her that I don't view her as a friend, saying out loud that I like her and that I felt like we have a lot in common - she thanked me a couple times for my vulnerability and openness and told me that she's preoccupied with school and that her ""heart is elsewhere"" for a guy she knew before me. She said that she's just nice in general and that people can misinterpret that, but in my view there was a very clear difference between our interactions and the interactions she was having with some of our other guy friends (I didn't mention that to her). I told her I'd be respectful of how she's feeling, that my feelings are what they are and that they're probably not going to change, and we agreed that things wouldn't be awkward between us. It was a good conversation and, in my view, we both handled it maturely. 

After that, we did wind up getting dinner with a group later in the week (my friend overheard her talking about the fact that I asked her out confidently with some of our mutual friends before I got there) and it was fine, but I could tell that the dynamic had shifted a bit. She still laughed at my jokes and things but she seemed more guarded in general - she wasn't generally talking to me directly and we sat further apart. Over the past few days, we've still wound up seeing each other in class, studying in a group together, going to the gym at the same time, etc. but things feel just as distant. 

So, I think this may be a case of where things potentially could have worked out between us but factors beyond my control in her life may have prevented that. That being said, it's also possible that I  messed things up in some way causing the attraction to fizzle out (this is something I'm particularly curious about since I do tend to get girls interested in me but I don't usually pursue them enough to see if this is a trend for me or not - I'm a very analytical person which probably isn't a good trait in emotional areas like dating hahah). 

Although we agreed that we wouldn't let things be uncomfortable between us, I don't want to inadvertently make her feel that way by hanging around too much (we have a lot of friends in common, the time we go to the gym is convenient, etc. but I still don't want her to think that I'm just doing those things to be around her). I sent her a quick text today, haven't sent her anything in about a week, just to test the waters a little but haven't heard back, which may be because she's in class still or it's possible that she just doesn't want to give me false hope.  I really like this girl and it'd be great to get to know her better to see if there is long-term potential, but if she's happier with the other guy then I'm happy for her. If her situation were to change I admittedly probably would ask her out again. 

Anyway, how do you recommend I handle things at this point? Should I just give her and that circle of friends some space for a few weeks/months? And for what it's worth, I am still focused on my own pursuits, goals, hobbies too - I'm not trying to have my life revolve around a woman, but I would like her to be a part of my life. Do you think there is still potential for a relationship in the future?

I married the girl I met when I got here, we were together for a total of 3 years. Our relationship was not very good much of the time, always a bit cold, never felt that my emotional and romantic needs were met. In the end, she finally admitted to herself that she’s not sexually attracted to men, and we called it quits.

I’m in a tough spot. I’m from a much larger metropolitan area where people are very open and approachable, and there are plenty of other eccentric folks for interesting conversations. Here, meeting people has been much harder. I experience a broad feeling of alienation in this town, not just in the romance department. 

I’m a pretty attractive guy, I dress well, work out frequently, and have good career prospects, but it seems like my interests are very niche relative to the women here, and I struggle to find anyone that I can have a conversation with, and I’m not really interested in a hookup in which we barely talk to each other.

I never had to learn how to date here because I met someone so early, and now I’m a fish out of water. I’m not doing well on dating apps, and people here are generally very closed, so meeting people through my classes and even school clubs hasn’t panned out and I hate the bar/nightclub environment.

I’m hoping to go on Sunday though but and this is gonna sound stupid but my parents don’t really know and also we started talking via hinge and they don’t really get online dating they kinda look down on it and in some cases I can see why.

We are both 30, and we have been in a relationship for 8 months at this point. We do spend lots of quality time together and for the most part I feel really happy with him. I've met his family and we spend a lot of time together during the week. 

Lately one issue has been plaguing me a lot, and I struggle to understand if i'm just projecting my past onto him, or whether its reasonable to find it rude when he takes hours to reply to my messages... particularly ones where we are confirming plans and/or gathering important information.

I've been cheated on and such, so I could have some residual issues despite investing lots of my time into therapy. However, I will give myself some credit as I DO believe i'm pretty self aware of any jealous, possessive, anxious and obsessive behaviours I might have. I can honestly say my frustration with him isn't due to jealousy/possessiveness or thinking he's going to cheat, but rather... I get the feeling that he doesn't care for me as much as I care for him... which is a huge incompatibility issue as I don't want to spend my life with someone who is potentially halfhearted about me. In the past I've never had issues with men and communication, all of them have been excellent texters.

Often I will message him and he takes a while to reply... which took some getting used to, and it doesn't bother me much when its the day to day chat, and not urgent. However, when I ask him a time sensitive question such as ""where should I make a reservation tonight?"", ""i'm just picking up xyz, what was that thing you wanted me to get again?"" or ""would you like to come for dinner tonight?""... very often he takes hours to get back to me. My initial thoughts was always that work was overwhelming. But he frequently talks about how boring his day at the office was, and how much downtime he has (to the point where he's out with clients golfing or having lunch, or simply shooting the shit with his coworkers) it makes me feel like he's just sidelining my messages. I wonder to myself how he couldn't just take a second to reply if he always has his phone on him. It really hurts. Even if he were to put it away during the day, he gets his messages on his watch and I see him checking them at home all the time.

For the record, I do NOT bombard him with messages, nor do i nag him, or double text him or do anything that would be perceived as needy and annoying. As a result of suppressing this feeling of hurt, it is starting to grow into a bigger issue where I am starting to wonder if he sees me in his future or if im just a ""for now"" girl. 

At this point he also hasn't told me he loves me, and we haven't discussed anything regarding our future together. In combination with his lack lustre texting habits it is making me feel taken for granted and I don't have the time to waste in my dating life.

So you don't feel like you're the only one going through this bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

So I matched with this chick on tinder one day and we really hit it off! We had the exact same taste for music, which is very important for me in a potential partner because music is a HUGE part of my life. We added each other on facebook messenger after a while and even spoke on the phone a couple of times (she seemed really into me). I was really looking forward to meeting her, so one day we set up a date.

 When the big day came she never showed up. I checked messenger to check up on her and she was completey gone... Asked a friend to check if she still had an account on facebook. Lo and behold, this chick blocked me. I was so confused! I couldn't get it out of my head. Couldn't stop thinking about her. But soon I just accepted reality.

A couple of months later she hits me up on messenger out of nowhere and apologizes for her behaviour (while trying to make me feel sorry for her). Apperantly she blocked me because she thought the whole thing was to good to be true or something like that and she got scared. WHAT???She put ALOT of sad emojis through out the whole conversation and it really felt as if she made the ''puppy eyes'' digitally, you know?

The thing was... This girl was really hot and I almost gave her a second chance. But then a little a voice in my head just said ''She doesn't deserve you and you deserve better''. So I told her that I accept her apology but she blew her chance of meeting me big time.

&amp;#x200B;

To be completely honest I almost wanted to get my revenge by sleeping with her and then ghosting her. The thought was cool, but that's just not who I am. I'm not a douche or a player.

MORAL OF THE STORY IS: Listen to your gut! Doesn't matter if the chick is really hot. Have self respect and own your value.

**Advice to anyone here considering asking their teacher out or dating them:**

* If she looks at you, smiles, listens, and nods her head when you talk or discuss a topic, it doesn't mean that she likes you. I know it is crazy. I always thought that if a girl listens to you and looks at you when you talk, she likes you, but boy was I wrong. 
* If your teacher gives you good grades and tells you that you did a good job and should keep it up, it apparently doesn't mean she is romantically interested in you. Yes, even if she did the above mentioned things together with giving you good grades and complimenting you.
* If she laughs when you talk about Roman history and imitate Caligula it doesn't mean anything. From what I read on the Internet, if a girl that laughs at your jokes, she must like you. But apparently they lied about it because now I am in trouble. 
* If she walks behind you in the hallway it doesn't mean that she wants to see your butt.

I am an educated, successful, well traveled, compassionate woman (34F, straight). I spent my 20s-early 30s in a few long term relationships that ended with me moving for my career and the men not wanting to follow (which I get, no harm there) and one ended because he cheated (had cheated on every woman before me too, best to walk away). 

Recently, I was talking to a man (and met him once) that did a number on me due to the confusion and emotional roller coaster. We talked every day (morning to night, text to video chat) for three weeks.  He initiated most of the time. We shared a lot with each other, including vulnerabilities from our past - what he called “love and learn moments”. We met in person, hit it off for hours, and he raved after about how great it was - saying he couldn’t wait to meet again, this was such a great time for him. He told me every day for a week that he was so excited for our next meeting yet also bailed 3 times by simply not following through with those enthusiastic words and endless kissing emojis. 

How did he set up these bailing moments? We were supposed to meet in person and something came up once the morning of the day we were to meet. Then again a few days later, to which I shared it confused me - to be told how excited he was then be asked to go out on a specific day yet to have no follow through when the day came (there was no excuse for it, it just didn’t happen). This second bail, he flipped on me by saying I said yes to the date but never chose a place or time; he also went so far as to say I didn’t need to complicate dating so much. Wait, what? We disagreed on how that played out, he said I ruined his day, and ultimately talked me into one more chance. I caved and shouldn’t have listened to the guilt trip. But ultimately did. And thought wait and see - third strike you’re out. 

To keep it simple in how he blasted me (lovebombing, if I were to guess): he would say how excited he was to meet again, share something he thought was great from our first date, and when I said “great, me too, let me know when works” he would casually suggest a day yet not provide any place or time (clearly by design). This happened three times in one week — on a Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. Again, after we met in person so clearly stringing along. Each were cancelled the day of when asked what time to plan for (it was the day of the supposed date FFS). 

Fast forward to the third and final time: yet again, it was predictably cancelled that morning after he was talking about it nonstop for two days. When I said I wouldn’t be reaching out, this again wasn’t my style of dating, he blew up on me. He leveraged intimate conversations against me and used information from my past including how desperate I was for living with former partners then slammed my age. Conversations he initiated about loyalty, compassion, and wealth were brought up, flipped and twisted in rapid fire hate texts that attacked every piece he could.

He is blocked. I stopped defending myself early on in this weird exchange (seeing it was grossly toxic and hateful). 

I am still processing how horribly wrong I was in judging this person’s character but woa - looking back, I saw glimpses from day one. The blaming others for his negative relationships was there - but covered in his manipulative tools and smooth talking clearly impacted by his wealthy bringing (my impoverished upbringing was used against me in his hate texts). 

People say emotional abusers show signs in early dating. The signs of control, disregard, lack of respect for boundaries and other things - like time and energy. Practicing vulnerability is difficult; discernment in practicing vulnerability in safe spaces is even more a struggle.

I’m new to this.

So I’m new to dating and tbh idk what I’m doing but I want to learn, I feel like if I don’t learn I won’t get no girl to love me and won’t get married in the future and have kids and all that.

My perspective on woman changed, I used to think of them only for sex but now I respect them because they are beings and they have feelings and are important.

A few months back (I’m 18) I was texting this girl from school and since we were in quarantine we had class online. I didn’t know what the rules were so I had my friends helped me and it was awful. I didn’t know what to say, I was acting up so bad I made awful jokes it was terrible and the thing is my friends gave me great advice to be myself and to be vulnerable by telling her I’m new to this but I felt like she would’ve dumped me because my whole reputation at school was me being bullied and since it’s high school I thought it would gave me “loser vibes” and the thing is she didn’t even care which I was very shocked, she literally gave me multiple chances and I blew it but I learned my mistakes now I want to be myself and if they can’t like it then I’ll find someone who will.

I plan on talking to this girl tomorrow at school but I never spoke to her, but the thing is I feel like I’m not ready to have a girlfriend, I don’t have money and i don’t feel I have the confidence to make her happy especially knowing her last relationship made her change her perspective on boys not to a complete extent but I can tell she was very upset about what happened. I like this girl man, I feel dumb cause idk the rules of dating, I don’t know if I have to talk to her everyday, I don’t when to ask her out or when take her on a date. I literally don’t know anything but I keep having these thoughts of me and her being married and having kids and I came to realize that those are just thoughts and that I must stay grounded. Idc if she rejects me, I love myself now but I don’t want to get into something that falls on my face, not again man.

I am ready to date again but I am wanting to make sure the person I’m seeing isn’t just playing with me and knows what he wants. 

I recently met this guy (I’m 27F) and he’s 32. I really like him and he seemed genuine but I had my guard up a bit because he is pretty intense. Like first date he was telling me he wants a family and he wants to be serious with someone and asked me how many kids I wanted etc. He’s telling me I’m so beautiful and sweet and he wants to get to know me more and we can take it “slow.” We kissed and it was amazing. I knew he was looking for a home but not sure where, either the city we were both raised in or 4 hrs away where he went to school and had his friends. I am also waiting to take exams and get licensed for my job and that won’t happen until the summer if all goes well. 
Second date he was even more intense. Talking about how now he’s taking me into consideration about moving, how he knows we’re still seeing each other but “you’re mine,” how he wants me to meet his friends, how he wants to call me baby (i told him no not yet but he did anyway), how I’m the perfect package, how he’s serious about me. 

Third date: amazing, he’s so thoughtful and i let my guard down a bit more. Apparently that was the wrong move lol. I ask him when he plans on moving, and now he’s mainly talking about moving to the city 4 hrs away. He’s like oh you know we’re still new, I have a lot to think about still. I might go see some properties soon there. Laughs and says will you come visit me? I didn’t like that, and I started overthinking which I know is something I need to work on. The question made it sound like I was just a friend and he’s basically telling me to hit him up whenever I’m in the city. 
So i got quiet and he was like don’t overthink right now just think later. I wasn’t gunna tell him what was wrong but he was like ok just tell me. 
So I said I just think there’s a disconnect, you were so serious in the beginning and now ur saying oh we’re new. I know we’re new, like fully aware but he wasn’t acting like it? That is a little shady to me. I said i’m sorry i’m just thinking because i don’t want it to be a situation where in a few months you’re like actually byeee. I don’t want to get hurt like that. He’s like no I wouldn’t do that. Again he repeats we’re still new but I do have feelings for you, anything can happen i could meet your brother and he could hate me lol. I don’t think he understood what I was trying to say. Anyway we were wanting to see each other again but he didnt text me to ask me to do something he just texted to check in and i feel like he’s distancing himself.

The goal is to create a better dating experience for tall women by allowing them to quickly match with other tall men or shorter men that would like to date-up (of course other sexual orientations are supported too).

A bit of context, I come from a very tall family. I’m 6’9” (as a guy) and the average height in my family is probably around 6’7” for men and 6’0” for women. My grandparents even met in a tall social group back in the day. Needless to say height and dating have always been a common conversation I’ve been roped into over the years.

The way DateUp works is pretty simple. Essentially DateUp is a dating app for tall people, or those seeking someone tall. Everyone of a certain height (6’0”+ for men, 5’8”+ for women) join as “Members.” Members can match with other members nearby or with “Guests,” who are shorter people that want to date someone tall. There’s also a height verification feature.

There’s value in joining DateUp for all tall people, but the way it was designed was directly based on feedback from numerous tall women, because that’s where we felt there was real room for improvement in the online dating space.

What do you like about it? What else would you like to see? There’s a good chance we’ll implement good suggestions, so don’t be shy.

My dating approach is somewhat guarded unless I connect with “my kind” or person. Sexual attraction is probably one of the first things I looks for but, that doesn’t mean I’ll cut off anyone I’m not instantly attracted to. 

In my experience, when I’m (sorry tmi) turned on when talking to them, over the phone, FaceTime or even texting, we’re going to get along. I look for important qualities from there onwards and I’ll go for a coffees if I see myself with them (at some point in the future).

Right now, having said that before the first meeting I follow my intuition and do not ignore my thoughts (or red flags). I’m happy being single but having someone is definitely a plus.

I’m posting because the minute something sexual is bought up, everything is ruined. I’ve lost all attraction  towards the person. My curiosity completely dies, I’m not upset or angry at the situation or the person. Even if they’ve said something borderline disrespectful. I’m not talking about flirting or grey area sort of comments (I like a tease).

I have no problem whatsoever attracting people to date but the minute I’m put off, it’s just done from there. How do I stop seeing it so black and white?

My friends say carry on and do not under any circumstance change. A good man won’t have any issue with this but I’m not so sure. I’ve accepted I’m not going to fall in love with everyone but come one at least one person would be great lol.

I kinda just stared at him in horror and he apologized but the damage was done.

I'd never felt like I was settling for him, meanwhile he said out loud he was settling for me.

What's weird is I dated a guy who was shorter than I am who never said anything about his own height. I hit on him at a party, he was super cute, it never occurred to me his height was a problem because it wasn't for me.

My point is, sometimes the height or any other perceived shortcoming isn't the problem, the massive insecurity is.

You can be a confident person who doesn't insult people who like you, or you can be like this jerk I dated, who was so into his own inferiority complex he felt a need to put me down when I was never anything but kind and into him. :/",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,982077,public,self,"""Short"" guy put me down out of insecurity",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfiice/short_guy_put_me_down_out_of_insecurity/,all_ads,6,,,

We’re both 17 and here’s the story so far. I originally didn’t like her because she trash talked me to another co worker about me taking all the customers at the registers (not on purpose but I just made eye contact first). Anyway a few weeks after that I had to help her at registers and she was super friendly, I remember thinking “man she’s talking a lot for not knowing me”. But I was super dry and blunt because I was mad at her remark she made at the time. She did things like ask what time I got off and then acted disappointed when I got off before her. Before I left I had to buy something and I went to her register. When I did she said “oh hey, it’s been awhile) and smiled and had a flirty look on her. She also was messing around with me and being mean in a playful way. Like messing with me when my card didn’t work and said “well we close in 30 minutes so if you don’t get it by then idk what to tell you” but it was flirty like I said


Fast forward a few weeks later and I see her one day and I decide to put what she said behind me and kinda have a “fresh start”. I started taking to her and it went so well. I made her smile and laugh a lot and she was playing with her hair a lot. I was looking to see if she played with her hair when I wasn’t talking to her and she was but not as much. It went so well that day. The next day I worked tho she was busy and around other co workers so it was hard to talk with her. I finally wanted to at least say hi. When I did I went full blown stupid and froze and just wave. I said nothing but she did the same, waved and said nothing. For some reason I looked away and then looked back. I have no clue why. When she left I told her bye and she said it back but she didn’t seem flirty or interested at all. I thought I ruined it until the next day


The next day she was there and I noticed she had her hair dyed. I wanted to compliment but decided not to because after last time I didn’t wanna make it worse. So I just told her good bye and she said “bye, hey did you get your hair cut?” I did so I said yeah. She said “it looks really nice”. I said “thank you!” And went on. She asked “do you work tomorrow?” I said “yeah wby?” She said “not until Thursday”. I said “I work tomorrow and Wednesday but not again until Sunday” she replied “I think I work Sunday!” I said “ok nice, see you!” And left. Today is when it gets amazing. That day she came in as a customer and checked out at my register. When she came up she was playfully being mean and stuff. I got to the screen where I couldn’t scan her discount and she said “wow do I need to do your job? I think I do, cause I will if you can’t” we both made each other smile and laugh a lot and it didn’t feel like a normal conversation, but like she was flirting the whole time. I asked her “do you need a bag?” She said “if it makes your life harder I totally need a bag”. When she went to leave she asked “you work Sunday right?” I said “yeah, you do right?” She said “yeah!” I said “nice I’ll see you then, btw I like your 
hair!”. So I finally complimented her new hair

Yesterday I worked with my crush and this was the first day we worked together next to each other. She said some things I can’t tell if there hints or just her messing around. There’s another boy there and she said how he’s obsessed with him. She wasn’t serious but just joking. She said “hey texted me because you know he’s obsessed” and thing like that. Idk if this was a sign for me to get her number or if she was just joking. She also was saying things like “can you do (blank) because you love me?” Or if id do something she’d said “you still love me tho”. I didn’t really know the correct way to respond to that lol. I also cut myself on a tag today and I told her “wow today was the first day I cut myself on these tags, I blame you!” And she said “I was probably distracting you” and I said “well yeah maybe”.

Everyone that I knew, including myself &amp; this girl, were gonna be out of that building by late-end of August. I saw her twice before asking for her snap &amp; eventually her phone number. She's in town for 6 months only, since she's attending a program that lasts for only 6 months. 

At first she was a bit flakey, I once saw her on the patio smoking a joint &amp; chilled with her. The next thing you know, we're seeing each other almost every night, nothing sexual, but we'd just chill on the patio for an hour or 2, smoke a joint or a dart, and just talking. Now I used to be a shy &amp; awkward kid, so spending so much time with a girl was new to me. On top of that, I genuinely enjoyed conversing with her &amp; I think she did as well, since she'd also message me asking if I'd wanna smoke with her when I'm off of work. 

Since she lived around where me &amp; my friends would hang out, she eventually met most of my friends. My best friend came back to town &amp; I introduced them. There was a point where she'd hangout with me &amp; my best friend and me &amp; her would talk to him about his issues (he had some drug abuse issues). Now being around her for so long didn't help, and I kept getting more attached to her. I was scared shitless to make a move that would make her uncomfortable. she's easily the coolest chick I've met, and I didn't wanna scare her off. I think she could tell that I was into her, but she's mentioned on occasion that she's not looking for anything, due to her short stay in the city.

2 weeks ago, she moved out since she was just subletting the apartment &amp; she moved somewhere else in town, rooming with some of the other people that are attending the program (all guys btw lol). At first, we still called pretty often, but I think I was a bit too clingy &amp; too available/desperate. I saw her on the day she was moving out &amp; I asked her if she wanted to hangout over the weekend, and she said that we can discuss it later. Unfortunately, I persisted &amp; I was eventually was left on read. She did call me however early the next week and we just talked about shit, like we usually do. She mentioned in the call that she wasn't looking for anything, but she also said that we should call more often. Then I didn't hear from her for the entire week, so I call her during the weekend. Then yesterday I ask her if she wants to watch something &amp; she tells me that she's not looking for something. She was also acting a bit strange. Like, we had spent so much time together in the first half of the month, but she was treating me like I wasn't close to her or anything. I let fear get the best of me. Since she wasn't living in the same building anymore, I feared that she was pretty much out of my life, so I ended up bombarding her with texts &amp; missed calls and I believe that may have eventually drove her away.

The thing is we were pretty tight, and that wasn't even a long time ago. I believe that I was too available &amp; that anyone being this desperate/clingy would instantly come off as unattractive. I understand that she's only here temporarily, and hence, isn't looking for something like that &amp; is mostly focused on her program, but I just wanna chill with a person that I get along with and vibe with. I know that it's not looking good for me right now, and most people would just suggest that I get over it and forget about her, but is there anything else that I could do that could maybe turn the tide? It's not like I'm chasing a stranger, or someone that i didn't really know. I don't really meet a lot of people that I vibe with, so when I do, I can sometimes get like this. I'm aware that I need my space &amp; I need to get on my shit, but I also really don't wanna lose her completely from my life. Any suggestion other than 'let go &amp; forget about her' would be really appreciated, since the former suggestion is not really the one that I'm looking for from this post.

I also am going through an insecure phase. Usually I'm a bit more confident but lately I've been struggling with that after a painful breakup. My last relationship (actually the last 2 guys I dated really affected my confidence) The first one played w my emotions &amp; the second one used me for a year then disappeared. What's worse is I had doubts about both of them but took a chance bc I thought they were nice &amp; really interested in me. One thing I don't tolerate though is mind games. If I feel someone is trying to manipulate me or lower my confidence to control me, that's an automatic no. 

Its been nine months since my last relationship. I took a break from dating. I talked to a few guys here &amp; there. There was one really cute guy that seemed interested in me &amp; I liked him too BUT bc of my insecurity from my last relationship nothing ended up happening w him. I tried again a few months later w him &amp; he was open to it but again I think my lack of confidence came through &amp; ultimately he told me he wasn't interested anymore. I feel things could have been different if my attitude &amp; self esteem had been better. The guy was understanding &amp; knew what I was going through. I think he was going through the same but not as bad as me. We're cool though. 

I just hate that my insecurities are getting in the way of my dating life but after you've been screwed over so many times esp after the last two it just really took a toll on me. I started seeing a really good therapist again to really get to the bottom of my issues bc my last breakup really brought out all these abandonment issues. I've also been coming to terms with some truth about my family that I'm not happy about. 

I am focusing on myself &amp; my goals, school, work. I'm saving up for my own place. I'm really thinking about my future for myself &amp; not depending on anyone to take care of me even though I'd like to find love &amp; get married one day. Even though I'm at that age where most people settle down, I try not to beat myself up about it. There's so many people my age who are in the same boat as me. I also am trying to travel &amp; get out more. I don't have many friends bc I just don't see eye to eye w many around my area in terms of hobbies &amp; interest. Sometimes it's lonely but sometimes I really enjoy the solitude. 

I just wish my anxiety &amp; doubts could stop. I wish I didn't focus so much on what makes me sad &amp; doubt potential love &amp; stop letting fear get in the way &amp; stop thinking that everyone is going to abandon me.

The first guy I dated (I went on four dates with him) ended up ghosting me instead of telling me he didn't want to go on a fifth. I started seeing a new guy at the beginning of August, and our dates were so amazing, with each one longer and more intimate than the previous (these were really long dates: the first was 9 hours, the second 13, and the third one almost 24 hours). He kept bringing up things we could do in the future, like places we could go or restaurants we could try, etc. There was literally no indication that he didn't want things to keep progressing. 

Well, he called me earlier tonight and told me that he doesn't want to see me anymore due to a conversation he had over the weekend about his future and marriage and kids, and because I'm not his religion, he said he wanted to tell me sooner rather than later. And not going to lie, I'm absolutely crushed by this because everything seemed great in person—he even said he enjoyed our dates so much. But honestly, if he had ghosted me.... that pain would have been so much worse. It's a shitty conversation to have to have with someone, but the next time you're thinking of ending things with someone, please consider calling them instead of ghosting. It's going to be so much easier for me to move on now. Even though it really, really hurts and I'm going to have to take a little bit of time away from dating to get over it, it was really a kindness for him to have that conversation with me, as hard as it must have been.
