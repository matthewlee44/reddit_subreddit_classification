We set a ‚Äúdate‚Äù to meet up but due to the covid mandates and restrictions we had limited options so he offered to come to his place or my place whichever I was comfortable with. So I ended up going to his place he was such a gentlemen we were having a great time. We were flirty, he cooked me dinner, would compliment me every now and then. Overall loved his presence and how the night was going.

We ended up going back to his room listened to music, talked for a bit, made out all that jazz but then it came to sex. 

For me atleast I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable yet to have sex to which he was visibly frustrated but he brushed it off. Throughout the night he‚Äôd try to atleast get me to do something sexually related or to get me to be half naked to which I did tell him I still wasn‚Äôt really ready to do all of that and I barely even know him that well. For some reason I just passed a comment cause he had red LED lights on so I was like ‚Äúyou know what they say bout red LED lights‚Äù to which he responded ‚ÄúI mean that was the whole plan‚Äù. He also asked if I‚Äôd ever choose love over religion to which I said with no hesitation that I would choose religion (that‚Äôs my personal belief) to which he was shocked and idk if that influenced his decision later on. 

But yeah he managed to convince me to stay and we cuddled had a cute time together but again he‚Äôd try to get me to do some sexual to which I still stood my ground and said nah. But we both were on the same page about meeting up again. I got back home and things weren‚Äôt the same later.

He texted me the following day asking how I was and he wished I was there with him and we had a good convo going but then he just left me on read for a whole week and I was left confused. I did reach out after a week and I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but even when I did he completely brushed the fact he left me on read for a whole week and continued to just sweet talk me.

But can you put your blinders off and realize that once an individual becomes an adult, it becomes very hard to meet new people, especially in the same age group and with similar interests, and that these apps are the most likely way they can ever meet someone great? 

Bad dating experiences do happen everywhere, so let's not demonize the apps, and instead try to help people who are having a hard time on what they could be doing wrong and we ourselves can stop approaching the apps with such defensive pessimism.

Also, what's the hate with Tinder? Dating is a numbers game, so most people go there because it's the most likely place they'll find someone, so stop saying it only for hookups. If you're only meeting people who are interested in hookups, you should look inwards and see why you're swiping on those kinds of people and if there were warning signs.

And for God's sake unmatch people if you're no longer interested in talking to them. It declutters your conversations and makes it easier to have meaningful conversation. Unless you're looking for attention in seeing how many like you can get, in which case, fuck you and your eyebrows.

25M oversea nerdy PhD student here and never have any dating or relationship experiences before, just maybe one or two girls back in high school or college time, we might got the feeling for each other, but maybe because we were young, naive or whatever, we never manage to last till the end... One of them we tried to go for LDR as I studied oversea, but it's just hard and plus COVID makes things worse so it literally came to an end and both of us feel really sorry about it. 

As a PhD/researcher, I have always been busy with my lab work and experiments etc. so along the passing years I always could hardly spare any time to devote it completely in the effort to date someone or at least really get to know someone; but deep in my heart I still long for love or emotional connections, especially I really want to experience that type of puppy love-ish feeling or ""life"". I really want to feel my heart accelerates beating when I meet my love and talk with her with a shy/exciting/trembling voice during our first date and we could just enjoy those moments and enjoy ourselves... 

Sadly these never happen to me and I doubt whether they might happen in the future as I grow older and older. 

I began using dating apps, few matches but not much luck in general so far and it's a completely different experiences and I heard that after leaving your school/campus dating or even making friends would become even harder in work space or just because you are ""older""... 

So close to the end of my degree... IDK what I could do ... 

Admittedly, I achieved sth. at the price of sacrificing my ""loving"" experiences and now I am not sure whether I regret it or at least, I guess I might wanna to compensate for that more or less...

Night out with my (now ex) girlfriend, a girl friend of hers and a guy friend of ours led to everyone essentially blacking out. I've had sneaking suspicions for a little while so I did the ol' thing while she was sleeping and snooped the phone. 

3 different guys (that I know of). One was a guy she hooked up with on her birthday while she was visiting family in a different state. One was the mutual guy friend we went out with. One was her ex who is the biggest culprit as it turns out she never lost feelings for him even though he's a horrible person. God knows who else that I didn't find evidence for. 

Part of me wishes I could still be ignorant and we'd still probably be in bed right now cuddling. It's gonna take a while for that part of me to die which just plain sucks. 

Her two closest friends, whom I was extremely amicable towards and we seemed to be on really good terms, knew the entire time. Something about the fact that everyone seemed to know except me makes it 100x worse. It's unbelievable that a group of people can be that genuinely awful. 

There was night where she was claiming she was doing really bad mentally and needed to be alone - turns out that was code for her ex to come over instead. I was basically the backup plan the entire time.

The worst part of being cheated on is being in love with someone one day and then having to completely cut contact the next. There's no decline in interest, no lost feelings - it's just black and white. 

I don't really have a question or a lesson to give. Some people just really suck and this is gonna suck for a long, long time. I needed to write this out to keep my mind busy, I'm just so numb and time is moving so slowly.

So I‚Äôve been chatting with this guy for a couple months. I‚Äôm super busy as a mum and work and I‚Äôm also at school. I had to cancel one meet up as I unexpectedly had my kids that weekend. He cancelled twice, once because his mate was in an accident( I now believe that was bullshit) and he had COVID( again I think that was bullshit).

Anyway, we had plans today. Been talking all week about being excited to meet each other finally etc. 

We are talking up until 1230pm and he tells me he‚Äôs left and on his way. He lives in a city over so like an hr and a bit drive.

So I (31 male) met this girl (she‚Äôs 26) early December at a mates party, she‚Äôs really good friends with his wife. We chatted a little bit that night, added each other on FB and that was about it.

My memory is a little hazy around this point after such a big night but I remember us talking for a little bit, then dancing with each other. When then ended up down on the front yard making out with each other (where everyone could see haha, both drunk obvs). After that I remember talking, her telling me she‚Äôs going travelling in a few months time and how she isn‚Äôt after anything serious (have no idea why we were talking about that obviously) 

I didn‚Äôt see her the next morning I had to leave pretty early but all the boys were just saying how we were all other each other, us down on the grass etc.

I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on something for me.
I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô3‚Äù, moderately muscular but untoned, heterosexual Caucasian fella with what I would like to say are average looks (solid 6.5/10), a good sense of humour, but a severe lack of self-confidence. I often third-wheel for couples, I give relationship advice to people in dire straits that *seems* to improve their situation when they take it, and I do try to be as unassuming as possible. I‚Äôm kind, generous and honest to a fault. People at work are always trying to ‚Äúbig me up‚Äù to get me to ask *that* girl out or get *that* girls number, but I just don‚Äôt have the skills or confidence to do so.

I‚Äôm very confused.

Many people at work say things like ‚ÄúIf I weren‚Äôt taken, I‚Äôd say yes if you asked‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIf I were straight, I would date you‚Äù which gives me a little confidence boost for an hour or so, but then I realise that they can comfortably say that because they HAVE something already. I know it‚Äôs intended nicely, but sours a little over thought.

I know that there are MANY years ahead of me for finding someone, but the repetitive ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone out there for everyone‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still young‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help with how I feel about wanting a partner NOW.

I don‚Äôt want any sympathy comments, but just some insight into why I feel like I‚Äôm better at third-wheeling for others than at my own dating life.

[To add onto this, I *hate* the ‚Äúclub scene‚Äù because it‚Äôs too loud and just feels unromantic, I‚Äôve been on six different dating apps for three years now, with little to no success, and I have someone at work I‚Äôd like to ask out, but I know she‚Äôll say no, and don‚Äôt really feel like adding a rejection to my stress levels right now.]

TL;DR:
I lack self confidence and am confused as to why.

He texts me out of the blue like one page filled with reasons he doesnt see us like a great fit and  that he dont want anything serious and dont want me to get attached and get hurt feelings?

What feelings bro??  We met like 2 times...what feelings?

I get that he probably didnt want it to stay on just ghosting..but why dont have a normal conversation about that, and not just assume my position in all of this.

Okay so for context I am 20F and he is 28M and we met through a dating app, liked each other and we texted for about a week before meeting up. We had a first date and even though it was a bit awkward since I had never done this I‚Äôd say it went pretty well, he said he wanted to meet me again and I agreed. We went on a second date and it was also pretty fun and we clicked I‚Äôd say. Now he usually takes so long to have a conversation to the point sometimes I get an answer back like 3 hours later even though he isn‚Äôt working and sometimes it‚Äôs a bit dry or it‚Äôs like he isn‚Äôt even trying. For example, yesterday I got into a car crash and I let him know this, I texted that about 3pm and he answered my message at 7pm at night. We saw each other a third time and he was super sweet, cooked for me and went in for hugs and kisses and also told me he really liked me. What gets me confused is the dry texting or no texting at all and when he sometimes acts like he doesn‚Äôt want to open even a bit.

I eat well, but am not a stickler for being perfect, happy to still eat out and have fun on occasions as long as it‚Äôs not the core of my diet. I work full time at a warehouse while also taking classes on the side for software engineering, investing a large portion of my income while I‚Äôm still young enough to afford it. I love music, I prefer rock and metal and go to a lot of concerts, however I‚Äôm happy to listen to lighter pop too. I have a car with no payment, I longboard, hike, enjoy doing adventurous stuff like I went skydiving this past summer. I hope to travel a lot in the future, partially why I‚Äôve chosen a field that can often be done remotely. I enjoy discussing philosophy and playing devil‚Äôs advocate, or just teasing around for fun. And I don‚Äôt see women as some completely separate species like I know some guys do.

My dad is about average height despite his father being a little short, however my mom is 4‚Äô10 so I really just got stuck with unlucky genetics. I‚Äôm trying to make the best of it, but I really wonder how much I can do.

But how much of it is just ‚Äúas long as he‚Äôs taller than me‚Äù vs ‚Äúhe needs to be tall‚Äù? - for example, how many girls shorter than me, say &lt;5‚Äô3‚Äù would be willing to date someone my height?

There‚Äôs also this feeling of inadequacy, that even if a girl settles for someone my height, she still would *prefer* someone taller.

My last relationship was a long term (3 years) relationship with a girl about 4‚Äô10‚Äù so I really didn‚Äôt have to worry about much height wise. I was really happy with her and we were very comfortable with each other in many ways, the sort of best friends and lovers at the same time feel. It ended quite painfully a little over a year ago, and now that I‚Äôm facing the reality of re-entering the dating scene, I‚Äôm becoming more aware of my height again.

This might sound a bit dumb, but I need your advice. 

Pretty much this girl in my class caught my eye one day. Ever since catching my eye, I have been trying to figure out how to approach her. The catch is she seems very shy or maybe even stuck up. I only ever see her talk to a few other girls in the class. She doesn't seem to be their friends either just friendly to them. The class is a lecture with roughly 200 people so there really is no group work where I could try and be in her group. Additionally, she always comes to class just on time so trying to talk to her before class is impossible and after class, I have to book it to my next class so I don't have time to talk to her then. To top it all off, a week or so ago I found out she is actually an Olympic swimmer from the UK. So yes, she has a baddie accent. 

How do I approach a possibly shy girl without making her feel awkward or uncomfortable? And given I am new to dating, should I even try? She obviously has access to the top class of men (male Olympic athletes) and I am just am average joe lol. She is in my major and also I assume likes to be active so we do have some things in common. Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated!

Should I just cut my losses?

There are three major issues I have with my boyfriend. 

1. He is a mooch. He constantly smokes my weed/cigarettes, he eats my food, never offers to pay for coffee but always suggests we go out to get it, etc. I said he could have some of my chips, he handed me two and ate the rest of the bag. I went to sleep two hours before him, he smoked 2 grams of my weed while I was asleep. He has given me a few joints and a few cigarettes in the couple of months we've been dating whereas he usually takes at least 5 cigarettes and a few grams of weed every time we hang out. I also gave him 1/8th a few weeks ago and he never got me back like he promised he would. He's bought coffee maybe 1 or 2 times but almost every time I take him out he says can we get coffee and has conviently left all his money at the hostel.



2. He lives in a hostel. He has had a few housing opportunities come up, and declined them. It's a hard market out there, but he had the chance to have a real place to live and he turned it down to stay living in a hostel, sharing a room with his buddy, he can't have visitors, he can't get any of his possessions from his old city until he has an actual home, etc. So he spends half the week at my house, he showers here, he sleeps here, he eats here... he should be paying part of rent and utilities at this point.



3. He got fired from his job about a week ago, he had two opportunities for work and declined both of them. He intends to stay living off his last paycheck and the CRB for restaurant workers despite being capable and having opportunities to work, at least for the next month or two. I strongly disagree with this decision, but feel like I don't have the right to say anything as we've only been going out 3-4 months.



I'm really at my end with him. I feel taken advantage of, honestly, and like I'm wasting my time with a loser who doesn't even care about having a house or a job. He calls himself a bum, and I've mentioned before I feel I'm wasting my time with him because he has no drive to fix the issues in his life. Or he somehow doesn't see homelessness and unemployment as significant issues in his life! I am also unemployed because I am doing a practicum for school, and I have a budget I have to follow, I've mentioned this and he seems very lax and says well don't buy me anything then, but still comes into my home and takes my food, weed, and cigarettes, generally without asking. 



I have set goals for myself in life, I want to build my career and get a start with my life. I don't see myself getting anything out of this relationship beyond companionship. Should i cut my losses? Or should I put up with it another few months and see if he is willing to change? I'm really not sure. I like him as a person, he is just not where I would want to be when I am his age and he doesn't seem to care that much that he's unemployed and homeless. I feel like maybe I'm judging him too harshly, he is a very nice person and I really like spending time with him, but our goals and values in life (for me, a strong work ethic is extremely important) just don't seem to line up.

The 2nd date seemed a lot more hot and cold than the first one and I wasn't able to get a clear idea if she was getting more comfortable around me or just wanted the night to end already. 

In terms of progression, the second date night I ended it with a hug instead of a kiss because of that gut feeling and I didn't want to cross a boundary if I was judging the situation correctly. I like her a lot but also wouldn't want to make this irreversibly awkward between us because we both meet up at my school for skating and I wouldn't want to squash that as an outlet for either of us.

Anyway, fast forward to when I am already back at home thinking that I am probably not going to be seeing this girl in a romantic way again and she messages me 

""Did you get home ok? 

Thanks again for tonight üòä you‚Äôre wonderful""

Which very much threw me for a loop considering how much I thought I messed up the evening but also maybe questioned if she was just being polite.

&amp;#x200B;

So now it is 2 weeks out, neither of us has messaged each other and so I am writing to reddit to see how others would approach this. Am I wasting my time thinking about her so much or should I just message her and see what's up?

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt watched it yet, what is the show about?‚Äù


‚ÄúBlah blah blah the show is about blah blah blah. You should watch it, Ive gotten so many people into it. 

‚ÄúI guess Im next on your list then‚Äù *says slowly casually and in a low tone, looking at her*

‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre next on my list‚Äù *nervous and blushes*


Idk how I did this, the words just came out of my mouth even though it‚Äôs probably something decent I said (or lmk if it was good). There was more words before the last two things but I don‚Äôt even remember. I said some other smooth stuff I don‚Äôt even remember, first time this has happened. 

I basically went through the entire 3 hour class with her, talked like crazy, even hung out during our break, got her snapchat by the end of class, and just winged it. I was also half asleep so that entire time felt like a blur. No nervousness, just me trying to not fall asleep and her talking to me was the only thing keeping me up. We also tried to get caffeine but the stupid vending machines aren‚Äôt actually vending machines and don‚Äôt work at all, I was also about to steal them but we agreed to not steal anything (long story). Also made good eye contact, starred in that for a while at a time when we talked and so did she. It all felt like a dream/daze. After the class was done and we were about to leave the room, I gave her my phone and asked for her Snapchat so that she could type it in. 

Its funny because I downloaded dating apps this week (which hardly work) and the only thing that worked is what Ive always enjoyed, meeting someone organically in person. 

When I say idk how this happened, I really don‚Äôt know how I did it. Just proud of myself for not fumbling like I have before. Ive been single (as in not talking to any girls in that way at all) for 2 years and have been meaning to get back into it, I think Im off to a decent start for the first week of college. 
There was a lot of other stuff we said and she said but I don‚Äôt even remember which sucks. 

She is also waaaay cuter than I thought because we had masks on, holy shittttt dude how did I do this???

So how do I trust the fact that I will get into a relationship soon and not be so obsessive?

I‚Äôm having this issue because I really worry that I may not get into a relationship at all in my life.

I would really like to date someone as early as possible and would really like to experience the joy of being in love with someone of the opposite gender and the things I can do with them (playing video games, watching movies, going out to eat, making out/having sex, sleeping comfortably together, etc).

And I‚Äôve been told these alot: Join social groups, go to places you enjoy being at, work on yourself and the women will come.

But is really leaving it up to fate the best option??
Because I don‚Äôt think that always works for everyone and I feel like if I don‚Äôt try to find my potential partner, I never will.

So how can I know for a fact that I will eventually(hopefully soon) get a girlfriend?
How do I work towards finding my significant other?
And how do I get less obsessive and become more confident that I will eventually find my one?

Also my dream job is to be a game developer and game entrepreneur and I feel like my mind has been more on finding a girlfriend rather than my dream job which is probably not a good sign.
So that‚Äôs probably something that should be talked about here in this thread.
I think it‚Äôs either laziness or a lack of self discipline that‚Äôs the issue.

Another thing too is that I found this reddit group called r/AloneForeverDating and it‚Äôs a group where I can ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù find someone, and so in the meantime I‚Äôm just going to rely on that and also do some other things in my life until I think I may have found my potential one.
How does that sound?
Also for those of you that have tried r/AloneForeverDating, have you had any luck?(Especially if you are a guy)
I‚Äôve messaged a few girls today but I‚Äôve got no replies probably because of the other crap ton of dms that they are getting from guys lol.

To give context I‚Äôve (M20) been talking to this girl (F18) that I‚Äôve been working with since October. I asked her out on Christmas Eve and we went on our first date two days later. She‚Äôs a really great person and I really connect with her and I thought this could potentially lead to something good.

Well after New Years was the last time I saw her. We were supposed to go on a date the first weekend of January but she got covid and misses two weeks of work. Then the next week we couldn‚Äôt see each other because of the snow and we both couldn‚Äôt work either. I also tried to reschedule again last week but she said she was swamped with school. So it‚Äôs been close to a month since I saw her in person and to make up for this we‚Äôve been texting everyday and we‚Äôve had meaningful and deep conversations so it‚Äôs been good.

Lately though I‚Äôd say the past week and a half shes been getting really sad/negative due to her having a lot of family problems that have started and the fact that she didn‚Äôt get into her dream college a couple of days ago (she only applied to 1).

I don‚Äôt want to sound selfish but I‚Äôm just confused on where I fit into her life. I asked her if I was bothering her and if she needed space to sort things out but she said that I wasn‚Äôt bothering her and that I‚Äôm nothing negative in her life with what‚Äôs going on right now.

It‚Äôs just hard for me because when we had our date she didn‚Äôt know how she felt about me and that she wanted to take it slow. But with everything that‚Äôs happened I really don‚Äôt know where she stands.

I want to ask her where does she see this thing we have going but I know she‚Äôs going through a lot right now so I don‚Äôt know if I should wait a little bit. I‚Äôll finally see her at work tomorrow but I want to try an reschedule our date so I can ask her. What should I do?

I just turned 36 and my last relationship ended a little more than a year ago. Afterwards, I resigned myself to being single and have been super happy. I have a good job, make great money, live in a country I love and have loads of friends. I really have a lot to be grateful for and I am content. 

I lost my father to cancer last year and that has made me very afraid of the future. 

I am not (actively) looking for a relationship, per se, so I know that what I am about to say may sound absurd. I am very, very anxious that my value as a female is depreciating and that I know men are going to stop looking at me, desiring me, or wanting me in any shape or form. I have no idea where this has come from, or why I am thinking this way. 

Of course, if the right person was to come along, I would completely jump at the chance. Right now, I am just trying to make my life as fulfilling as possible in the hope that I will meet someone along the way. 

From reading this sub, I know that some men think it's just 'women's turn' to have a lack of choice in their 30s, sort of like the tables have turned from being in 20s. This stings, as I didn't really play the field at all then I was younger, I guess I've just been waiting for that great connection, and I have found it a few times. 

In any case, I want to live my life without this anxiety and so really need to get over it. I either accept that my fears are a reality and build a bridge to get over it, or I need to stop being so negative and be open to people who will appreciate me for me, not what I look like or how old I am.

My current gf now has a pretty extensive hookup history and in the past, it‚Äôs had the tendency to come up fairly frequently in a very casual way when it relates to something we‚Äôre talking about. I really wish I could just turn off all my insecurities and be able to talk and laugh about her past like I would with a close friend but every time she tells me a story, there‚Äôs been some detail that I fixate on which ends up becoming an intrusive thought or some recurring mental image that I hate. 

For example, something that has come up several times is her blowing other guys in some context. She has told me many times how she doesn‚Äôt like finishing the blow job and doesn‚Äôt want me to cum in her mouth (and honestly, doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy oral sex that much anyway; if it‚Äôs relevant, I love going down on her). I understand and completely respect her wishes and I would never want to pressure her into something she didn‚Äôt want to do, if for no other reason than that it‚Äôs a turn off to know she wouldn‚Äôt be enjoying herself. However, she‚Äôs gone down on and swallowed cum for I don‚Äôt know how many other guys, and apparently even had one cum on her face. 
Again though, I‚Äôm not sure how much she enjoyed all of that, and she‚Äôs opened up to me on how she felt a lot of pressure over the years to use her body to keep guys interested and maybe get them to like her in FWB kind of situations. I know she‚Äôs happy with me and I appreciate that she‚Äôs comfortable enough to tell me what she likes. However, now I‚Äôm stuck with all these casual stories of her getting fucked and cummed on every which way by a bunch of other guys in a pornographic way I find insanely hot, while she‚Äôs saying she specifically doesn‚Äôt want to do it with me. Another that‚Äôs come up is her getting choked, which I think is particularly visceral for me because.. again I find it very hot and she doesn‚Äôt want me to do it, yet she‚Äôs let guys do it to her in the past (the mental image of her getting fucked and choked by some dude she met at a party has been a bit of a recurring intrusive thought). 

I didn‚Äôt always bother me as much in the beginning because my reaction was like‚Ä¶ well damn, she‚Äôs kinky.. how nice for me! But over time, it  started to become clear that our sex lift was not going to be like that and it began to bother me. It‚Äôs progressed to the point where even when she shares the tiniest details of her prior romantic history, I start to get insecure and withdrawn, and I don‚Äôt know how to communicate that I hate hearing about her sex life because I deep down resent that she did those things with other people but doesn‚Äôt want to do them with me. Of course with much emphasis placed on that I would never pressure her into something she doesn‚Äôt want, and part of the reason I have so much trouble verbalizing this is that I almost fear she would cave in and do something she hates to make me happy. 

So I tend to get quiet and she‚Äôll of course get upset as well. The discussion always seems to run back to me feeling insecure about her having sex with other people before me (which is true although there‚Äôs nuance that I have trouble voicing to her). It‚Äôs recurred enough to the point the boundaries have basically been set that we can‚Äôt ever even peripherally reference previous partners because it always leads to a fight. I can even notice now when she actively censors herself off of a story, which is honestly not that much better because it leaves just as much room to the imagination. 

She‚Äôll always reassure me that our emotional connection is superior by a landslide compared to everyone who came before me, and I know that‚Äôs true (for me as well, and one of the reasons I want this to work out so badly). But she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that the sexual aspect for me is independent of that, or at least my perceived deficiencies and sexual insecurities (‚Äúwhy did she want to do X with some random person but not me?‚Äù) are not entirely trumped by an amazing friendship.

I‚Äôm writing this as I sit here listening to two songs back to back with a 12 second cross fade, but I realized today that despite what I told myself I haven‚Äôt really gotten rid of all my feelings. As I sit here crying as I‚Äôm looking at the Snapchat memories we have. I feel like I‚Äôm finally learning what it means to go through the acceptance phase. To accept that yea, this happened, but it‚Äôs time to move on. 

Those memories you build. I‚Äôm 19, and was in college a year ago. The memories from my 19th birthday. Is at a restaurant with my friends. The cute snapchats with the baby filter, and other filters. That look she gives you when you‚Äôre recording that says, are you really recording this? But then she laughs with you and she‚Äôs enjoying her time. Those mirror pictures that you guys take, where it‚Äôs just you two. 

And after your breakup, or whether it‚Äôs months after your break up, and you finally decide to accept the memories; you realize how much happier she made you, even if you were toxic because you didn‚Äôt get over your past relationships and you were scared she would do the same things to you that they did. You‚Äôre looking at these mirror pictures and you start to fall in-love with yourself, but you realize that that‚Äôs not you anymore. You wish you could be that happy, although you didn‚Äôt think you were happy at that time. 

You remember how much she did for you. What she did for you on Valentine‚Äôs Day, or any other day, and no one has ever treated you this way. No one has ever tried to actually help you heal like they did. Yea, you may have family, but family isn‚Äôt the same. I‚Äôm saying all this because I just needed to rant. We broke up a long time ago, but due to our recent interactions, I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself. I‚Äôve pushed my past relationship traumas to the side for when I get stronger to actually face them. 

But she‚Äôs helped me realize what I need to work on, and that I need to face those traumas. She‚Äôs helped me find a place to start, and that‚Äôs better than where we started. Because where we started, I had no place. But now I realize, she‚Äôs given me a place. An actual good place to start. I know more about myself now, than I‚Äôve ever known, and that‚Äôs all thanks to her. I thought I was chill, but then she told me about this other guy, and we‚Äôre just friends now, so it shouldn‚Äôt matter. But it hurt. It hurts. I have a place now, but idk where to go. 

But I miss her, I really do. I miss letting her know that she‚Äôs beautiful. I miss our kisses. I miss ours hugs. I miss our weird moments. I miss those late night talks, where I just wish she would be quite. I miss it. I miss us. So as I sit here in the dark, listening to this transition. I‚Äôm learning to accept that it might actually be over. To accept what I don‚Äôt want to accept, even thought I know it‚Äôs better for her. As I cry and reminisce all the good times, all the bad times.
