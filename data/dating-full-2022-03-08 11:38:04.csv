I’ve really been knocking of all my insecurities the past year, but now with this Im actually starting to think I’m building up an insecurity about my age. Im afraid to actually act my age.

And by the time I’m old enough to consider saying how I feel I’m afraid they’ll either have found someone or grown too old for me.

I think i like the challenge and unlikelihood, that’s probably why I want it. But I’m starting to question if I even do want it. My brain says I dunno, but my emotions say I really should.

I’ve had a breakup (it was long relationship of many years) back in September and ever since I’ve been just dating a lot of people. During all my life I’ve slept with 2 people (during long term relationship) and now during 6 months I’ve slept with around 10. Firstly, it was mainly one night stand type of situations.. then, I started dating somebody more long term. Even developed some feelings, but it’s nothing that lasts long. Mainly, because I just lose feelings. I can like someone a lot, but then after some time I just don’t care so much anymore. And I am even a big frightened of that. When will I finally start falling in love? 

I think it might be unconsciously that I was so hurt before that now even by slightest hint of the person hurting me, I’m trying to withdraw myself from it. But I’m not sure it’s healthy. I also feel really sexually adventurous and the idea of sleeping with different people excites me. (Following all the protection and precautions, Of course). 

But then, at the same time, I miss being in relationship and just having one person to invest my time in and having more of an intimacy.

I've met this cool girl at a bar, she approached me asking what I've written down on my shirt and we hit it off from there. Eventually kissed and had an after at my place with other people and then she went home. After we texted for like 1.5 week. Like every day. And learned a lot about each other and felt that she was just awesome. So we made plans to see each other again, hell I almost couldn't remember her face fully because I was pretty drunk. But when I saw her she was still as cute. Had a some drinks and then went to her place. Slept with her, then went to work and we kissed when leaving. Then she shoots me a message when she was in a train about something a cute picture she saw. We're still talking a week later. She messages me about things she encountered or happened, I do the same. It just clicks. We strike up a conversation and then 50 minutes passed.   
Now the catch: She is super busy. I want to see her again. I think she likes me. But hell I don't know. I know sometimes people can be REALLY busy and I think she is. Lots of friends she has to see and plans. And I'm the exact opposite. I'm pretty spontanious and like don't plan 2 weeks ahead. Hell not even a week ahead. I just call or text and hit it off. I think I'm slowly falling in love with her, but I don't want to get crushed down since I don't feel like I have a definite confirmation from her that she likes me. Or I'm just overthinking the whole situation. She did told me I had a great body, was handsome when I slept with her, but wouldn't you make time for someone you like? I've never been in a relationship. I've always just like had fwb's or just hookups from bars/clubs. But I feel such a good connection with this girl that I have trouble giving my full self because I'm scared she doesn't feel the same as me. Also the reason why I'm still talking to another girl, I've been hooking up with. Thing is I never developed feelings for a girl like I did with her. I wouldn't say I'm in love yet because I haven't opened myself fully. But I definitely know it feels right. So, it's just new to me.  


We did however bought tickets for a party somewhere in April we want to go together. So that gives me sort of confirmation that she really is busy.

Though I want to talk about something first, and that is I feel that a lot of guys lack confidence and start to think they are ugly due to the fact that they just can’t get a girlfriend.

Just search up on YouTube 5 Reasons Finding Love is Too Difficult For Some by Psych2Go

But yeah I’ve noticed that a lot guys in the comment section haven’t had any luck with girls because they fully went with the “work on yourself” thing and well, some of these dudes are actually even 50 years old and still aren’t married because of that, and they are pretty miserable about it too.

So then after looking at the comment section of that video, I then watched a video on YouTube called 3 Mistakes That Prevent You From Getting a Girlfriend by Dan Bacon, and I agree with Dan 100%

But yeah, anyways Dan technically says that if you want a gf, you really need to go out of your comfort zone and just flirt with cute girls that you find attractive and just be confident, because even though you may look ugly, girls love confidence like that and will definitely fall for you.

If there’s anything that girls hate, it’s guys who are desperate and clingy.

So yeah I have no idea what flare I’m going to mark this post as because technically not only am I about to give advice, but I’m also going to ask a question too.

Now first let me go with the advice, and that advice is yes, definitely work on yourself and try to achieve your dream job and such.

But if you still want to get married and such sometime in the future, go to places where you can easily find your ideal type and just outright flirt no matter if it’s a cashier at a store, a bartender, someone who goes on the bus with you, a random girl that you see on the sidewalk, etc. just go up to her and flirt with her but more so in a playful way, not creepy.

Something that would definitely make her feel uncomfortable would be referencing something sexual or something like that.

But yeah definitely practice your flirting skills often and take them into action, because based on what I’ve heard, it always works.

So yeah, but definitely don’t make getting a girlfriend be your main priority, just make it a side one that you can work on along with your main priorities.

In short, not only work on yourself but also try to find your significant other along the way.

That’s the advice that should be given.

Not “work on yourself and the women will come” because to be honest although that is true sometimes, it is however definitely not always the case because like I said, there are people who are like my parents age who went with the work on their self thing and they only got their dream jobs and such, not a wife and kids.

Sooo yeah, and now to my question.

Heck I think I actually have more than one lol.

And those are

1. Is this good advice?
2. Should I work on my flirting skills?
3. Should I be flirty and playful with every girl that I find attractive, even if they are a stranger?
4. How can I work on my flirting skills?
5. Should I work on getting a girlfriend and work towards my dream job and such at the same time? Because I think I should.
6. There is some kind of 80s rock concert that my parents and sister are going to go to, should I tag along to see if I find any girls that I like?

Anyways that’s pretty much all I’m going to say.

And as someone who is 19 years old, I’m going to continue my drivers Ed, learning programming, learning game development, learning animation, trying to get a job. Etc.

But along side all of those main priorities of mine, I will still often times practice my flirting skills and confidence and try to attract some girls and see where things go😉.

And I advise that every other guy does the same instead of going so hard on themselves about being short, ugly, fat, and not being able to get with someone that turns them on.

ANYWAYS, i started feeling bad for how i reacted, i mean. i reacted. pretty badly. multiple messages etc etc etc. until i was blocked. so i decided to apologize. i took the blame for how i reacted to finding out. it was put all on me. i got a very backhanded apology back. but we decided to be friends again. i was asked if i wanted to have sex. (mind you all, this man is recently divorced 🙄) i was super hesitant. because i knew he was still upset over her. i told him “are you SURE you’re ready to do that? because i’ll be dammed if we do and then you feel regret. i will feel guilty”. he told me he was ready. so we did. the next day, he started acting very very distant. i asked him what was up. he said “it’s not you. some days are just harder than others” so i gave him space. a few days later i texted him again asking if he was okay. we chatted a bit then went to sleep. the next day we talked all day. everything was fine. he told me he was going to sleep. i woke up around 12am to check snapchat and noticed his entire account was gone. he didn’t delete/block me. his ENTIRE profile is gone. i texted him. asked if he was okay. he said no. i just asked what was wrong and he said “i don’t wanna talk about it”. so i let it go. and just said “if having me around is hard for you. i can let you go”. it’s obvious something changed after we had sex. he just started talking about “you’d be better off without me anyways” rewind a bit, a few days prior he had told me he was having suicidal thoughts. so the next morning, he wasn’t answering. so i texted him about 5 times and called him about 5 times over the span of 3-4 hours worried if he was okay or not. he replied, said he was busy. i apologized and just said “i didn’t know if you were okay or not” anyways. that day was super shitty. i got into a wreck. it was the first month of march which is a SUPER hard month for me. i was worried about him. my family wasn’t exactly being the nicest to me. so i just texted him about my problems and worries and what was going on with me. he replied with “you’re acting like you were last time when you fucked mow over”. what? me talking about my problems for once instead of his was a problem? i apologized. told him that wasn’t my intention at all and that my day was very bad. he told me he needed space. i gave it to him. a few days later i tried to send him a tiktok, it wouldn’t send since he had unfollowed me. so i texted him. just asking what was up. no reply. i let it go. the next day i sent him another text. just explaining that i felt used. taken advantage of. i was hurt. my feelings were pushed to the side. and i wished him all the best. his reply was “it’s not you. it’s me. i’m disappearing for your own good. i don’t deserve you. you did nothing wrong. i didn’t use you for sex. rightfully hate me, i need to hear it. i used your kindness &amp; presence to comfort me. at the end of the day. i do love you.” like.. what? his response was very.. plain. almost like he rehearsed it. i replied with a couple of questions for closure. no response. i texted him a few hours later and just told him i understood. and i was there if he needed anything. no response. i texted him 2-3 days later. just telling him that i wasn’t doing well with everything. at all. that i needed closure. (i know i’m not obligated to anything) but it would make me feel better. no response. i have severe anxiety. i overthink. i always blame myself. i sent him multiple messages again. like 8 over 5 hours. just begging for closure. because i mean. it’s like i had been used for sex by a close friend. who i share so many good memories with. and no matter what he said, i didn’t believe him. after hours of no response. i lost it. i texted him a long paragraph saying “you want me to hate you? fine. i hate you for making me love you and want to save you” etc etc etc. talking about how i was once again, taken advantage of. and my feelings shouldn’t be brushed to the side. how i was asking for the bare minimum of just having closure. how he knew what he was doing. blah blah. he blocked me after. now i am, once again, beating myself up for how i reacted. i hate how i am. i hate how i need closure. i hate how i always overthink. i hate it. but i was used. period. i let him back into my life which is my own fault, and i got fucked over again. was this all my fault? did i do all of this? i feel terrible. but i’m hurt. and i feel invalidated. i knew he needed space. i should have given it to him. the guilt of letting him make a decision that i KNEW he wasn’t ready to make has filled me with so much anger. when i needed him, he left. and my feelings were pushed to the side. i was always there for him. i would drop anything i was doing to help him. but the second i need something. i’m over reacting. i’m crazy. blah. he drove me crazy. and i feel terrible. and i hate how i am. but i feel so used and hurt with no closure or clarification on what exactly i did wrong for him to do this..",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163031,public,self,this is messy.. help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t9ht8u/this_is_messy_help/,no_ads,0.0,

That’s something I told him I wanted from the start and he agreed. I really enjoy his company and think we get along really well. However, during these two months, most of our hang outs were out in public and totally platonic, I didn’t mind at first. I only came over twice to his place, and it was clear that he wasn’t prioritizing the benefits part of our relationship and it confused me. We had sex once, I have tried to give him two hand jobs, he didn’t cum on either occasions. This messed a bit with my self esteem considering my lack of experience compared to him (his body count is close to 35, and mine is 5), also triggered my insecurities, and him not reassuring me and opening up to me afterwards. The last straw that broke the camel’s back was when I suggested coming over yesterday and he said how he’s “busy” this week. I expressed to him how I’ve been feeling rejected and frustrated. He said he has been feeling a bit off these last few months and just doesn’t think much about sex, and suggested we take it slow. However, just two weeks ago when he was on vacation and he’d told after he came back about how he tried to hook up with two girls he met, but failed and only befriended them. How is that for wanting to take it slow when it comes to sex? I told him everything I felt and asked him for space. He said he agrees on space and said it is hard for him to talk about his mental health.  

This is now fucking with my head and i’m just so confused and hurt. 
I don’t think I’d be into it anymore. There has been enough damage to my self esteem already. It’s both our faults for not talking about sex when it is a relationship that is supposedly revolved around it. I’m just frustrated because I really like him as a person and it really hurts me to know that something is going on with him surrounding sex that I don’t understand, and scared and feel humiliated that he may just not be into me that way.

And I felt like that's what would happen if I just stopped initiating, He has never texted me one without me texting first in the last month... it hurts cause I feel undervalued 
Like him to bits but I don't know how much more I can take, I know this sounds cliche but there is an unspoken bond and it's insane

Well it feels good letting that off, I was really sad today,

People have a very limited amount of exposure to you whether you're meeting them online or in person and you have a very narrow window of opportunity to make a good impression. The rest - personality, hobbies, your career, etc is something you can ""sell,"" to these people later on.

I always feel a little flattered when someone asks, as long as I am not uncomfortable with it I am willing to talk to someone and see where it goes. 

But I always have caution as I will mention, I am asexual. I experience romantic feelings, but am not interested in sex or anything like that. Which can make these types of random encounters kind of futile for the both of us since we wouldn't be compatible if they were not asexual, which most people who you randomly encounter probably wont be. 

But his first text to me was ""You looked beautiful today"". Mind you I had never spoken to him before this and I did not know him, he just randomly came up to me to ask.

And for some reason this rubbed me the wrong way. It obviously isn't a mean thing to say, but for some reason if a guy starts talking to me for the first time by complimenting my looks in some way it just feels weird to me? Like I've never really known how to respond to that, and I would like to at least exchange some info before you get into that.

I can't tell if I'm just reading in between the lines too much, but it always feels like if they compliment my looks first thing...it queues me in that they probably aren't ace and so this whole thing is going to be waste of time if that is their goal. 

Am I being overly cautious in this situation and should I loosen up?

Not exactly sure what my direction with this post is, probably will be a mix of a vent and also looking for advice.

My identity within my friend group is the one who is always single but for some reason all my friends come to me for relationship advice almost like an arbitrator. I even got the nickname Coach cause my friends always tell me Coaches don't play the game they teach it. The only 2 ""relationships"" I've ever been in were back in 7th grade and in 9th grade, neither of them lasting over 2 months, so I've essentially been single my whole life, it's something I've gotten used to but at the same time it has caused some real lows in my life especially right now. Before I talk about my self a bit I would like to mention I am well aware of the ""nice guy"" stereotype as I browse that subreddit alot and imo doesn't apply to me, I wouldn't dream of behaving the way of the posts I see on that subreddit.

1. To start, I'm not an unattractive dude, but I'm not some 10/10 gigachad either, I'd give my self a solid 6-6.5 (probably raise it to 7.5-8.5 if I fix my hair, my first post if you're interested). I also used to be pretty in-shape with a nice body until my last attempt where I got stood up pretty bad about 8 months ago and haven't worked out since.

2. I don't think I have a problem talking to girls either (I have a harder time if I have to force the interaction but if it happens naturally it's easy for me), I went up to Colorado to go snowboarding last December and at one point I got on a gondola with this girl my age and it went amazing, we had a pretty deep life talk I don't think it could've went any better.

3. I don't have an inflated ego and I can admit when I'm wrong, I'm probably biased here but I don't see any glaring flaws in my personality that's affecting me here. I browse AskReddit alot and I always read the post about dating and what girls like and don't like in guys and on the good side of it are things I can easily see myself doing in a relationship and the bad side most of them I wouldn't dream of doing.

4. If I ever meet a girl first online and start talking to them they just always seem to be... Uninterested? I usually get these short and terse replies that make it difficult to have any type of conversation past the icebreaker stage. I can keep a conversation going if they actually want to but it rarely seems to even get to that point.

5. Finding girls to meet in person is something else I struggle with where I live. I don't live in the middle of nowhere but it's not a densely populated area either. I go to a community college and the campus life is completely dead, my town has straight up banned bars too so that's another dead end. It just seems like where I live it's difficult to find somewhere where I can have naturally occurring conversations with girls I haven't met before.

And he took it fine, didn't even mention rescheduling or anything that felt like pressure which made me feel a lot better abou tit in return. A few days went by and I got my car back and I had been enjoying our convos so I told him my weekend freed up a bit. We started to try to make some plans again and then he told me he could that day (Thursday) or Saturday.

I am interested in this girl, and I have been for a while, however, she has had a boyfriend (now single) for the last two years, who I may add had been cheating on her since the beginning (she found out and told me).

So her, couple of friends, and myself all went to have a couple of drinks, and we are all feelin pretty nice, dancing, etc., but as the night goes on, her and I are sorta standing to the side alone in the bar, and she tells me ""You and I can fuck, or we can do a three-way"".. this alone caught me off guard, but my response was ""I'm down for that"" and so we just continued talking after that, later that night when the bars are all closed, we are walking with all of our friends to get food, her and I are locked arms/holding hands up until her and her friends she came with decided to leave. 

Now, I was with my bestfriend after the girls all left (who is also friends with the girl), I told him what she had said to me, and he said ""Yeah because she likes you, I told you this before"". Now back story off of that is when her and I are together she's always hanging off of me, touching me, etc.. and everyone always says she is into me, but it could just be how she is, and I don't wanna jump to conclusions, mostly because she's an absolute dime and I consider myself to just be 'ok'. 

Now just this past weekend, she called me asking if I wanted to go out, I said sure, and my bestfriend commented ""Odd that she called you but didn't bother even texting me"". 

So we ended up going out, her and I, and we had deeper conversations, talking about our childhoods, family, where we want to be in life, etc... Fast forward to the end of the night, I knew she was spending the night, so I told her to take the bed, I'll sleep on the couch, so I go and lay on the couch, and after she changes, she comes out and says ""come sleep with me"", I responded ""Are you sure?"" and she follows up with ""Yes, you're cuddly"", so I ended up changing and getting into bed, and she puts her feet in-between my legs, and we share some laughs, and we end up falling asleep.

In the morning, nothing eventful happens, she ends up leaving heading back home.

So I am confused, I can't get a read on her. I don't know if shes just trying to fuck, or if she's just being friendly (now that she is single, wanting attention, or what..

We went on our first date last week, just bowling and some time at an arcade. We got on well, I find him attractive and we’re pretty similar. The chat is natural and we’ve got a similar sense of humour etc.

So we agreed to meet again, which ended up being today. He came to my place (I have a flat and he still lives at home). We just hung out, played mario kart, watched some Netflix. He’s made it clear he’s into me, I just am so on the fence about how I’m feeling.

We did kiss goodbye, but it felt more like when you kiss someone goodbye who you’ve known for ages like in a ltr. I didn’t get butterflies or have any urge to be physical with him. Now comes the bit that may sound weird but still bothered me - so I have a little kitten. He’s my baby, I love him so much. This guy got on well with him, although my kitten is fairly friendly with everyone but then he started making weird jokes. Like sexual jokes about my cat. Now I understand we all have our own sense of humour, maybe I would have found it ‘funny’ if it wasn’t my cat. But he wouldn’t stop, he kept joking about my kitten going near his dick and making groaning noises whenever he’d go under the sheets. 

It just made me feel so weird because he kept doing it. I understand maybe I’m being picky but I just don’t know….

Hello all! Not exactly sure what my direction with this post is, probably will be a mix of a vent and also looking for advice.

My identity within my friend group is the one who is always single but for some reason all my friends come to me for relationship advice almost like an arbitrator. I even got the nickname Coach cause my friends always tell me Coaches don't play the game they teach it. (Sidenote: I am a FUCKING WIZARD at solving relationship problems) The only 2 ""relationships"" I've ever been in were back in 7th grade and in 9th grade, neither of them lasting over 2 months, so I've essentially been single my whole life, it's something I've gotten used to but at the same time it has caused some real lows in my life especially right now. Before I talk about my self a bit I would like to mention I am well aware of the ""nice guy"" stereotype as I browse that subreddit alot and imo doesn't apply to me, I wouldn't dream of behaving the way of the posts I see on that subreddit.

To start, I'm not an unattractive dude, but I'm not some 10/10 gigachad either, I'd give my self a solid 6-6.5 (probably raise it to 7.5-8.5 if I fix my hair, my first post if you're interested). I also used to be pretty in-shape with a nice body until my last attempt where I got stood up pretty bad about 8 months ago and haven't worked out since.

I don't think I have a problem talking to girls either (I have a harder time if I have to force the interaction but if it happens naturally it's easy for me), I went up to Colorado to go snowboarding last December and at one point I got on a gondola with this girl my age and it went amazing, we had a pretty deep life talk I don't think it could've went any better.

I don't have an inflated ego and I can admit when I'm wrong, I'm probably biased here but I don't see any glaring flaws in my personality that's affecting me here. I browse AskReddit alot and I always read the post about dating and what girls like and don't like in guys and on the good side of it are things I can easily see myself doing in a relationship and the bad side most of them I wouldn't dream of doing.

If I ever meet a girl first online and start talking to them they just always seem to be... Uninterested? I usually get these short and terse replies that make it difficult to have any type of conversation past the icebreaker stage. I can keep a conversation going if they actually want to but it rarely seems to even get to that point.

Finding girls to meet in person is something else I struggle with where I live. I don't live in the middle of nowhere but it's not a densely populated area either. I go to a community college and the campus life is completely dead, my town has straight up banned bars too so that's another dead end. It just seems like where I live it's difficult to find somewhere where I can have naturally occurring conversations with girls I haven't met before.

disclaimer: im overthinking this wildly, im aware, but here comes an overexplanation

been texting this person every day for a few weeks now, but we've only managed to meet up once. (for background, we already knew each other, as we dated for like a month in the fall)

we've brought up multiple times the idea of seeing each other again, but havent said an actual day. then their birthday came around, and i gave them a gift (dropped it off and left, they were sick). it was very forward of me honestly, especially considering we are not close, but also my gift idea was inexpensive and such a good idea that i couldn't get it out of my head to do it. he was happy abt it, started asking me when my bday was and asked for pics to set as my pfp in his phone. 

next day, they ask to hang out, but its kinda last minute. i told them i couldnt because i was studying with a friend and didnt wanna bail on them. i then ask, what about tomorrow? they didn't answer that. we kept talking but it kinda got brushed over. 

yesterday, he brings up again the idea of us meeting up, but leaves it at that for a few hours. so i just ask when we'll see each other. first, he asks if we had plans tonight that he forgot because he has a lot going on. when i say not tonight, but when else would they be free, they say the above in the tldr. 

i kinda didnt answer after that. to me, not offering any specific days to meet means they dont really want to. its like ""yeah, i'll hang out with you if i have nothing better to do"". when we dated in the fall our plans were never last minute, they were always made at least the day before, so to me the message was very clear.
