2,pvc5jn,1632592988,Recovering from abuse as a man,"Hi everyone, 
I‚Äôve debated posting about this for a long time, as a man I find this subject particularly difficult to discuss as there just isn‚Äôt as much support available as there is for women. 

Before I begin, I‚Äôd like to make it clear I have been out of this relationship for 4 years now and haven‚Äôt had contact with the person since. 

I started a relationship with a girl I met while at university, in the beginning of the relationship things were fairly normal. However upon reflection there was some cracks that seem quite obvious to me now. 

I suffer from treatment resistant clinical depression and generalised anxiety disorder. I am in a fairly good place with it now, but at the time of the relationship I was in the worst state of my life. 

The girl that I was with at this time, was in the beginning quite understanding or at least I thought she was. 

As my illness started getting worse, she started using tactics against me. I understand this now as gaslighting. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail on this, but the types of things she would do. Would be making me question my own sanity, she was very sarcastic and would put me down regularly about everything. She would start arguments about very small things, and would withhold sex and make me feel bad about wanting to have sex. 

She eventually cut me off from my friends and family, and eventually drove me to attempting to commit suicide. 

She would purposely ignore my messages when she knew I was worse than normal with my depression and would go on nights out when she said she would see me. 

It all eventually came to a head, and I ended the relationship. I was told by a doctor that I was two weeks away from dying as I had not ate a full meal in a year and was mixing alcohol with my medicines. My organs were starting to stop working properly. Luckily I got back in touch with my family and I spent six months recovering in bed on a diet of full fat milk and ice cream. I also had to withdraw from the medicines I was taking, which was hell. I believe I may have had a seizure at one point too, but my memory is foggy of a lot of aspects of the recovery. 

I have now met the woman I think I‚Äôm going to marry, I‚Äôm not going to say too much about her. But she loves me unconditionally and I love her back. She doesn‚Äôt shout at me and is extremely patient with me, which I greatly appreciate more than she could ever know. 

The reason for my post, is the subject of the sexual component of the abuse. 

As I said she would purposely withhold sex from me, and if we were to have sex there would be conditions to it. For example, one time she made me put on her lingerie to humiliate me, and in return she would put it on and have sex with me. 

I have a fixation now that I was coercing her to have sex, it makes me feel like I was a abuser. Because I always had to ask her to have sex, and it was always a big discussion. I do realise that I was not really being coercive as I was craving intimacy and I just wanted to feel loved and cared for. 

Even the times that I may have asked a bit more than usual, it did not normally result in sex. Majority of the time, it would end up with me crying and her purposely laying further away from me in bed and her letting me cry myself to sleep every night. 

I‚Äôd also like to state that she made a number of attempts to contact me after the relationship ended and I had to get a new phone number and new social media accounts. 

I am worried that she would try and say that I was coercing her into sex and this would ruin my new and very happy relationship. 

I have spoken to a number of friends and family about this, and even my new girlfriend about this and they all agree that I was the one that was being abused in this relationship. But my anxiety tells me that I was the abuser and it‚Äôs all my fault. I feel a great deal of shame, guilt and regret with what happened to me in that relationship and I‚Äôve not gotten closure from this. Even though I have done years of CBT to get me back to functioning. It doesn‚Äôt get any easier. I feel undeserving of love, and I genuinely hate myself. 

I don‚Äôt really know how to get past this, and there isn‚Äôt really much support I can find for this kinda thing as I‚Äôm a man. Most of the literature is geared towards women, which I totally understand why. But I feel lost and as an outsider within the survivor community.

For context, since March 2021 we've been sexting sometimes, and sometimes it gets really heated and we tell each other what we want to do to each other.

He got all awkwarded out and we talked about it figuring out what we should do, we decided to stop the sexting completely because it made him kind of uncomfortable and he was joking.

Since then, he's tried to initiate sexting once, and today we sexted for real this time. He told me that he would ""love to f\*ck"" and that he was ""hard"", after that ended he told me he was joking again, so I'm kind of confused. Why does he do this?

- mentions generic TV shows or films like the Office 
- people who's only listed job is ""landlord""
- conservative political stance or has anything to do with politics, vaccines, masks, talking about god or other nonsense in their bio
- talks about being obsessed with the gym but looks skinny
- bad hair cuts/hair that's too short/side parts/receding hairlines
- looking like every other man, having no style or unique vibe that stands out
- thinks that it's different to be ""into travelling""
- has a Snapchat handle in their bio

Since early childhood I've been fascinated with English language and British culture. I've often dreamt of living in a foreign country. I come from a relatively poor family, but thanks to my English skills I have a well-paying career that can give me enough money to eventually move to a different country.

Unfortunately, my career leaves little time for dating in real life. All my co-workers are male and my job requires me to be away from home for 4-6 months with 2-3 month vacations.

Some things I've tried:

* **Dating apps**: I get very few matches. Most don't respond. I've had more people make fun of me than go on a date with me.
* **Dance classes**: The women in the classes didn't seem to want to dance with me, so I often ended up dancing with one of the instructors.
* **Talking to people at bars**: Most people just don't seem interested in talking with me.
* **Meetup groups**: The main problem is that most groups I can join skew much older in age.

66,pvhy43,1632612259,Thinking of asking a girl out at work,"I'm a 25M with aspergers. I've lived a pretty unconventional life, I dropped out of school and homeschooled for 5 years because of bullying, anxiety and depression. I did well at it, ended up on a scholarship to college and grad school. I never really socialized much there but graduated from both top of my class.

I eventually landed a good job for this year and moved out of home to my own apartment. It was only ever a temporary gig though and I'm leaving for another job in January. Before this year, I had never gone on date, kissed anyone, or had sex. A few months ago, at the behest of a 24F work friend, I started a bumble, hinge and tinder account. I never really got anywhere on bumble or tinder but ended up getting quite a few good matches on hinge. The first girl, 26F, I went out with on hinge was the most successful, we ended up going out on 4 dates, and she ended up french kissing me at the end of the date, before breaking it off with me because she wasn't emotionally ready for a relationship. The other hinge dates were less successful and non-eventful, and probably not super-relevant here.

To be honest, I'm stuck in a paradox, where on the one hand, I never took the apps especially seriously because I viewed them as a contrived social situation and always wanted/dreamed of meeting someone in person, whilst on the other always being too scared and lacking the self-confidence to ask someone out in person. I can't help but think that I was right about the apps, and therefore need to develop the confidence to ask someone out in person.

A few months ago, a new girl, 22F started at work. We work on different floors so I don't really work closely with her but I see her around a bit. I've spoken to her a few times and she seems sweet and quite shy and awkward which makes me think she'd be a good personality match. She's also gorgeous which helps lol. As far as I can tell from her fb and insta she doesn't have a bf. I am aware that there are obviously risks from asking out someone at work, but I think they're mitigated at least somewhat by the fact that we don't work together and that I'm leaving in a few months. It's also a pretty unconventional workplace where interoffice romances are, if anything, encouraged. That said, it's going to be quite awkward as I've never asked someone out before, but I need to start somewhere.

Any advice about how to approach this?

Granted, it wasn‚Äôt strictly a date but it felt like one; he turned up in a shirt, invited me back to his place after and then walked me home. However, he never made a move or even came close to me except at the end when he gave me a quick goodbye hug. 

A few days ago he asked me for a second drink and I agreed. I took this as a good sign and thought since he hadn‚Äôt made a move the first time he was just shy. However, having just come back from said second ‚Äòdate‚Äô we did the same as the first and still no move.

However, he still sat far away from me and even on the opposite chair from me at his house at one point so I couldn‚Äôt even try and make a move on him‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt even try to brush my arm or anything. Literally 0 physical contact.

I didnt tell my crush anything about her but she is quite hot and I guess my crush got a little jelous since she left almost without notice. I didnt get to tell her that this other girl has a boyfriend. Anyways, we met up for a late evening walk today. We both had busy days but she showed up eventually. I had bought her two gold spoons and some high quality tea to match her gold cups. A pretty personal gift. I was super nervous about it and thought that maybe she would think it was too much. She really appreciated it though. A much more positive reaction than I usually get when I give people gifts. She got emotional and I think she cried a little. She said I had to come over for a cup of tea next time and she invited me out tomorrow already. I cant though. Her plans were too early for me. But she asked me to come visit as soon as possible and that she had no plans whatsoever next weekend and that I can come on weekdays too. I guess we are getting serious but we still havent kissed. I am less anxious about it now though. I feel comfortable with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvider/i_gave_her_a_gift_today/

74,pvifdv,1632614051,What does a third date mean to you?,"I'm ever so slightly lacking experience here. I recently went on a second date for a first time. So we did something fun, then rather than calling it a night took a walk, sat and chatted for an hour. I'm talking and asking questions, there's only ever an odd silence but I'm 90% ok with it. Same as the last time we kissed (although this was slightly more awkward as we were in a car). Since then I'd say we're slightly more comfortable with each other, texting a little more, although not constantly as though we're an actual couple.

Anyway there's a few things I'd like help with. I don't want the spark to fizzle out, but I'm also quite bad at reading signs or taking a lead. I'm also a little afraid of talking about relationship stuff just with not having the experience, although if it comes up I think I'm comfortable in simply saying I've not had a relationship because I wasn't comfortable, but now I am.

79,pvizmj,1632616123,Question for Ladies and Gents!!,"For reference I am a woman.   


I had a question! So often what I've been seeing both on the online dating apps(mostly) and when I go to events for speed dating/dating events. Why do guys call potential SO's 'sweetheart/honey/etc' those pet names when they first meet someone? I've had it mostly happen online but it has happened when I do the in person events too. I find it extremely uncomfortable especially if it's the first thing that they say to me.   


To Guys:   
Why do you do this? I'm not sure how calling a complete stranger any sort of pet name puts a woman at ease in this situation, especially if it's a date or starting a chat. If you don't do this, maybe throw something up to clarify why.  


To the Ladies:  
Has this happened to you? Did you mind? What did you think? How did it make you feel? Are you comfortable with pet names at all? Why or why not?   


Personally, I tell them if they do it to please not do it anymore as it makes me uncomfortable. Most of them listen but the others tend to get upset that I'm getting offended over something small. Which, of course, is a huge red flag for me and I just cut off contact. If they can't respect my simple request to pump the breaks, they don't need to talk to me(or anyone else they don't pay mind to really).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvizmj/question_for_ladies_and_gents/
80,pvj014,1632616163,Anyone have stories about overcoming linguistic exclusion when dating someone of a different sociolinguistic background?,"I'm a white male, my girlfriend is a Chinese female. We are in our early mid 20s. We have had a long and sometimes rollercoaster-like relationship, but we love each other very much and plan to get married.

We've accepted eachother including flaws and baggage, including complications of intercultural dating. However, there are a few issues, which are not deal breakers or totally unbearable, but I'd love to work on for quality of life and fulfilment.

You see, she's been in the states for over 10 years and she's heavily influenced by both American and Chinese culture. She can fit into either perfectly, and is great at negotiating the differences. However, 95% of her friends, and there are a lot of them, are Chinese. Most of them are students here, speak fluent but rigid English, and have a very marked distaste for almost anything non-Chinese.

I've gotten used to most of it. I know anytime we socialize we will only be eating hotpot or noodles and that most of our socializing will involve eating. I'm 100% fine because I understand it's not easy to be in another part of the world as a minority and it's much easier for them to speak their native language and that they genuinely prefer their own culture. I love her so it's not a huge deal.

The one thing that kind of diminishes my quality of life though is that they all will only speak in Mandarin around me. I can understand and respond some, but not nearly at their speed or nuance. So, I usually end up getting left out of conversations. I probably interact 5% verbally and usually nothing gets translated to me. So, I get bored pretty fast and I usually zone out, talk to other people nearby in public, or play on my phone. I am not trying to be standoffish! It's just really hard to invest in a night out when I have no idea what's going on, even though they will talk about me and not explain what's being discussed.  

I know the friends don't hate me, they're nice enough to me, but they don't make any effort to include me. I've talked to my girlfriend about it who doesn't have much of an opinion and doesn't seem to care that I feel excluded. Despite that, she's a really wonderful person so I just assume she doesn't understand it. Still, I've explained to her how it would feel if I speak Spanish exclusively around her when I'm with my friends, even though we all make sure to only speak English around her. 

It's not the end of the world. I am fine with just being a kind of extra wheel because our relationship is great otherwise and I have my own social circle. I ask because I wouldn't mind to feel more fulfilled and be able to participate more. And yes, I've been studying Chinese for 3 years and feel to be at their level would take many more years and a much greater level of immersion than currently capable.

So there this girl I like alot and we have been having a great time so far (I think). I have her in 3 classes and we talk the whole time. We even walk to the bus together. 
A few days ago I was planning on getting either her phone number/Snapchat but since I'm extremely shy I didn't have the courage to do it. After a few minutes I was scrolling through snap, she grabbed my phone and added herself on it without saying anything (I hope that's a good sign) and we kept on talking. 

The problem is At first I thought she was into me since she seemed genuinely interested bc we talked every day, Walked to the bus with her, She told me alot about herself, she didn't mind me touching her (not inappropriately ofc) and I actually make her laugh a decent amount (I'm not even sure if I'm that funny sometimes I make myself laugh ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø) 

Either way i try to make conversation through snap and now I feel like she isn't interested at all. I understand if she has stuff to do after school or weekend, but she seems to talk Alot more irl then through texting. 
She might prefer Irl talking but I'm not really sure ....

I've been talking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks. He's a former model, and can sing and play instruments, and is honestly the most attractive person I've ever seen or met.

 We went on one date and it went really well. We had lunch and then we went to a nature trail nearby, and he sat me down on a log and we made out. He drove an hour to see me since I can't drive yet and he said he usually doesn't do that for anyone. He said that he's falling for me and obsessed with me and that he might be my perfect match, and that the reason the other dates I've gone on haven't let to anything is because they weren't as smart as me and I didn't kiss on any of them.

But he says that he wants to have unprotected sex with me in his car on our second date to see if the sex is good, and if it is then we'll become boyfriends (he made it very clear that he needs to cum inside me). I'm a virgin and usually don't want to have sex with someone until we're in a relationship, but I really do like this guy. I'm a little afraid that he might just want me for sex, but he has said that he doesn't, and said that I made him feel bad when I asked him if that was the case. 

I told him that I wasn't sure if I'd be ready to have sex with him so soon. He said we could have sex when I'm ready to but that it would delay the relationship. I feel a little conflicted about this.

I am Latino also and kinda light skinned (lighter than tanned but not fair skinned) but I think what hinders me is that I look a little bit Asian to some people at least.

The next day I texted him thanking him and apologize again. No response. A few days went by and still no response. Keep in mind we had been texting just about every day for weeks now and he had apologized in the past about taking almost a day to respond one time. Broke down and texted him Tuesday night. He responded but we didn‚Äôt talk for very long. He said he was dealing with a family issue but didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. I texted him again on Wednesday just asking about his day, and I still haven‚Äôt gotten a response.
