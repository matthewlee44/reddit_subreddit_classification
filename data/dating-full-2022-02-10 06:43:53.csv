It went great we went out to eat and talked and then went to get dessert and talked for hours in the car laughing and overall I would say it was a success. 


So a day goes by and I ask her 

“Hey would you like to go grab a bite to eat again on Sunday or Monday?”  (off days) 


She replies like 10 hrs later saying she’s sorry for the late response that she’s busy both days , which is perfectly understandable 

But dosent procede to say she’s free on another day or try to reschedule or anything like that. 

I then say no problem to let me know whenever she’s free

For those of you who don't know - Caleb is a regular Joe who is attractive, tall and has a decent job. He is accused of ghosting different women who he met online after a few dates, love bombing them and sharing the same spotify playlist with some of them. The women took it to Tiktok and they randomly found each other and he became an internet meme, people vilifying him and calling him to lose his job.

So many news media's covered this including Forbes.
West Elm Caleb Doesn't Deserve All This Internet Hate - Forbes

Here are my issues with this whole thing - 
1.Ghosting isn't right but most of these women who call him out probably does it too. One girl one her tik tok literally talks about ""adding men to roster"". 
2.If you need to vent why are you bringing personal identity, his work place, name and everything into the mix. 
3. As a guy I get ghosted a lot. I don't go on tiktok posting and calling names. 
4.For a generation that cares so much about mental health they don't seem to care about ruining this guy's life at all for a few minutes of fame and attention. This is cyner bullying is.

I see a lot of people give advice like 'love yourself', 'work on yourself'. I don't get it how.

So mean while i want to 'work on myself' like you guys say, how do I that? Like started to workout everyday to get a bit buffed and look a bit more attractive. I don't want to be Ryan Gosling, but someone who is confident enough get dates and be witty enough to keep someone interested. And i lack both. 

I try to talk to people but it gets really awkward, I'm a nerd and a geek so all i know are coding, computers, video games, tv shows and movies and the other person isn't remotely interested when we talk. Also like my personality changes when i talk to girls, like think of how Michael Scott changes his behaviour when he finds out Pam set him up with someone in that bar, that except it's bit more serious and stiff. I don't know why this happenes and beat myself after every encounter i have.

So I'm sure the 1year I've given myself is long enough to make myself better, so How do I become more confident and funny? How do I work on myself exactly to get into a relationship?

We’ve been living away for the past 2 months and have been texting everyday and we used to sleep on call as well. He also asked me to be his valentine and booked dinner for us on the 14th when we finally see each other after almost 3 months. 

His mum found out about his interest in me and the potential that he might date me and since then she’s looked me up on social media and he’s been pretty much lecturing him not to get into a serious relationship. The lectures happen quite frequently and she’s gone and told his friends and relatives to tell him not to date as well. Even his hairdresser….

She found out about Valentine’s Day and rostered him to work on that day (she’s his manager at work). 

And ever since being lectured by his mum, he’s just been super distant and has tried to ghost me a couple of times. He also said that he’s losing feelings for me.

Literally the week before, we were sleeping on call, watching movies and making plans for when we finally meet. He was saying how he wanted to tell me he loves me in person.

Now everything’s just gone and it’s getting a bit awkward because I can’t rlly express how much I still like him and he obviously doesn’t/can’t reciprocate.

He’s only going to be home for 2 more weeks before he moves to my city for uni (he’s moving without his parents) 

He says to wait until we see each other in person but I can’t help but worry that it won’t be the same that I won’t even be able to hug him.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158254,public,self,His mum is not letting him date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sp1rmf/his_mum_is_not_letting_him_date/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

They both lived together, but one of them was moving to a different city for six months, and they were looking for someone to take her room in the meantime.

We had a really cool, fun and a tiny bit flirtatious conversation through Zoom for about an hour, and they said they would send me a message regarding if I would have the room or not. I already expected not to get the room (because I felt the situation would be a little bit weird if I just moved in with one of them for a couple of months after we flirted a little bit on a zoom call), but once I got their answers I asked them for their Insta contacts, saying I had found a flatshare myself but would love keeping in touch, because we had a great time on zoom. And it actually worked. Both of them said they had a great time and sent me their insta contacts.

So, the question is: what's next? As I said, one of the girls will be away for a couple of months, and I've never met them personally. What would be some good follow ups? Should I keep flirting with both of them, or focus on the girl who is staying in town? Should I try asking her out right away?

So our situation is really complicated we started talking in 2020 but I used to live with my aunt and uncle and they were really strict, they did not let me go out or anything and the guy that I talk to he lives in another state so I could not see him at all so eventually he ended up finding a girlfriend and I started talking to another guy. Things didn’t work for either of us so we started talking again in 2021, after I moved out. In my head I thought we were getting serious we try to see each other as much as we can (since we live kinda far, and we both work), we talked about our future, like moving in and kids, and we even say I love you to each other some times, and yes we are not in a relationship (we just don’t have a title 🙄). Recently we had a conversation and he mentioned that he did not want to be in a relationship so I asked “what do you mean about not wanting to be in a relationship, because then what’s the point of all this”and he said that he got out of his relationship and he was heartbroken so he just wanted a little bit more time, he said that he wants to be in a relationship with me but eventually. Another situation that happened, he misunderstood what I said and thought I thought he was with a girl and bla bla bla, and he said we was home with his friend (he actually was because he FaceTimed me earlier), and said “you know how I feel about you but I’m still single”. So this whole situation is confusing me because I don’t know what he thinks we are from my point of view, I believe we are in a relationship because we do couple things, he acts like he’s my boyfriend, I act like I’m his girlfriend he says I love you to me, we talked about our future together I know his parents, he knows my parents, I know his friends and it’s confusing me so I don’t know what to do. And I know it sounds like he’s wasting my time but I’m trying to be patient with him and also give him time to heal because we started talking a few months after his relationship ended. So I can understand the way he feels but I also feel like he should understand the way I feel. He still FaceTimes me everyday, we talk everyday, we watch movies together, we try to visit each other as much as we can.
I just wanted to ask if he talks to other girls but maybe that’s too immature, so I’m going to ask where do we stand because if it’s different than what I think, I’m probably going to have to make a decision.

I love that she's outgoing, certainly makes a change, mostly dated girls who were very quiet so they made dinners out etc with friends quite awkward. My girlfriend is very chatty but also quite loud and tends to make all the conversation topics about herself.

I've noticed this around her friends but I shrugged it off because her friends whilst lovely are quite boring and just tend to stick to the standard smalltalk script, but last weekend it was her best friend's birthday, sat next to her friend and I barely got a work in, my girlfriend was basically heading the table 6 people listening to her and she got more and more drunk therefore louder. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to embarrass her, but she enthusiastically shouted ""lets go to a kareoke bar!"" and her friend kind of pulled a face so I gently said ""is this what YOU want? it is YOUR birthday"" and she kind of just shrugged... so in this case, fair enough, I get it, her friends are very submissive and indecisive so perhaps she has felt like she needed to lead them.

But last night, one of my oldest friends came all the way to my city with his wife (me and my girlfriend went to their wedding a month ago) and thing is, they are incredibly sweet, he's like Flanders basically, so they WILL listen to anything anyone says. Anyway, so as soon as they sat down she's taking over the conversation asking them how their journey was etc etc, I appreciate it, she's being socialble, so we get talking and I'm very much making the conversation topics about them etc asking questions.. anyway, my girlfriend keeps changing the subject about her job... she has a mind numbing job in finance... she KEPT bringing it up, she loves it and kept talking about stakeholders asset managment etc etc and of course they politely hung onto every word and showed an interest. They asked me how my job was going, and, well, not to sound arrogant but I have a creative job which normally sparks a dozen questions from people, but I don't waffle on about it for half an hour, I just summarised how it was going in a few bullet points and then asked them both how their jobs were going.

So my girlfriend has just had a new kitchen installed in her apartment and it's great she's so excited about it but it's ALL she's been talking about for the last month and she brought that up, went on and on about it, then when my friends said they were moving to a particular area, of course, she knows that area and proceeded to give like a 20 minute sales pitch about her friend who fitted her kitchen and then kept talking about how she has this connection and that connection in the area she can really help them etc etc.... I just pretty much zoned out.

I appreciate she was just trying to help them, but like, I don't know how to tell her that sometimes she REALLY needs to just reign it in and not making everything about her boring job and her fucking kitchen... we're all guilty of being over chatty when we're excited about something and when alchohol is in the system but still...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158263,public,self,"My [M29] girlfriend [F24] is too loud and domineering in social gatherings, how can I tell her to cool it without hurting her feelings?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sp32nx/my_m29_girlfriend_f24_is_too_loud_and_domineering/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

31m met 32f online. Just some brief context,

She  liked my photo on the app and asked me out for a drink. She got there  15 minutes early and got a table. The date went as well as any first  date online could go. It felt easy and any pre date nerves I had were  gone quickly. At the end of the date she initiated a hug. She texted me  when she got home, saying if I'd like to do it again to let her know.

I  know some people won't like this, but I check my dates online status on  the app to gauge their interest to see if I am wasting my time or not.  She wasn't active at all the weeks leading up to our date. Then she was  ""active now"" immediately after our date while we were texting each  other. And she hasn't been active since. I'm guessing she was looking at  my profile.

That was 1.5 weeks  ago. I have been unusually busy since the date, like, have barely had  any free time as every responsibility in my life decided to blow up at  the same time. Anyway. we texted the first couple days after the date,  then didn't talk for 4 days. Which is fine with me, I'd rather get to  know someone in person.

So, on  Tuesday I asked her if she was free on Saturday. She told me ""I might  have family plans, but will try to cancel them :)"".

I was super into her, and I was pretty confident she was super into me. We talked a lot on the phone, shared a lot of common interests, even started binging a new Netflix series together. 

We spent about 7 hours together on the first date doing different activities, mainly because I had to take a bus to her because she lived about an hour away. So we both thought we’d make a day out of it. Overall, on the day, I had a really fun time, and she reiterated she had a great time too. I was buzzed off the high of what I thought was a great first date. Until later that evening, she sent me the dreaded “I think we should just be friends”. 

Like damn man. Of course I respect her decision, and didn’t choose to fight it. And told her I wasn’t really looking for friends, and things just ended there. Removed each other from everything, and gone like nothing ever happened.

About a month later, after yet more talking, I tried to invite her to an event. She again declined, though this time it was with the excuse that she was busy that day. Again, she remained friendly and we still talked.

A while later, me being the dense boy that I am, figured I would give it one more shot. This time I was more direct asked outright if she would ever agree to go out with me. Her answer was something along the lines of ""sure"", so I again asked if she wanted to do something with me on the weekend. She said was busy, but maybe next weekend. I figured, at least its not a no. 

Next weekend comes along so I ask if she is still ok with going out to do something. This time she says no, lets just remain friends. At this point we stop talking as much, probably just made things awkward. If you are still reading at this point, you might be thinking I'm a total idiot. I would agree.

Last year, I started university online (due to the pandemic), and started talking to this guy in my class who's a fair bit older to me. He might have been interested in me for a bit but lost interest and moved on, and started dating someone else. I got over it. Now he's one of my best friends and I genuinely feel repelled at the thought of thinking of him as anything more.   


But, but, but ...   


While I was talking to this guy, there was another guy in my class much closer to me in age and very close to one of my best friends in class (let's call her A).   


A and this guy live in the same city, and they've met quite a few times. She constantly wants to set people up. When university started and A and this guy (let's call him R) became friends, she introduced him to a cute girl in a different class that she was sure he'd like. Him and her started talking.   


A, R and I have been teaming up a fair bit for competitions lately and have ended up spending a lot of time together. I got over the other guy and started liking this one sometime in Decembe or Janauary.  


This is where the situation becomes complicated.   


R has been on one date with the girl A introduced him to. But that was before we became close. For the past month or couple of weeks, R and I have stayed up all night talking (we've literally caught sunrises together) and we are so similar it's sort of scary. Almost everything about us is the same, from childhood traumas to sense of humour to music taste to life ambitions. I have found myself, once again, liking him a little too much.   


But the problem is that he still likes the other girl who lives in his city, and they're even going on their second date soon (their first date was months ago but they've been talking since then). He's still not committed to her. I don't know why he doesn't want to get into a committed relationship with her, but A keeps egging him in that direction (she doesn't know I like him).   


Today he texted me that he's very grateful to 'have friends like you and A' in his life. I'm pretty sure I'm stuck very firmly in the friendzone, but I was wondering if it was worth waiting it out. Maybe him and this other chick won't stick. Or maybe they will stick and I'll be made a fool of for waiting for someone again.

Not saying there isn’t, I just personally haven’t seen or experienced someone who wouldn’t cheat in some form or another. Even the toxicity that exists in these relationships is so present.

What does upset me is the mindset that people are adapting that cheating is becoming normalized. And that’s what upsets me, that’s where i lose hope.

I believe social media has been a contributing factor to this aswell. It has corrupted dating and makes a toxic foundation to a relationship. It’s crazy just the other day, My friend was explaining to me how to reply to someone your into on snapchat.

So here's the story:

About a month ago, I met this one girl who, just like me is an immigrant grad student from my home country (South Asia). So we went out a couple of times, had coffee, chatted, then again went for a walk and all. I usually call her over to my place for tea and she doesn't deny (nothing physical has occurred between us so far, I am too conscious about not ruining things for now I guess). We chat frequently on Whtaspp, and use a lot of teary laughter emojis :D. One day she was really upset about something and she cried in my arms, and at that point, I felt that she confides in me. She's not the perfect woman there could be, but given that I have been single for the past couple of years, I think I am developing feelings for her. I have this urge to tell her that I like her but haven't quite been able to do so.

Anddd there's a twist. Enters a guy, another grad student from our home country. This guy, a couple of years older, starts pursuing the girl. New to this part of the world, the girl gets offered a lot of help from this guy...drives her around for groceries and that kind of stuff. The guy took her out for dinner a few days ago. I am pretty sure the guy is pulling all the strings to be around her as much as he can, and from some mutuals, I learned that the guy is dead serious in his pursuit.

As such, what do I do now? Should I tell her that I like her and ask what she thinks about me? Should I wait? I ask because I am not the type of person who usually rushes into things, but the entry of this guy has expedited things for me.

He said that if I was feeling up to it at some point that he’d love to try again and I agreed.

I started talking to a guy from tinder over a month ago. He lives almost three hours away so we haven't met in person yet. The first week or two we had long phone conversations all the time, just laughing and gabbing about our lives. He had made it clear he only talks to people with the goal of a relationship, and that he wasn't into just hooking up. We also both stayed we don't talk to multiple people at the same time.

After those first two weeks he planned to come stay with me for one night and day so we could meet and see how we feel in person. We both agreed he could just sleep in my bed with me but we weren't going to move fast physically, it was more for convenience and cuddles. Last minute he had to cancel bc someone called out of work and he had to cover for them as he was a manager. He apologized a lot and said he would try to come next weekend.

The next weekend rolls around and he has not brought up any scheduling, so I ask him if he is coming. He says he isn't sure bc he doesn't know if that same person is going to call out or not. He doesn't end up coming and we have been talking on the phone a lot less. 

Another few weeks pass and he seems to never have availability or initiate conversations about meeting each other. The phone calls slow down even more. I get fed up a few times and tell him that I don't think he is actually going to make the effort to meet me. We have a conversation about how he feels bad and he is frustrated with how busy his life is rn. I tell him that I am very willing to go drive to him and meet him at his place just to get to see him. 
 
A week ago I told him I had availability this weekend and he said that we would try to work something out. In my head I decide this should be the last week I sit around waiting for him. Turns out, I'm no longer available this weekend as family is coming to visit me. I haven't told him this yet bc he hasn't brought up any scheduling for the weekend. We haven't talked on the phone in a while. To be fair we do have regular texting over snapchat everyday and he texts me goodmorning everyday. 

At this point I'm about ready to cut it off simply bc of the lack of follow through on his end. I should state that he seems great with most other things and I am very attracted and interested in him. I need some perspective on if this is normal ""guy communication"" or simply bc it is early in our talking phase. Or is this simply just not worth it.

27/M - I am a damaged guy. I have been hurt by so many women in my past and when I try to date I get ghosted a lot so it makes having a conversation with new women harder and harder. I feel like there is no more hope for dating after I have been trying for so long. I feel so embarrassed that I cannot talk to family or friends about this and I probably never would. I really don't know what to do so here I am reddit looking for advice.

My girlfriend is moving to a different country(we are both in the US now, same city) because of her visa situation. She is going to be there for a year atleast. We have been in relationship for a year now and we have also spoken about getting married and having life together in the US. For the past few days she has been very busy just packing stuff up and arranging the shipping of her stuff and also taking care of the things. She hasn't asked for my help at all and I have offered it multiple times. She just keeps taking help of her friends and we haven't met in a 3 weeks now. I keep asking her when are we goingto meet and she said she is goingto meet me a day before she leaves. I asked her to stay at my place as she has subleased her place to another person. But she chose to stay at her friends place and not mine. When I asked her why she just said she needs to stay close to her old place to take care of stuff. But I am not that far either. I live 30 mins drive from her place. I got angry about that and told her she doesn't care about my feelings. I am already sad that we are going to be apart from long time. I also keep asking her why doesnt she want to come here and spend a few days with me. I only asked for couple of days, but she didn't even agree for that and doesn't give me a straight answer for that. When I pushed her more, she just said she wants to do stuff in her own way. I am just so sad and feel angry by her behaviour but I don't know what else to do which I haven't asked her. I am so Lost and heart broken at the same time.
