1,s8g12y,1642674655,Trying to get an actual date on the day I want,"This time last year, my now ex hubby of 14 years almost killed me. I managed to leave a few months after (it took a bit of planning to get out safe).

The day is on my mind and I’m trying to reframe it in a positive manner. So I thought I’d celebrate my ‘survival day’.


I’ve been on bumble/tinder and had a couple of dates which always lead to a ‘you’re lovely but...’ message the next day, which is okay, I’m grateful they take the time to message me honestly. I recognise I’m an over-sharer. I have adhd and I do try to keep a lid on it, but on a first date, people ask questions and my mind wants to answer honestly. In detail lmao.

So I’m swiping on these apps and asking if anyone is free on Monday and getting no reply. I’m careful not to say why so it’s not the reason they are running for the hills. Is it because I’m being too direct?

I just really want to spend the evening with a nice bloke who seems interested in me for a few hours to help overwrite the years of being told how unlovable in every way I was.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s8g12y/trying_to_get_an_actual_date_on_the_day_i_want/

I'm not exaggerating, I have gotten zero likes on Hinge since the new year. Bumble tells me I have 50 likes, but I'm not paying to see them, and I don't think they're real - none of my right swipes are a match, and only one in maybe 50 left swipes sends the ""you missed a potential match!"" message. 

I've had several friends tell me my profiles are great, so I don't get it.

3,s8ithv,1642684771,I am too desperate for a family and social support to date,"I have no family.  No parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, cousins, and no kids.  My support network is a highschool friend who lives 2000 miles away.  She told me I could move in with her family which is very tempting but I have a business where I currently live.

I think I am too desperate to be in a relationship.  When I date, I don't tell people about my problems.  But now that I am 40, I am really afraid to spend the rest of my life alone.

I know the common advice is to learn to be happy alone, which I am in therapy for.  But I've never heard that advice come from a lonely person without a family or support network.  It's people who can call their parents and brothers and sisters when they are alone.

I just wish I had something like that, and I know the only path to that is dating, but my desperation to not be lonely is creating sort of a catch 22.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s8ithv/i_am_too_desperate_for_a_family_and_social/

7,s8rk4a,1642708762,Dating single mothers,"This post is not to bash single mothers.  Myself am a single father.  I know the struggle.  With that said, I am
Wondering.  

I have been dating my girlfriend for around 2.5 years.  Both of our kids have had sleep overs.  We have been on day trips as one big family.  We have spend countless hours at the rivers and lakes during the
Summer together.   My daughter and her son play Roblox online and FaceTime almost daily.  We share a Netflix and Amazon Prime account for streaming content.  Hell, I even added her to my Costco account as a family member.  By all accounts, we are one big family.  

I am very open and comfortable with my fatherhood to make time for my girlfriend.  I go out of my way to plan quality time with her on our kid free days/nights.  I am a firm believer in taking the effort to build a solid foundation for which a healthy relationship can be built upon.  I have zero boundaries set in place and am willing to help her at a moments notice in the event of an emergency or home repairs.   

The problem is that she does not reciprocate any of what I just said.  When her kid is home and I am kid free, she refuses to let me spend the night with her nor spend any time with her.  She never sends me good morning texts or good night texts.  I have repeatedly asked her to try and initiate some good morning and good night texts.  She refuses.  I have expressed how important this is to me and she does not care to even bother sending a text.  When she is at work, she tells me that she is busy.  But she chats with other people all day long and randomly sends me recipes in Pinterest.  So I know she can’t be that busy to chat now and then.  When I try and start a conversation, she replies with a single word or the thumbs up emoji.   When I am with her, she rarely ever talked with me while in person.  I could go on, but this post would be miles long.   

I have expressed all my concerns and issues that are important to me many times.  Only to blow up in my face as she gets irritated and hostile towards me just for talking about my important issues.  

I am at the end of my rope and feel as if the relationship is going nowhere.   I feel like more of a random booty call or FWB than a boyfriend.

8,s8rori,1642709099,Is he interested? Not a bloody clue.,"I'm F43, he's M, maybe early 50s at most, not sure. He's a firefighter who also works at my part time job.  First met when I was 16, when me and a friend used to spy on him and his other fireman mates getting changed at the back of our office, a thing I had forgotten until he reminded me recently. I had no idea he was one of those firemen either at the time, I genuinely didn't know we had met before. 

He started working closely with me in September and has been quiet and reserved. By December we started chatting, he showed me his tattoos, we went to the pub with a colleague who had to leave early and chatted all afternoon about how lonely we both were (me being a widow, him being divorced) and how we both use work as a crutch to fend off the loneliness. I said I realised I was an inveterate flirt but would run a mile if anyone took it at face value. Wasn't talking about him though.  That afternoon he was due in work at 5, but waited with me until I got picked up from the pub at 4.45, hugged and kissed me, and ended up being 20 minutes late for work at the fire station,  which I think is a pretty big deal especially as he is the station manager. 

Since then I started dating someone else who is messing me around so the fireman has told me he thinks I should finish with him because I'm unhappier than I was before I met him when I was lonely. He also volunteered to stay late at work to keep me company when I finished later than him. He spent a whole shift trying to repair my broken (but expensive) pen, getting himself and his shirt covered in ink in the process. When I suggested a team night at the pub, he told me which nights he wouldn't be available (on it's own, a reasonable answer to my question!!).

So. Are all these signals that he quite likes me? I am useless at reading men, I was married for 20 years and this is all new to me as an adult (met my husband as a teenager). He was very pleased with the mug I bought him for Christmas (I bought all my colleagues a small gift) and said it would be pride of place in the fire station, and he tells me uses it every day. I just can't tell if he is just being nice, or whether it's worth asking him I'd he fancies going for a date?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s8rori/is_he_interested_not_a_bloody_clue/

*i'm not one to jump in the deep end. I'm an introvert so find it hard to strike up a convo, so over the last couple of weeks, i've had a couple of wines after work and found the courage to message these peeps.*

*They've obviously stalked my profile and found I don't' have many photos. I have a bit of a psycho ex so alot of my socials are locked down tight. They have asked for photos and i've sent them a couple ... now ....... I am not feeling comfortable personally in full body shots , so i've just sent them ""head shots"". ...*

*This has been a no no and i've gotten replies like ""oh what no full body shots?"" or tonight I got ""no leg shots?""*

*After scrolling through my photos, I actually don't' have any .. so I didn't have any to share, which I mentioned to them. I am quite self conscious so I don't like sharing those type of photos.*

*I am of a belief that if there are sparks, its' from you as a person , your personality, not the way you look. I'm happy to chat to someone , I will not hide the way I look forever, but lets chat first and then go from there ... am I wrong in this ?*

*Yes ..... looks sometimes play a part and I get that, but should that be the first impression ?*

After two days of incessant messaging, we exchanged numbers and the great conversations continued. They felt natural and unforced, so naturally I agreed to meet him. 

The day after we exchanged numbers, he text good morning and sometimes followed up with a mid-morning phone call because—he wanted to hear about how my day was going.  He continued texting and calling for the next five days. 

Then….we me met for our date. He greeted me with a kiss, held my hand the entire time. We went back to my place and engaged in some heavy petting, but kept it PG rated. 

He overstayed his welcome a little too much for me. But not so much so that I didn’t want to see him again. However, I did think it odd that he didn’t ask to see me again. I let go of the thought when he text me 30 minutes after our date to say he’d enjoyed himself. 

The next morning….silence. And that’s when I knew I’d been ghosted. 

I’m honestly more disappointed than hurt. Disappointed that I allowed myself to believe only to be duped. 

I know that it only stings because that’s the psychological effect of ghosting. I’m thankful that it was just 1 week, not 1 year. Still, I don’t know how much more of this I can stand. OLD seems more harmful than helpful.

42,sa6a46,1642869384,Gaslighting on OLD?? Should I be worried?,"I need some advice, friends. Yesterday I got pretty creeped out on an OLD app and I’m wondering if I should just delete it. 

I had messaged with a guy for about a day when he asked for my number. I said I have a rule not to give out my number until I’ve met someone in person. He didn’t seem too upset with that, but stopped messaging me for a while. 

A few days later, he starts messaging me again. We text quite a bit, and he seems like a good guy. We’re really hitting it off, and I reveal some personal info (age, kids, occupation, month and day of my birth). 

So he asks for my number again. This time I say I’ll consider, if he’ll agree to some ground rules, including 1) don’t ask for nudes and 2) don’t be creepy and look up my address. This last one was meant partially tongue-in-cheek because obviously I wasn’t actually worried about that if I’m willing to give him my number. 

He immediately gets offended that I would even suggest that. At first I tried to put myself in his shoes and remembered that things don’t come across the same over text as in person, so I tried to explain I was partially joking. But I also added that I’ve literally had that happen to me so it’s not too outrageous. 

At first it just seemed like I hit a nerve and he was overreacting a bit. But then this guy does on a tirade. I don’t really know how to explain it, but it suddenly got very creepy. He starts attacking me personally, calling me crazy, saying I’m lucky enough to have a decent man like him interested and I have the audacity to question him, etc. He also says that he “let it slide” the first time I wouldn’t give him my number, but now I’ve gone too far. 

Alright, so obviously I didn’t give him my number and blocked him immediately. But this was honestly a mentally unstable person. And I don’t say that lightly - he was disturbed. Now I’m really worried that I gave him enough information that he can find me. 

What have I done? Should I be worried? Should I get off this app completely? Suddenly I’m super paranoid…..",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sa6a46/gaslighting_on_old_should_i_be_worried/

51,sajk7g,1642907100,Weirdest Make Out Session Ever,"Please tell me about the weirdest/worst kiss you’ve ever had. I’m not talking about something traumatic, that’s for another thread. I’m talking about the kind of kiss you left wondering, “who taught this person this was enjoyable?” I’ll go first. 

Okay, went on a date with a guy that went amazing up to this point but then the kiss was so weird! Not saying that I kissed everyone everywhere, but I’ve kissed enough people to say this was absolutely the weirdest kiss I’ve ever had. If this was related to some fetish, it would have been important for me to know before it happened so I would have known what was coming and had a chance to say no thank you. 

For starters, he didn’t want me to kiss him back. He wanted me to “go slow” which meant open my mouth and literally suck my lips and teeth. I tried to redirect him to a typical open mouthed kiss and he freaking slapped me and told me to “go slow”. Nothing hard, kind of a light tap, still a freaking slap though! Unacceptable! He wanted me to basically dead fish for his mouth. I think I can skip my next teeth cleaning after this. It was weird. Fetish? Not my cup of tea. 

As he did this he literally smeared my makeup from the top of my face, into my eyes then down my chin. It wasn’t a light caress, oh no. This was an intentional heavy handed push of his hand, fingers in my eyes to the point I had to tell him to get his fingers out of my eye! He had smirked my eyeliner and mascara into my eye (it burned!) and across my cheek. What man in his 40’s would do this? It’s the middle of the day, I’m going to buy groceries after this. Never have I ever experienced this either! Fetish? New one to me. He needed to have communicated with me first he wanted to try and poke my eye out. I’m not into that! Who would be?

What in the heck just happened? Not once in my 40 years on this planet have I experienced this. Up to this point, he had everything going for him. I was interested! But that kiss was just so terrible. Ew! 

I don’t know what just happened but I’m not into it. The green light turned red and walked the heck out. I feel so disrespected. Just ew!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sajk7g/weirdest_make_out_session_ever/

Well, I decide to continue to chat, and, probably foolishly, to meet.  I figured I’d inquire about this mystery 5 year gap.  But… I get there and she is super fit.  Gorgeous.  Could very easily pass for 10 years younger.  And probably the nicest, most warm hearted person I’ve met in a while.  We talked effortlessly and suddenly I didn’t even care about this age thing.  I didn’t bring it up.  We’re going on a second date.

My question is… should I ask about this?  Should I care?  I imagine her answer might be, I don’t have enough in common with older men.  They can’t keep up.  So I do this to meet younger men.  (She’d be right.  When I say she’s fit, I mean, VERY fit.). Still, it’s dishonest.  And nothing else indicates anything of the sort.

56,sapg6h,1642928350,Pets while dating,"I used to be a dog lover but not anymore. Growing up I had dogs that I loved up through my 26th year - fed, played, walked, groomed, slept in the bed with me; all that jazz. Last dog was at 26 &amp; we had to put her down because she was sick 😢 I and my family are very calm people and our dogs/my dogs reflected that they were chill as hell, happy, and sweet. However, in my late 30s I lived with my now ex-fiancé and he had a dog. She sucked. I didn’t blame her. I blamed him. He wanted a dog but not the responsibility of a dog. When we first started dating he lived in an apartment. He never took her walking. She’s a greyhound mix (she needs to run and she is very high strung due to inability to exercise properly) &amp; for bathroom he would let her use it on the balcony and sweep off her feces with the same broom he used to sweep his kitchen, his place smelled like dog urine and poop because she was constantly using it in the apartment because he never took her out, she shed very badly and he never got her groomed or took her to the vet. I found out his family was the same way - the first time I went over their house their entire carpet in each room was shit and urine stained and their dog pooped and peed wherever it wanted and then they would act embarrassed if it did it in front of me. Tuffs of dog hair was in the coffee pot, just gross. I was so mad at him for bringing me. Stupid me continued dating him but I got him to start taking better care of his dog and shamed (yes told them how nasty they were) his parents so badly the next time we visited they ripped up all the carpet and laid hardwood flooring and let their dog out more regularly (or at least when I was there). They also cleaned out the coffee pot. Before we moved in together (new house) I laid down ground rules. The dog was free to roam downstairs (hardwoods) but not upstairs where it was carpeted. She could not get on the new furniture because her atrocious smell (I tried everything but her dog smell was so overwhelming I had to deep clean the walls, floor and cloth furniture 2x a week) and she ripped up his old furniture and he had to start taking better care of her including take her for walks and play with her. There were times he would run out of food for her and would not care to buy her more dog food for 1-2 days!!! I didn’t know this until we moved in together and cursed him out! How would he feel to starve for two days?? When I would attempt to take over her care he’d get mad at me. I  cleaned up behind her and him. We did have a big backyard and I played with her more and when he was away she was sweet and relaxed. But as soon as he came home she went bonkers and would turn on me. Twice she ran away due to his fault (left gate/door open) and he blamed me for it. She bit me twice and he blamed me. He watched his dog attack me, unprovoked, and did absolutely nothing. She could be a moody jerk. Anywho, this completely put me off of ever dating a person with a pet. Am I the only one? I feel so ostracized and hated about my no pets stance. I will legit ask them their pet care habits and get immediate red flags or if I see OLD profiles (when I do get online) where they are kissing their dog in every picture I think well why do you want a partner you have your dog, especially if they put on their “dogs are better than people” or “my dog has to like you”. I know I’m traumatized, she’s the only dog that’s ever bit, lunged at, and tried to attack me. Do I need counseling? I also think in my 40s and as a woman I’m getting less patient with taking care of others - pets and humans.

57,saqyrj,1642934530,Feeling uneasy about my current FWB arrangement,"I (47F) have an FWB, a nice honest guy who outright told me that he is just out of a long-term marriage, and in the future, he would like a family and more kids. (He is a bit younger than me.) In the meantime, he would like to enjoy being single and dating other women but he agrees that we are to be sexually exclusive for now (I guess until he finds somebody else), for STD safety.

While I appreciate his openness, this situation somehow bothers me. I only started dating this year after getting out of my marriage and after all those lockdowns. With my previous FWB, it was assumed we would not date other people while together, even though we did not explicitly talk about it.

I guess it's not jealousy, as we only met a couple of times with the current FWB. It's more like my self-esteem is hurt, I suddenly feel very old (even though I wouldn't want to have more kids even if I were younger). I also feel that I am not good enough, and I hate this indeterminacy as I don't know when he finds somebody better than me, it can be any time, isn't it?

Not sure how people deal with these kinds of feelings and situations? He is a really nice guy, much better than anybody I dated before.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/saqyrj/feeling_uneasy_about_my_current_fwb_arrangement/

67,sb4rs5,1642974227,OLD vent (I know there’s a ton),"Last week I decided to join POF to shake things up (I usually do Bumble, Hinge and Tinder). I’ve had decent success since starting OLD about a year ago, plenty of dates and a few casual relationships. POF has been the worst and I’m about to just delete it, but they do seem to have a lot of people in my area. I’ve been inundated with messages (fine, I get that’s the nature of OLD for women) 99% are from guys I wouldn’t date for whatever reason, but if it’s clear they’ve read my profile and are sincere I do try to reply with a polite reason they’re not a fit. In this past week I’ve had 2 guys try to convince me that I was ridiculous for not wanting to chat with them because they live over an hour away and “true love will know no distance”, countless messages that start with “Hello beautiful, Hello sexy” or some semblance of that - still no clue why a guy would send that as an opener - I’d honestly rather a Hi, Hey or How’s your day going message. I had a guy want to meet up for coffee at Wawa (which is literally a convenience store with no seating) - then continued to text me from multiple numbers. Two guys set days for dates and then bail without a word, both were suggested by them - One was today where he asked if I thought that we could meet up today to get to know each other, I said I think I could just let me know when and where…that was almost 6 hours ago. Many conversations with guys who’s profiles say they’re looking for a relationship when they’re actually looking to hook up (fine but just say that). No clue if guys face the same thing with women on the apps, but it’s extremely frustrating and annoying. We’re all adults let’s just say what we want or at least be close to saying what you want. Don’t say you’re looking for a relationship when you literally just want to hook up, because honestly if you do that you’re a scummy person.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sb4rs5/old_vent_i_know_theres_a_ton/

My take:  if this is a tactic motivated by any of the above, or something else (besides actually being busy, which happens), it doesn’t work on me.  It has the opposite effect!  It telegraphs lack of interest.  There are others responding more quickly, and I’m totally ok with eagerness from others.

He rarely initiates and when he responds, sometimes it’s a sentence or two. He’s fine in-person. He’s never been a massive texter, but it feels less than usual. Not sure if this is normal drop off or something more. I hate coming across as clingy by bringing this up. What would you recommend? Just be quiet and observe or is there a not clingy way to discuss? I miss him and it’s hard to keep the momentum this way. Thanks for your help!!!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sc4few/text_frequency_communication_norms/

95,scif19,1643130232,Can someone help me figure out why people drop out at our age (40+) when things get serious?,"Hello fellow redditors,

So I (42) meet this guy (41) IRL we become close friends with daily contact and he begins lovebombing me full on after about 3 months. I play it down as it makes me feel uneasy. Then he would tone it down and we start getting real close and fond of each other. There is so much love and care and great connection mentally as well. 

Sex is good, we really like each other physically, our habits and rhythms are similar, everyone has space but still share common activities, friends, and we essentially both look for the same thing; to love and to be loved, we want someone to be there, not just fuck buddies or a fling. He involves me in interior design for his new home. I stay at his parents house. I take care of him when sick. He does a lot of lovely things for me as I do for him. We give small gifts all the time. He says no matter what, we are there for each other. Even involves me in his future plans, and suffice to say, I am so sold on this. 

We never went officially labelled as such though, label did not seem to matter. But when I tell him after about 6 months that this is it, I am happy and want to be with him, he starts to pull away ever so slightly. Few weeks of question marks, push-pull games follow, then he says he fell out of love and about a month ago he goes for some random chick because he wants to have family.. (did not work out) 

Obviously, I am, aside from the insane amount of pain over the loss and grief, completely dumbfounded as to why on earth would someone throw away something they apparently wanted and relished in, just as they got it. 

Sadly I cant avoid seeing him so I also witness how little of that beautiful love remained in him. As I was just some furniture in the office. Naturally, I tried to get an answer - in a civilised, patient manner, and got all sorts of bullshit answers that don’t add up. 

I am also hearing similar stories from others. Can someone lighten me up please? Why would people do something like this? Just look around, he heard all these awful stories about dating, too. In a world like this, I’d take care of gems in my life for sure!

TLDR; why do men throw away a companion they claimed they want as soon as she confirms them that she loves them and is interested in staying?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/scif19/can_someone_help_me_figure_out_why_people_drop/

99,sckg8m,1643135504,Struggling Trying to Start a Relationship,"I have been OLD for the last several months after a breakup where I finally felt like I was healed and ready for love. My last relationship was not very intimate and the person kept me at arm's length so I never really felt like I was in a true relationship. We were together for two years, but he never told me he loved me. I have never had a good and healthy union with anyone, but did the work and feel ready for love at 43 yo (f). 

The problem I am running into is that a relationship continues to evade me. I get a lot of likes on Hinge - hundreds since I joined. I match with people but the conversations seem to go nowhere. When they actually do take off, we meet for a date and I've hit it off with about 3 people so far but they never go further than just a date. I do feel I am above average looking (I don't mean this to sound egoistic), have a good job, am really funny, kind, and I am very cautious about overwhelming people - meaning, I'm not clingy or a big over the top texter. I have a ton of friends and I'm in great shape. I know I am now OLD in my 40's vs when I was in my 30s so my pool is different, but I can't help the creeping feeling I get that there is something unappealing about me. Or disappointing? I am sure this is a common post, but how do you contend with this? I am trying to be optimistic, but I feel hopeless....goodness, even...defective. Any advice besides 'you gotta love yourself first!' because I do, I just don't know why nobody else seems to lol.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sckg8m/struggling_trying_to_start_a_relationship/
