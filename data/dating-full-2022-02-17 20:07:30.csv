So i went and booked it all, and for a month or so we were excited by our plans &amp; talked about what we were going to do.

Until a week before the date, she unfortunately broke her ankle which put our plans in jeopardy but she was determined to keep the plans, even after I offered to reschedule until few days before, she messaged saying she might just be coming for a night for evenutally her to drop out completely, but she offered to reschedule for couple weeks time if her ankle was better.

So i went ahead with the weekend and met some friends instead, then ended up bumping into her friends &amp; they’d said that she’d said she likes someone but, couldn’t say who.. however they thought it was me &amp; i should go for it as I’m a “good looking lad”. 

I was still in contact with the girl, as she was asking how the weekend was, if I’d gotten home ok etc &amp; for on the monday for us to wish each other happy valentines. Our messages energy seemed pretty good with response times typically being half hour at the most, to suddenly not hear from her for about 5 hours &amp; the response’s energy was off, without any emojis as it was unlike her. 

&amp; that’s the last time i heard from her until she posted on her snap that she was going to Newcastle (2 days after when we were meant to be meeting), and so i responded by have fun babe &amp; she said thank you im not doing anything in newcastle babe cos of my ankle haha (think thats her saying she wasnt there to have sex). Then she was posting stories in a restaurant with drinks &amp; food with this guy and, my friend saw on her snap map of her in a hotel.

I really need help but I can't find much so I am hoping the people of reddit see this!! 

Hello! I hope I'm posting this in the right area, my best friend and I are both seniors in Highschool. Out of all the friends I've ever had, she's always been my number one person in my life. But that was always as a best friend, we've never seen each other as anything more (At least, I assumed she didn't) her and I have lots in common too! Martial Artists, fitness enthusiasts, anime lovers, ya know all the fun stuff.

I promised I'd never fall in love with her and I don't want to sound like the dumb teen tossing around the word ""love"" all willy nilly but honestly this is the first time I've ever experienced this emotion (I've never actually had a girlfriend before, don't laugh at me lol) but I'm confident in saying that I am.

Now here is the problem, there are a few. My best friend is Catholic, she grew up in a strict Catholic family where she has lived all her life following her rules and her culture. During the time I wasn't confident about my feelings for her, I helped her make the decision of dating this other catholic white guy she kinda had feelings for. I wanted her to be happy but it didn't take me long to realize I was jealous seeing her be with another guy. Everybody and I mean, everybody I knew or knew her and I's friendship said we'd make such a cute couple but I brushed it off.

Now I'm starting to see it but my inexperience with love and dating makes me think I'll never be good enough or like her boyfriend. My other major problem and this is a huge one.... She is Catholic. NOTHING WRONG WITH HER RELIGION she just believes she needs to be with Catholic-only people. I'm not Catholic, I am Taoist. I have a sort of omni religious belief where I acknowledge the existence of the God's in all the other religions, I just have my own personal God's I choose to worship.

So basically I sometimes lose confidence in my ability to be as good of a boyfriend as the one I helped her get now, but I still believe in myself! She believes she has to be with other Catholics, but I want her to believe that love can overpower that! And also she said she's into white guys, I'm Asian and Native American (my pfp is me) so idk if I basically have no shot or I can do something and maybe be with my best friend the way I believe we are meant to be.

We have plenty in common and she seems to like who I am. Conversations would always flow and we had a few 4-5 hour video chats. I wanted to take her out on a date weeks ago, but I ended up having plans with friends, then proceeded to get covid and was out of commission for 2 weeks. So when I was feeling healthy again, I asked her if she'd be interested in meeting up. She said yes. So I started planning out a date. She told me she was unsure of what day works for her because she normally meets up with one of her girlfriends once a week. I noticed that whenever I brought it up in text she would start to pull away. I asked if everything was okay, and she mentioned that she's going through a tough time mentally (in-between jobs and her ADHD is causing her frustration and grief). She told me she didn't want to seem rude, be vague, or seem like she was ignoring what I'm saying, and that she was struggling. I told her we can talk about it if she wanted. I didn't over-pursue and suggested we have another video chat and we can plan things then. She agreed.

About 3 hours into the video chat (which was great and filled with awesome conversation as usual), I brought up how we should plan this date. I could instantly tell that she felt uncomfortable when I brought it up. So I asked her if this is even something she wants to do. I told her that she can just say no and that she doesn't have to let me down gently. She said that she wants to go out with me, but she's not in a good place mentally for it. I told her that we'll go at her pace and she can bring it up when she's ready. We talked for another hour or so before ending the chat.

The next morning I thanked her for the chat as we usually do. She didn't respond and I haven't heard from her in 3 days. Not gonna lie, I'm feeling pretty down about this. The old me would've kept messaging asking her if she's okay, but the now experienced me knows that that won't solve anything and likely pushes her away further. The only option I feel I have is to completely pull back too and wait for her to reach back out.

However, she is a shitty texter most of the time and not the one who is active but it doesn't matter. Time passes so fast, our college has shitty stuff called data match and I guess she participates in these days. She posts yesterday in her secret private Instagram account that ""I have a date today and it went well."" Honestly, I felt so upset when I saw this. I know this is my bad because I always have no courage to do many things and maybe I am not excellent enough to be liked. It's been a few months I guess she feels I like her, but I never speak it out even though my friends encourage me to do so. Although I feel sad, I wanna tell her my romantic feeling of her and end up this thing. I don't think I have a chance anymore so I just text her today to see if she is willing to see me this weekend and take the small gifts that I bought when I was traveling a month ago.

I (M19) was never in a relationship and the reason for it might be that I am usually less social.

I'm french, lives in france and wants to live there in the future. The thing is I'm aware there are big negative stigmas around black women. Physically I know that I don't fit the negative stigmas : I'm thin, I wear feminine yet cute/laid back clothes, I don't wear wigs/weaves, no dramatic makeup. I'm educated, I don't come from the hood, childfree in my 20s, I have a good vocabulary, I'm polite, I behave well in public. But I want to seriously get settled down this year. I aspire to meet a good person, who has a good job, wants to commit/get married. 

But I'm really careful bc men generally don't take black women seriously, a lot want to have a try with them (that's why I refuse to have sex before be officially in a relationship in the future, like almost 2 months after the beginning), some can view them as a fetish, some see them below all the other races of women in my country (white, asians arabs/north african). The most fantasized women are the arabs (most searched in porn web sites in my country, men use the term b\*urettes) and east asian women. Men have no problem marry east asian and arabs women. I want to get married, I refuse to become a baby mamma, I don't want to be a strong independent black woman or that kind of B.S. 

Since I want to exhude feminine energy and don't want to fit with any horrible/disgusting colonial/slavery stereotype that french people would have (sl\*tty, desperate for s\*x or whatever), I prefer to be seen as prude, a virgin mary instead of an easy girl. Because a blonde blue eyed girl in my country can brag to sleep 100 men, did sextapes or whatever, she'd have no problem marrying after hit the 30 mark. I'd do the same, I'd die alone for sure.

So I met this guy we’ve dated for like a month and a half. We were texting each other he was so nice and good to me, he took me to places to go for walks together so that we could actually get to know each other. He took me out for food too he paid for the first and I paid for the second because I don’t believe that a man should have to pay all of the time either. Then one evening he asked if I wanted to come over and chill in his, he said that nothing has to happen or anything like that which I respected about him so much. He lives with his parents so obviously I asked him and he said it’s absolutely fine that they won’t mind. I got there and I was chatting to his mom for a while she was so sweet and so nice. She went to bed and we started watching a film and then decided to watch the rest in his room we both cuddled and it was so nice, I told him that I didn’t want anything to happen tonight and he absolutely respected that. But then things did start to get a little bit heated and bare in mind I was on my period too and I told him that too. But then he asked me did I want to give him a blowjob and I declined politely. Then the next morning he was completely off with me would barely talk to me and I just had such a weird vibe from him. I went home after and I didn’t hear from him in two days and all of a sudden he sends me a message saying ‘hi I don’t think we should see each other anymore. I wish you the best and I hope you find what you’re looking for’ I was in complete shock and I still am, it’s upsetting because I honestly thought something was going to come out of it. I asked him did I do something wrong and he said no but yet he didn’t give me a proper reason to why he wanted to end it so suddenly, does anyone have any idea why he could’ve done this?

So I showed her some trailers and she stated it again that “I don’t like old movies and these ones look like they have bad graphics too”

I have tons of friends, a few great ones and a stable job that I started as soon as leaving HS in a great field of work, rising quickly through the ranks(recently promoted to a mid-level position), also doing my university stuff in the same field, also seperate additional qualification courses/certificates. I like to think that Im the type of person that is really goal-orientated and pragmatic. Also I was incredibly pessimistic about love, I had had sexual experiences, but I cant say I felt anything about the girl I did it with, I thought people said they loved each other out of convenience or something along those lines. I have never ever had a relationship.

Almost 2 years ago I met aboslutely beautiful girl in a store, I was infatuated with her instantly, she had her mask on and her work uniform, but when she smiled at me while we were talking the way her eyes ""smiled"" and the edges wrinkled was cute af. We bantered a bit I asked her insta, sent her a follow request and then nothing(she didnt reply to the request) for about 6 months. I was a bit down and couldnt stop thinking about her. Then one day before bed I see whe accepted my follow request and followed me back... I look through her profile and see that she has had a relationship for quite a long time, the next morning her bf stories/pics were gone. I replied to a few stories, we started chatting and really hit it off. I really liked this person both physically and spiritually, she was funny, got my sense of humor, ACTUALLY ASKED ME QUESTIONS AND SOMETIMES EVEN WROTE FIRST...

We went on a date that went really well, even though I was out drinking the previous night cuz I was celebrating a personal career achievement. She told me at the start of the date she'd have to go in like 2 hours to turn in uni papers... we stayed for 7h. We had banter, connected on personal matters and she really made me open up about stuff, which up to that point was impossible for me. She even initiated next date plans... She had previously told me that she would be going back to her homr town for a couple of weeks after the semester to see her folks and when I asked her about her town on the date she told me about a certain product her town is famous for producing, I said I should maybe come and try it, and she was all aboard for me to visit her while she was home. Now here is something Im really bad at... showing affection on both a physical and mental level. I gave her a semi -awkward hug when we seperated and that was that. We kept chatting. I felt absolutely great, I had this newfound energy and even things I despised doing before, seemed like no big deal. Next week I had my bday, gathered friends and went to celebrate it. 

HERE COMES THE FUCKUP. I got pretty drunk, which isnt that bad for me, I just maybe lose my filter that filters out the stupid things I think of saying and after chatting on IG a bit with her during the night, when my friends went to sleep I couldnt sleep and so we just chatted. She told me about a new jacket she bought and how she was gonna spoil herself a bit. And so my monkey brain thought it was a good idea to tease her about being spoiled. I thought it was funny...

A few weeks pass and our date got postponed and I may have had a few more club nights. Our chats at this point become rarer and rarer, I assume its cuz sge is busy spending time with her family and friends. After one of those club nights I remember messaging her and trying to mend the damage I may have done with my stupid-ass typing, well it actually got worse... I remember trying to call her cutie, even though I knew she didnt like that, and after she said so, I kept doimg it cuz Im a dumb dumb and thought it was funny after 16 hours of partying. 

She blocks me after a few days, I thought it might have been because I may have made a bad impression for the reason that I had had 3 months of straight partying every weekend, and had 3 long vacations, which were again full of partying. At the same time she blocked me, some other horrible shit happened in my life.

I was absolutely heartbroken, depressed, I hated myself, I couldnt make myself do anything productive and just sulked. This went on for 2 months, after which she surprisingly added me back, messaged me, setup a date for a few days later, until again she went back to her hometown and stopped replying to my msgs, or would short reply after 10 hours. I asked her if we're still up for the date, she postponed it by a few days due to work. After that I had pretty much given up and straight up asked her if she had any interest in me. She said that she had, but I acted like a real asshole through the summer and offended her. I at that point had no idea that the things I said were offensive, but more on the failed joke side. I explained that I mustve been joking, she said I didnt make that impression and said I was a very smart, ambitious and focused guy, but that she was mad at me.

I then proceede to give her with a few compliments too and tell her the thing I wrote on here about how I was infatuated with her on first sight, and how even though she wore a mask, when she smiled the way her eyes wrinkled absolutely melted my heart. I said I was ready to do anything to make things work out.

She then said she'll be honest with me and that she has feelings for someone else... I was devasted.

I wished her well, she did too... We still follow each other but apart from that we obly have exchanged a few msgs since then (2 months ago).

I still cant get over her... I know its stupid. It never was serious, but this is the only person that has made me open up in this way for the past 21 years. I had never felt like that before and I wish I could go back to before meeting her when my mental state was stable. I now cant sleep, feel super demotivated and lack satisfaction in anything. Even finishing my semester and getting a certificated and promotion at the same time didnt lift my mood at all... Not a day passes without me thinking about her.

I (29F) was talking to this guy (30M), lets name him ""Dan"", in November from a motorcycle community in a larger city, South of my smaller city. At the time I was in a bad state of mind and burned out from work. He offered to come up to visit me twice but I had told him I wasn't wanting to date at the moment, which was true. Too much was on my mind. Well, about two weeks later, an acquaintance/client of mine introduced me to her guy friend. He lived in my small city, which is very hard to date locals who actually live here because there's hardly any young professionals. We hit it off and dated briefly for 2 months. Things did not work out, he decided to breakup end of January. I moved on because I knew I deserved more than what he gave because the short relationship felt one sided and he wasn't very attentive to me.

Beginning of February I was down in the big city where Dan was at a motorcycle event with my friends because it was a community event. We finally got to meet in person, and we were chatting throughout the afternoon. I got good vibes from him and that evening he asked if he could take me out to dinner the next time I was in the city. We had planned to have a dinner at the end of February when I was in the big city, but instead the other week he drove about more than halfway to a city in-between for our first date, dinner and a movie. Dan was a gentleman. He got the door for me, got my chair for me at dinner (who even does that anymore, like awww so sweet), held my hand during the movie. Which was not only cute, but physical touch is my main love language. Our second date was on Valentines Day, he drove 5 hour roundtrip on his motorcycle in cold weather just to spend 2 hours at dinner with me, and arrived with red rose in a mini vase and gummy bears. He isn't a big on texting long messages, but will message me throughout the day, says good morning sunshine and goodnight sweet dreams almost every night. He hasn't been creepy or pressuring in any way, he has complimented me and been sweet. He also wears hearing aids because he only has 40% of his hearing so does some lip reading, so it's nice he is actually focusing on me talking when we are together. Well, our third date will be tomorrow (fourth time seeing each other). We plan to go bowling and maybe something else after. He will be staying the night at my apartment, cause that's a lot of riding for him. He e said he can sleep on the couch. We have only kissed a bit, we haven't made out yet, so I'm not ready to have sex with him yet. (I still do plan to go down to his city the following weekend at the end of the month to see friends, and see him too.)

Soooo, the issue lies with my fears and anxieties as I have had such bad dating experience with awful guy after awful guy who has been distrusting and lied to me/lead me on with false intentions/used me for sex. I feel like my dating life has been extremely tainted by so many guys being terrible with their false intentions that it's caused me social anxiety in dating. It's really hard for me to trust. I have been too trust in the past that now I have anxiety about trust. Heavily linked to my ex who shattered my heart last year... I'm so scared of being hurt and lied to again. Because no one has really proven to be, and I've dated a lot. I do want to enjoy the moment with Dan and be happy in his presence, so far he has shown me he is a good guy. I'm not sure when would be appropriate to ask what he is exactly looking for/where this is headed? The last thing I want to do is come off clingy. I want it to flow naturally, but I've been in the position in the past of assuming things were exclusive wit someone when they weren't. I'm also slightly nervous as well having him stay at my apartment, being alone that I don't want to jump into having sex yet. I also get in my head that how do I know who else he is talking to or dating. I'm not seeing or talking to anyone else because I told myself after the recent breakup of the short relationship in January I wouldn't date for awhile...but then we finally got to meet and I liked him more than I thought.

We are exclusive. I've tried to be interested in kink but he seems to be comparing me to past partners and has decided that I just am not the ""type"" for it, and that he doesn't need it in our relationship.

Back to the event. His reasoning:

1. He used to do it all the time before meeting me
2. It's nothing to do with sex (just likes the music/vibes). 
3. Wants time to himself to ""selfish and not worry about anyone else"" (we don't live together nor do we do everything together; we have separate interests/friends) 

Oh and also I don't have the right clothes for it anyway, apparently.

I (26F) have been talking to this guy(28M) for about a month now. Never met him, it's been phone calls, facetimes and constant messaging through out the days.

Not like a love you bye or something like that it was a full on and clear as day... I love you. 

He's full of compliments and seems really great in so many ways. I asked him about it and asked if he knew it slipped out or if it was just a reflex cus he'd been talking to his mum or something but he said he knew he said it and he meant it.

To start, I’m (20 f) not a touchy person at all. Not even with my own family. The last person I allowed myself to be touchy with was the first person I didn’t mind. Their touch was everything to me. But that’s long gone now because he ghosted me. And it’s been five months. 
And I’m by myself again.
But today I was working in a tight space with my attractive friend and coworker (23M) and I had slipped on something and he gently placed his hand on my lower back to steady me. I was hyper ware of every single second of this interaction. I could feel the warmth of his hand through my sweater and though it wasn’t anything sexual at all I found myself wishing that the moment wouldn’t end. It was so comforting and I swear I could feel my body automatically lean into it. But the moment went as soon as it came and he sheepishly apologized but I thanked him for watching out for me. But I felt a rush of heat to my cheeks and I ignored it. But the scene played in my head over and over. Still feeling the ghost of where his hand was. Oh yeah did I mention that he’s married? 
I don’t like him like that by any means, but it really stuck out to me the way that I was longing for touch.
I think I’ve convinced myself that I don’t need it and that I don’t liked it, to protect myself. Especially since last time I was so nonchalant about it I ended up very hurt.
And also my best friend from work also attractive (24M) came back from being sick with COVID for two weeks. And when I saw him I had to contain every fiber of my being not to jump up and hug the life out of him. But I realized that our friendship was never like that and I would probably make him uncomfortable. I just wanted to so bad!
I hadn’t realized how lonely I’ve felt. How much I miss hugging just because and holding hands because they are there and you want to treasure every second. I miss kisses on the cheek to show appreciation and a hand caressing my arm during a movie. I miss leaning into his hand whenever he’d fix my hair and unabashedly stare into his eyes for minutes at a time and discover that he has the lightest hint of gold in his cold eyes. 
I miss it so much and I’m crying as I write this because I am not the type to pretend to care or feel comfortable with someone I barely know to just go on random dates and get my fix.

I always felt like he wasn’t into me because he was into the girls around me. I saw the way he behaved towards them and it wasn’t the same for me. He seemed uncomfortable when I insinuated we were going on a “date” once, and he says we should hang out and even  tells me that he enjoys hanging out with me, but I feel like it comes down to me to make the plans. So, I take these all as signs that I’m just a friend he enjoys talking to. I usually just *know* when a guy likes me.

Him and I get along very well—we have a lot of playful banter, we talk for hours and I feel like maybe we do have some chemistry? Though he seems to be naturally flirty, I have noticed it’s not as extreme with certain other female friends, but I chalk it up to it just being our dynamic.
 
One recent day we were going to part ways for the day, but we ended up talking for about an hour until our convo got cut short due to commitments, so he asked to continue the conversation later that night on call. I agreed and we spent another few hours continuing the conversation and then getting to know each other. I think we only got off call because it was getting too late.
That call involved a lot of conversation about our personal lives—mostly about love and relationships. It got deep and we got flustered over certain topics, especially topics that implied some kind of romantic/sexual compatibility between us. I definitely felt sexual tension there, and my assumption was that he was flustered because he felt it too. (And mind you, I’ve had these kinds of conversations with other male friends and we haven’t been flustered over it like this.) Related to this topic, I told him some things about myself that surprised him, and he explained that it just wasn’t the impression he initially got from me. Other comments we made that night also had romantic insinuations and almost felt like a set up for something, but I was too scared to flirt along with them. I tried to ask questions to gauge whether he knew how I felt and whether I should confess. He said he’s pretty attuned to how people feel about him but never said anything about me. Seeing each other the following days makes me feel like I’m just a friend out of convenience again because of the way he seemed a little more distant when we were with others, though he does seem to still enjoy talking a lot when we’re alone, so I might be over-analyzing.
 
I ended up telling my friends about this whole situation and how I still feel like things are inconsistent but that it’s clear he doesn’t like me romantically. Most of them said I can’t know for sure until I know. Then they said that maybe IM the inconsistent one and he’s trying to figure out whether he likes me—I just haven’t given him a clear indication that I’m attracted to him. One of their points was the fact that he was surprised by my answer to that one topic that got us flustered. Another thing I forgot to mention was that he told me something he does to attract girls’ attention, and the following day I’m pretty sure he did it while we hung out, but it seemed like he did it to amuse me at that moment so I just laughed. In hindsight I remembered what he said the night before and now it’s got me questioning if it was really just for humour. Sometimes he still seems to get uncomfortable (though it seems kind of jokingly) when I do something for fun like calling him some silly pet name, but I interpret it as, “He’s uncomfortable by this because we’re just friends.” Again, maybe I’m reading it wrong here too.
Another time my friend and I visited him at work and we had our usual, playful banter (which my friend said looked like flirting), but the thing is, I kind of did it to his coworkers too. So I’m starting to think they’re right about me being inconsistent with him. (Also, when we called he also mentioned that he’s stopped talking to girls, and that a relationship isn’t something he’s actively seeking anymore but he’s open to it if it comes, so some people took this as a sign he might even be making himself more available to me. Plus, why would he want to continue talking to me for hours at night even while we were struggling to find more questions to answer if he didn’t at least like me? Unless he was just bored, but then wouldn’t he have just found something else to do instead?)
To be honest, I think I am really bad at flirting. I don’t touch him, I don’t give enough flirty compliments, and it’s because I don’t really have dating experience. My friends have also said it sounds like I’m the one who’s bad at gauging how he feels because of this.
 
I guess my question is, is it more likely that I’m wrong about his inconsistency, and it’s actually just ME being an idiot and giving HIM mixed signals and he might be trying to figure out his feelings for me now? Or does his previous behaviour hold up and I’m reading too much into a close friendship and he’s actually not really romantically interested? How the heck do I get out of my shell and start flirting better without misreading how he feels?
 
TL;DR: became friends with a guy I like, always thought he wasn’t into me because he was inconsistent with me in the past even though we seem to have chemistry. Recently had suggestive convos with him and noticed little things from him but don’t want to over analyze, but I might be overlooking some real signs as a result. Friends brought it to my attention that maybe he’s trying to figure out if he’s into me but *I’M* the inconsistent one.

This word invokes several forms of thought depending on the time, culture, society, in which you were raised. In some cultures, sex is taboo, or it must be done under certain conditions as in marriage, it is unclear, it is a sin, etc., in some others it is a tool of manipulation, torture, humiliation and control. On the other hand, for others it is the sharing of pleasure, love, well-being, joy, happiness.  
  
We could give several definitions of sexuality, for us, the definition could be: a physical and emotional connection between two beings.  
  
Different sexual intercourse  
  
Based on this definition, we can distinguish various sexual activity.  
  
Heterosexuality: Sexual desire for individuals of the opposite sex  
  
Homosexuality: Sexual attraction for people of same sex  
  
Incest: Sexual relations between a man and a woman bound by a degree of kinship resulting in the prohibition of marriage; sexual relations between very close relatives.  
  
Pedophilia: Adult sexual attraction to children, girls or boys; physical relationship with a minor.  
  
Zoophilia: A person's sexual relationship with an animal.  
  
There are also other forms of sexual intercourse that we find inappropriate to the definition adopted that we do not mention here.  
  
Given the title of our subject, we will dwell on homosexuality to evoke pleasure in good anal sex practice.  
  
MENTAL PREPARATION  
All good things in life begin with mental preparation, we mean mental preparation, total acceptance of oneself, of being that we are, we mean by that; love, appreciated, cherish all that is in you.  
  
The world in which we live always tends to judge others, they judge you not the way you should be, but the way ""they"" want you to be. Whatever you do, are, the way you behave, even if you make all your efforts, use the best of yourself, you will never be perfect in their eyes, they will still find things to fault over and over again, be yourself with all your qualities they like or don't like because you have no flaws. The qualities they consider to be lacking are qualities that do not meet their criteria or their conditioned mentality.  
  
PHYSICAL PREPARATION  
Is your body ready for anal sex? we do not want to talk about the sexual stereotype that is that or that physical is more appropriate or not for anal sex. But good physical health is even better. It is revealed that a body that practices sports activities with a balanced diet is better for the sexual act, but all this is self-evident.  
  
For exercises, we can recommend jogging especially in the morning, registering at a gym and doing regular exercises. There are gymnasiums that offer free coaching sessions for beginners.  
  
As far as food is concerned, stay away from fast food. You already know what we are talking about because you have at least 2 not too far from home. We suggest you eat lots of vegetables, salads and fresh fruit, drink plenty of water. If you want, you can take energy-drink made from natural ingredients or vitamin pills always made from natural plants. Do not consume big food after 9:00 pm because at nighttime the body makes more time for metabolism.  
  
HYGIENE  
We are talking here about physical hygiene, yes clean is the most important. It is recommended to shower well before a sexual act, to shave the pubic hair (only in case you and your partner like it as well). Before a sexual act it is not recommended to perfume yourself or embalm with deodorant and other products because the natural body smell makes the sexual act more attractive,  
To talk about anal hygiene, not only do you have to shave the hairs around, but you also have to use a colon washing machine or you can use colon washing pills.  
  
THE ANAL ACT  
  
With all these preparations, now you are ready to move on to the anal act.  
  
In order to fully enjoy the act, it should be carried out with mutual consent. The sexual act is not only in penetration, if you hurry to direct yourself directly into the area, you will lose most of the fun.  


PRELIMINARIES  
  
All good sexual act begins with a sexy look, a false shyness, a capricious look, the message of these gestures says to the partners ""there is a flame of fiery fire that burns inside me a flame that waits only for your garden hose to extinguish it"" there the approaches of melee are made, the touching begins slowly, sensually. We look each other in the eye, we begin to kiss again and again as deep as we can. Begins to undress clothes after clothes while kissing, we wrap ourselves against each other, we caress, lick various parts of the body we move on to genital.  
  
Getting to this point of the act, now your whole body says it's ready for penetration.  
  
ACTION  
For the penetration, you need a special lubricant gel for this, as you are already at the high sensation level, there is not going to be too much pain, but some suggest stimulants like poppers to help them.  
  
It should be noted that it is not the size of the penis that tells although some requires a significant size, the Technic is to know how anus works.  
  
The anus is a contractile but elastic membrane, it functions in automatic mode. What does that mean? it means that it opens and closes on its own. During penetration, you must be patient. Put some lubricant gel in the orifice of the anus and on the penis gland, you don't need to put in all the body. Make sure the head of the penis is in the door of the anus. Do not push to try to put it in, do small pushes from time to time while caressing and kissing the partner. The anus that is an elastic membrane will open by itself and you will feel the penetration that is done alone without much effort.  
  
But some people can use sex toys if they want.  
  
CONCLUSION  
way to have sex is not universal, everybody has his how preference, way to make it. You can use the above derived methods to enjoy anal penetration, but also you can use your own.

So I’ve been talking/dating this girl for 3-4 months she got out of a bad relationship a bit ago, but anyways we have gone on a few dates and shared some pictures etc.. ans out of no-where she starts the distancing, less messages and sometimes nothing at all, so, I asked about it and she said she’s just been busy and I get it she is a single mom after all. Since then she asked me to help get her resume updated, help job hunt for her, etc.. well a week before Valentine’s Day she had a blow out about something and took it way out of context and apologized she said she had a very bad day etc.. 

So, I scheduled a Valentine’s Day spa treatment on the for Friday cause she seemed stressed and well… then on Valentine’s Day  I asked her tk sooner and nothing.. later she posted on FB that she went to the beach and I saw a different ex with her and I told her that’s messed up and now she blames me for being upset and called me unstable…??

Am I wrong to be upset? I really freaking liked her.. Oh and she said he’s just a friend 🙄

He is constantly giving my reasons to leave, not trust him, be upset, and hurts me. It’s so hard for us to have 1 single day without fighting or arguing. He always (at least i thought) tried to get back with me once I leave him but just the other week he told me he doesn’t try getting back with me, all he does is simply just message me. Yet he messages me sweet things like “goodmorning beautiful i hope you have a wonderful day,” reasons why he misses me, guilt tripping me that i told him we will be “forever and always,” and leaving me cute voicemails.

 He used to get high all day the first few months together while he was working until he did a major hypocritical thing that he told me he doesn’t want me doing just a few weeks prior, resulting in me trying to leave him and him promising he won’t get high around females or while working. I took him back and when he wants to get high while going out or being around other females, I remind him of the promise he made resulting in him always saying “no it was about me not getting high during work” and I keep reminding him what occurred that made him make that promise and he shrugs then moves on. Now, he wants to go out and get high with one of his guy friends that he hasn’t seen in years, who for some reason he refers to him as a “brother” but his own actual blood brother didn’t even know this kid existed while his actual blood brother knows all his friends that he calls a “brother.”  I told him about his promise he made and he said “i’m tired of you controlling my every little movement, i’m going to get high with him while we’re out and nothing you can say or do is going to change my mind.” I mean, i understand where he’s coming from but he hasn’t made that much of an improvement since the incident occurred so i simply told him if that’s what he wants to do, i’m leaving him. He didn’t care, told me he is going to do it, and he let me go. 

I still have his location on both of his phones, he has two because he uses one for work, he has my location as well. Today i noticed he arrived (11:49am) at work 20 minutes after the other phone (11:29am) did. I thought maybe his phone was glitching and wanted to see where it said he was during that time but it only showed he was driving from 11:20am to 11:29am and then says he’s at work at 11:49am. There’s a 20 minute gap. He has a probation officer who calls and checks on him on his personal phone so he wouldn’t dare to leave it behind and miss a call, his personal phone is also the one who arrived 20 minutes later than his work phone. I gave him benefit of the doubt and told him if he wants to prove he wasn’t doing anything wrong to show me his significant locations on his personal phone, lo and behold, he has no significant locations for todays date. 

My profile is filled with issues/arguments I had with my boyfriend and for the most part everyone is always telling me to leave him, including my own family and friends in person!

I spend majority of my days crying because of him and this relationship, I lack sleep, I lack friends, I lack personal time, I lack so much but I always go back to him. How can I stop? How can I finally break free? Ive tried blocking him, ignoring his calls, not replying, but he always says or does something that causes me to talk back or message him resulting in us getting back together.

It seem like so many men I've known over the years was able to talk there way with women.  Reason for the jealousy I don't have that skill.  And in fact I'm very much the opposite of men who just seem to be able to work a room of people.  I'm not sure what my strengths are either in terms of flirting as most my life I've been a wallflower  like I'm not big into teasing sexually and joking (at least not with some decent time spent with said person) all I know how to do is be nice...kinda.  i say kinda as I'm on the autism spectrum and most women I've met or deal with semi regularly  always say I'm too serious or I'm an asshole as I tend to just say it how it it without sugarcoating things..I'm just really direct with how I talk. Idk I don't really know how to date for fun. I guess.  I've always had this issue and it's one of the few comments that always comes up like ""X you are to serious you need to live a little. Girls don't like serious guys""     I'm just flat out at a lost on what my strengths are  and how I can actually  find or let alone realize which women in this world are interested in me.  Always feeling overshadowed by the abilities of men who can talk the talk and walk the walk better than myself.  I mean I've been single with zero action for a little over 3 years now and  I just can't seem to  talk to a woman.  I just can't seem to spark that sexual interest  that make a person be interested beyond small talk.  Also I suck at small talk... scratch  that I suck at socializing with men and women.  It just hurts more since not getting anywhere with women feels more like a failure in basic human life.

So, I frequent a wine bar often and know all the bartenders, alone, because I have no friends and am trying to meet someone (a woman) because well... I'd like to get married someday and it isn't happening with OLD or sitting at home. I think I'm a reasonably attractive man and am not the weird guy who sits in the corner, drinking and getting hammered while eye humping everyone lol. I make an effort to talk to everyone and be as friendly as possible. 

Anyways, when I go I always try to sit somewhere that is kind of central to the bar seating and have at least an open chair or two on either side of me, which sometimes is impossible. Which is where this comes into play. 

I am a super approachable kind of person and don't give off a ""leave me tf alone"" sort of vibe but, as an example here... The other night I was at said wine bar and it was packed. Sat down, and of course 2 minutes later this really pretty woman walks in who was alone. She sat across the bar in the only available seat which was between some obnoxious drunk dudes and a couple. The TV is in the corner and in her direction so I was half watching that but also glancing at her and noticed she was giving me some solid eye contact, multiple times. I really wanted to go talk to her but given there was no opening near her, I couldn't, so I didn't. At one point, she went to the bathroom and her wine was just about gone and I thought about telling the bartender to put her next glass on me... a seat did open up next to her and I thought about moving but, idk... does that just seem weird or creepy? She was very clearly not meeting anyone and was seemingly friendly with the couple next to her. How does one go about talking to someone at a bar you want to talk to who you aren't sitting close enough, to do so?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159598,public,self,Switching seats at a bar to sit next to a woman?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sv7gub/switching_seats_at_a_bar_to_sit_next_to_a_woman/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,
