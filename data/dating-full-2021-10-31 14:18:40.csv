Hey guys, last week I was competing at a swim meet and a girl I like, lets call her Mary, sits near me on the bleachers. We go to the same high school and exchange greetings in the hallways. We talk a bit and at some point she looks at me in the eye for like 3 seconds, sticks her tongue out, and looks away. I felt like I was acting creepy cuz i was looking at her in the first place. I compete in a race and come back to her sitting next to where i sit. A dude on the team sat in her seat so she moved, but right next to me? Or am I just being weird. We talk more and look at each other in the eyes again. One time when we talked she touched my arm. The next day she sat next to me again and our legs ended up touching each other because of the crowded space. I didn't realize until a few minutes. As we were bunched up together she leaned on me and said how we were cramped like peas in a pod. I chuckled.

And yes I'm providing lots of details because i never pick up on any signs. She is the type of girl to talk to a lot of guys, which is why im skeptical on whether or not she is normally like this or is actually flirting.

I have posted previously, but I really just want an opinion on a rather specific behaviour. I have quite an obvious and severe hand tremor. It's called essential tremor. I went on two dates with a guy, and he explained after the date that he was very uncomfortable. I explained what they were, and that they weren't degenerative, but this didn't change anything for him. I function independently and live alone.

The guy I went on dates with did not make eye contact during the dates. After our second date, I asked why, and he said it was because of my tremor. He didn't want to make me uncomfortable while I was eating, he didn't know where to look, and he didn't know how to help me. He said he can't control how he feels. I was quite upset. The thing is, he didn't really look at me for the entirety of the date, except for when he moved on top of me to initiate intimacy.

He ultimately ended things because he said he didn't like the way he made me feel. He also said he doesn't want to adjust his life to my tremor, it may get worse, and the treatment I am having to correct the tremor may not work.

Would you consider making no eye contact because of a physical disability normal behaviour for a 35-year-old man? I have questioned autism, but I'm not sure. I don't have much experience dating, so I'm interested in the opinion of other, more experienced daters.

I have the same issue with people who are interested in person, being near them makes me avoid them if they get too close.

I found out about this a few days ago and it has been eating me up ever since. Reddit, I need some advice. So, my boyfriend (24M) and I (19F) were on the topic of past relationships when he suddenly slipped up and told me he had been with a girl who was 14 at the time (him being 18). I confronted him about it and he tried to deny at first (not wanting me to see him as a creep). But after realising it was too late he confessed. We had a serious conversation about it. He told me he didn’t know her real age when they met. She had allegedly told him she was 1 year younger but after a while he found out and didn’t want leave because he was already in love with her. It was pretty much a toxic relationship and he struggled to get out. They were together for about 4 years and didn’t sleep with each until she was 15 and he was 19 as they lived a few hours away from each other (keep in mind that the age of consent in my country is 15). I told him he was the adult and should have known better which he agreed to. He says he regrets it to this day and would never have let it escalate if he knew the truth from the beginning. I know past relationships are in the past and I don’t wanna ruin our relationship. However, I can’t shake this awful feeling. I love him and despite our 5 years age gap he has never ever tried to take advantage of me or force me to do something I’m not comfortable with. He is pretty much the ideal guy but I’m worried it might be something more sinister going on. I thought this through for a few days and decided to give him another chance. We haven’t had any problems prior to this and I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. He is very naive and gullible for someone at his age but it still doesn’t make it right. Did I make the right choice or is this something worth breaking up over?

We send each other hot pictures on snapchat. Generally, i am not like this, i dont text dirty and send sexy pictures(not nudes) prior to dating but i am doing it this time. I enjoy doing this but i have thinking that i am doing all the 'dating stuff' with him even before dating him like flirting excessively, sending each other hot pictures, talking like we are actually dating when in actuality, we aren't. This has really started to bother me because i think that if i do all the dating stuff with him prior to dating, he won't feel the need to date me in future.
 He seems like a nice guy, understands me but recently he sent me some pictures of him and asked me to send him some too, and i did. During that conversation, he specifically asked him to send a 'booty picture' (not literally, but wearing tight shorts), that kinda cringed me (i usually send him pictures like that and he said he loves them), i felt that he is only talking to me because i am hot and i send him his desired pictures without him asking for it  and i really seem to like him.
I don't what i should do noe because i think it's too early to talk to him about dating me as i want to know him more. 
Any advice on this? 
By reading the description, you must have formed a image that our relationship is onky limited to sending each other snaps, and perhaps it is like that. But our vibes really match, i like talking to him, our interests are very much the same. But his excessive flirty attitude bothers me.

This was just our experiences, so please take what I say with a grain of salt, ymmv I suppose

So basically we're best of friends, personality wise we're clones of each other, both play an instrument, same taste in music, both like cars, same authors, clothing style, political leanings, attitudes/personas, etc. The only difference we have is at face value, physical appearance. 

My buddy is more traditionally attractive, fitting the Eurocentric beauty standard; he's a pretty handsome guy, tall (6'0), lean but not a twig, curly brown hair, freckles, no acne or any deformities, happens to be white as well. I never thought I was particularly ugly, but I'm certainly don't fit the traditional Eurocentric beauty standards; Some acne scars from when I was in HS, but theyre mostly faded, not super tall (5'6), used to be a bit overweight but I did lose most of it, but I suppose I could stand to lose a few more lbs(175lbs to 147 currently), and I started balding a couple years ago so I just have a buzzcut these days thats super close. Also I'm a good few shades darker than him, my family is from the middle east so I'm often mistaken for hispanic or indian or something of the sort.

For our bios we both had identical information and responses, and picked out the photos that we thought we looked best in. We had another friend come in and double check our profiles and he said that our pictures and bios looked good, and he made sure to doublecheck any filters or location things or whatever.

We each decided to use Bumble as women are the ones that have to show interest and message first, and so we each swiped on 200 profiles. I'd say our preferences in women were about the same, and we were sitting next to each other over the course of the evening to make sure we both agreed on who we'd swipe right and left on on both our phones to ensure it was as fair and representative as possible.

At the end of the experiment my pal ended up getting 138 matches and 55 responses; I got 2 matches and no responses.

Although this isn't a perfect experiment, it was a disheartening to say the least. My friend received much more engagement, simply due to his appearance and his random luck at the genetic lottery, despite us being near twins in every other aspect. 

I'm at a loss for what to do now, I see so much conflicting advice on this sub, I just want someone that I'm reasonably attracted to that likes me for who I am, that I don't have to change myself just to be accepted or liked by them. Some here say to switch things up like go to the gym or change your style or do whatever, but I'm sick of that, I've been there and I've tried it and it did squat, others say to just wait it out, but I don't want to just wander around waiting for something to fall into my lap because I know that stuff doesn't happen irl usually so the chances are low. Others say to settle for someone that youre not even attracted to but that just feels like a cop out and a paradox.

My friend has been telling me I should date her brother for a while but I avoided it even though I’ve always thought he was cute. But recently we had a really nice time hanging out in a group of friends so I texted him and told him I thought he was hot and he texted back that he thought I was the prettiest girl he knew.

Last night we went out for Mexican food. I paid because I asked him first. He drove since I was paying. All during dinner we just talked about our jobs and normal conversation you have getting to know someone. It didn’t ever feel awkward at all. I thought he looked really handsome too. He’s one of those guys who’s handsome but I don’t honk he realizes how handsome he is. And he’s got really nice blue eyes which are a weakness of mine.

After dinner he asked if I wanted some ice cream and offered to pay for it so I took him up on it. I was thinking of inviting him back to my place to watch a scary movie since we both like those kind of films but the ice cream idea seemed really good. So we got ice cream and talked some more. He had me laughing pretty hard and he told me I had a really pretty smile.

So I figured what the hell? I’ve known him since we were high school kids. I know he’s not a creep and he’s been to my place before. I asked him if he’d like to go to my place and watch a scary movie. 

While we drove to my place we had a talk about what we’re both looking for. I know his sister told me his last girlfriend cheated on him so I figured he’d want to move slowly which I’m ok with. My last ex also cheated and it’s taken me six months to give this another try. We both agreed that we like each other as more than friends and we both want to continue to see each other.

So we watched a movie and missed a lot of it because we made out almost the whole time. I discovered that he’s a very good kisser which is a nice bonus. After the movie was over we just laid on my couch and talked and kissed for a while. I told him I had to get up early to volunteer for a fundraiser this morning so he kissed me goodnight and said to pick a place for dinner next week since it was his turn to pay.

I (29M) got rejected by a friend (F) of three years last night. She recently ended an abusive long-term relationship and, in the few months afterwards, we ended up spending more time together – not because I was interested in her, but because she was a friend in need. And for the most part, it was the same old friendly chit-chat and hangouts with friends we engaged in before her break-up. But then we spent more time together one-on-one. We’d go out for coffee, drive an hour away to get food, text each other everyday, spend hours on the phone with each other. And I enjoyed it to the point that when we were together with friends, I would only want to talk to her. So I figured that the best way to spend more time with her was to date, so I asked her out. And it was dumb. I should have known it was too soon, but I suppose I had on my rose-tinted glasses. She said something to the effect of not wanting to lose our great friendship, that it wouldn’t be fair to me because she’s still not over her ex, and that she needs time for herself.

So…idk. I suppose we’ll have to see how our friendship fares. I don’t see myself initiating conversations or hangouts anymore, and I don’t know how I’ll approach our relationship now that she knows that I wanted more.

She mentioned that her and her best friend (F) frequently express their feelings for each other and have gotten just to the point of sexual on many occasions. They flirt back and forth and almost reliably end up kissing at our parties. 

I was okay with that entering the relationship and fast forward a year or so I can say without a doubt we’re both in the happiest relationship we’ve each been in as we both frequently say it to the other. Neither of us second guess that for a second.  

However, I know she’s emotionally interested in her best friend, and her friend is too. And I am too. I not only love seeing them together and how happy they make each other, I also find her friend very charming and wouldn’t mind if they dated (exclusively) but ideally would like to date them both in a triad. I also know her friend finds me attractive for context. 

I do NOT want to jeopardize my best relationship or the love my partner and I have for each other, but I feel my partner would be happier also dating the girl she’s emotionally interested in. We’ve both made jokes about it constantly (mostly her) and talked about an open relationship or triad. She frequently asks if I would hook up with her friend if she let me, always with a smirk on her face.

We talked between acts and after the concert, I just had to smile looking at her (at least I hope I wasn't pokerface all the time, there are photos of me where I thought I was smiling but in reality I wasn't).
In the end, I walked her home but I guess we both felt a bit awkward at that point so we didn't hug or anything just said goodbye and that's it.
I can't get it out of my mind that I didn't do these things but we agreed to meet for a second time, I will try to gather my courage and get a little bit physical, to at least go for a hug.

He understood and told me he was serious about me and that it’d be okay for me to open up. Over the next 2 months we face timed every day and spent time together frequently. He said I was the most caring person he’d ever met, he has never felt so confident about himself, it’s the best sex he’d had in years, and started talking about meeting his folks and planning trips together. Then about two weeks ago he starts expressing that he’s “unsure about everything” and “scared” and “not sure if he’s ready for a relationship and doesn't want to hurt me”. I told him I understood and that it was best if we took a step back for now and give each other space. What has ensued since is him reaching out to me (even though I told him not to) saying that he misses me and doesn’t want me to forget about him, but is still unsure. I’m at a loss for words as I can’t believe this has happened to me again. I’m sad that this is probably over, but more sad that I’m not sure when I’ll ever be able to open myself up to someone to do this again. Advice?

I (28F) was helping friends to produce a video, and through connections I ended up hiring this guy (27M) as camera operator.

First second we meet, I totally fall in love.

The energy I felt between us was so strong and increased during the day, I just couldn’t ignore it.
He’s caring, kind, with pretty blue eyes, always in a good spirit, and smart.

He looks deeply in the eyes when talking. We literally have been so close sometimes it was hard to not kiss him.

We worked on set together that day and always consulted each other and as a joke he said “we should sell ourselves as a duo”.
I was doing art direction / set design and he kept going around to help me, grabbing new items telling other people on the team “I have to show her this, she’ll love it”. Everything I said or did, he was always so enthusiastic and we just had the best time.
Basically a very good day at work &amp; I couldn’t wait to see him again.

We ended up being in touch but he doesn’t really use social media/his phone much so it was a bit slow process and we were both busy so we didn’t meet.

I had another gig, where I needed a camera person, and since he’s been amazing to work with, I called him again.
Everything went so so so well and it was all very light hearted. 

We had a lot of time to talk during the three shoot days, and realized we have many things in common.
He’s planning to move to Mexico for a few months, and I’m invited to visit! He joked about us going to Japan together (which is my absolute dream).
I don’t drive, and he told me he has a car and can teach me.

I shared good news that happened to me recently and he was genuinely excited to see me happy and keeps asking for updates even now.
I shared my ideas for the future and how to grow in my work/things I love doing and he said he absolutely wants to be part of it (including opening a studio together).

We feel on the same wavelength. He literally said a few times that “we’re in sync &lt;3” and I really think there’s something.

We met for a tea a few days ago and kept talking for two hours about plans, and traveling, and cultures, and languages, in a park.
I gifted him a book explaining that it’s a specific one I gift people when I meet and things click and he was so happy and grateful!
That night, I was going to a concert (with other people, he wasn’t there). I got introduced for the first time to a friend of a friend, who noticed us earlier at the park, struck by how in love we appeared (wow. a total stranger saw this and then I met him that night. what are the odds)

Last night I had an absolute turn of plans that brought me with friends somewhere I’ve never been and wasn’t absolutely planning to go. We named 20 places and ended up at this one. And who was the first person in line at the entrance when I arrived? Him.

It just feels like things keep aligning.

Last night I also met his friend (let’s say his name is J), that he mentioned a few times, he studied with, and he’s planning to go to Mexico with. They also work together (both as freelance camera operators) and that’s all I know.
J knew about the book, and overall was super nice to me. J kept looking at the two of us not sure if with a “how cute” or “that’s sus” vibe. J also said he was happy I was there with them and we danced together for an hour or so!
I know he had a girl in the past but now I wonder if, by how things were vibing (and the long trip they have planned) maybe J is his boyfriend? Or best friend. J’s the only person he mentioned by name so far besides the people we have in common.

He’s a giver (and so am I), and he cares about who’s around. He’s present and listens. He’ll make sure everybody is doing well.

There’s not too much on his (or the friend’s) socials to know more than what I already know so I can’t get answers that way.

I wonder if we just developed a strong connection or if he might be interested in me.

I invited him out tomorrow.

I don’t want to misinterpret his kindness for interest. Also don’t want to ruin this even if it’s a friendship, because despite all the people I meet on a daily basis (also living in NYC), nobody caught my attention like this in a lot of time and I really can’t get him off my head.

So I (24m) met this guy (26m) from tinder, we kind of instantly clicked and started talking quite a bit.
We decided to meet 3 days later for the first time and go on a date and it actually went perfect. 

There was no awkwardness at all from the very beginning, conversation just flowed, we had a nice dinner and then went to his where we didn’t have sex, but did mess around and it was great. He mentioned a bunch of times that he really liked me, even called me “perfect” (just to mention). And he generally seems like a genuine, nice guy.

Now, neither I nor him(from what I gathered) have properly dated before. 

We were both pretty keen to go on a second date, which happened 5-6 days later. But this time it wasn’t quite as good. Like, we had some pauses, and it seemed he wasn’t trying to keep up a conversation that much. I get it, second date is probably harder. It was still quite nice overall and there was definitely some passion when we ended up making out again. 

Issue is that the day after, and still now (4days later) he’s not as talkative as he used to be on social media, even though he did mention that he wants to see me again.

I don’t wanna seem clingy or anything I’m just not sure how to proceed, I’ve never really done this before and don’t know what to expect or how to act and I don’t want to mess it up. I just don’t know how it’s “supposed” to be. And I obviously think it’s be weird to have a chat, we just went out twice.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I'm terrible at talking about myself, but I need some advice.

I'm a 26M vrgn with social anxiety. I don't even know if I'm considered a vrgn, considering I had grinding ""sex"" at kinder garden age with my ""gf"" when my dck didn't even work. We were playing around, this actually damaged me mentally and made me afraid of having xes and not being able to ""perform"". Btw she wanted to play this, I didn't even understand what I was doing and why, until sometime later. I don't want to think about it. I never told this to anyone

In early 20s I had few chances with girls that were in love with me, but I was always afraid to go any further than flirting. Even kissing, two girls were basically inviting me to kiss them, but I backed out both times. One time I finally kissed a girl, she bit my lip, so I got so anxious I almost passed out, then backed out, because I didn't know what to do, I literally wanted to die after she left it was very awkward. It's a thing with me, if I don't see being with this girl long-term I can't open up at all.

So yeah I have tried dating, not just for xes, to find someone to talk to and go on trips, but I have this thing that I never be myself. I pretend I have experience with women, which I don't besides flirting, and worst part it, I'm great at it (pretending).

People at my work think I'm a stud, I don't talk about it when asked and people assume I have many women and have a lot of xes. This is not helping me, it makes the lie bigger.

So I act cocky and confident just until the intimacy starts, then I brake down into this virgin looser. I'm actually confident, just not in the intimacy part.

I also don't have any close friends, because I don't trust anyone and my anxiety keeps me from going out.

Btw trust issues comes from my dad leaving me, my best friend betraying me and many other friends laughing at me, the ""we want you to feel bad"" way not the ""laugh cause it's funny"" way.

The biggest problem is that I'm incongruent. I'm confident up until the point of intimacy, then I brake down. I have been in few dates and I see that this thing is a huge turn off for girls.

I have also tried being less cocky and confident, but that is a turn off itself, because I'm not a hot dude and I need to play to my strengths.

How can I be confident being a vrgn, when I don't know what I'm doing.

Also, should I be open about my lack of experience and if I should, how can I overcome trust issues.

Is there a problem for women if their man has no close friends and mostly hangs out at home, reading, learning and build a business?

This post has no structure, the point is I don't know how to act when dating (I only use tinder). My big problem is that being a vrgn is a huge insecurity for me and I just can't seem to overcome it and I become very needy if I like the girl and that drives them away. I'm needy because I'm afraid they will leave me and I get too excited to text them, call them, like all the time. It's annoying even for me.

How to be less needy for starters? How to be confident not knowing what to do? I'm afraid girls I date find out I'm a vrgn and have no experience.

P.S. No I won hire a girl, not because I think they are bad, because I want to do it naturally with possibility of relationship.

Firstly, I want to add that this is my first experience on Tinder (or other dating apps anyway). I am - or how I like to think I am - an old fashion fella (PS: as attitude, an old soul if you want. I am 30 years old). If I am interested in someone, I will give my attention to that person and I expect the same, or I expect honesty and respect. Common sense, right?

I met this girl on Tinder and we started talking a lot on messages and on calls (a call can reach 1 hour without any fuss). We decided to meet face to face, for the first time as a date, and a day before the actual meet we decided the location and time. A few hours after that, she told me she would go to a friend of hers. I was sure, no problem, but after hours passed and (unusual for us since we were talked frequently) she was quiet, no messages, nothing. The next day, I woke up and she already sent a message saying she won't come. I was ""ok, sure, but what happened?"" and she said that she doesn't feel alright, well. Understandable, right? The only thing that my gut told me was that it was something fishy and I politely asked if she was on a date with that ""friend"" of hers, to which she replied yes and that's the reason why she didn't want to meet with me, saying that she spent the night there and that she was still at that location.

The thing is, before all that, I had a ""somehow shock"" how dating online is compared to actually going out and meeting with people that have the same or at least half of your hobbies, right? I've started to read the experience that others had and to not have any expectations EVEN if you are an old fashion fella who would give his energy, attention to one lady and expects the same. No, here, online dating is like a jungle, and everyone would do anything to ""survive"" which is understandable. I had emotions for example that I was just an option, but in time I start to see different. In the end, it's normal to date anyone, at the same time with others until we hit the exclusive level, BUT what bothered me was that she wasn't honest. I like to think that if you aren't honest from the start, you won't be further in the relationship, right? Or you make plans and the next day you just bail when we could have a nice chat. Because of that, I told her my feelings, I specifically said that it didn't bother me that she went on another date, but to be honest about it (not saying a lie.).

After that, we didn't talk for a few days (not sure how many), but I was practically ignoring her until she found me on another dating up and (I liked her profile when we were still talking at first) matched with me. I interacted with her, talked and I was ""whatever"" with her. Thought that she seems now more interested in me and wants to meet with me and so on. It seems that if I am indifferent, she's more interested or maybe because I know that she wasn't lucky with her dates and she comes to ""her option"" (e.g. me). For me, it felt, that with every date that she tried too (I know two - one is the one that I told you about and the other is from the IG), she seems that she would focus on whoever she might sleep/meet and if things don't go, she would go to next. Tbh, I am indifferent because I am not sure if she's worthy if she's capable of being honest.

Knowing how this dating online is actually going, should I keep in contact with her, meet with her, should I think that she's actually a good potential for a relationship? (I am not actually looking for ONS, I actually want to find great people with common senses and build a strong base for a possible relationship). What do you think? I am exaggerating? Should I give her a chance? I am not sure if she's fooling around and know how to play with the words for her own attention or you experienced this type of people (who isn't adult enough to talk about what they really want) and end up having something nice. Please, let me know your honest though, even if it's about me and where I need to improve or anything and I will reply to your comment as an update.

Edit: from what I talked with her, she seems someone who needs emotional attention, affection. She told me once that she's suffering from depression... So, I am not sure if this is a behavior that explains why she would go with anyone just to feel that attention.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1112252,public,self,I would like to know you opinion about this.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjxshg/i_would_like_to_know_you_opinion_about_this/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I’m a woman in her 20’s. I live with depression, anxiety, ADHD and a physical chronic condition. I’ve been waiting till felt ‘together’ to start dating but the older I get things are still not ‘together’ and my conditions will always be a part of me. I’m always going to have bad times.

I don’t know if I should date. I’m worried about being a burden for my partner and not being able to love them as they deserve. I worry that I wouldn’t be able to do all the things they deserve to experience. I’m worried I won’t make a good life partner too.

Even before finding a long term partner I may suck at dating. I might have to cancel cause of flares or feeling low. I’m forgetful and worried about not remembering important things or detail. I struggle with fatigue and worried it will come  off as uninterested.

I really do love, love and would like to find a partner. I don’t feel very deserving of love because of what I’ve mentioned but would like to experience and have a chance of finding a partner.

Before I get slandered with ""then you don't truly love her"", let me explain. I didn't want to make the title super long.

I (18M) been dating my girlfriend (18F) for 6 months now. She's the first actual physical relationship I've been in (dated only one girl prior but that was long distance. Never even met her and was only 3 months). I went through a rough spot in our relationship before, debating me emotions and feelings, but I was open with her about it and over time I realized that I truly do love her. Fast forward a few months and I'm now in first year Uni. The distance hasn't been easy, and there have been days where I've missed her so much it hurt, but we've made it work because we both love each other. But then things starting getting a bit dicey for me.

I, in a way, and for a lack of better words, feel sort of trapped. Now that I've been in Uni for a few months away from her, my mindset is starting to change. I started to think about all the things I'll never experience due to me getting into such a committed relationship this early in life. I'll never experience hooking up with a girl at a party. Never know what a friends with benefits is like. Never have a one night stand. Went to my first house party the other day. It was awesome. But it also sort of sucked because all my guy friends went off and started flirting with some hot chicks and I couldn't. I love my girlfriend, but in terms of sexual attraction, she's not a 10/10. She's more cute than she is sexy. She's pretty flat chested and doesn't have a thick waist. And my male brain isn't making it easy when all around me are walking temptations and reminders of what I can't do

And to make things worse, this girl recently joined our friend group. Gonna be honest, she's super hot. And she talks to me a lot and seems to be getting along with me the most. And I can't help but think ""If I wanted to, I totally could hook up with her pretty easily"". But I can't, I'm in a relationship and don't want to hurt my girlfriend. Knowing she cried because of me would break me inside. But I can't help but think this way and constantly want to do these things.

Despite all this, I still love her. ""What? You just went on a rant about how much you want to cheat"". Yes I know, it makes no sense how my brain works, but this is the truth. If I lost her, I would be severely devastated. I can't even talk to her about this because she loves really intensely, and she's also really really sensitive and cries super easily. Then again, what would talking to her about it do? I'm hours away, it's just gonna make her overthink more and more and make things overall worse. But I don't know what to do.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1112286,public,self,"I love my girlfriend, but ever since I started Uni, I get bad urges to cheat and question my feelings...",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjy3fr/i_love_my_girlfriend_but_ever_since_i_started_uni/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I think this is gonna be quite a long one so bear in mind.

Me and my fuck buddy have been sleeping together for almost 2 months now and lately we’ve been hanging out more and getting to know one another better. When the arrangement first started, it was strictly sexual with no kind of social media or text communication throughout the week. However i noticed that last month, he began to text me midweek. This then progressed to texting everyday and has continued ever since. He then told me that he ‘liked spending time with me but he wouldn’t have time for anything serious’ (he works 2 jobs and studies). I was fine with that, as i don’t particularly have time myself and am happy with our current arrangement. We continued as we had always done and things were fine.

So this is where things go south…

He and I met at work which has a large team and everyone gets on well. I have a few friends within this team who happened to be at a party that i was also at but my FB wasn’t. The night progresses and the sexy version of Piccolo gets brought out and the dare reads ‘Kiss the person to your left’…and the person to my left is one of aforementioned friends. Who is also friends with my FB. And we kissed. 

Fast forward to last night and we are in work when this information then comes out that myself and another person on the team have kissed, which I had not previously disclosed to my FB because 
a) it was just a drinking game 
b) he’s not my boyfriend, i’m not committed to him 
c) it didn’t seem right to randomly bring it up

But immediately my FB is not happy upon learning this. He would barely speak to me and was incredibly ‘off’ and told me he would no longer be spending the night with me like we had planned. He agreed to drive me home but we sat there in silence! 

So i sent him a message today, explaining the situation and apologising if i had hurt his feelings stating that that was never my intention and it was merely a game. When he finally replied to me, he told me ‘don’t be silly, we’re all good’. 

But i don’t know where to go from here because it certainly doesn’t seem like we’re good! If anyone could just give me ANY words of wisdom to help me in this stupid situation that would be greatly appreciated x",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1112366,public,self,i think i fucked up my FWB situation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjyy5n/i_think_i_fucked_up_my_fwb_situation/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,
