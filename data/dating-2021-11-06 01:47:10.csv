0,qnutxv,1636181711,The pressure in getting a partner and not being able to,"Not a rant, I just feel depressed and confused about dating.

I keep seeing posts about Tinder, dating, sex, hookups, you name it on here. I'm 25 and in college, and I can run a half marathon. The only issue I see is my face, as it isn't ""masculine"" like George Clooney or some underwear model. I have a full beard though. I've written a proper bio on my Tinder. The only explanation I can think of is that most girls don't frequent Tinder, even if they have a profile. Does it take living in a multimillion population city to get multiple matches, like it's advertised for? Is Tinder really a successful tool for 90% of guys that don't live in London or NYC?

Is it a major loss to not be having promiscuous sex or being in a relationship? I try to not think about being alone but every time I see a guy and a girl holding hands/studying together I feel a loss. It makes me keep going back to Tinder in hopes of somehow beating the ridiculous odds and landing a match, resulting in only seeing the same like I got 3 months ago when I joined. I wish I didn't think so much about this and could enjoy life like I did up to age 10.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnutxv/the_pressure_in_getting_a_partner_and_not_being/

12,qnwjl6,1636189704,The family of my partner is trying to destroy our lives (LDR),"
Hey all to be honest I don't know where else to turn so I'm hoping I can get some guidance through Reddit. I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year now and have yet to visit as my country still has an active international ban due to covid. The issue here is her family is actively going out of their way to put a strain on our relationship and I'm scared that eventually, they might just succeed.  So far what her family has done but is not limited to is:

1. Her brother gained access to my partner's Facebook and live-streamed our convos to the rest of her family which they laughed at and screenshotted many things 

2. I was going through a hard time and was crying over the phone. Her brother recorded it and later blackmailed her with it.

3. They constantly say things like ""I liked your ex the most""

So this brings me to what happened recently my partner's ex-friend whom she hasn't spoken to for a year reached out to my partner's family and informed them someone made fake accounts and was posting horrible things online acting as her. This led to the mother accusing me and posting things online claiming I am sick and a bully. Her brother got physical with my partner and kept telling everyone what they assumed I did. When confronted a few days later the brother said the reason he did all that was because he had a fight with his partner and was angry. As for the mom, she said the friend that called insisted my partner was the only one that had her phone number which was posted. This was later proved to not be true and it was later found out it was the friend's ex. I have constantly tried to reach out and have a mature conversation with her family but they literally either ignore me completely or say something like it's done now move on we don't want drama. I have brought tickets and will be visiting her soon and they have told her I'm not welcomed anywhere. 

Is there anything I can do reddit family? And if not is this something that could destroy a relationship?

13,qnx03w,1636191848,How do I handle guilt?,"So I [22M] have never tried to flirt in person. I started dating relatively late (once I hit 20 years old), and I've only used tinder, which got me three dates and eventually a girlfriend.

Now that I'm single again, I want to be able to openly flirt with a woman if I see her at an appropiate place to do so (a party for example). Tinder is a safe bet because I already know if she's attracted before talking to her, but I'm tired of this app and I want to be able to flirt in person.

But here comes the problem, if a woman catches my attention, my thoughts are ""you probably are the 10th guy that tries to flirt with her tonight, she will be tired of that and she doesn't want me to approach her, etc).

I feel guilty because I feel like I will be bothering them, and that I'm not enough to try to better those ""10 guys"" that I'm competing with, so I end up not trying. Maybe my problem goes deeper than that and it's about self worth, but I think that those thoughts are making me lose good opportunities of meeting someone special.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnx03w/how_do_i_handle_guilt/

I have more pics from dating profiles I could send him. (Selfies, full body etc)  I just can't send one out of the blue- not yet anyway. 

We have only been talking on the phone a short time but it has truly been amazing.  I feel We are both in the right place at the right time.  We seriously match up in so many ways.

But...  *there is always a but* ...I'm extremely nervous because- yes- you can see by the pic that I'm heavy. I'm a BBW, but I don't think from that pic- he knows my true weight. I'm currently losing weight and have started walking, a little yoga, eating better etc. (I've already lost 60lbs and kept it off, but I have a good 40lbs to go- 25 lbs at the least) 

I'm just afraid if we get closer or worse yet when we eventually meet up- he will have ""buyers remorse"" so to speak.

This is a man who is so kind, accepting, and open.  He doesn't seem to be the type to judge by looks.  He even has said online that he cares about the person inside- not the outside (this is my answer I guess?)  He said these things on a social media site months before we met.

I'm pretty confident. I'm wanting to be healthier.  I think sexually our kinks etc are very much a match (yay !!!).

So- how do I? OR when do I? Introduce the topic of my size. Do I throw hints around? Use the word ""plus size"" which to me is a really subjectively poor description.

27,qnz6n6,1636201529,A vent- dating as a woman,"I feel like hookup culture has brought out the worst in men. It‚Äôs not even their fault, WE sent the message that it‚Äôs acceptable. But I believe the apps (paradox of choice problems) and hookup culture (spits in the face of the very real FACT that most women have trouble separating sex and emotions) have RUINED dating. 

I am 32, a certified 8.5 according to my friend John üòÇ(who is quite hot himself and sleeps his way through our city), make 250k/ year (I don‚Äôt disclose this but I think they can tell I do well), very in shape, educated, worldly/cultured/traveled and very fun and outgoing with a huge social group and a ton of hobbies (I ski; do handmade ceramics, play tennis, workout, cook, travel). Super long Blonde hair, brown eyes, 5‚Äô4, 118 lbs with boobs and a butt if I do say so myself.

But goddamnit, the more I‚Äôve glowed up in life or in looks, the men who are in my ‚Äò‚Äúleague‚Äô or the male versions of me are getting chased down the street for dates and therefore they are just too spoiled for choice and won‚Äôt commit. 

My male equals (in a romantic match sense) who ARE good men who genuinely like having gfs/wives ALREADY HAVE ONE. They are literally taken.

The only hotties on the apps get too much attention and though we may end up dating for a teeny bit, they just want to keep playing the field.

When I see hotties out in ‚Äòthe wild‚Äô, they already have a girl by their side. 

There are just so many truly beautiful women (8s and above) and not enough men that can measure up for these super women. It‚Äôs so disappointing. There is this holy grail of a man we are ALL looking for, and then we finally think we found him and that man has already let the female attention/endless choice turn him into a fuckboy.

I‚Äôm at a loss. I was with someone for five years 4 years ago. SO handsome, so wonderful to me; so funny; so successful. Just all the things. And he was all in from day One, no games. I am over him now and have been for some time (he didn‚Äôt want to marry me after all that time, this wasted my half my 20s. but I say this to point out that I just can‚Äôt go backwards from that, you know?  I know what it‚Äôs like to be truly smitten and insanely in love with a serious catch who fits the things I want.


Anyway. Just venting I guess. I feel like I will have to settle for someone that doesn‚Äôt truly light me up sexually or at all, or be alone and never have children, and I just started crying in my therapists office the other day about it.

I told her early on I still had strong feelings for her and that she‚Äôs the woman I want to be with; and that dating other women felt disingenuous to me. She said it was music to her ears, but also said she had been ‚Äúseeing‚Äù this older guy (42m) for a few months and felt like she should try to make it work with him, despite them having issues ‚Äúweekly.‚Äù He was critical of her, flaked on plans, etc. She told me I might have to ‚Äúplay the long game.‚Äù

Well yesterday I sent her a text asking how she was doing and if she had plans for the weekend. She replied that her relationship with the older guy ended a few days earlier and she was reeling a bit, despite it ‚Äúbeing for the best‚Äù and before any more time was wasted. She said she had been drinking and that she wasn‚Äôt telling me all of this because she felt like we needed to re-kindle. She said she‚Äôs glad her and I are still friends and that she‚Äôs appreciates me and asked if we could hang out at her place or mine this weekend.

The thing is, her and I are not really friends. When I‚Äôm with her, I treat her as a love interest (lots of flirting, touching, innuendo, etc.). She knows that I‚Äôm in love with her. 

I‚Äôm really not trying to be her rebound, but I absolutely do plan on seeing her ASAP. I want an LTR with her, but need some perspective here because I can already feel myself getting worked up over the possibility of getting back together. I understand there are red flags, and I‚Äôm considering those, but the heart wants what the heart wants and I can‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm crazy about her- she‚Äôs incredible. How might I proceed so that I can make sure she knows I care about her, but without manipulating the situation.

Any advice and feedback is appreciated! Thanks!

TL;DR: have been reconnecting with my ex gf who I still love. We‚Äôve hung out a few times recently, despite her ‚Äúseeing‚Äù another guy whom she complained about to me. Well they broke up a few days ago and she wants to see me, but also said she wasn‚Äôt telling me this to ‚Äúre-kindle.‚Äù I should probably take that at face value, but there‚Äôs a ton of chemistry between us still (lots of flirting) and she knows exactly how I feel about her.

I've started to try online dating 2 years ago and I can definitely say now with conviction that it led to nothing but disappointment. I did get matches which led to chats and dates who eventually turned into ghosts. I'm pretty sure girls have it better, with tons options.

I deleted multiple times already but found myself coming back to ""try my luck."" And today would be the last because I had my most traumatic experience ever.
After which I found myself feeling worthelss,  the most anxious I've ever been and depressed and even a bit suicidal.

I thought to myself: ""I guess I'd just die alone. Nobody would care. Maybe I'd be even be happier if I just vanish right now."" The moment I thought that to myself, it's comforting that there was an inner voice saying: WTF ARE YOU SAYING?! 

Here's the catch: I'm sure as hell I'm a keeper. I'm fit/athletic and I look so much younger for my age. If anything, maybe I'm ""too nice"" and I've heard that alot.

I've made a few attempts at dating and haven't been successful at all, top it off that recently I've decided I'll focus on making friends again, there was this girl who took an interest in me, got my new group of friends to set up some test and I apparently failed, it felt like I was dragged into a pool of gasoline and given a box of matches, so I crawled out and lit a cigarette.

Am I just meant to be single? Should I save myself a lifetime of suffering and just give up on dating? I feel like just shriveling up and not even bothering, not even with casual sex. All of it just feels completely foreign and alien to me, I've read up and watched videos on dating and casual affairs, even asked friends on advice on it, nothing makes sense. Dating apps are just scams to me, I just feel like a creep at parties, I feel like people look at me like I have a third eye growing on my nose, it just seems like people who talk to me like they're just digging for info to laugh at me and kick me down.

33,qnzqx3,1636203648,Why do we like shitty people?,"I had a thing with a guy back in college who was quite famous among girls. Every other girl used to flirt with him and I used to regularly hear about him. Met him somewhere and got a lot of attention from him. For some time I enjoyed it and played along but he never seemed serious and I started dating someone else. While I was dating someone else, he started appearing in classes I took and it was a little uncomfortable though he never said or did anything. Eventually he started dating someone else and I was relieved. 

Reconnected with him years later and he still seemed interested. I remembered his reputation from college and thought of giving him some benefit of doubt. He didn't share a thing about him while I kept talking and turned out he had a gf the whole time. There was definitely flirting between us. They were in a long distance. Had to cut him off but I was hurt. We still share social media space. He broke with his gf and came back and told me he loved me but I don't want to date someone like him. Then he reconnected with his gf and they are back together now. She moved to his country and are probably engaged. They probably never broke up properly and were still in touch. Sounds like a red flag to me. 

His only concern was we weren't in the same place which I could have easily made possible but didn't want to commit so early. He played with my feelings and kept his gf as a safe option. I didn't want to tell him that I could travel or study near wherever he is working. Now he knows that and he is trying to get in touch again and I am divided in two. I never gave it an honest chance but I know he is trouble. 

It's hard to see their social media ups and downs and to not feel bad when you're treated like that. A part of me wants to yell at him for treating me that way and other part of me knows nothing good is going to come out and I got out of it before getting invested.

It feels like a chicken or the egg scenario.

If you‚Äôre an attractive, tall, white guy you‚Äôre going to get a lot of attention from girls in your formative years. Like some guy that had sex for the first time when he was 14 I‚Äôd definitely going to be confident. He‚Äôs been able to get attention from girls his entire life. 

If you‚Äôre a ugly, shorter, ethnic guy like myself, no girls are going to like you. Not only that but when you do put yourself out there it‚Äôs just going to be rejection.

I have seen so many posts about why people can‚Äôt get dates, why the community has changed so much, why does everyone wanna sleep around instead of finding a nice long term relationship etc‚Ä¶.

Has anyone stopped to really think about that? All the girls say it‚Äôs the guys fault. That they are the complete package and guys only want sex, but what is the complete package? Girls make it so hard these days for men to want a relationship. Most are so high maintenance, all about the looks, and think they are high and fucking mighty, but that ruins it for all of the girls who have flaws, the girls who aren‚Äôt the whole package and don‚Äôt want the whole package. Girls who just want to be loved, but men are so scared about commuting because these high maintenance girls make it IMPOSSIBLE. 

The dating field is changing because people are changing. You can‚Äôt expect to always find someone out of your league, and you can‚Äôt expect to find the whole Dam package. People have faults, they have issues, and they have flaws, but than all the high class people overlook them, and they don‚Äôt even notice the lower class people because they feel they deserve perfection. But there is. No. Perfection. 

Step the hell back and look at the bigger picture. Just because that girl not that perfection doesn‚Äôt mean she won‚Äôt be a wonderful wife. Just because she is almost perfection doesn‚Äôt mean she will be a wonderful wife. 

Just because he isn‚Äôt perfect doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt be a wonderful husband. Just because he is perfect doesn‚Äôt mean he will be the perfect husband. 

Stop letting yourself get so stuck in your head about what you want, that you overlook the one that don‚Äôt quite meet the description. Put personality before looks and see what‚Äôs really out there. If you can‚Äôt find anyone, your either looking in the wrong place, or your looking for the wrong thing.

56,qo2l6m,1636212443,DO YOU THINK WE ARE GONNA WORK OUT? SHOULD I GIVE IT A SHOT OR SHOULD I STOP IT?,"I (26) have been talking to this guy (34) for over a month already. He seems to be like a great person.

But... he doesn't seem to worry about the future which never even bothered me, to be honest, until earlier today.

He has a job and works 6 hrs a day, he barely sleeps. I assume because he's a gamer. And he's very unproductive (he's admitted and trying to work on this which truly makes me proud)

I'm very supportive when it comes to his life decisions. 2 weeks ago, he decided to stop drinking alcohol. I am so happy for him and told him to do baby steps and don't overwhelm himself.

He also decided to go to a therapist and enroll himself in a gym on his day off, but he didn't because he was lazy and that he hates himself for it. He usually misses his doctor's appointments. I didn't say anything like ""you should take actions"" because I don't want to pressure him. He just stays at home all the time.

On the other hand, I am a very ambitious woman. I work out, I got businesses, I have a lot of hobbies like hiking, travelling, drawing, playing the Ukulele, and most importantly, I work for my future.

So earlier today, I mentioned to him that I like to start another business which is a clothing line. I am a designer. And the response I got was ""Why are you so obsessed with making money?"" I told him that I am planning to buy my own house next year.

He said, house is expensive. I told him that I will need to loan it and will pay for it for 20 yrs and renting is something that I don't want to do forever. He rents an apartment, by the way.

Then he went to telling me that ""I don't know why people is so obsessed over wealth so much!""

I told him that I am not and that I grew up in a poor family, got molested by different people around me who are drug addicts and alcoholics. And I don't want that same thing to happen to my kids someday.

He said that he just wants someone to accept him for who he is... and I was like üôÑüôÑ dude, you were the one who's judging me here. I didn't say a single word about how lazy you really are. I didn't, for once, call you out for his negative views in life.

I am not the type of person who can get easily mad about things like this. Because I try to understand the person first. I always tell myself, ""maybe he had a bad experience in the past."" I was super calm all throughout the argument.

And another thing, whenever I ask him ""What's your plan for today?"" (I am literally just asking what's he up to) he seems to get triggered by it. I guess by the word ""plan"" and he thinks that I am calling him out for having such a lazy ass!

But before we end the conversation, he said that he's sorry and that he went back to drinking beer again, that's why. Gosh, he just took all his frustrations out of me.

I told him that if something bothers him, he can try to ask me in a nice way because I'm happy to talk it through and I just don't want to talk to someone who's being driven by so much emotions.

58,qo3g2e,1636215040,Uh oh got left on read,"Hey uh so yeah, I 20M was texting this one girl 18F I know pretty well. Very good friends with the whole family and extended. Recently got left on read after asking about her mom's health and asked to be kept updated on the results of a doctor's appointment. She read it but hasn't given an update over the last 4 days but it looks like her mom is doing fine on social media.

So I hate playing games and I'm no player. I like serious, long-term relationships that have meaning. But to blast back to junior high for a bit, is it bad to be left on read? I know the connotations for each person is different, but in my experience, if a person really even cared or appreciated the other person they would do the decency of replying. I know the potential answers of 'oh she's probably busy' or 'she forgot and maybe she's a bad texter.' But, again, in my experience, this is never the case with girls since they seem overly attached to their phones nowadays (guys too), so there's pretty much no excuse to 'accidentally' forget to reply. I'm just peeved about this since it seems to happen often with a lot of opposite gendered friendships, and it's honestly so childish.

59,qo3huf,1636215181,Dating as a childfree woman and ... Compromising?,"I've always had a very firm childfree stance. And I know that I will never have my own biological children. Therefore, when I start dating someone I make this very clear at the beginning - as I don't want somebody to waste their time or expect me to change my mind.

However, recently I started dating a friend and I KNOW they want babies and were in fact talking about having a baby this or next year with their ex partner. 

Even though it is early days, because I know their history and I know they want kids, I've made sure that they know this is out the question for me. I don't want them to have to give up on something to be with me. 

But they offered me a compromise - they'd love to adopt. They would be happy to be the primary care giver/parent and stay at home (theoretically). Surprisingly, I'm actually okay with this. I'm not somebody that typically likes kids all too much but I like them in small doses and I DO make the more money out of the two of us. 

Is this an okay foundation to work with moving forward? Don't want to waste anyone's time. They definitely want to be a dad and I think I would theoretically be okay with this compromise - but is it enough? Do you need to be sure of these things before getting into a relationship with someone that wants kids?

I bumped into him on a dating app few months ago and came to know we both are divorced now. He asked me to meet for a drink to catch up as a friend. This time I definitely felt attracted to him. We infrequently kept in touch, eventually we both told we like each other and ended up hooking up. Which was a really bad idea for me as I am not a NSA sex type person. I started developing feelings for him. But he is very inconsistent and not keeping in touch kind of person. After that one time he only texted when he wanted to hookup. Also he would take more than a day to respond to my text, he told me he doesn‚Äôt check his phone when I brought it up. I broke it off today, then he asked if we can still meet and talk , he would like that( we had decent conversations during those hookups). He did asked me few times to come try rock climbing (his hobby) with him, as i was hesitating he asked we can just go as friends.

62,qo3s0a,1636216004,Coping with being a long-term single,"I am feeling a bit lost right now. I went on a fourth date with a girl I quite liked yesterday, but the whole thing petered out and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll see her again. Right now I‚Äôm in the process of moving on, but I‚Äôm not really looking forward to actively trying to date again for several reasons.


1. Online dating is super exhausting to me. As a 25-year-old guy who‚Äôs decently attractive but not the top of the pillar, I barely get any matches. And when I do, there is no guarantee that the quality of the conversation is going to be good.


2. I don‚Äôt really feel like I have other options. Due to rising Covid cases, public spaces are closing down again and there are no chances for a single person to join any kind of fun activity where you‚Äôd just get to meet new people. 


3. I have a hard time meeting people in general. Since my past relationship ended in 2019, I've went on dates with exactly 3 women. At this rate, I won't be able to meet someone who's a good fit for me soon.


4. I‚Äôm going to go on an exchange semester in Japan starting in April. This is exciting, but also means that it‚Äôs probably a bad idea to again try to find someone because the relationship might not have enough time to develop to survive my time abroad. I‚Äôve had the same line of reasoning half a year before, because my exchange was supposed to start in September. I felt like quite an idiot when it got postponed to April due to Covid.



5. I feel like I‚Äôm a romantic failure. I‚Äôve had just two relationships, both of which did not last longer than six months. I‚Äôve been single since about February 2019 and, looking at all my friends, it looks like I‚Äôm almost the only one who doesn‚Äôt get to play in the game of romance. 



At the same time, I‚Äôm also wondering what the point of all this is. How many more years is it going to take? How many more years are the only hugs that I‚Äôm gonna get be good-bye hugs? Sometimes, I wish I could just sleep through times of my life that are so emotionally unfulfilling.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo3s0a/coping_with_being_a_longterm_single/

64,qo3wut,1636216393,I (27F) feel like I‚Äôm gonna die alone,"Venting but could use some pointers. As someone who‚Äôs dealt with social anxiety all my life, growing up I never dated or hung out with guys much. My first kiss wasn‚Äôt until I was 21. It only happened because of tinder. I didn‚Äôt have a boyfriend or lose my virginity until I was almost 22. Again tinder. My only relationship was very toxic. The feeling of finally being in love kept me in an emotionally abusive relationship for almost 4 years. It‚Äôs been 2 years since I broke it off and I haven‚Äôt been on a single date. Online dating apps are just not for dating. They‚Äôre hookup apps. Either that or you text someone and suddenly communication stops or you never meet up. There‚Äôs just too many options.

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt go out much because I don‚Äôt have many friends (thanks social anxiety) That makes it hard to meet people. It‚Äôs usually just me and my best friend. So last night we went out and a guy I matched with was there. It was dark inside and he was with a couple friends. Maybe he didn‚Äôt see me. But because of my anxiety I avoided eye contact. I got a drink to relax a bit but by the time I was relaxed he was gone.

This guy has hinted at hanging out a couple times but nothing has been planned. He‚Äôs followed me on IG probably a year now. Last time he brought up hanging out I was sick and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. We don‚Äôt talk often. Usually just reply to our stories. Anyways, after that encounter I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthis is why I‚Äôm gonna die alone‚Äù lol we were finally in the same room and I expected him to read my mind and come up to me. I just didn‚Äôt know what to say or do. My go to is avoiding eye contact and that‚Äôs why no one comes up to me. I know it makes me unapproachable.

I don't think I ever had genuine feelings for him, more of a schoolgirl crush. I don't hold anything that happend during our relationship against him, he never pressured me into doing anything.  
He was the first boy to ever show interest in me and the first boy I ever dated. So, one night I was staying at his house along with one of my (at the time) very close female friends and throughout the night we were drinking. My female friend constantly pressured us to have sex and make out etc. So eventually, once I was quite intoxicated I agreed to give him head. 
My friend did not leave the room while this happened and due to nervousness from both me and the guy it didn't go very well. He didn't finish, I didn't stop because I felt like he had to finish or else I was doing something wrong but he never did. 
I don't remember much of what happened after this point but when I woke up my underwear was halfway down my legs. They told me what happened (we did not have sex, I know this for a fact) I went to take a shower, washed my mouth out with water multiple times and started shaking and crying. I felt like I had done something horrible.
 I have never told anyone about this. 
Is this a normal reaction for a first sexual encounter at a young-ish age?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo5s1i/cried_after_first_sexual_interaction_is_that/
83,qo5s42,1636222018,How do I get over this,"My bf (19M) and I (18F) have been dating for 2 months now. He confronted me about something yesterday: he told me, he doesnt think our relationship is 50/50. He told me my texting style is not that satisfying. Our interests differ quite a lot which isnt usually a problem but it is a reason to why he might feel unsatisfied in our conversations. But the thing is, i havent felt this from my point of view and ive been trying my best to text and reply as much as possible and asap, as im a very bad texter generally (plus my bf said that he only started feeling like this because of a random wave of dissatisfaction and hate toward himself). And my main problem is my bfs classmate, who ive had a grudge on since elementary school, she is a very ambitious and smart person, just like how my bf wants to be. They talk a lot and im afraid of him finding conversations with her more satisfying, because she knows more stuff in his field of interests. I told my bf this and he told me not to worry but i cant help myself. What should I do? Should i bring this topic up again? Should i wait and see what happens? How can i improve this situation?

86,qo60n3,1636222722,When a date goes 50/50,"Met up on a first date for breakfast earlier. She was nice and I like her. We had breakfast, then I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk, and we had a walk. Lasted about 2hrs, the topic of a second date didn't come up. No kiss or touching.

We're both aren't into casual and I believe we want to take things slowly. There wasn't any intimacy such as touching other than hugging when saying hello and goodbye. Overall I'm 50/50 about it, 50% because it wasn't awkward or necessarily bad, and 50% because it wasn't like a magical moment of romance either. 

I've asked her if she fancied doing somethign again and awaiting a response, although that was a few hours ago so my hunch may be no second date. I hope if it is rejection it is rejection with an answer rather than ghosting.

90,qo6gce,1636224041,How come the majority of girls I meet have no problem with spending other people's money? (Rant),"I don't want to make it a gender debate, but there are so many girls that I've met that openly talk and laugh about spending other people's (guys) money while their money is safe in the bank. They even talk about spending their parent's money freely and only wanting to go on vacation if their parents or someone else is paying, even as grown adults. There seems to be no shame. Personally, I feel extremely uncomfortable if someone (anyone, male or female) is paying for me - I won't stop them if they offered but I'll be more likely to want to repay the favor and quickly. 

For the girls I've gone out with, not only have the majority never offered to pay, even for themselves, some have even said ""I want this but you'll have to pay for it"". Granted, when that happened, the item itself wasn't too pricy, but it was the action itself that was strange. 

Another girl recently basically said that she's only coming out for a date (that she suggested and picked the location) that I pick her up from her place (1 hour drive) then take her to the location (40 minutes from my house / 1hr40min from hers, with my house in the middle between hers and the date location), and then drive her back home. I suggested other options like taking a cab, or taking the train and she asked why I was making it such an issue and that her suggestion was ""more convenient"". Of course, she didn't say that it was only 'more convenient for **her**'. 

Lastly, a friend of mine (girl) told me about a dinner date she had with her friends (all girls). Apparently, they wanted to split the bill evenly and my friend refused, saying ""why should I pay for drinks I didn't drink or food that I didn't eat?"" I suggested she keep that same energy when the next guy takes her on a date and she laughed and said ""no way, the guy is paying for everything"".

TLDR, I'm just wondering how and why there are so many girls out there that would spend guy's time and money freely, but won't do the same themselves. It just seems disrespectful and selfish, as if they see men and their parents as walking wallets that are there to serve.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo6gce/how_come_the_majority_of_girls_i_meet_have_no/

92,qo6iq3,1636224246,Did I 25M screw up badly? Really need some advice here,"So a couple days ago a girl 25F from my 25M mutual friend group whom I‚Äôm close friends with texted me and told me she broke up with her GF. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt want to pry or anything and so I just told her I was sorry to hear and said to call if she needed someone to talk to.

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon, she texted me about hanging out in our friend group last night. She told me that the rest of the girls knew about her break up (I‚Äôm the only guy in this group fwiw) so I at least knew everyone knew about it when we got together. She called me about two hours before we were all expected to hang out and told me that she would talk more about it when she saw me in person and were together. 

Anyway, I went over to one of the girls houses prior to us all hanging out and this particular girl (Katie) is one that I‚Äôm interested in courting and so her and I were together. The others ended up canceling due to other commitments that came up last minute so it ended up just being me and Katie so it was kind of like an unofficial date. I called the girl who had the break up and told them everyone else canceled but that me and Katie were still planning to go out and so I invited her to come with us. She initially said that even though Katie and I are not actually a couple, she would feel awkward being around us because she‚Äôd feel like a third wheel. I told her I understood but still encouraged her to come with us so she could clear her head a bit. 

Long story short, she decided to come along, so Katie and I went over to her place to pick her up. Shortly after, I asked ‚Äòso tell me what happened‚Äô‚Ä¶ I assumed it was safe to ask since the other girls already knew and she had told me we‚Äôd talk once we got together. Anyway, she became uncomfortable after that and later told me she was taken back that I‚Äôd ask about her breakup in front of Katie and said the whole night was uncomfortable for her and that she felt awkward. I heavily apologized and said I didn‚Äôt mean to make her feel uncomfortable, as I thought it was safe to ask considering Katie knew and she also told me we‚Äôd talk once her and I were together in person. 

Do you think Katie would‚Äôve thought I was a jerk for asking about our friends breakup? And was I in the wrong to ask about it? Bear in mind we‚Äôre all close friends, so I didn‚Äôt think it was the wrong time to ask. I told Katie afterward that I felt bad bringing that up but thought it was safe and she didn‚Äôt seem like it was a big deal and kind of brushed it off.

TLDR; I brought up a break up with one of our mutual friends and it made the whole night out feel awkward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo6iq3/did_i_25m_screw_up_badly_really_need_some_advice/

Would these be red flags to you?

\*On first date, said the night before they went to a swingers sex party as a plus one with someone they used to date, said he didn't partake. He said he was only there as it was couple's only, and she needed someone to bring.

\*Also bragged about getting 3 porn star phone numbers from a adult movie convention.

\*Asked twice if I was into women (I am not). The fact he brought it up again made me feel he didn't accept my own sexuality. His past partners, many were lesbians. He also had a threesome with his baby mama 2 years ago, who also was/is still a lesbian.

I really liked his personality, but I wanted to ask third party what they would of felt with the information given. I felt like he was being honest, but also, it felt heavy for a 1st date.

He's 38, and I just feel now his mind was so warped from porn. I am also looking for a relationship, and thought he was, too. Also, we were talking for a month before this, and none of this was mention, outside the fact his baby mama was/is a lesbian.

Once, I talked to this girl (Mary‚Äôs friend) I replied to her storie and we were about to link: Me w/ Mary‚Äôs friend, and a friend of mine with Mary.  They ended up playing hard to get and nothing happened.

Months later, Mary and her friend fought and now they aint friends no more. So, at a party, 3 weeks ago, I shot my shot and ended making out with Mary (not her friend whom I firstly wanted). Mary was in a relationship so she cheated on her mans w me.

1 week ago, I maked out with mary again, but now making myself ‚Äúhard to get‚Äù, like i would swerve her kissed and stuff and being mean (joking of course) but not just making out like first time.

99,qo6zvt,1636225678,"Me [40 m] with my coworker/closer friend [29 f]. We're close, sometimes I think there's more other times I'm not so sure","This girl and I have been coworkers for about three years and have become close friends over the course of the last year and a half.  She got out of a relationship about 6 months ago and I have been divorced for about a year now and it feels like our dynamic has been changing recently ‚Äì as in we are growing closer and closer. That being said, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm reading too much into it or if she has interest ‚Äì at some point I will ask her but because of the age difference and having been out of the dating game for more than a decade I‚Äôm curious as to what others would think. For the record, the coworkers we are closest too seem to think she‚Äôs interested in me.

‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs become more physical with me. In the past, she used to touch my elbow to tease me about how cold her hands were. She likes playing with my arm hair or stroke my arm and sometimes when we‚Äôre talking, she‚Äôll rest her legs on top of mine. Now when she gives me hugs, they‚Äôre no longer the friendly side hug, she comes up to me and presses herself against me, leaning her head on my shoulder or chest. She‚Äôll randomly grab my hand and have me follow her to help with something. If I tell her my back hurts, she‚Äôll give me a back rub or massage. When I‚Äôm sitting down and we‚Äôre talking, she leans up against me if she‚Äôs standing up. She starts a few hours earlier than I do, if I don‚Äôt hug her when I come to work, she says something like ‚Äúexcuse me, aren‚Äôt you forgetting something?‚Äù When her shift is over (a few hours before mine), she asks me to walk her to her car. If I‚Äôm not working that day, she walks alone and doesn‚Äôt have anyone else walk her up. 

‚Ä¢	When we‚Äôre assigned to different areas of our department, she‚Äôll come and spend time with me in my area. She flirts with me and some of it is mildly sexual ‚Äì she comes from a pretty traditional culture (Arab) and she‚Äôs told me she usually doesn‚Äôt flirt like that. She also doesn‚Äôt express emotions. For example, she went away recently and asked if I was going to miss her. When I said I was going to I also told her that she can tell me she misses me. She responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really express those feelings.‚Äù While she was away, we were talking and I said I might call off on the day of her return to work and she said ‚Äúyou better not, I miss you.‚Äù When I asked her about not expressing herself, she sent back a winky face.

‚Ä¢	Other guys at work try to flirt with her, she doesn‚Äôt really respond or just laughs it off. We talk about everything and text each other throughout the day. We always text each other ‚Äúgood night‚Äù and ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù even if we‚Äôve had a day where we haven‚Äôt really texted. We call each other honey and sweetheart. She gets jealous when other girls at work try to flirt with me and will show me memes that say something along the lines of ‚Äúwhen another girl flirts with your man that‚Äôs not your man‚Äù and has some random picture of an upset animal or something like that.

‚Ä¢	A few weeks ago, we were talking about going to lunch together and she was making super elaborate plans about where we‚Äôd go and what we‚Äôd eat, etc‚Ä¶and she ended it by saying ‚Äúand we can call it a date.‚Äù Unfortunately, I had to cancel due to one of my parents being diagnosed with cancer. We‚Äôve both been busy and haven‚Äôt had a chance to reschedule but will have some time next week. 

‚Ä¢	When we do certain tasks at work that we‚Äôre required to do every night, we do them together and I call them ‚Äúwork dates.‚Äù She always gets a quick little smile on her face when I do so. If I‚Äôm not around she‚Äôll come find me and say ‚Äútime for our date.‚Äù 

‚Ä¢	She sends me pictures of herself all the time. If she‚Äôs out of town, she‚Äôll send me a picture of herself at the beach or having a glass of wine, or whatever. She was out of town for Halloween and sent me a picture of herself in her costume. She‚Äôll send me videos of herself with her family ‚Äì I‚Äôve only met her brother and sister-in-law. I‚Äôll send her pictures of places I want to go and she‚Äôll say something like ‚Äútake me there.‚Äù Or if I send her a picture and say that I‚Äôm going there alone, she‚Äôll always ‚Äì I mean every single time ‚Äì say ‚Äúno, we‚Äôre going together.‚Äù

There are a lot more things she does that shows she‚Äôs interested in me. We‚Äôve hung out a few times, and I‚Äôd like to ask her out but I‚Äôm not sure how to go about making it clear that my intention is for it to be a date and not hang out as friends.

I‚Äôm not looking for comments regarding dating coworkers: our employer doesn‚Äôt care and neither of us reports to the other. If we were to date and things went south, it‚Äôs easy enough for me to transfer to another location that‚Äôs about 10 minutes closer to where I live. 

I‚Äôm also not looking for comments regarding the age difference. I‚Äôve made jokes about our age difference, and she‚Äôs made it clear that she doesn‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm older than her. 

**tl;dr**: pretty sure co-worker/close friend is interested in me. We‚Äôve hung out in the past, but want to make clear that next time we hang out I want it to be a date. How to go about doing so without being an awkward fuck.

ETA: as I don't think I was clear - I am very interested in her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo6zvt/me_40_m_with_my_coworkercloser_friend_29_f_were/
