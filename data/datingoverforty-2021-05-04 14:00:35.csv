0,n4z34l,1620164406,Misrepresentations and anger of rejection,"50M here. Been on OLD looking for just casual/FWB type relationships for about 3 weeks now following finalization of divorce. My profile is very clear about what I am looking for. Out of the 6 conversations that have started, I made sure that I again communicated what I was looking for, which resulted in 3 of them immediately ceasing contact, that they hadn't bothered reading my profile.

I had two dates with one of those three remaining women I was chatting with. First one was a quick meeting in a public place to make sure she was comfortable with me, and then a dinner for the second. At the end of the second, I was honestly hoping for a romantic encounter and instead she just gave me a peck on the cheek and wished me good night. I was disappointed but figured that was rejection, and had resigned myself that it was going to be difficult for me to find what I was looking for and that having an initial dating experience was good for me.

She messaged me back in a few days asking me to go on a third date. I was confused about this. I wouldn't expect someone who was looking for casual sex partners to spend too much time having multiple dates before having sex. I questioned her if she was actually attracted to me or not. What followed is the strangest/disturbing interaction I have ever had, however my experiences in dating were from 27 years prior. 

She texted that she was attracted to me, but she wasn't the type of girl to jump into bed with someone before 5 dates. I responded that it sounds like she was looking for more of a serious relationship, and not something casual that we had communicated about. She came back that people just say casual but they really want a real relationship, and that I was boyfriend/husband material and not hookup material. I felt like I had been honest but she had misrepresented what she was actually looking for. I politely said that we were looking for different things and wished her well going forward.

She didn't take that well. She then proceeded to send me angry insulting texts. Almost every 5 minutes. For the next 24 hours. Until I finally blocked her number and blocked her on all my OLD profiles. I didn't block her immediately as I was almost fascinated by how she didn't stop, and I kinda wanted to see how long it would go. I wasn't responding, just reading everything. This can't be normal, right? Any other men out there, these types of reactions after rejecting women don't happen frequently and this was just the luck of the draw for my first outing, right?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n4z34l/misrepresentations_and_anger_of_rejection/
1,n50iko,1620168175,Is being a widow as much a deal breaker as people say?,"So I find myself widowed at 39. My late husband always said he'd do me the courtesy to die and leave me young enough to date again. (There was *a bit* of an age gap.). Well I suppose he was right...

Anyhow. I'm told a lot of people see being a widow/widower as a deal breaker, and I'm wondering why.

Sure, I loved my husband. But things weren't that good that I'd be looking for a stand in. Nor were they bad, so don't expect me to never talk about him again. Heck, we had some riotously funny discussions about his dating life from way before we even met, so previous partners are probably something that would come up in conversationeventually...

Let's face it, at (nearly) 40 there is bound to have been a life before meeting a new partner. Why not share the good bits?

So, when I eventually get into dating, I plan to maybe not advertise but certainly not hide the fact that I'm a widow. If people can't handle it, then I suppose better to know upfront...

On the other hand, maybe the 100lb dog is more of an issue :-p

so, is being a widow really such a deal breaker?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n50iko/is_being_a_widow_as_much_a_deal_breaker_as_people/

I've been using tinder for a few months, and I've met some great guys, but it's mostly been one or two dates, then it fizzles out for whatever reason. A few weeks ago, I met a great guy - funny, successful, cute, the whole package. I'm not looking for anything serious as I haven't been single that long, but this guy and I just clicked. We went out and I left town a few days later for a planned trip. The whole time I was gone, we were texting and he said he couldn't wait for me to get home so we could get together again. I felt the same way, so I rolled with it. Three dates in the next week after I get back, and on date #4 we end up back at his place. Great sex! Yay! The NEXT day, he's weird - not responding to texts like before, etc. Now, I know he has a very hectic job so I don't think anything about it at first. It has now been a week, and it's more of the same. After one great night together. I can't figure this guy out. I'm not looking for anything serious, but our dates were fun and easy and I just really enjoyed spending time with him. Now I have no idea where I stand, and we have barely talked since. We're due to see each other tomorrow, and I'm actually nervous about it, when I never was before. Ugh is this normal guy behavior? Some of my career single friends say yes, but I just don't know.

Met a man age 50 on a dating app. Seemed like a normal dad with older children. Older than me! Yay! We had one date. He came across totally normal. We had been texting all normal like before the date. I was excited because Hell Yes! Normal!!

Found out that he has been sending cash, lingerie and gifts to women in their early 20’s he has met on the internet. Same age as his oldest daughter. I discovered this as he sent me screenshots of his texting with them. Which also mentioned how he had more dates than he could handle and also how fun it was getting physical with said dates. Um- Hello?? Why on God’s green earth would he send this to me? To brag about paying off random chick’s credit cards and buying flooring for them? You commissioned erotic artists to sketch them? I get it! You have a good job!

He sent me a screenshot that had my photo and told his sugar baby I was double her age. I get it! You think you pull in young chicks!

Also found out he has his very own Onlyfans page. Mmmmmmm- ok Sex Freaky. I get it! You lost weight and now random peeps pay to sneak a peek at your package. Most dudes just post a shirtless bathroom selfie of their brand new post divorce chest on Bumble. 

Oh wait. He is not divorced yet. Going through said divorce. I get it! You can’t find a good therapist and now I get to hear all about it. Every Day. And I mean All About It. I believe you btw- I don’t need screenshots from the lawyers. 

*For the love of all things holy* - it hasn’t been even a week since our first date on Saturday. It’s been 3 days y’all. It’s like he said let’s make day 3 all sorts of Magic and I will just sh!t on this woman all my private business.

14,n5cqv1,1620210492,He added bot girls to his FB,"I just wanted to make this post in case any of you are curious about bot accounts and how I nearly had an anxiety explosion over them. 

I noticed my bf’s FB friend count was rising rapidly about a month ago. I took a look at newly added friends, and they were all very young women, about 19-24 in age. Very pretty, but very girl-at-the-mall type. I looked at their profiles’ URLs and noticed that some of them were men’s names. Took deeper looks and noticed a lot of photos of men on the account, and something just didn’t seem right.   More accounts were added, and I was at the point where I had to ask WTF was going on. 

My bf laughed and said he added bot girls so that he could chat with them to see how funny the replies would be. I don’t know what eventually happens when you chat with bots, but I’m assuming they ask for money at some point. I told him I thought it was silly and a waste of time (am I wrong?!)...but that I was glad he explained it. 

A few days later, a friend of mine pasted his conversation with bot girls, and it was actually pretty damn funny. I felt much better knowing it was so entertaining! 

I feel bad for getting upset at a stupid FB scam, but I also felt it was weird for him to add these ‘women’ to his profile for me, my friends, and his family to see. It just looked tacky, and I had my friends questioning me about these new hotties popping up.

17,n5f06c,1620218563,Seek input on date 3 convo,"I'm on date #3 with a woman that I seem to be clicking with when she asks me my number.  This was already after previously asking me if I was talking to or dating any other women (which I wasn't).  I don't know my number but was on the modest side and said 5.  

The convo then turns to ""what we are"", meaning casual, exclusive, etc.  My goal is LTR and I like this woman, so I said I wish to be exclusive.  She then confesses she has a date the next night with a diff man and felt a stronger connection to him because they've spoke on the phone more than us.  I spent the next 3 mins telling her we aren't exclusive yet so I understood but I thought we had a good connection and would obviously prefer her to not go and was willing to establish exclusivity that night.

We parted ways and she called me an hour later saying I didn't seem right and claimed she told me she did not have a stronger connection with this other guy but with me and that she must've been nervous and misspoke or I didn't hear her correctly.  I am 100% sure she said the other guy as I wouldn't have spent the following 3 mins saying what I did and I think she would've caught this.  

The next night she was totally silent and only replied to me later in the evening (9pm) after saying she took her kids to volleyball and didn't reply earlier because they don't allow phones in the gym.

This seems odd to me.  If she already planned on taking her kids to the volleyball, how would she have been seeing the other man?  Do they really disallow phones in a gym?  This seems like she was seeing the other guy and didn't reply until the date was over.

My questions are simple.  First, does she sound believable?  Second, if not, should I care since we aren't exclusive yet?  I guess my issue is the potential lies after being asked if I was chatting with or seeing other women.  Seems like she was ensuring I was focusing on her when she wasn't focusing on me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n5f06c/seek_input_on_date_3_convo/
18,n5f7ea,1620219175,Hi the guy I was dating who lived 2hours away had a wife abroad!,"Hi, I got a call from the wife of a man that I was seeing who lived long distance (as per my last few posts here) this morning to say she read our texts etc (which the texts hardly say anything)  I couldnt even remember the name of the man I dated as she gave me his real name Marcu, his wife only just came to the uk with their child to visit him for 2 weeks.

1. We met on that trash site Badoo back in Jan or Feb
2. He gave me a fake name called Alex
3. By our 2nd date he moved to a new place as ""single"" guy to a 2 bedroom  flat, which should have been a red flag and him hiding his phone when I was around
4. He never said he was married oland denied having had kids, and that he got divorced 6 years back
5. He coerced me into getting physical with him which I regret wholeheartedly!
Anyway I never had much with him and emotionally I dont feel nothing for him, I could only sweetly apologise to his wife and tell her everything that had gone on and we had a good talk by phone and text too, and now she is the one left in pieces with this nightmare, she said he is unintelligent and just after sex and with her even she doesn't want nothing with him.

There are way tooo many men in London not 80% up front honest and truthful and just on the sly to get their d*cks satisfied.

This has now left me with guilt and I'm so naive as I was lonely at the time.

I have just started seeing another man recently we met on FB who is so lovely, But he had to travel home last week for 3 weeks to see his little daughter and spend time with her; now I'm thinking if his identity is 100% and can I trust him now but I know we are just relatively new together so I'm trying not to be that mad possessive hysterical woman as I wish him happiness and fun on his trip and I'm not his wife and just a recent girlfriend, so who am I to start accusing just because of something someone else has done  in my past that doesn't directly affect me now.

I'm just left with some many horrible experiences its leaving me vulnerable and fearful now and it's why I'm having commitment issues and just jumping on to OLD when I feel fearful is not how I want to be anymore with seeing one person after another,  but for my very new guy I'm trying to be honest, i have deleted my dating apps and im just prayingg that I can be in a normal situation and we be happy as normal when he is back home here again.

I went to check his profile and it disappeared, meaning he had blocked me.  Are you kidding?  What a volatile individual.  Quite laughable.  Just thought I’d share.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n63abu/got_blocked_for_not_replying_immediately/

40,n66djm,1620304953,Breaking the Ice on OLD,"Backstory: I (49 M) am going through a divorce and decided to try out an OLD site. My previous experience with OLD was twenty some years ago when I met the woman I am now divorcing. We're still friends and the divorce is amicable so I would consider my OLD experience pretty positive overall. 

So I created my profile and got some likes almost immediately. That resulted in one date which was fun but isn't going to lead to anything.  Now the likes have mostly dried up. Not sure if that is because all the potentially interested women have liked me already and I didn't reciprocate or because I rewrote my profile and it is not as appealing. 

In any case, I find I am in a position where I need to be more proactive and I am struggling with that. I've liked a few women but really have no idea how to break the ice with a message. It seems that the women I am physically attracted to have relatively basic profiles so there is no obvious topic to mention other than their appearance or proximity, both of which feel like they would be creepy.  So my question is, if there is only physical attraction to go by,  what sort of message would be appropriate to break the ice to find out if there is a deeper connection? 

Because that probably makes me sound shallow, I should clarify that I am pretty nerdy but also really into physical fitness. I'm not looking for a model, just someone who takes care of themselves and ideally has some nerdy tendencies as well. The two seem to be mutually exclusive, aside from the one woman with whom I had my only date. 

Would appreciate any feedback. I have found this subreddit really helpful so far.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n66djm/breaking_the_ice_on_old/

You have to read it to see how stupid I was. Thank you to those who gave me some excellent advice. 

Turns out my gut and intuition don't usually fail. Found out 3 weeks ago - after 6 months - that he was playing games with me and multiple women at the same time for the entirety of our time together. He had at least 3 women thinking they were also in a ""relationship"" with him - one is even married, he was cheating both emotionally and physically. I am hurt, in disbelief that a man can be this evil, and a little mad and disgusted at myself for being played, believing all his lies, and ignoring red flags. 

He broke down and cried when I found out and broke up with him. Told me he loved me but he's broken and lost his way, to give him time to go to therapy and find out why he's like that. How do cheaters have so much time and energy? He stilled called me every day and night, saw me almost every weekend, told me how he wants to build a future with me, and planned future vacations and trips together.  I don't know if I was with a narcissist, sociopath, BPD, or just a serial cheater. Everything was a lie!

Anyway, I've learned many lessons and I'm taking the time to heal myself and check the boundaries I have in place to be more discerning and aware in the future. I aim to be gracious in all I do, so I forgave him for the deception, genuinely wished him the best of luck, and went NC. If it doesn't kill you, it really does make you stronger, smarter and brings better awareness about yourself and what to avoid like a plague.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n6ah6u/update_my_34f_bf_48_m_latenight_convo_with_females/

50,n6g89l,1620331432,(Update) She Ended It,"So I have an update on my previous post about the woman I have been with for 8-9 months finishing the relationship via text.

We met last night to discuss things because I told her I didn't understand and was confused why she ended it after saying I loved her.  

She explained that it was nothing I had done, and I re-explained the reasons why I had delayed introducing her to my daughter (scared of getting hurt again after my divorce 2 years ago).  Due to us both having kids it created a period of 9 days where we were unable to see each other in person because we hadn't introduced each other to our kids yet.

We had a good talk but I still didn't understand why she wanted to finish it other than her saying she didn't feel it like I did.  I told her that I didn't expect her to say she loved me back and this isn't a reason to end the relationship.

We then kissed, cuddled for about 30 minutes and were very close to having sex.  She said maybe she needs more time and then we both stated that we are just coming into the 9 day period where we don't see each other and her feelings start to drop.  We carried on kissing and hugging.

After talking some more I asked her to tell me that she doesn't want me in her life and she couldn't.  After talking more I just asked her to tell me that this isn't what she wants and she just replied with 'Sorry'.

After that we said our goodbyes for what I assume is the last time.  I'm so confused!!! Is she confused???  Do I just leave her to it?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n6g89l/update_she_ended_it/
51,n6jkrh,1620340166,Update/looking for further advice,"I posted a handful of days back about potentially getting back together with an ex. We have texted back and forth (taking turns initiating like suggested). We’ve talked on the phone. He is taking a lot of interest in my life and vice versa.

I took a lot of the advice on here that said I should be the one to initiate anything or to push things forward/put myself out there.

I told him that I would like to work on building a solid friendship and possibly down the line if it feels right, to maybe try dating again. We talked about it a decent amount but to sum up what he said: 
he definitely wants to see me in person and while he still has strong feelings for me, he doesn’t know if he thinks we should date in the future. He also that he would not say that it’s a 100% no, just that right now he doesn’t know. He would also like to build a friendship and “take things one day at a time”.

He also said in therapy he is learning to not answer questions he doesn’t have the answers to, and I really respect that. 

I guess the advice I’m asking for is, does it sound like if I am patient and can earn back his trust in us, do I stand a chance at getting back together? Another question would be how to push the idea of seeing each other, he was the one to mention that so I would like to eventually initiate plans as friends to start.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n6jkrh/updatelooking_for_further_advice/

Early on, she said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship, and she said she wasn't good at relationships.  I developed feelings for her anyway.  At one point she also said she was developing feelings, and also that she really liked me.  But she's very guarded.  When she realized how much I felt, she said she realized how much work she needed to do on herself and wasn't ready for a relationship (due to past traumas).  She said she still enjoyed my friendship and company and would still hang out.  But it seems she has ghosted me.  I haven't heard from her in about 12 days (I had texted a couple times to check in and she didn't respond).

I've been feeling really down and sad about her saying she isn't ready for a relationship (despite saying she really likes me and apparently had feelings for me), and also now that she seems to have ghosted me.  I'm not sure why, and not sure if I had said or done anything wrong.  I'm confused and hurt, since she said she enjoyed my friendship and company.

She had added me on Facebook not too long ago, and she is still listed as a Facebook friend - so I'm not sure what that means as far as a friendship with her.  Might there be any reason to believe she would still want to communicate with me in the future?

I've been really confused, as she said she enjoyed my friendship and company, and then she has apparently ghosted me.

I felt like I had mixed messages when I was hanging out with her.  She gave me some signs that seemed like she wanted more than friendship, but at the same time, I could tell she was guarded.

A few hours ago, i just felt this pressure on my heart. I sit down and start to cry. It went for a while, and then came back, and came back. Felt more naked and naked for every tear and every small sense of trembling. Like my soul was an onion skin.

There was a sense of void, of something to miss, anguish, almost like i´m just a prisoner of time, like the past and the future are connected by emotional inertia. 

There was a sad and miserable simmetry between the fear of fall in love and possible abandonment. Standing still and being stuck in a cage of fear and regret. Not letting my heart go into being in love with someone special, when that´s what i want the most.

But there´s also other things:

I am afraid that i*´m not going to be enough*, with all these dating checklists.

I´m not an alpha. I just know in my heart that i´m just a normal guy. I´ve been always insecure. Studied Psychology, did Sports but prefer books, like to cook, things like that. It doesn´t help that i´m 6´3 and i´m black. There´s a set of expectations that i don´t fit.

And makes me afraid. I am afraid that my *openess with emotions and feelings* can be perceived as *weakness or vulnerability* for a women in their 40s.

He makes reservations ahead of time and secures the date, texts throughout the day every day, and treats me with care and respect.

He recently had to cancel our next date because of a change in childcare (expected).

I’m used to more time when dating than once a week, and if it stays that way until we are more serious, I’m currently deciding if I am interested in that.

In the meantime, I’m also curious; If he’s only seeing me once a week, even though it’s all that’s available (hypothetically) until I can be more in kids life, what has your experience been? Do you lose interest more easily? If you can’t do more day/weekend dates with more than dinner/sleepover, does it get boring? I’m wondering how things can progress to that more serious point if dates are less frequent and have less variety than I’m used to.

Thinking over my last relationship, I'm sure I did make some mistakes. However, in ""advertising"" myself online I find myself in a quandary as I don't know if I should ever mention  the fact that I have BPD and fibromyalgia.

I'm not the greatest looking guy and certainly not rolling around in cash from a good career. But I genuinely believe that I have excellent qualities. I'm strictly monogamous, I'm witty, people find me personable in general.

But, I'm anxious that the fact that I have mental health issues and the fact that I am opposed to children really limits my options. Im not sure if wading in the dating pool is a good idea for me.

70,n7ckq3,1620431820,Help! LTR from OLD that has one BIG problem,"Sorry for long post but need honest input  - harsh or not. 

Traditional 49F divorced 3.5 years in 7 month LTR w/53M.   This is both of our 1st “post divorce” relationship.  I focused on raising kids (currently ages 8, 12 &amp; 16) and had a highly contentious, 3+ year litigated divorce that had an enormous financial impact.  When I decided to begin dating last year, I was selective and thrilled when I met him as we are highly compatible, great chemistry, knew mutual parents from our kids private schools; same faith; and very kind.  I had no experience when to introduce him to kids but I needed help with carpool 3 months into our relationship and he met my kids in an impromptu visit. They adore him.  He also met a cousin.  

He told me he loved me after a week; asked me to marry him at 6 weeks &amp; again at 3 months (I laughed and told him he was crazy but reciprocated my feelings at 2 month mark). 

So what’s the issue?  He’s STILL MARRIED but separated.  He told me everything upfront, but I still went out with him.   He wasn’t even separated when I met him but seeking advice from other divorcees.  He also happened to be using same attorney my ex spouse used so I chatted with him.  We communicated for 2 weeks before meeting IRL in which time he moved out and drafted a settlement to began divorce proceedings.  When we met IRL, we were super attracted to one another and got involved underestimating the timing and duration of his divorce.  Things were great until recently....

Now his wife and him are knee deep in litigation- she hired a PI and I’m being threatened with subpoena.  I’ve never met his children or friends and feel like Angelina Jolie.  On 2 separate occasions he invited me to meet his inner circle at their vacation home then reneged on both invites.  This week I’ve become passive aggressive and have been argumentative.

Yesterday I had a drink then provoked him in a text.  I sent him a mean message insulting him and told him he was a pushover too afraid to stand up to his wife for fear of losing his marital assets. Stupid I know but I’m in love with a married man and have become “the other woman” which I cannot comprehend.  I was hoping he would come over and talk (he normally does) or be more agressive in his divorce but for the first time he pushed back and told me I was out of line and hurtful.   

Is this a train wreck?  My heart is in love but my practical side says my irrational behavior will continue as I can’t go thru another divorce &amp; I should not have gotten involved with him until post divorce.  What do i tell my kids?  I don’t want to lie but it’s a mess. My ego says it ended it last night and this was lust.  I know he wants to continue a relationship with me (why wouldn’t he? He has a mistress) but something has to change.

Don’t be afraid to put me in my place as I know I need to talk to him but I don’t want to go back to “normal.”

He seems smart and interesting and attractive. I did notice that he talked over me a bit and didn’t seem to be a great listener. I was hoping it was because he was excited or nervous and was still going to give him another date. 

Then, when he walked me to my car, he made an offhand comment about now he can delete his match.com profile. I kind of laughed and didn’t say anything.

I got home and he had, in fact, deleted his profile. Then, an hour after our date he started texting me. Just random stuff, like, what kind of music do you like? It seemed like a lot given that we had just spent three hours talking. And he texted me many, many times last night. He kept trying to push a conversation when I was taking a long time to respond and giving short responses. 

So, this is a terrible sign, right? Because whereas I felt really excited about him earlier in the evening he began to seem really desperate.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n7czy5/great_date_last_night_but/

43M and separated, working out a divorce, no chance of rekindling. 

She has Borderline Personality Disorder, it continuously got worse until she got violent and I ended things. After 11 years/3 married. 

My question is this: How do I move forward in the dating scene, whether that be OLD or real life, and avoid the same issues without being an outright asshole? “Do you have mental issues” is obviously not a kosher question for a first date, but ultimately I can’t do it again. The amount of struggle and heartache I went through in dealing with BPD makes it an absolute dealbreaker to have to do it again.  I hate to sound harsh, and I’m fresh to this (we’ve been split for 3 months now) but I just don’t see myself being comfy, confident, and trusting of the future in a relationship with someone with similar issues. 

I’m certainly not ready to begin dating again yet, but this issue is a cloud already hanging over my thoughts towards the matter.

When we were first introduced, he was in the east coast.. and I’m in the west. He initially had a plan to move to near where I am, but COVID happened. We started out with some casual texts to get to know each other.. phone calls.. facetime.. etc.. I guess the usual progression.. We got along really well from the beginning... He could really kerp the conversation going.. from small talk to more heavy topic.. I was able to open up fairly quickly. We discussed what went wrong with our previous marriage, what the expectations are in such situations.. etc.. I’ve dated few men casually after my divorce but he was the first one that I thought I’d get into some more serious relationship. We met three times in our first 8 months of knowing each other. Beginning of this year, he finally moved to near where I am, although not super close.. it’s a lot closer than cross country. After his relocation, we met at least one a week and eventually got into intimate relationship. The problem is he has ED but has some side effects to viagra and cialis. He said those side effects are temporary but he doesn’t want to deal with it. He’s confident that he can satisfy me via ‘other means’. At first I was like ok.. but now it’s becoming an issue for me. If I push him to take the medication, will that hurt his ego? I don’t know how to politely tell him that.

After finishing our &lt;2h dinner, I still took my chances and asked her if she wants to come to my place, right across the street. She says: ""**ok, but I will not be able to sleep over, because I have an early appointment tomorrow morning**"". Note that at that point we hadn't even kissed, or held hand - hadn't even touched each other.

I wasn't sure I had heard it correctly, I was a bit surprised that she'd be so transparent about the possibility of sleeping over, and that the only reason she wouldn't is logistical. Don't get me wrong - it's not that I am not used to women being attracted to me, I did have sex on first dates in the past. It's just that when that would happen, there would usually be alcohol involved, it would happen over the course of hours, and, above all, I would know that the woman is into me given how flirty she might be.

Because of my doubts, I still hesitated a very long time before getting physical, which, with hindsight, seems a bit silly. Anyhow, after I had kissed her, and we started dating for good (we've spent nearly half our time together since that first date a month ago) I asked her, and my girlfriend confirmed that this was really what she said.

I would like to lose 30-50 more pounds but I cant promise that I will or when I will. So anyone I date should like me as I am right now. No weight loss advice required. 🙏

Im not upwardly mobile in the sense that Im ok where I am  career wise and have no desire to chase a higher paid stressful position-in this field or any other.  I have the necessary credentials to do other kinds of human service or nursing work but elect to do one-on-one human services work because it allows me to develop a bond with my clients and their families and its low stress. High stress is extremely triggering for me. So I tend to avoid it.

My frustration is that despite all this I have zero luck with online dating and I only occasionally meet men IRL. I get a few responses but the men either have negative preconceived stereotypes of larger women (that we are lazy, have poor hygiene,  are easy targets for sex)  or just want sex when I only do LTR or marriage. 

Some of the men who respond are younger and I am automatically suspicious. Of their motives. Also men who ask when they can (come see me) or want me to come see them at their home and not in a public place are blocked because I assume they are looking for easy sex which they wont get from me.

89,n7yb3o,1620507378,How would you feel if this happened to you?,"This is a true story... it happened last Tuesday. 

I know a post op trans woman, she came out as trans three years ago. She lived as a man for 30 some odd years.  She has had two surgeries, FFS and bottom surgery last fall. She completely passes as a woman and has been taking hormones for three years. I have seen the equipment downstairs and it is very realistic. 

It's been months since her surgery, she has started online dating. I am happy for her, and encouraged her to meet someone nice. 

Here is the problem...

Last Tuesday she hooked up with a man from Tinder and DID NOT tell him that she is trans. I asked her if she told him, she said 'no' but didn't care because she wanted to 'loose her virginity'. He was the first guy she slept with after bottom surgery. 

I know we hear 'trans women are women', and from that perspective a crime didn't occur. 

**Argument One**: A lot of people get sex via deception by omission, the law can't remedy every single wrong one commits against another. It is illegal to get sex by fraud, or even by impersonating a celebrity. 

Many of us would not have slept with someone if we had known certain things about them, and they keep secrets to get sex. 

**Argument Two**: This is a sex crime and should be prosecuted as such. If one is guarding secret information that would be crucial for an individual to make an informed decision whether or not to engage in sex, that rises to the level of sexual assault.

Hopefully we can agree what she did was morally wrong. Was it illegal? Should it be illegal? Can we blame the victim for not doing his due diligence before sleeping with someone?

I know that according to the law, if you have an STD you must disclose before sleeping with the person. If however, one is HIV positive, undetectable and doesn't transmit the virus to anyone can/should they be prosecuted for failing to disclose? Lets say the partner didn't contract HIV, by they are traumatized to learn someone they were sleeping with knew they had it and failed to disclose. How is that  trauma ""different"" from the trauma of finding out you've been sleeping with a post-op transwoman whom, 'accidentally on purpose' didn't disclose because she wanted to lose her virginity? 

This entire situation is so epically screwed up, I do not know what to do, think or say about it.

99,n8b6ms,1620554745,Ugh. I feel disrespected. Am I the crazy one or am I being gaslit?,"So, seeking some wisdom here. 

**TLDR: GF is spending time with a recent ex in a way that I feel is disrespectful of our relationship.**

My (51 M) GF (49 F) and I have been dating just over 2 years now. We live about 80 miles apart, and because of job and family situations that’s not likely to change anytime soon. We had a messy breakup last November, and we decided to get back together in March. We try to see each other in person once or twice a week, text pretty constantly, and talk on the phone a lot.

The breakup was triggered by differing opinions on parenting styles (I have kids, she does not), and she ended up getting into a heated argument with my teenage son who lives with me. During the breakup, I moved on (too) quickly and began dating immediately. When we got back together, I completely cut ties, blocked and deleted the person I had been dating. Her words at the time were “if I catch you talking to anyone we’re done”.

She waited a couple of months after the breakup and started seeing someone (call him Joe) who lives about a half mile away from her. It started as mutual support, and eventually they started dating and had sex. She says that she dated him even though she didn’t see it going anywhere. I don’t judge her for dating him, but after we got back together she wanted to keep him as a friend.

So…the problem I need advice on is that she still spends time with Joe at night, and these things often come together without any advance notice or planning.

I absolutely think that women and men can be friends, even exes and past sex partners. I also think that even in a relationship, you should get to choose who your friends are. I don’t mind her being friends with Joe, but I do have a higher sense of awareness about people I know are exes and past sex partners, especially recent ones who are not deeply embedded in her friend group. With men who fit in that category, I feel very strongly that they need to be people we see together, that she sees in group activities, or if she spends one on one time it should be in public and daytime/early evening hours, and sleepovers should be out of bounds.

While they were dating, she had pushed Joe to apply for a promotion at work. Last month, he was selected for the promotion and as part of that, he was moving to a different branch office in the same metro. His coworkers wanted to take him out to celebrate, and he had invited her as his guest. She agreed, and I had a real problem with the idea and insisted she not go. My issue was that her only connection to the event at a bar she didn’t like and coworkers she didn’t know was him, and I felt it wasn’t appropriate. She wound up not going, but she felt like she should have been there for him in his moment, and wasn’t happy. From what I hear, this turned into a late evening, past midnight, and he got very drunk. All of which reinforced my thinking about the issue, that it wasn’t just a work celebration and better that she’s not part of it.

Worth noting that I did not like feeling like I controlled this. We've talked about him extensively over the last few weeks, I'm OK with him being her friend. I just think it needs to be a more casual, arms-length thing for now since it's so recent.

Last weekend, she had been out with one of her best (female) friends drinking, and continued when they got home. Somehow she ended up talking with him, and he ended up drinking with them at her apartment. It didn’t go well, he got kind of stupid and belligerent and hitting on her friend. She had to walk to his apartment after 1 AM to check on him, since he insisted on driving himself home drunk. Then she had to spend two hours there calming him down. He’s been apologizing to both of them all week.

So this weekend, I had spent the night with her Friday and came home Saturday morning. We’ve been texting all afternoon and talked a couple of times, a pretty normal day. Around 10:30 PM Saturday she told me she was going for a walk. I had to pick up my son from an event, and I got home around 11:30 PM. She texts me then that she walked over to Joe’s and they’re watching TV with his son. I felt misled by this…how does a normal fitness walk end up with her there? I called her a little after midnight while she was still there and talked for a few minutes. She said she was going to leave and walk home soon. I haven’t heard anything since. Text messages, even those sent before talking on the phone are unread. Now my anxiety is up and I'm losing sleep over it.

The thing is, I actually do trust her. I don’t want to control her. I don’t think it’s my place, and I also don’t think it’s my place to issue anything resembling an ultimatum. I don’t need to know her movements or activity 24/7. I don’t think I’m jealous of Joe, but I feel like her actions with him are disrespectful of our relationship. Am I right to feel this way, or am I way out of bounds?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n8b6ms/ugh_i_feel_disrespected_am_i_the_crazy_one_or_am/
