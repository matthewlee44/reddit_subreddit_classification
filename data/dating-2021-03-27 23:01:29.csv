I have noticed in many of my interactions with women on dating apps that no matter how the convo has been going as soon as I mention the idea of actually meeting up I get ghosted and never hear back. 

I understand that there is a lot of self confidence boosting and just wanting the attention going on with dating apps, both among men and women, but it‚Äôs usually pretty clear when they are just doing it for those reasons and dont actually want to date based on the flow of conversation. 

What am I curious about more specifically is where you are having a great conversation and both sides are clearly trying to get to know each other more but then if I actually ask to meet, which is supposed to be the whole point, then I get ghosted. Maybe it‚Äôs still just for the attention but I don‚Äôt know why someone would put in that much effort to communicate if they aren‚Äôt interested and if they are interested then why they would not want to hang out.

10,mev61d,1616908744,"My looks don't match my personality at all, does this hurt me in dating?","I am a nerd, straight up no question about it. I love anime, fantasy novels, manga, comics, video games, D&amp;D, MTG, cosplay, and other such things. This is a big part of my personality and deep down I consider myself a kid at heart. 

However, my looks do not match my personality at all. I'm kind of a bigger guy, not fat or super ripped just naturally larger than many, especially larger than most I know with similar interests. I'm not sure if I'm explaining that right, like I'm not super tall just...stocky I guess is the right word? Also I look older than I am, my face has a naturally unfriendly look when I'm not smiling. My eyes...seriously my eyes look dead. When I met my group of D&amp;D players it was at a convention and I was wearing a mask, my DM told me months later if he had seen my face he would never have invited me over as he would've been too intimidated. I recently shaved my head but kept my beard, experimenting, always wanted to try the ''Walter White''. I've been told by most I look like a biker now and scary. 

Don't misunderstand, I'm not putting myself down. I like the way I look, I actually find it interesting perhaps even funny that my child at heart self has a naturally intimidating look. I even think my dead eyes are distinguished looking. What I'm wondering is how this will effect me in dating or even in finding friends. Because my looks are so drastically different than my personality, will this make finding someone I'd be compatible with difficult?

This guy (m/27) replies to me (f/27) right away, we have overly flirtatious conversations but after some back and forth, he always stops responding then replies to my last message after 2-3 days or the following day. Most of the time he replies with 7-8 messages in a row and lots of emojis. He seems to enjoy my texting from his enthusiastic responses and pictures of himself that he sends me in between but once I start replying back he texts some more and then doesn't respond for couple of hours to few days. He is actually engaging in his replies never boring or short sided and always mentions that we should get together again soon (met once and had sex, he lives two hours away) and one time opened up how staying constantly in touch actually bothers him cause it only makes him want me more while its hard to meet even on weekends cause none of us has a car and we are working all the time or making other plans. So far none has asked each other for a second date explicitly only dropping hints at each other. Lately he has been telling me that he missed me and can't stop thinking about me (this is always when we don't talk.for.few days) texting me ""baby"" in almost every sentence. One time he didn't reply for a day because he said he was getting carried away with messaging and was hard to concentrate on his work a whole week cause he kept daydreaming about our sex and the time we spent together. What do I do with this? He gets me off guard when he replies after some hours cause I always feel that this is my last message to him (since I was expecting him to ghost me after sex but kept replying albeit late).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mev8vb/guy_replies_late_but_keeps_flirting/

We've also been texting back and forth. She likes to text me every morning before work just to see how I'm doing. That's nice. We finally went out yesterday. Thankfully, she looked so much more attractive than she did in the photo she sent me (and it was her natural look, not tons of makeup). 

She's extremely quiet. We went to Friendly's and I did most of the talking. She did talk and laugh but I had to come up with topics. At least everything flowed well. She's like me in that she doesn't really do anything, she just sits home and watches TV like I sit at home and play video games. She has a son but he's grown up and not really around so I'm not getting involved with someone else's little kid.

After Friendly's we went to miniature golf and had a lot of fun. Again, I had to drive the conversation. I don't mind or anything though. She kind of just lets me do everything. I paid just because I feel like the man is obligated to pay. She didn't say thank you, but I think it was more of just being ignorant of socialization or something because she at least seemed to appreciate it.

And she wants to go out again. I don't know if these are dates to her or just ""this guy takes me places and pays so I'm game."" Her mom knows we both need someone and we both know it too. We'll see what happens. At least with her she lets me take charge and that feels awesome.

23,mewbd7,1616914273,Bad First Date: What I‚Äôve Learned,"Hello everyone! 23M here and just went on a first date, three months after a breakup from a serious relationship. Unfortunately, it did not go as well as I expected it to be, but it was a really good learning experience. Here are some things that I learned from this date, that I think all should keep in mind!

1) Do NOT get too emotionally invested in a person!My date and I met through Bumble, and what I‚Äôve learned was that texting and meeting up in person are two different things. What attracted me to this girl the most from the beginning was how well we communicated with one another, and how much we had in common. We were both goal driven and shared a lot of similar viewpoints on life and morals. She also seemed like a very mature person and our texting game was on point. We texted pretty much everyday for a week, up until our date (I do not recommend doing this!). Once the date came, vibes were completely off almost immediately. She felt too ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù from the beginning, and the date felt too tense and too much like an interview. She was asking me questions - I answered, and asked some back. However, it felt so unnatural and forced, as if we were talking just to avoid awkward silences. I could tell that we lacked chemistry and we were not as compatible as I thought we would be. Texting her felt like a completely different person, as opposed to meeting her in person.

2) Meet up somewhere were both of you could have fun, perhaps an activity! We met at a rose garden and sat and talked on a picnic blanket, which is fine - again however, the date felt too ‚Äúinterview-y‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt as enjoyable as I thought it would be. Personally, I think it would‚Äôve went been better if we went to do an activity were we could have fun together and ease up, such as mini golf, arcade, etc.

3) Make intentions clear, the moment you guys begin talking! I was under the impression that she in the long run, wanted a relationship - and so did I. However, as we were talking, I started to notice a bit of a red flag. She referred to her ex-boyfriend as her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù twice, throughout our conversation. I found it odd, perhaps she wasn‚Äôt over him and was looking for a fling? Or maybe she was cheating on him? It began to have me question her intentions with me, which I should‚Äôve made clear the moment we started talking.

4) Last but not least, hang in there and be patient! This date ended up being a letdown. We got food after the rose garden, and we were planning to do something else after. However, as we were leaving the restaurant, she got a ‚Äúphone call‚Äù from her friend who claimed to ‚Äúbe stranded and needed a ride‚Äù (the convo between them sounded so fake too). My date asked me if it was fine to call of the date early to pick up her friend. I already knew this was BS and that she probably felt the same incompatibility I was feeling. Not going to lie it hurt, but at the end of it all, I realized that she wasn‚Äôt the one (perhaps I even dodged a bullet with the ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù thing?). It sucks because she was really pretty and through text she seemed amazing - however, this goes back to what I said about texting and meeting in person being two different things. As I am writing this, I still feel hurt and bummed out, since I spent a week texting and trying to get to know her. I had too much hope, thinking that things would go flawlessly. But even if your date is a dud, hang in there, and try again! Take time to reflect, and take it as a learning experience to better yourself for the next one. 

Im going to take a couple weeks off - maybe a month or two from dating. Just be patient and at the end of the day, there is someone there for all of us :)

32,mexg6u,1616920069,Dating apps dehumanise have people,"I‚Äôve thought a lot recently about my experiences on dating apps. It occurred to me from observing men that I‚Äôve went on dates with they are used to using dating apps as easy and free sex and dehumanising me straight away.

I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I‚Äôm looking for - healthy relationship and I‚Äôm comfortably single and just browsing at the moment for the best for for match for me. 

Quick example : met a guy from a dating app who seemed like a decent man but I always felt he was in a rush. Two dates in he asks me back to his for drinks and I decline as we live in a major city and I‚Äôd rather go to a cool bar. You could tell his patience is wearing thin and he flat out said to me ‚Äúlook it‚Äôs a dating app- when are we going to have sex.‚Äù Basically confirming my gut feeling that he was only listening to me and hanging around for sex. He also said ‚Äúif we wait - what if it‚Äôs not good.‚Äù I said look , if you want to know me as a person and let things develop naturally I‚Äôm happy to keep seeing you and as expected I was ghosted a few days later. It was disappointing because I couldn‚Äôt help but feel we would get on if we met offline and we had a lot more to explore there for sure. Very intelligent man aswell. 

Found this with other men to some degree where as soon as they sense there‚Äôs no quick sex - they are off and anything else about me they claim to be interested in seems to drop off a cliff. 

So my new tactic , I‚Äôm humanising my experience by myself by showing that although I am a female - I have a lot more to offer than what‚Äôs between my legs and go on dates being my full human self. If guys are half listening , in a rush , pressuring for sex after 2 dates then it weeds out those not really in it for me . (Personal opinion but that‚Äôs ridiculous sorry.)

We only have one life and to be treating each other like this is ridiculous but also no one will find true connection. From my experience . I think dating apps are melting our brains a bit so stay alert out there to both women and men. 

If you are just looking for hookups I‚Äôm not judging but there‚Äôs a lot of people out there looking for true connection so just incase this helps anyone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mexg6u/dating_apps_dehumanise_have_people/
33,mexhzm,1616920324,Cutting straight to the chase? Good idea?,"(Wasn't sure whether to post this in r/sex or r/dating)

So I'm 22F and I just got out of a long term relationship and I am so excited to not date seriously and just have fun and sleep around (in a safe and respectful way of course). 

So I met this guy, friend of a friend, we got drinks and the chemistry was there. He actually asked to be friends with benefits with me when I was freshly out of my relationship, but I wasn't ready so I said no. And I guess I am a bit worried that me saying no the first time might have changed his mind about me.

I should be meeting him later this week to hang out and I was planning to just flirt with him and see where things went, but now I am realising that I could just message or call him and say 'Hey, I thought you were really attractive when I met you and I would like to hook up with you"" instead of wasting time, money and energy wondering whether or not we will end up doing anything.

Also, if I am straightforward and he declines, then I can just let this go and focus on meeting other guys.

What do you think? Fool proof plan? I think I just need a bit of encouragement. I'm not too scared about coming on too strong because I don't want to date him and if it scares him off, then oh well, plenty of other guys to meet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mexhzm/cutting_straight_to_the_chase_good_idea/
34,mexmh2,1616920954,I may be getting rejected for the first time in 10 yrs,"I (33f) was with my ex for 6 years, separated for 4 years. Recently finally decided to get a divorce (not yet) and started dating. 

Met this guy (31m) on Bumble. We met a few days after we matched, had sex. Met a few times after that. He's still in grad school for his PhD (graduating in a few months), he has roommates, so we always meet at my place. I think we have good, informed conversations about topics we're both interested in. We share some banters. He's tall, intelligent and confident, which is totally my type. He asked once about what I'm looking for on dating apps, and what I think about those keep shopping even after establishing exclusivity. I thought it was a good sign.

The thing is he hardly contacts me. If I don't initiate a conversation he will only text me every 3 or 4 days. Last time we met on Wednesday and I haven't heard from him since. Called him on Saturday morning trying to see if he wanted to hang out on Sunday. He didn't pick up, nor did he call back or text the whole day. 

I actually wanted to talk about his expectations of our relationship, if it counts as one, and where it's heading down the road and stuff. Because I'm starting to get attached, if he doesn't feel the same way I want to end things now. 

I'm good looking and intelligent, if I actively swipe on bumble I'd at least get a couple matches daily. And I can tell he enjoys spending time with me. But since he doesn't text me much I guess he just wants to be FWB. And from what I gather when women ask men to ""define the relationship"" it never ends good.

So yeah, may be getting rejected in 10 years. It sucks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mexmh2/i_may_be_getting_rejected_for_the_first_time_in/

I‚Äôve broken up with him twice and the last time I broke up with him was over a year ago. I care for him a lot and know he loves me. I do love him but  it hurts me that he is taking so long to figure his life out. When I started dating him it was a long distance relationship and he was making great money in aerial photography and for the best 2 years he has been living at his parents house barely scraping by on doing yard work for them 20 hours a week while I pay to live on my own. I have been patient and encouraging him to succeed and he is just taking his sweet time to figure things out and missing opportunities. I am a single mother to a a 5 year old and it‚Äôs been a tough year with home schooling, and trying to give my kid everything when living in a one bedroom studio apartment. I was able to get out of that situation and bought my self a house recently in a good neighborhood for my kid. I‚Äôm angry that he says he loves me but pissed away like 20k since quiting his good job to live off of and seeing me struggle. I wanted this house to be with him I wanted everything to be with him because he‚Äôs my partner and he‚Äôs missed opportunities because he‚Äôs never prepared. Last night was the final straw. I have barely seen any friends since the pandemic started and have lost a lot of will for most things. we ran into some coworkers I have been working remotely with and Having a good time. On the car ride home, he‚Äôs cold and distant and I ask him what‚Äôs wrong and doesn‚Äôt answer, I‚Äôm goofing off and he‚Äôs being serious. Then I ask him and he tells me I‚Äôm ignoring him. Ok I‚Äôm pissed now. I tell him I‚Äôm angry and I tell him I don‚Äôt like his micro aggressions and that it‚Äôs normal for things to happen in situations that are unplanned and he shouldn‚Äôt have said anything. I tell him to leave because I‚Äôm mad,  I don‚Äôt want to talk about it or hear what he has to say because I‚Äôm just really over feeling like shit. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression and I think a lot of it comes from him not having his shit together and sucking up all my time. I recently did go out with a few friend and felt much better about my self. I know a lack of human connection is what my mental issue has been. He won‚Äôt leave my house and let me cool down so I literally just through all my feelings out there and I‚Äôm not super nice about it. I don‚Äôt say mean things to be an asshole I say them because I‚Äôm fed up. I do feel like a jerk but I also feel disrespected that he didn‚Äôt leave. He asked me if we were breaking up. I said I don‚Äôt know I needed time because I‚Äôm mad. I admit my biggest issue is anger. I go zero to 10 and often when I ask for space I don‚Äôt get it and then flip out. I really try not to be this crazy angry person but I am angry that I have put so much trust and support into this relationship and it‚Äôs not functioning on pretty much most levels.

44,meyntv,1616926055,New Relationship Advice,"Hello, 

TL:DR; Relationship since Nov/Dec, 6 dates in and things suddenly slow, been over a month since last date but still talk daily. Strung along or just taking things slow?


I‚Äôve (M31) been dating a girl (F27) since November/December and it was going really well at the outset. We really clicked and text most of everyday, the 1st date was awkward (as we both were nervous) but went very well and subsequently seen each other 5 times more. 

Little background; She is a single mom, with the dad having the child (5) every other weekend. She is an one on one teaching assistant and she is studying to become a full time teacher. So understandably I have to work around her more often than not as her schedule is very busy. 

Our texts were flirty and cute, compliments flying both ways and looking forward to our next meeting. Obviously there has been a global pandemic so with the UK going in and out of lockdown it‚Äôs been extra hard to see each other but nevertheless we managed to see each other 6 times, the last being Valentines Day where we had our 1st time. 

Since then the relationship seems to have been slowed by her, the texts have been less frequent (though still everyday) and that cuteness/flintiness has disappeared. Feels more like a friendship but I have made my intentions clear to her. I also said I understand she is busy and I‚Äôm willing to wait until she is not and we can go out (COVID pending) to restaurants etc. I got an acknowledgment that it is hard having a relationship over text and ‚Äúwe will just see what happens when life is more normal‚Äù. So she‚Äôs not shut it down but also not gave me reassurance. One friend thinks she‚Äôs stringing me along, another thinks she is genuinely busy and overwhelmed (she has mentioned this ) by her busy schedule and life. 

It‚Äôs now the end of March and I‚Äôve suggested we doing something over Easter, she said she should be free but it‚Äôs her weekend with her child so will have to sort something. 

So my question is... am I being strung along? Or am I expecting too much from a new Relationship as we are not officially BF/GF. Previously she has mentioned there is no rush, so I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs taking it steady and maybe was going too fast for her so she‚Äôs pumped the brakes. 

Any advice is welcome, if you want any more details or specifics just drop me a message, rather not leave them in the comments.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/meyntv/new_relationship_advice/

46,meyqtb,1616926465,How do I heal from this?,"I‚Äôm on a healing journey. However there‚Äôs something that happened back in highschool that I can‚Äôt seem to move past. 

My bestfriend (at the time) set me up with her ex who she dated in year 10 for like two weeks. It was ‚Äúunserious‚Äù to the extent where they even joked that ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt count and they never even dated‚Äù. 

In year 12 when I turned 16 him and I started dating seriously. It was tough because my parents believe in arranged marriage and so we had to constantly sneak around and couldn‚Äôt see each other very often. Three months into the relationship he told me he still had feelings for her. It broke me but I decided to push past it and continued dating him. 

They would often be texting online while him and I were talking. She would tell him things about her boyfriend at the time that she would refuse to discuss with me, but she knew everything about my relationship. She would do flirty things like getting him to feel her legs after she shaved, or he wouldn‚Äôt share drinks with me and would drink straight from something she had drank from. 

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Him and I got distant and we had an explosive fight where I said he can either choose me or her. We came to an understanding but she pushed me into breaking up with him.

She became incredibly distant and selfish after this. She would go on about how he called her pretty and she melted. She broke up with her boyfriend. About six months later, they were dating. I caught them at the school musical, holding hands and they acted like I‚Äôd just caught them committing a crime.

I unfriended them and tried to move on. Everyone sees their ex‚Äôs new relationship go to shit, but I wasnt so fortunate. Three years after highschool ended, one of my friends texted me telling me that they were engaged. Engaged. The wedding is soon- I‚Äôm in touch with a lot of people from highschool so no matter how much I try to avoid it people do bring it up.

Idk how to heal from this. It‚Äôs been so long. But I want to destroy their wedding. I want to cut her dress to pieces. I want to batista bomb their wedding cake. I want to tell the priest he‚Äôs got the date wrong and have him not show up.

When I finally talked to her about it days after, she said she didn‚Äôt think it was that big of a deal and apologized. Am I just insecure or overreacting?

This latest girl wrote me super long messages and seemed excited about our shared interests and then suddenly.. unmatched. Im never saying anything rude  and im just being myself really. The conversations are also alloways about something different, its not like i just ask the same boring questions. What am I doing wrong?

53,mf0bhu,1616933605,Asking out IRL if much more shallower than OLD,"There is some concept that OLD is shallow and ""meat shop"" because you like people only by their look. The same concept have a nostalgic story about men hitting on woman IRL like bars, gyms, etc.

If you think about it hitting on women in IRL is way more shallower than OLD. You start to talk to a woman only because she is hot, that's is. You don't know her name, age, preferences, bio, nothing. Just her look and maybe you can speculate something from the context of where you see her. In OLD you do have this info, it's not only the looks. 

If anything is a meat shop is hitting on women in the bar. Its literally a meat shop because you know nothing about her except if she is hot or not to you.

The reason people feel OLD is meat shop is because people can hide behind chats and say thing that would not say in IRL but if you judge the way people choose partners then OLD is not a meat shop at all comparing to real life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf0bhu/asking_out_irl_if_much_more_shallower_than_old/

65,mf22mp,1616942585,"I like him, but resent him at the same time.","Hello everyone, 

So I met this guy last year and we had a lot of fun together. We met, had sex, took a trip together, it was great. We were never really ""dating"" I guess and didn't have labels. Yet, we still texted everyday. 

Long story short, he started being a d*** and cancelling on plans (that he made), and I decided to be done with him. Fast forward about five or so months, he texts me out of the blue apologizing for the way he treated me. 

I wanted to ignore him, but I decided to get some clarity. He told me he was going through a rough time back then, and that he'd quit drinking and basically living a better life now and said it'd be good to meet again. 

Fast forward about a month, I let him back into my life and we met (had sex) once and haven't seen each other in a few weeks but we still talk daily. 

My problem is, I have been thinking about how much happier and less lonely I felt before we reconnected. On top of that, I feel the negative emotions from before coming back again of waiting for his messages, yet being petty and ignoring his if he took a long time to reply to me. Sometimes I don't care, othertimes it gets to me! Also, I realized having sex with him isn't very fun. 

Basically, I'm feeling a lot of unhealthy things and I don't know why. When I think about him at times, I feel happy and glad that he's back in my life. Other times, I wish he wasn't back and that I didn't have to think about him or feel anxiety waiting for his texts. He's been open with communicating and (I assume, honest) with me, but I don't know. 

I feel like we're still in that in-between of not really dating, but not quite ""friends"" and it's weird. I don't think I want to just be friends with him, nor do I think calling him my boyfriend would make things better. Part of me wants to get him upset so he decides to stop talking to me and we can just be done with it, but part of me feels sad thinking about losing him. 

Can anyone please give me some advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf22mp/i_like_him_but_resent_him_at_the_same_time/

Theres this guy though, a friend she has had since highschool. Incredibly good looking dude, fun to be with.. also kind of a douchebag but that is irrelevant. Recently, my gf admitted to me that this was someone she gave a blowjob too right before we started seeing eachother. she said they didn't have sex, and was drunk and it happened. I don't really have a problem with that, but I am starting to get the impression that she has unresolved or complicated feelings for this guy (Oh, he went to prison for two years if thats worth mentioning). This guy is in a very serious relationship that has developed over the same timeframe as mine and my gf's, and I feel like that is really what is keeping her emotions at bay. We went over to his place last night with some friends, and my girlfriend would lie on my chest and literally just stare at him for minutes, when he wasn't talking, and other people were engaging the group. There was even a time he called her out of the room alone for roughly five minutes before they came back.

She is constantly inviting him to events, in a way she doesn't with other friends. Looking for any reason to go do whatever he is doing etc. When the whole group wanted to leave last night she asked if we could stay so she could hang out with him, because they haven't seen eachother in a while. at surface level thats reasonable, but it felt wrong. 

When he facetimes her, she leaves the room, when he texts her, she turns her phone away. the crazy thing is I dont think she is physically cheating on me... I don't even think she would. But i do feel like i am being emotionally cheated on, and that if he wasn't in a relationship with this supermodel babe, he could get her to be unfaithful.

I think she knows in her heart she could never date this guy, with all of his baggage... not to mention his outrageously high body count which i know does not sit well with her. 

My gut tells me she at least had a modicum of feelings for this man, and think in her perfect world she could be with him and not me. 

I dont know how to handle this. I'm incredibly lonely outside of this relationship and even though I feel like breaking up is what I will be suggested to do... I'm so afraid to retreat back into my old lifestlyle.

My questions are -- 1. Do you think she has feelings for him/is it possible for two people to have that kind of history and genuinely be platonic 2. Is this worth breaking up over. 3. Do i even address the issue and risk coming off as weak and paranoid, which i know from past relationships just erodes chemistry and attraction..

So basically I‚Äôve been seeing this girl for about a month and a half now, everything‚Äôs been brilliant. She‚Äôs shown a lot of interest and we‚Äôve basically just clicked. She‚Äôs usually confident, she likes to compliment me and she seems very interested.

I said I want to take things quite slow as she seemed very openly sexual at first. On the 3rd date I kissed her, it was a really good kiss and she said I was a good kisser. But then was distant for a bit, but was back to normal after that. 

Then on the last date we went on, everything was normal and chill. She was really enjoying herself constantly laughing at me, I was a lot more confident this time than usual, because I was comfortable with her. She kept flirting with me, putting her legs on my thighs etc. 

We carried on walking and talking went to a place that was quite secluded, then we was just chilling cuddling and flirting. But she wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact with me and seemed very closed and anxious. Then she apologised for being frigid and I said ‚Äòit‚Äôs okay don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äô. So I said we can take it as slow as you want. 

She then said she didn‚Äôt want to kiss me, because she was scared she was going to mess it up. Then proceeded to tell me she likes me a lot more now, which was why she was anxious. Which is great and I‚Äôm fine with. 

However, she‚Äôs meant to be coming to my house next week. She seemed really sexual over the phone, so it‚Äôs come as a bit of a shock to me to be honest. As I thought I‚Äôd be the more frigid one. Is there anything I can do to help her maybe feel a little bit more at ease? 

I‚Äôm not planning on doing anything sexual with her, but maybe just to help calm her anxiety a little bit.

83,mf3vno,1616947940,How I learned I was ready to move on,"I spent most of last night on a call playing a game with a unimate. Somewhat with the intent of romance or just connecting, but it was really eye opening. They asked me about my ex since a friend mentioned we recently ended it. 

To summarize, my former partner when we first met was a man, they changed their gender identity a year or so into the relationship. They told me over text first, which was fine, but I never felt quite sure on how I felt about it. I accepted them but I did have some questions I never asked since I felt it might harm them and it's a delicate subject I don't think I could've handled with the care it needed. I didn't understand the identity because there's no solid definition for it, it's self defined and that's fine. 

I became distant from him after this, I lost all attraction for him. I respected him enough to use the pronouns he wanted (he and they), I still talked to him but it was different. I couldn't think of him as a boyfriend really, and I was confused. I looked it up and in general LGBT+ people question their identity for a long time in the sense they always know they might be who they are. I feel I was wrong to have felt iffy on if he did know he was questioning or not and never revealed that to me when we were dating at any point before he came out. The important thing is that those things are complicated and for some people it can be a sudden discovery of themselves. 


The person I was talking to we've known one another for a while since we go to the same uni. He told me something that really astonished me that I wasn't in a relationship for as long as I thought I was. That the day my ex partner changed their identity, I wasn't emotionally, mentally, or physically in one with them anymore. 


I feel bad because, when I was in high school I had a girlfriend for a bit as she was my only and best friend while I was questioning. We were able to keep in contact immediately after the breakup since nothing bad happened and she also knew I might not be gay like her. I think the different feeling is I didn't feel pressured with her to ever stay. I didn't feel like even though she also had mental conditions, they weren't newly diagnosed like my recent ex. I had to think about my sexuality when he first did and I realized I'm only attracted sexually and romantically to people who identify themselves as men, regardless of their sex at birth and I always have. 


I also realized and questioned if it was right for me to be so avoidant. The answer is no, even though I believed I was preventing mental harm because it's normal for people to delay breakups for life events as to not add on stress.  I realize I became so conflict avoidant due to my ex and I having so many arguments that I never wanted to ask questions or say anything. I didn't want to even really see them and I'd rather do a third job than be around them. 

The answer is no, I shouldn't be avoidant. My avoidance isn't inherent, it was due to a bad time in his life. The person I talked to last night knew me before corona and mentioned he liked me due to me smiling and waving at him when we passed by on campus, for me being fine with inviting him to study or even messaging hello first as he's painfully shy. I was never an extrovert but I'm a loving introvert. We talked for hours and he got out of a relationship a year ago since his girlfriend wanted him to live in kr. His was hectic too since he also became avoidant towards her for trying to get him to move back when he didn't want to.

84,mf3zcx,1616948239,Should I clarify I meant to ask her out on a date?,"Hey guys,

There's this girl that I met country swing dancing about a week and a half ago. I saw her again yesterday, danced and talked with her a couple times throughout the night, and asked her if she wanted to do something outside of the dance. She said yes and I got her number, but my problem is that I'm not sure how she interpreted my question. My phrasing was almost exactly 'Want to do something outside of the dance?' like I mentioned before but am unsure if she might've taken that as a friendly invitation to hangout rather than a date.

What would be the best way of clarifying that I'm asking her out on a date? Would it be awkward to text 'Want to go to a kickboxing class, get something to eat after, and call it a date?'

Normally I would specify in the question that I'm asking someone out on a date, but it's been over a year since the last time I asked someone out in person so I just forgot the right way to go about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf3zcx/should_i_clarify_i_meant_to_ask_her_out_on_a_date/

90,mf4eaf,1616949490,don‚Äôt even know anymore,"This is gonna be super long. 

I don‚Äôt like putting my business on social media usually because I know my perspective is unique and i know describing it to others may seem unreasonable but I‚Äôm completely out of options. 

Met this dude on tinder, we got along so great, people even described us as the same person but a different gender. Shit was going great, dude wanted to commit, covid happened, relationship was put on a halt. We didn‚Äôt know where we were and we didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd survive. It was me waiting for him. I lived alone and got attached and wanted the relationship to work. The guy was so confused over what he wanted because he was afraid of commitment and afraid of getting hurt since his mental health went to shit because of covid too. He apparently wasn‚Äôt over a girl in the past and I even caught him flirting with some random Instagram influencers. 

I never said anything for the longest because while we agreed we were committed, we had no label. Over time he got better, he ended up labelling the rship, and made an entire 360 degree turn because he knew he wasn‚Äôt doing enough. Unfortunately because he had already taken such a big hold on my mental health, I‚Äôm finding it hard to forgive him for the past. I felt like I did a lot for him and put in chunks of effort that went unmatched. I want to forgive him for myself, so I can move on from his past poor behaviour. 

Fast forward to a month later after labeling rship, he confessed he loved me. He became super supportive and takes lots of care of me. Frequently hosts me after he moved out of his parents‚Äô house and into his own apartment. Cooks for me, showers me with endless compliments, does everything that made me happy. Even got me a freaking monitor so I could play video games at home, along with a keyboard, mouse and speakers. Met the parents and extended family at Christmas. Dude wants to marry me too, it‚Äôs kinda amazing. Puts in tons of effort now, still kinda crap at communicating sometimes but it‚Äôs okay, he‚Äôs improving. 

Unfortunately I‚Äôve always feel like it‚Äôs not enough to help me get over the past. He hurt me a lot. I ended up checking his phone (admittedly this was extremely wrong of me to do) 2 weeks ago and found out he asked someone for nudes back when rship wasn‚Äôt working out. I also saw him flirting w some random girl too. Absolutely gutted me and I‚Äôm not over it at all. Every time I‚Äôm alone, all the depression, anxiety and insecurities come right back. What did he do to me? I yelled at him and he couldn‚Äôt remember what he did because he was apparently drunk and that fogged his memory, but he said he believed me, he didn‚Äôt try to prove me wrong or gaslight me or deny at all, he outright apologized and I know he‚Äôs doing more to make up for his mistakes. But these mistakes are so grave and they‚Äôve shot me back in the past again. 

I‚Äôm so hurt, you guys. I want to move on. It‚Äôs been a whole ass year. I‚Äôm supposed to be okay now, why am I not? I‚Äôm on therapy too and I‚Äôm trying to work on this so I don‚Äôt end up resenting him. I refuse to leave him because I‚Äôm stupidly in love with the guy, and I know he is with me too because of how often everyone around me (including him) tell me so. But there‚Äôs so many triggers I have because of him. And my trust in him has depleted so much. 

He‚Äôs loyal and he has never physically cheated on me; I don‚Äôt think he will either. But damn it I‚Äôm so mad at him. He knows he hurt me and has given a verbal apology several times AND changed behaviour. So what‚Äôs stopping me from forgiving him? What should I even do? I feel so alone in this struggle, a lot of people are supporting me but no one I know has been through this type of thing so I feel like I‚Äôm all alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf4eaf/dont_even_know_anymore/
91,mf4njk,1616950239,My first Tinder date,"I'm a woman in my mid 20s and I matched with a cute guy who's a few years older than me. We had good conversations, had a lot of things in common, and went on a date 2 days later. It was fun and I thought it went well. We talked about our past relationships, connected over other things, and had some meaningful discussions. Turns out I'm totally his type. His relationships tend to last over a year, which I thought was a good sign as opposed to guy who just hooks all the time. He told me he normally doesn't have sex on first date, which I was fine with. I wasn't even expecting to have sex either. Well, we ended up making out towards the end and ended up having sex in the car. We're both interested in continuing to see each other. I'm pretty excited to see what's to come. I like him and I hope things work out. I just think it's funny how we ended up having sex when he told me he does not do that on the first date, lol. Not bad for my first Tinder date!! 

Any advice on what to do when taking things slow? I don't want to turn him off or anything. Thanks!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf4njk/my_first_tinder_date/
92,mf4qas,1616950460,Can't get over something that happened almost a year ago. Venting/Advice please?,"TW: suicidal thoughts

I doubt anyone will actually read this but this is something that's very distressing for me on a daily basis. I'm in a long-distance relationship of 5 years, so it goes without saying that we've always had some strain on our relationship. But at one point last year, our communication was cut off for a few months (we expected a full year) due to something that happened on my end. However, we already had an understanding that we'd wait for each other no matter what.

So, after a few months, I found out he had been interacting with a very sexual Discord server in a way that I wasn't happy with. Lots of flirting with lots of people. It made me doubt whether our relationship could continue, whether he even loved me, and whether I should even live. I suppose this has been a mistake on my part but I had gotten comfortable with the idea that he was the only reason I should continue living. So naturally, this devastated me. I felt very rejected.

I almost broke up with him, but after having multiple talks over a course of months about the situation, I decided we would try and make things work since a) this was the first time we'd had a serious problem in our relationship, b) he didn't actually cheat, and c) he suggested that his thinking had been impaired, which I can't fairly deny because he does have some mental illnesses.

Nevertheless, I've been very insecure about our relationship since then. I still think about how I tried to kill myself one night after finding what I found. My self-esteem was already bad, but I think it had improved a little since the start of our relationship‚Äìnow it's pretty bad again.

He tells me he loves me daily and often, texts me throughout each day (but calls less often), watches movies with me, tries to be there for me for the most part when I'm down, sends me sweet gifts on holidays, and even let me meet his mom on a video call and talk with her for a bit, which is a big deal to me. He also doesn't seem to have changed his mind about marrying me someday and having a family; he recently showed me an engagement ring he had been looking at.

I think all of these things would seem like green flags to anyone, but I still feel very inadequate. I don't feel attractive enough for him because I've seen what really attracts him, and I don't look anything like them. I've always worried about this to a degree, and I've never quite stopped trying to ""win him over"" and just be enough for him since the start of our relationship, but now that worry can feel disabling. For months after I initially confronted him, I would go back and read the messages he'd sent on Discord just to torture myself. I would actually get stomach pains/diarrhea every single time I'd open the Discord website, and in hindsight, I think that might've been something like mild, acute PTSD.

I really do love him, but at times I struggle to believe that he could actually love me and be attracted to me, especially now that I've lost some of my figure due to my fitness routine being disrupted by COVID-19. I worry that I might have ROCD (just found out that's a thing) that's been worsened by what happened last year, and certain things he's said since then (e.g. in an attempt to reassure me, he basically said he wouldn't leave me for someone who looks better because he loves me for who I am and how I treat him, but in my eyes, no one looks better than him‚Äìand I want him to feel the same way about me). I constantly find myself trying to drown out my intrusive thoughts with shows and music, even in this very moment. I just can't seem to fully get over these things, even though I've forgiven him. But I don't want to bring it back up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf4qas/cant_get_over_something_that_happened_almost_a/

95,mf51m8,1616951330,Online dating dynamics,"After a while on the apps now it feels like there is this weird dynamic going on where people date either out of or below their level of attractiveness. Im not a fan of the numbers but its like women are super selective, meaning 5-6 girls only swipe on guys at 7-8+ who in turn get ignored by 7-8 girls so they eventually decide to settle on sex with what they can get. Naturally though most guys still wouldn't seriously date someone far below their level either so again it ends in another ""why wont guys ever commit??"" Post on this sub. Meanwhile the guys at 5-6 get barely any matches at all so there is another ""all girls suck"" post on here. No wonder most people never find a suitable partner on Old in that system.

98,mf5m4m,1616952945,Why did he get waste my time if he wasn't ready for a relationship?,"Back in November I matched with a guy on an app and we hit it off. The area I live in has been under lockdown since November but things have started opening back up. Over the past 4 months we've had virtual dates and talk daily and had plans to meet up once lockdown lifted. On my profile I stated I wanted a relationship and he mentioned that he wanted the same thing so while getting to know each other we discussed the qualities we look for in a relationship and in someone we are dating. Over the past month or so, I noticed some minor red flags. Lockdown restrictions have lifted and he asked me if it wasn't for lockdown would I still be seeking a relationship or more of a casual arrangement (he has a history of casual relationships). There were 2 occasions where he didn't text me for a few days without any explanation, and I'd always have to be the one arranging our video calls. He also told me a story of how he had a one night stand while in a relationship but never told his ex gf. Given all of these things, last week I asked him if he was too busy to be in a relationship. He said no, but then yesterday night he send me a text basically saying he's ready to date but not be in a relationship as he wouldn't have the time, and with things opening he wouldn't know what a relationship would look like that he's willing to keep his options open and see where things go. I was pretty shocked considering we've talked for months on end and he didn't consider these things while talking?  I told him that at this point in my life I'm looking for more commitment and maybe we should just remain friends, and he told me he was disappointed and that it was bittersweet but he understands. He said that maybe now is not the time for him to be in a relationship and that he worries that he may not meet someone's expectations. 

Why did it take him 5 months to determine this - especially when it was time to meet up now that lockdown is over? I feel sad but I know it was the right decision.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf5m4m/why_did_he_get_waste_my_time_if_he_wasnt_ready/
99,mf5rq0,1616953397,"When you're with the right person, the relationship is just easy","When you're with someone you can trust completely, have open and honest communication with, feel like you can completely be yourself, you're both in it for the long run, is healthy and stable. The relationship just comes along so easily. We both put effort in, listen to what we have to say and work on those things because we want to be a better partner to each other. I am working on letting him know when I'm upset and communicating what I want because I know he's not a mind reader. And all of this has made the relationship overall so smooth, that these last 6 months have just flown by and been extremely happy for me. And we made sure that before we started dating, we both were on the same page about what we wanted in the future, marriage and no kids.

This is my longest relationship so far and only 6 months so I know there are going to be rough patches in the future. But I have this sense of assuredness that we both will work through the problem together because we both want to make it work. And don't get me wrong we've had little hiccups here and there, but mostly because of my lack in communication skills which I am working on improving. Being in a relationship shouldn't make you feel shitty, it should bring out the best version of yourself and help you grow into a better person. These relationships are not necessarily the most exciting, because there's just a lack of drama, but damn is it so nice to know that you have that special person you can depend on.

I've been single for most of my life and I can say without a doubt that I'm grateful I took that time to learn to be my own independent individual before coming across this amazing man. Because it's only prepared me to be the best partner I can possibly be for him. Being in love and being loved in return is truly a special experience that I hope everyone gets to experience in some capacity at least once in their life. Know your worth and what you deserve and don't be afraid to walk away when you know you deserve better, because there's a high chance you will find it.
