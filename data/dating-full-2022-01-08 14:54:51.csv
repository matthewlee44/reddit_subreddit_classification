(22M) started texting this (21F) a year ago, texted for 4 months then decided it was best to break things off since I was going to another country because of work and she did not want to. 
While we were texting, it just felt perfect, learned everything about each other in a matter of months, just had a connection, we opened up to each other almost completely.
As things went on, she started getting less interested in me and things I like to talk about, which are history, deep subjects etc, which I do understand, she might not just care about such topics. 
But she mostly talked about herself, somehow every subject we talked about was mostly about her life or some side topic we both like talking about, for example animals, marketing etc, even we I tried talking about my day, my life, plans etc, she brushed it off after 1 or 2 sentences, while if she said ""I am going to get some wood for a fire"" I made the effort to find 10 questions about that sentence and keep chat going.
 My point is, she seemed to stop caring about my life and had not invested as much as effort in chat as I did.
 Felt like I was just someone she can talk to to spend her time, who would always be there for her, send her cute messages, ask her about her day, be romantic, go out of my way to please her, etc, while she did not do such things. 
Was just not getting back what I invested. Now, she knew that, because we spoke about it many times, and she does change it for a few days but eventually goes back to her old self. 
Thing that is bothering me, she can really sometimes be awful, and she knows it. But then again, rarely, she cries in my arms for hours, saying how she doesn't deserve me ( she went out mostly with deadbeats before me ) how I am too good to her and for her, that I should leave, because she is aware she is such a person, but just ""can't control it"", and that she does not know what she would do or what kind of person would she end up with if it wasn't for me. Now, this bothers me because if she does understand her issues, why does she not work on them?
I feel torn apart, I do believe she is deep down a good person, she went through a lot, poverty, physical abuse, alcohol abuse in high school, isolation from her friends as a result.. 
I am now trying hard to make her stop drinking, and I do see some results in that, she did start working out but quit after a week.

I didn't talk to him since last 10-11 months. Now I feel like that these feelings have caused so much pain that I should let it go because one thing is for sure that he could have my heart man.

We go to trade school together and around 4 weeks ago we started chatting a bit and i invited her several times to sit on a bench and smoke a joint after school. It was always very chill and we can talk without a single pause for hours on end. Lots and lots of laughs. She also started texting me pretty much every single day, telling me what she does but also asking me how and what I'm doing.
3 days ago she spontaneously invited me over  in the middle of the day to get drunk and so we did. We watched some Youtube/ Netflix and sat around on her couch, it mostly ran in the background though. We talked and laughed hard (got pretty blitzed) and after like 5 hours she had to go to work and I left. Yesterday we did pretty much the same thing again. (Oh and it's not like we're getting wasted on beer, she just keeps popping serious champagne bottles)


I don't particularly like the word ""chemistry"" but it really applies here, it genuinely feels just so good to be with her. We share enough to have common ground, but her life is also so full of interesting stories that it doesn't get mundane, ever. I feel like the luckiest guy on earth just being next to her. The fact that she looks like a complete supermodel, body and face is just the cherry on top.

Now here comes the catch: Without inflating my ego too much, I know from a lot of people that keep telling me this, I am genuinenly funny. I can make people laugh easily and am very empathetic. I am able to listen for hours if you just talk about your life and struggles and I will remember all of it. People open up about themselves to me VERY quickly after they get to know me just a little bit. Why do I mention all this?

I just think she likes to hang around with me because she likes me as somebody to be around and not much else. She already briefly mentioned that she doesn't think her current relationship will last much longer, but from what I understood all her boyfriends are tall, lanky blonde guys, all older than her. Meanwhile I'm currently in the process of moving out and don't have much to show. She likes the music and art i make so thats cool but how on earth am i going to compete with good looking DJs in their early 30s with some serious money. I am below average in size, shave my head and am definitely too hairy and broad to fit her type.

I guess all of this was more for me than anybody that would read this, but still: Should I just give up? Because if I open up to her and this doesn't work out i will be forced to still see her every day. I feel like I already very well know what stance she has on me, I just feel like complete shit getting all this attention from her knowing nothing will come off it.

I’m a 20M, and this girl likes me, and I mean REALLY likes me. She’s decent looking, but I’m not attracted to her. Maybe because she’s so clingy, I don’t know. I don’t want to speak down on her or anything, she’s a lovely girl. 

However, I personally think that she wants a relationship with me. From some of the Snapchat stories she posts directed at me, wanting to go on dates and just wanting to talk to me like every day, that’s what I gather. 

Now I move around a lot these days, from city to city, country to country for business and pleasure. I don’t stay here often, so I won’t give her a relationship. I don’t think I would want to anyway. 

Moving on, she told me recently that she wants to be FWB, and I was like okay, if that’s what you want. I was hoping that I could drift away from her a bit, message maybe once or twice a week, or even just message when we have a day we want to meet up. I guess I was hoping for no strings attached, but now she’s talking about going out again. 

I don’t know what to do here. I want to spend less time texting, no dates or maybe just occasionally and no strings attached. If not, then I don’t even care about the sex, I’d be okay with breaking it off entirely. 

I want this year to be a year of self improvement, getting businesses off the ground and what not.

A fair number of people seem just to not engage on dates anymore.

Met someone on a dating site.

We went to a local dive for dinner.

I had studied her dating profile for her interest and researched some facts about her hobbies. So when she talked about herself , I could actually add to the conversation.

We get there and she just seems completely disinterested and cold.

She did goodish online , chatting. 

We get to the table and we are both staring at each other.

I asked "" what are you gonna order?"". "" Eh idk"".

I am a person, when I get nervous I babble.

So I am throwing every conversation I can at her.

"" Ah""

""Ok""

"" cool ""

""Yep""

By this time, I am thinking "" Ok she is hoping I choke on my spaghetti, so she as a reason to leave"". Not woman thinks I am as great, as my mommy does.  I am a big boy, I will rally. 

We basically sit there staring at each other. I just wait for the clock to run out.

We walked back to our cars. I said something like "" thank you for coming.""  She kind of nodded and smiled. She sort of just turned and went to her car.

I was thinking "" I bombed that like Hiromasa"".  

Got a text "" I had a great time , we should do it again. "" 

In my head : THAT WAS FUN FOR YOU! I DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT TIME. ARE YOU INSANE.

I just never texted her back.

This isn't the only time, but it is the best and most extreme example.

We went to a bingo club thing where you can dance on the tables and play bingo but mostly just music and drinking! It was a really fun night with everyone and the girl and I were hitting it off, started dancing together and then towards the end, we kissed and were dancing up against each other, cuddling and all that jazz. We then left to go onto another place and her and I were walking in front of the rest of the group and ended up unintentionally losing them before meeting up with some of her work friends at the next place. 

We continued the night in a quieter bar having fun with her work friends and stuff (we played darts and they put my name down as ""*girls name's* bf"" which was funny) and we again were sitting together, cuddling, kissing, holding hands and what not. We then left that place, grabbed some McDonald's before I suggested she come back to my place which she agreed to. 

Obviously up until this point I'm thinking this is going great, we get on and are obviously into each other and she's back at my place drunk so sex is on the table. Anyway, she lays on the sofa coz she's cold and I put a blanket on her while I go sort myself out in the bathroom. Come back out and she's like half sleeping so I say, go brush your teeth and whatever then you can get into bed as it's more comfortable (I'm now not expecting sex since she's clearly tired and still drunk which is fine!) which she does but as she's cold, she gets into bed with her jeans, socks and everything so I suggest getting into a pair of my more comfortable joggers etc. But she said she was fine. She lays down facing me and I kiss her and put my arm over her but she's not like holding me back. It's 3.30am at this point so I think okay fine, let's sleep and then I'll see how she is in the morning. 5.30am she wakes me up, grabs her phone and books a cab to get home coz apparently she had to go and help her sister move some stuff into her place (I'm certain she said to the group earlier in the night she had no plans the next day) so she gets her shoes on and kisses me goodbye and leaves! I didn't even get her number coz I thought I'd get it in the morning and obviously didn't need it when I was with her! 

Anyway, as she's a friend of a friend I found her on Instagram and have sent her a little message saying I hope she's okay bla bla but yea, I'm not sure what happened? It was going perfectly for a solid 7 hours and then it just seemed the script flipped!

We work together, so I have been careful about asking her to hang out until I knew it was time so I didn't put her in an awkward position. 

Conversations in person and text/calls are great. She says she has alot of trust in me, she appreciates my understanding of her, and she even said the other day that talking to me was ""her favorite thing.""

I felt the time was right to make a move but on the day that I felt it was time to ask, she mentioned that she went to hang out with another guy from work last night. The two of them and another couple (who also work with us) went out for drinks. Nothing special. Sounds like a casual work outing but with a definite double date kind of insinuation

Now, I'm 100% convinced they are just good friends. She has told me as much, as well as the fact that she is very single. 

But just to be sure, before I escalate the relationship and ask her on a date or to hang, would it be a terrible idea to maybe ask some mutual friends if they are ""talking"" or interested in each other? I'm not really trying to mess anything up with her, purely from a friend perspective and definitely not trying to appear like I am trying to compete with someone else for a girl. If they got a thing going on, I'd back off respectfully. I'd rather focus on someone who has their full attention on me 

But I also fear it may weaken my position if I ask around and it gets back to her.

Okay but seriously, I [M19] completely put off dating in high school and even up to now in college (I’m a sophomore).

For the longest time though, I never thought of myself as being a good boyfriend. I know that I have a bad attention span, and I’m apathetic, so I could always see myself dating a girl but then neglecting her, then she leaves me (which she would be right to do in that scenario). 

Another thing is that whenever someone brings up my dating life, or asks me if I have a girlfriend or whatever, or talks to me about getting one, I always shut it down. Like, my very first instinct is to say “No”, and that’s it. I don’t know if it’s a defense mechanism or something, but if it is what on earth am I defending myself against?

I’ve been dating a guy for about 1 month and a half. Things are going great and I really like him (which really doesn’t happen very often for me). We went on a trip together, he met my mom (kind of informally). So far he seems super invested and open, more than any other guy I’ve dated, and more than me at the beginning who was being more cautious.
So when we are together we are very much like a couple.
The thing is we met through Bumble. When he showed me something on his phone I could see that he was still receiving notifications from said dating app. Later on I asked him if he was still meeting people and he said that no he was just receiving messages. So we kind of half had ‘the talk’ but didn’t actually say we were exclusive. 
He is kind of new to my city and I know he has a really good friend that he met through Tinder. He told me he was super happy to have been able to create such friendship etc. I don’t have a problem with this.
Now I had covid for a week so didn’t see him. I told him today I’m negative and asked him if he wanted to see me. 4 hours later he responds that he is actually in another city for the week end with the tinder friend, that it happened spontaneously. I look at his profile on bumble (I know kind of stalkerish) and his location is registered to that city which means he checked the dating app recently.

So when we are together we are very much like a couple.

The thing is we met through Bumble. When he showed me something on his phone I could see that he was still receiving notifications from said dating app. Later on I asked him if he was still meeting people and he said that no he was just receiving messages. So we kind of half had ‘the talk’ but didn’t actually say we were exclusive. 

He is kind of new to my city and I know he has a really good friend that he met through Tinder. He told me he was super happy to have been able to create such friendship etc. I don’t have a problem with this.

Now I had covid for a week so didn’t see him. I told him today I’m negative and asked him if he wanted to see me. 4 hours later he responds that he is actually in another city for the week-end with the tinder friend, that it happened spontaneously. I look at his profile on bumble (I know kind of stalkerish) and his location is registered to that city which means he checked the dating app recently.

 So basically me 21m and 20F met in a uni school club, we hit it off and weve been in an exclusive relationship for 3 months now. She was this shy sweet girl but never struck me as religious and wanting to wait for it. We went on a few dates and she went hot and heavy on the making out early, so I assumed we would eventually get to the (sex). We did some stuff with our hands, and thats as far as we got. 

I dont really prioritize having sex in a relationship if I connect with them on an emotional level like I do with this girl, but there has to be at least a light at the end of the tunnel.

So as we were cuddling and getting into it the other day she drops a bomb on me, saying that she was thinking about us and about how she wants to save herself for marriage. I was kind of stunned by it all because it came out of nowhere. I just said it was fine and I understand that its totally up to her, but that i dont know if I could wait, especially because theres no guarantees ill marry this girl (different life paths). Things have been weird ever since.

Story starts in 2018. I joined a dating site and met a guy there. I was looking for a serious relationship and he's looking for something casual but we still swipe right on each others and began talking. Move to whatsapp ,chatting and some flirting, basically everyday, all day. Then a misunderstanding happens , we fought and we stop talking coz dude said his perspective about me changes. Anyway this new year I visit his fb profile because truth is I still like him. While visiting his profile I accidentally pressed the call button but i hung up right away in a panic. I send a text saying sorry, coz I know he caught me lol. I also admit to him that I visit his profile. He replied right away saying it's okay.. I wanna point out that he barely open fb and before I send him the text he was not active for days..or months... Hopium for me... so I ask him if he was just being friendly and reply fast to everyone. He said idk but it's to be polite Needless to say I've embarrassed myself enough and I told him okay, thanks blah blah and that I'm taking my leave coz I'm embarrassing. He read my text and didn't reply. Didn't open fb again after that... Is he just being polite or is this mixed signals??

I get it that most guys find them nice to look at, that's normal. I'm fine with him liking their pictures or leaving comments like sexy, hot, cute, pretty because those girls do look hot and cute as he stated. It's just like how I find Geralt of Rivia really hot. My looks is probably average but I am pretty confident in myself because we should love ourselves right. :) 

Until this picture, which is posted before christmas of this model with just a big bows 🎀 covering her nipples and her venis fly trap. He left a comment saying ""best gifts have a bow"". That comment makes me feel like I'm not enough for him and kinda makes me uncomfortable. The girl is asian and I'm asian too.

He's the one who first asked me to be his gf, did say that he really likes me and despite LDR being hard that he's willing to put the effort in because I'm worth it. We do sometime have a naughty talk but it was very mild. Never had any kinky moment being completely exposed nor talk about anything sex related. I'd say it's pretty pg13. Oh and we are almost 15000miles apart and he bought a ticket to come visit me this year on my birthday and it would be the first time we meet.

So question is..... Is it possible that all that pent up ""heat"" is the one making him write that comment? Is it actually okay for him to say that? I have alot of questions running in my mind but I couldn't write it all out.

Please tell me what your opinion on this is and maybr some advice?

I recall how everyone was in close proximity, how people see each other several times a week, how i sense trust with people after those interactions.

Now I don’t know how to develop trust in people without months of frequent recurring interactions. Nobody, including myself, has this kind of free time outside of work, and most people do not seem to have such patience any more.

The week leading up to the new year, she asked me if I wanted to be exclusive with her—if I wanted to be her boyfriend. I hesitated, and ended up not going for it. The main reasons being that I felt it was too soon, and the other being that she was the first woman I've been with—she was my first kiss, and I lost my virginity to her. 

I want to make a note here: we actually talked about the fact that she was my first, and how we were both worried about me being curious about other women in the future. We also talked about the pace of it all. This talk was done a couple of days before she first asked me to be her boyfriend. Furthermore, she actually came up with the idea of not being exclusive, but continuing dating because of our worries related to my inexperience. Even though this was her idea, she became jealous about the idea of me seeing other women; and hence, the aforementioned call.

After the new year when I was back in the area and we could get together again, I called her and asked if she wanted to hangout. At first she said yes; however, she added the stipulation that she would only see me if I was going to be exclusive with her (this was because she could feel herself falling for me, and that she didn't want to get hurt, so I understood). Again I hesitated, but came up with what I thought was decent middle ground to address the issue of it being too soon: I said I'd be exclusive with her if we went on a couple of actual dates (up until now, it was mostly just us hanging out with things leading towards sex). She agreed, and we did go on a date.. and still had sex every time we met. 

I'm not sure if I'm remembering everything correctly here, but I'm pretty sure that she just started calling me her boyfriend and was asking me to say out loud that she was my girlfriend during these times we met. So of course when those things sorta come out of nowhere I hesitate and eventually say what she wanted me to say. When I went over to her house, she went around telling everyone in her family amd her friends that we were now boyfriend/girlfriend. As another note: she has already told most of her friends and family that we were boyfriend/girlfriend—my friends and family have no idea about her.

So of course, I'm going to be uncomfortable with the whole label thing (even though I really like her and could definitely see us together for a while) because no one in my circle knows about her and I've never had a girlfriend before. 

I played along and actually put in effort into being her boyfriend. When I went to the store, I saw something that made me think of her, and then bought it for her for valentines day. I felt so happy. Even though it was a little new and uncomfortable, I was warming up to the idea and felt happy about it.

Later that evening, she called again. She said that she saw my hesitation when she was asking me to say that I was her boyfriend. She felt that I wasn't serious about it, and that it was her fault for pushing it (which she kinda did, though because of my lack of experience, I had no clue if I should've pushed back). We both agreed, said we still wanted to see each other though, and she mentioned just being friends with benefits. I wasn't totally opposed to that, and felt the call went well. After the call, I broke down. I felt like I made the wrong decision, and had no idea what to think. I thought of the gift I bought her and how happy I was to buy it. 

That call was Wednesday, and she mentioned she still wanted to meetup today, but barely any contact had happened between that call and today. I was going nuts, sensing something was off and I really wanted to see her, so I decided to call her just now—she doesn't want to see me in no way unless it's because I've decided I wanted to be exclusive with her. 

I feel so lost. The thought of being exclusive with her makes me feel happy and comfortable. All I know is, right now, being alone without her sucks. Should I worry about my lack of experience with other women at all? Should I worry about how quickly this is happening, without any of my family or friends even knowing about her? I wish I would've gotten the chance to tell some family and friends about this amazing woman I'm dating, rather than just suddenly revealing to them that we're boyfriend amd girlfriend. I really just wanna call her up and tell her that I want her in my life. Would it be unreasonable to suggest that we be exclusive, but just without the label on it for a little bit? There doesn't have to be any difference between just dating exclusively and actually being labeled boyfriend/girlfriend right?

(her) “i need to tell you something"" (me) ""what's up ?"" her ""you know i really like you and you are one of the sweetest guys i've ever meet genuinely, but i've came to realize that i don't think i'm in a position to give you all the love you truly deserve if i can't give that to myself. i need to find myself and love who i am before i get in any type of relationship, i'm so sorry that i realized this way to far into it but i hope you understand where i'm coming from because a care so much about you, and i hope we can still be friends and talk bc that's all i can be for you rn"" (me) ""idk what to say to be completely honest... i didn't want to say anything but over the past couple days i noticed we were drifting the conversations were getting dryer and talking longer to reply and it's not really my business idk if there's something deep going on or not and if you wanna talk about it but you know i respect you and all of your boundaries but i don't get what could be so bad that we couldn't work it out together . i really want a relationship with you and i want to treat you right and better than anyone else and i enjoy you as a person and i really want to help you get out of the state of mind that you're in right now . i'm not a selfish person and i don't really care if you need to work on yourself first before you can redirect your energy towards me but i don't really want to lose what we have together and go back to what we were before we really started showing our feelings . with that all being said i ultimately respect you and your wishes and what you decide but i wasn't just talking when i said i'm always here for you and i wanna be that person that cares for you"" (her) “i really appreciate you so much for being so nice and understanding, i just don't think i'm ready to be in a relationship, as much as i wishi was because ik you are an amazing person. i just don't have that in me rn and i've been telling myself i'm ready when i'm truly not. i love how you wanna help and be there for me but i think i should figure this one on my own, i'm so sorry i should've figured this out sooner"" (me) “ok"" (her) “i don't want it to be awkward or anything pls don't be mad"" Kind of long ik but I would appreciate it if you at least skimmed through it cause i'm kind of stuck as where to go next.

I guess my question is do i live and learn, and forget her and stop communicating? Do I stay around and keep up the communication and wait around for her to be ready for a relationship or what? I’m torn as where to go now.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150306,public,self,Should I Wait Around or Move On?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzbigb/should_i_wait_around_or_move_on/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

I’ve never had a girlfriend before (except for the online one whom I met like 4 times and kissed twice). I live in a rural community. About 15 mins away from a city that i don’t know anyone in. My university is online, so I don’t have many friends, and my current friends aren’t social nor do they party. I have been to parties, gotten kisses, numbers, and even head once. The problem is that no matter what I do, either try or don’t try, I can seem to get another girlfriend. I have tried tinder. I don’t get many matches. I think it’s because I am of darker skin tone? I got one date which ended in a hookup. What can I do to meet more women and get into dating? I sometimes meet some friends and I get a girls number, but all my friends live super far from me, making the girl super far from me too. What can I do?

If this helps, this is my appearance:

- for people who like dark skins, I’m considered handsome
-I’m like a super chill guy , I never get angry

So, for now my career is going pretty good, I'm talking about med school. I'm proud of myself, I achieved a lot with many ups and downs, but the road is long, so there are many years to finish school.  

My mental health improved drastically. Months ago my anxiety was tremendously invalidating, I cried a lot, couldn't talk with people, didn't want to socialize. Now it's not like that anymore. 

Talking about my external appearance, people tell me that I'm 8/10, 6.4 ft (194 cm), 182 lbs (82 kg), I'm thin but not too much, got a v-shaped body, long dark hairs, I always wear black or white clothes, because I love minimalism. 

So, the point is that I'm not happy about my relationships with girls and in general about my dating life. There aren't many girls in my life, but when one ""appears"", I can quickly escalate to something more. Still I don't like these girls at 100% because of some character incompatibility, but I date them because of some hidden desperation inside me. This is caused because I'm a little scared to approach a girl in public and have the possibility to choose them. How do you let yourself go and approach a beautiful girl? It seems a little hard for me, because probably I never did it. And it's so frustrating, I'm so young, have almost everything what I want from life, but dating is such a mess for me...
