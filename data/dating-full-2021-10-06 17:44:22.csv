I had tried to make plans for the following week but she got caught up with school assignments and work so we agreed she would let me know when she wanted to hang out again.

I'm conflicted on if I should even say anything about it or just continue to wait to see if she brings up wanting to hang out. I know she's busy but we also only live 10 minutes apart. I'm a firm believer that if someone wants to see you they will make the time and see you.

When I went to college, we flirted and sexted and whatever but figured long distance just wasn’t in the cards for us at the time. Time passed, we both got SO’s and then didn’t talk as frequently.

Well, we’re both single now and have rekindled our friendship (if you can call it that, it feels more like an online FWB situation). It’s getting more serious, we literally joke about how we want to get married and have kids, and I just love spending time with him and could talk for hours and hours. There are a lot of reasons I really really like him.

We’ve met in person twice and it went well, so it’s not like our relationship is entirely virtual. He confessed to me a while back. There are just a few reasons why I’m hesitant to make him a lifelong partner.

1. He’s a smoker. I would probably ask him to quit if we got into a relationship. He’s tried to quit a few times to no avail, and I’m just worried about his long-term health. Not to mention it’s just unattractive to me.

2. He comes from a very very poor area and has little savings. I feel really bad for even putting this in here but it’s something that is important to me. I was the “breadwinner” in my last relationship and having different concepts of money led to a lot of arguments. Plus, I want to be able to go out and do things and enjoy life with a man who likes to travel and spoil me (not even that much, just buy me things every now and then since it’s my love language) and I’m afraid he wouldn’t be able to do that, at least for a while. I’m kind of done with being the “mom” in the relationship who has to cover all the costs. It also means it could be hard for him to move if we even wanted to stop long distance and move in together. 

3. I consider myself Demi-sexual so looks aren’t the most important to me. However, as much as I’m attracted to his demeanor and his personality, I don’t find him very aesthetically attractive. His teeth are messed up (which comes from growing up really poor) and I feel like his hygiene might not be the best (he’s sent me pics of his hands and I notice his fingernails are dirty which is a HUUUUGE turn off for me). Not to mention I’m hyper-clean and from the looks of his place over FaceTime it’s kind of a mess. Plus he doesn’t really have style which I also find unattractive. 

Are these reasons petty/am I being too picky? Or are these valid reasons not to pursue him? I really like him, so I can’t decide if these are “make or break” characteristics. 

I feel like 27 is still young but I don’t want to get into another long-term relationship I end up regretting!

Our first date was a 20/10.  Asked her out to dinner/date. First contacted on the Facebook dating app.  Short after she took me with her to Santa Ana for her mom for  dental and doctor appointments. We took off to the Vietnamese town in the meantime. We would always walk the beach and eat great food while there.  She would pay for food for 1 hour massage for me and her. We took turns everytime we went out. But when we went to Santa Ana she had me. Pho all the good stuff. I went into this relationship looking for nothing serious just be fiends and do stuff together. We had sex couple times a week. But little did I know I was falling so hard for her. She was one of the best thing going on for me in life. It was : her, my puppy , my career-in the military and my civilian job. We talked about buying a house together that way we spend more time together.  We both work and we only saw each other when we were off. She even said she wanted to buy me a Tesla because it’s my dream car. I’m like she’s too good to be true. Too bad she was.  She told me the same as well. She said she had never meet a guy like me. In my head I’m like I’m settling down with her for sure. She meet my dogs !!! That’s a big deal. It was the best 2 months of my life. I had a purpose in life I felt. When I was with her she told me all her plans of us together. She wanted to have one more kid and wanted to be with me. I was very hesitant. I’m 24. She’s 32. The idea of that was a real possibility with me because I thought I found the one. I never felt this way for a girl ever in my life. Till last week she told me to not waste my time on her on a text. She told me to move one because she was gonna be busy with her kids and work. I was caught so off guard he that text. I’m like why didn’t she brought this up when we saw each other the other night.  Long story short I’m so devastated right now, I’m heart broken 😔 it’s the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. I stopped looking at girls the way I used to when I was with her. It was more in a “do we look good together “ to “ she’s a awesome girl I wish she reaches her goals”.

Back in early June of 2021 I met a girl on Snapchat that went to my school, she randomly added me and we started talking. It was obvious that she was intimidated by me at first. I was suspicious at first cause I’ve never seen her at my middle school. Eventually after a few months we got pretty comfortable with each other but we still didn’t see each other much at school, it usually consisted of us just saying hi and walking by or us just looking at each other for a split second. I liked her and confessed, but unfortunately she didn’t like me back. I tried and keep everything cool but there wasn’t nothing to talk about much. So I stopped talking to her and moved on.. for now. I went to like another girl a few weeks after and she seemed interested at first. We would talk in the hallways, give each other notes, give small compliments to one another, and I felt comfortable around her. But then I found out she only liked me like a friend. So then I just completely stopped looking for anyone cause I knew I was just hurting myself doing that. After literally a few days the first girl I liked came back into my life and she was the most amazing person to me, giving me compliments on little things I haven’t even noticed, she would walk with me in the hallways every time she would be out there, she even likes touching and holding my hand a lot (even though that might not mean much) but damn am I in love right now, she shows me signs but she didn’t like me before, I just want to know if I should shoot my shot, but I don’t know if she might do the same thing she did before...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1050110,public,self,Should I ask them out?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2sfbh/should_i_ask_them_out/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I workout 5 days a week, go hiking, live on my own, into photography, gaming, traveling, being spontaneous and just overall do lots of things. In short, I’m happy with who I am as a person and now want to meet my special person. 

My luck dating has been abysmal to say the least. I can’t even remember the last time I’ve had an opportunity to go out on a date despite my best efforts. I put myself out there, use the apps, join meetups and ask women out…I get nothing back. 

The majority of dating these days is done online, but as a below average height guy and a person of color, my success on them has been less than terrible to say the least. Even being delicate with my swiping and sending individual curated messages…90% of my matches never respond. 

This just more a rant than anything else…not really looking for advice. 

I guess I’m just sick of the way things are in the world when it comes to dating. Ghostings, superficial desires, reg flags, waiting for the next best thing…etc. no one wants to take the time to actually get to know anyone anymore and it sucks; especially for guys like myself who give it their all and see literally zero results. 

Even though it pains me to admit this, I guess I’m just bitter. I’m envious of people who have had a chance to be in a meaning relationship. Envious of those men who say they have no problem landing dates and meeting people. I’m envious of the fact I’ll never get to know what it feels like to have someone to cuddle, spend time with, go to events with, laugh and argue over silly things, have dinner with, introduce to the family and just enjoy life with. I’m so sick of being alone.

The worst part about everything is that no one around me can relate. All my friends are married, no in my family has dated in over a decade and have no idea how hard 2021 dating is. Non-single people just can’t understand what it’s like to be alone, especially someone like me who’s never had a chance to be with someone in their thirties.

I matched with another girl (30f) in our program who is a few years above us when I was casually swiping on a dating app. I rarely get together with people on the app because of my schedule and it’s often something to do when I’m bored/lonely. But 30f-girl messaged me and we’ve been chatting a bit. Apparently she knows 23f-girl and 23f has been talking me up. Now I’m obviously regretting not making a move on 23f sooner.

I’m thinking at this point I should count my blessings and ask 30f out—maybe she’s great. If it doesn’t work out though, I might be screwed with 23f.

Sorry I’m new to this. I just need some advice.

I was dating a guy that I really liked for around 2 months. He’s a lovely guy and we had fun together. He told me he liked me but I didn’t want to rush into a relationship because my last one messed me up a bit. I was honest with him and said I wanted us to get to know each other before we became a couple. We had been sleeping together and everything was great.

He seemed to get scared off by me wanting to wait. He had been cheated on in the past and I think me saying that made him panic.
To cut the story short, he messaged me after being distant for a few weeks to say he was dating someone else but it wasn’t anything serious. I was upset but I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it so I told him that if he was happy then I’m happy for him and unfollowed him on everything.

A month passed and he re-added me. Hasn’t said anything but happy birthday and continues to watch my stories and posts. He’s always the first person to watch my ig stories. I know it sound dumb but I was honestly gutted and I really like him.
I haven’t watched any of his social media and have no idea if he’s involved with someone else still. I’ve just been doing my own thing.

I just need some advice and opinions . Do you think it’s worth me reaching out? Why is he acting like this? I know we like each other.

1. this is not only valid for a 'she'. It can be a 'he', too ( I've read that 'I just don't get him' too many times. No. He just is not that into you. You would know. Because he would try to get near you, flirt with you, do that weird thing he does because he's a weirdo \[or at least the mainstream thinks so\], you get it.). Or an it. Or whatever, you get the point. This is *not* a gender thing.
2. more importantly - don't start switching your interest like you'd throw an unpinned handgrenade. You will get seriously lost in the glitzy world of super-fast dating and never actually get to know anyone. There is still the thing, where you get to know people, before at some point, you will actually get to know each other on a level, that starts making you two (or three, or whatever number is currently appropriate for your surroundings)  intersting for each other. It is *not* the usual (or recommendable)  way to get to know someone more or less at random, because they look somewhat interesting to you at some specific day. They have on an outfit you like, some smell you love, they laugh *that* way - you might find this interesting at first, but please don't start dating based on solely manipulated signales. Because that is what you could start doing, if you start assuming people don't want to date you. Not because that isn't good advice - it is very good advice in my eyes - but because it's still your assumption. You have a subjective view of your surroundings - like anyone - and especially getting to know someone new takes time.

Or do you nearly close your eyes in the supermarket, squinting, and take whatever glitzes the most? You hopefully don't. You will always end up with sugar and transfats. Life has a lot more to offer than toasties.

Other than that example - if you do this with people - basically internally rejecting them, before they even know of your existence - you could shut yourself out of that supermarket completely, eventually. You will start to assume nobody likes you. And - no scientific study here, but I might throw something together one day - that will probably also infect other, non-dating areas of your life. If positive effects of dating can infect the rest - why shouldn't negative ones do that? But I guess you already found out, that you're not on your best, if you're sobbing in bed with a bucket of ice-cream or chicken fingers.

So assumptions are good, but if you start raking in 'rejection' numbers in the high hundreds, something is off. The three seconds rule - the one you use with stuff you let fall to the floor - is not applicable here. It's not three seconds. It's communication, that fails.

Cheerio.

PS: I always eat desert first. So... I'm kind of prone to do just that.

1. I'm kind of doing the anti-thing of generalizations, so whatever

I (25M) have a bit of a situation I could use some help on. I was dating this girl (26F), and on our second date I told her I was looking for a girlfriend. She told me she was not looking for anything specific, but she could see herself in a relationship with the right person. It seemed like she really liked me (she invited me to hang out with her friends, go on trips, etc.), but she ended things after two months. She said I was a great guy and liked hanging out with me but there was ""something missing""; she knew I was looking for a girlfriend and she didn't want to waste my time because she didn't see herself getting there anytime soon.  In the moment I figured this was her version of ""it's not you it's me"" (basically she wanted to end things but was trying to be polite) but looking back (it's been about 3 weeks) I'm wondering if she would have been fine keeping things the way things were. While I wanted her to be my girlfriend, I was fine taking things slow. I didn't get a chance to say this because we were both really busy and she had to tell me over text (lame I know but it made sense in the context of our lives).

My question is do you think it is worth telling her all this now?  I'm worried I would sound needy. I really miss hanging out with her but she may have moved on. I don't want to come across like I'm changing what I want to fit her desires- because I'm not. We do text occasionally, and it seems like she is genuinely interested in being my friend. I've also thought about just waiting a couple months, hang out with her as a friend, play the field a little and then see if I still want to get these feelings off my chest. My worry with this approach is that she might meet somebody new in that time and not be available. Furthermore she has talked about leaving the city where we live in May. So waiting would mean less time to form a bond and potentially convince her to stay. Any advice is helpful.

Thanks!

Hello everyone! 

Using my throwaway acc to stay anonymous. Im in my early twenties, NW-EU.
In december 2020 I met this gorgeous girl on tinder who turned out to have an even better personality. It was -literally- too good to be true: intelligent, open minded, smart, kinky, flirty, caring etc. Also looks wise she was completely my type. We matched, turns out we study the same, while she does not have a lot of hobbies she is a ""sponge"" so was very interested in mine. She also brought her own deep discussions to the table which I love. She initiated flirting, we talked until deep in the night for days, she accepted my kink etc. We met 2 weeks later, had passionate foreplay, cuddled amazingly. We both wanted more of each other, the feelings were mutual, and two weeks later she became ""distant"" due to family problems, leading to ghosting. It wasnt the same to her as it was to me apparently, she said, when I confronted her. I was heartbroken. 

I continued my dating with others a few months later. But I keep comparing all my dates to her because she was so perfect to me. 
The following have occured (all different persons, due to covid on OLD) where I compared. 

- Sex amazing and lots of it but otherwise little connection. Suddenly 180d and we didnt meet anymore. 

- Amazing in every way I can discover over distance, we still talk since a year, but lives on another continent. I havent confessed my feelings yet. 

- Very good connection but I got ghosted

- Good connection, beautiful although not my type immediately, but very hard to get, the one im talking to now (the december girl went effortlessly because we were so into each other).

- Good connection, beautiful in her own way, but friendzoned me and thinks my kink is disgusting. 

-  matches that did not respond, ghosted or were very boring. 

And I just cant forget her unless somebody blows her away it seems. Im not seeking a ""new her"" because she was very different from my ex who I also loved very much. I am seeking a connection LIKE I had with her in the sense that everything felt right.  The comparison just pops into my head and I cant help it.. 

What should I do? Comparing is never good, but it constantly feels like im ""settling"" too if they are not ""better or equal"" to her.. 
""not dating"" wont help because I keep ruminating. I used to be happy single but due to covid I am not anymore.

Before today, the only time I really spoke to her was when she was promoting something for an organization she’s a part of. Every time we made eye contact when around each other, I could have sworn that she had an “interested” look in her eye; she’s even blushed. As a matter of fact, I was near certain, which is why I slowly built up the confidence to approach her.

Fast forward to today: I saw her in one of the classrooms as I was hanging around, and during the class’s intermission (it’s almost a three hour class), I decided to act! Since she was with friends, I didn’t want to just be direct with her in front of them, to save myself from the potential embarrassment and the spotlight. So, while many may find this cheesy/pathetic, I decided to write her a note. It said something like, “If you’re interested in talking for a bit after your class ends, meet me by the dean’s office. If not, I won’t bother you again! No pressure.” I walked into the class, handed it to her, and said, “You dropped this outside.” She replied, “I did? Thank you :-),” and I waited by the dean’s office hoping she’d stop by.

About 20 minutes later (before her class was over), her and her two friends walked toward my location but stopped approximately 15 feet away from me. They pretty much pretended I wasn’t there, however. But I’m pretty sure they were there because of the note because they didn’t go into any of the surrounding offices; they just stood there “talking” while occasionally looking over at me and then looking away. My crush would nervously make eye contact with me and then look away quickly. It was strange—as if they were inspecting me. After about two minutes, they went back to their class and my crush never came back to meet me. I took that as her rejection. 

I saw one of her friends in the hallway later and asked if she’d seen the note I gave to my crush. She started blushing and said, “No, but she has a boyfriend in case you’re wondering.” I thanked her for letting me know and that was that. I shot my shot.

Anyone know what to make of this? Did I behave oddly?

TLDR: Approached crush, her and friends had an inspection session, and then they went away.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1050345,public,self,Strange rejection?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2vw8t/strange_rejection/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

So I met this girl online and were both looking for a relationship. We really liked each other and so we went out for coffee for our first date. We had a lot fun and she was amazing with a great personality and she beautiful. She told me she wasn’t Christian, which isn’t a huge deal breaker for me, but she said she open minded to learning more about it. She told me she would like to learn more and etc. She gave me her instagram to follow her back and I told her I’ll follow back when I get home. We finished her date and went our separate ways. She was so kind and nice in person and she open to talking and etc.   


When I got home and followed her, I saw things on her profile that was so shocking that I was completely lost. It was her in her underwear and bra posing in mirrors and her saying sexy stuff that were very and I mean very inappropriate. I’m very close with my parents and so I showed them, they were stunned and they are old fashion, so this was definitely crazy for them. They told me to not go out with her, and stay away from her because she is toxic and there’s something wrong with her. They called her all sorts of names and I was left disappointed about what the girl did and what my parents said. And I told them that she‘s very nice and were supposed to have our next date thursday going to the movies, but it seemed like she was a different person. 

So I decided to call her up and talk to her to see what’s going on and who I’m talking with. I believe in forgiveness and if the person is willing to change, then yes I’ll date them. But what they had up was unexceptional, if you showed anyone her instagram, everyone would agree with me. When I called her she told me, “I new this would happen and I’m so sorry you saw this and I’ll do anything to change. The only reason I did it, was because i was alone and depressed and it gave me a lot of attention from guys, but not for the right reasons.” I told her this would not help her and it’s only going to hurt you. She said she’s willing to change and even took the pictures down on her profile. And I told her about my parents, which completely made her cry and she was so sorry for what they saw. Of course I forgave her, but this whole day had me thinking on what the best decision is to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family doesn’t want me going out with her because of what she did, but they said I can if I want and they’ll support me no matter what. I do really like her, because she’s cares for me and is even texted me today after we talked a day ago on the phone and asked how I was doing. I guess I don’t know what to do. My family told me if I go out with a girl like her, that no girl would want to go out with me because I went out with a girl like her. And I keep kicking myself wondering what is best thing to do. Do I get to know her and let her build a track record to see if she’s true to what she says and I forgive her for what she did in the past and present? I mean I only just met her a week ago Lol. Or is walking away and focusing on my life the best decision? Were both college students and we still have a long way to go in life I guess. So please give me some advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I’m not saying I better then this person what so ever, I have plenty of my own problems in life.

I definitely agree with that. Healthy relationships start with healthy people and I wouldn't want to bring someone down with me. But despite a decade of working on my confidence and happiness, I'm still as depressed and self-hating as ever. When I was 19 I decided that I needed to become confident and content enough with myself. Over the last 10 years, I worked hard on self-improvement:

* Career: I went to my dream graduate school and graduated debt-free, got a great job in tech that pays six figures, and recently bought a house. I love my job and there is plenty more room for career growth. I'm also on the volunteer board at work and tutor college students on the weekends.
* Hobbies: I started learning guitar a decade ago and now I'm at the point where I'm writing my own songs. I even started a band with my brother. I also like to paint and read.
* Life experiences: I've been to 9 countries, road-tripped across the U.S. and Canada, and lived/worked abroad for 2 years. During this time I made tremendous progress on learning a second language which has been a goal of mine since high school.
* Social-life: I'm not a very social person and usually prefer to be alone. But I really pushed myself to make friends and now I have a tight group of about 5 friends that I see as much as my job allows me to.
* Appearance: I work out 7x per week for at least an hour. Sometimes more than once per day for weights and cardio. I used to be slightly overweight but I've gotten down to pretty low body fat and managed to put on some muscle mass. I also got Lasik so that I could get rid of my glasses. I've seen a personal stylist and I get my clothes tailored as needed. However, I'm not the tallest (5'7), and my face is not doing me any favors.
* Mental health: I started seeing a counselor over a year ago and I go every week. Though, I'm starting to question the value of this. I also meditate every morning per my counselor's request and I'm on anxiety and depression meds.

I feel like I should be happy and confident but I'm not. I still struggle to look people in the eye. I still have virtually no self-esteem. I still have chronic depression and anxiety. I'm still a total downer deep inside. The question is, will it get better? I want to date one day, but I also don't want to burden anyone with who I really am. I'm 29 and I've never kissed a woman. Needless to say, I've never had sex.

Some of the worst advice I've ever received is ""be yourself."" If I did that I would have no friends.

There’s this girl that I’ve known for years. We are both 21, and have known each other since we were 17. Back when we were younger she was really into me but i never really felt the same because of a past relationship. 

Long story short on our past, i cut off communication with her twice and the second time  it was after we spent the night together. Not a good move on my part.

We’ve been back in contact in the past year, and we’ve talked thru some of our past. We became good friends over text, and once we were in the same city again she wanted to see me and asked to hang out. i accepted and we hung out a few times. 

I knew that i liked her and i wanted to do things the right way, so i made it clear i wasn’t just wanting to hook up and we just hung out and accompanied each other.

Contact has since fallen off, and she told me she’s going through a rough time and said i didn’t do anything. She said she was getting distant with everyone and i didn’t have to worry. At first i gave her some time. But of course it didn’t get better, so i made the mistake of saying “if you don’t want me around just tell me”. She didn’t like this and brought up how i ghosted her in the past so why do i care.

We talked through this about a week later over the phone and she told me that when i reached out is when things were really getting bad with what she had going on, so she lashed out on me and she apologized for it, and we were good then.

I saw her later that week. she came to me and talked for 10 minutes and asked if i needed help with my homework, which i accepted and thanked her for help.

I then reached out again a few days later to understand things better and again she got upset.

Last time i texted her i basically said that if she needs me or wants to talk to me she can, and i hope she’s doing well. She said she’s good and said thanks. That’s the last interaction we had.

Literally any other girl i would not care too much if they got cold with me. But the fact there is some history and she’s been around for so long makes it hard to let go.

I have a lot of questions that i ask myself about this, but all in all this has weighed heavy on my mind for the past month. I don’t care what the outcome is of this, whether we date or become friends. I just know i don’t want to lose our friendship at the very least.

When I was a kid I assumed that I would be looked at as a second option two women and for the most part that seems to be true in my adult life and that is because I am a visual artist

It is a great hobby and career and I'm pretty good at it as I have trained since I was a kid and with this hobby I gained a lot of other skills such as patient and time and networking and selling myself and my art


I'm very proud of this especially since it took me a long time to actually accept this about myself and come out as an artist. Despite popular belief a young man doing these types of things is seen as weird or childish or even girly since it has nothing to do with something like sports or hardware

And even though I myself don't personally think it holds me back it is clear that a woman may not choose me over a guy who probably is more sporty or actually has a hobby pertaining to mainstream masculinity


That's why you get so frustrating when you hear the advice of go get hobbies and get friends because if you're someone like me who's already done that, what else can you do?

Now granted some girls who enjoy it and even right now I'm trying to picture of a woman I've been talking to

But these things are only happened to me recently.

When I was younger a lot of girls were not checking for me even though I had this glorious hobby and I never expect them to but given the advice that we give I always wondered why I was always passed over since I had such an amazing hobby


At this type of thing I tend to get jealous because this type of things doesn't seem to really hold back women socially or romantically

Right now I have a female friend who was so similar to me and everything including my personality

Right now she can work on her art and not worry so much about outer society

Because she's a woman and she doesn't have a stigma of being a breadwinner or being radically independent

And because of all these factors she is able to live with her boyfriend and his parents without having any social backlash and be able to work on art.

Me as a man and especially a young black man I don't think I am able to do that. Just for the fact that not a lot of women are just going to shack up with a dude while he is working on artwork like the gender reversal.

I had my instagram in my bio and this super cute guy dms me instead of waiting for us to match and says “hi, i saw you on tinder, you’re fucking gorgeous” He’s spanish and i’m american, i’m living here for the next 4 years studying. 

Since he’s sent me videos of him talking and videos of his dog, then he asked me which part of the city i lived in and we’re pretty close, so he said if i would like we could go grab a coffee sometime. He’s been asking questions ab me, not too deep but basic getting to know me. He says if i help him with his english he’ll cook for me lol because he told me he wants to be a cook and i said he should make me a dish. We have some banter and he’s really nice and making the date on my terms.

Then we didn’t text for almost a week and he texted me “hey beautiful, how was your week” then a bit of small talk and he said “to be honest i don’t know what to say, i want to meet you in person” So i told him i wasn’t sure of my availability yet so i would let him know. So yesterday I texted him and we’re gonna meet tomorrow to go to a big park in the city to walk around then we’re gonna go get coffee/ or drinks? (he said whatever i preferred)

I also asked him what he was looking for and he said “idk, at the moment to just go get a coffee and get to know eachother, the truth is that i’m curious to meet you”

i’m a bit excited tbh because atleast over text i kinda like him, all my friends are saying they have a good feeling about him after reading our convos, but i want to ask in reddit’s point of view does he seem genuine?

I am definitely confident in who I am, how I look, and can hold a conversation with no problem. Getting the dates hasn't been an issue, but I can seem to make a connection. 

I believe it is because I am terrible at showing/creating the physical connection during dates. After reading through this sub I am stuck in almost a fear of rejection/being a creep to make any moves besides holding their hand or light touching. A good example to validate this is that I will go on second dates and still not kiss her at the end of it (which from what I've read is bad). 

I am looking for advice on if this is most likely the problem with me? And secondly, for those who have dealt with this before and/or have general advice on just not being so timid, I would really appreciate to it!

Then the next day he texts me and lets me know he's not sure if he wants to be dating right now. Totally fair especially since the date came out of nowhere but still disappointing, since I really liked him from talking and the date. I am pretty disenchanted with dating generally and this kind of bummed me out big time. This is why I don't bother with dating. I get so emotional and attached easily, and expend so much emotional energy only for it to go nowhere. 

I'm glad he was honest and nice and glad I met him but sigh... I'm really not cut out for the emotional rollercoaster of dating. If this is just the first date, imagine after several dates, months, years.. I just don't care to be in emotional pain on a moment's notice.

Hey! 

So the title pretty much explains it.
Im a guy who is 5”3/5”4 I’m planning on dating a girl who is 5”5/5”6 
Which is 2/3 inches taller than me.

But I’m short because when I was 12 I was diagnosed with cancer on my femur bone. So I ended breaking my femur &amp; missing my early teen years.

So about 3/4 years later I started to grow &amp; mature more. So the doctors decided to drill the growth plates in my knee. So I pretty have accepted my height now because it was all out of my hands, but I’m think my height is one minor reason to why I struggle with girls. I get called goodlooking/attractive by many older women.

But I’m just kinda nervous (not showing it to her) that she might not like me?

I’m wondering if any women here or anyone in general would have a problem with it? 

I think she’s a great. We flirt a fair amount. But I’m already accepting she wont like me in person.

Any advice on just how to get on with it??

I flirted with her a little bit like teasing her and she seemed surprised but she didn’t pull away.

She hasn’t really made any advancements or anything on me or done anything else really revealing that she had a crush on me, and she’s not shy but I know girls sometimes are just friendly and some people are really sociable.
