I've had zero success with girls since March 2020. Not even a date! The pandemic of course makes it harder but it's not an excuse. I do have somewhat high standards that I've lowered recently, but I will not pursue a girl I'm not attracted to just to break the dry spell. Here's what I've tried:

Online dating - tried for years, doesn't work for me and I will not invest another minute into it (being 5'8 doesn't help)

MeetUp app - great for making friends, AWFUL for dating; mostly an older crowd and even age restricted groups in my area are sausage fests  with very few opportunities to meet NEW girls (likely cause any time there's a new cute girl she gets too much male attention and doesn't come back)

Restaurant server job - it's not easy relating to girls who are nearly a decade younger than me, and it's only gonna get worse as I get older, but I'm probably just doing something wrong or being insecure about my age; men get more attractive in their 30s from what I've heard and there's plenty of older guys dating girls in their early to mid 20s

Pick-up volleyball - mostly an older crowd and definitely a sausage fest

Gym - SO MANY attractive girls, but I find it hard to break the ice and most are listening to music/don't want to be approached

Reading books on this topic - I've read books such as Models by Mark Manson, 3% Man by Coach Corey Wayne and Mystery Method Venusian Arts Handbook  (some multiple times), but I find that all that knowledge is useless without application and where I'm struggling now is finding opportunities for application

\--------------------

I'm not gonna go out of my way to do something I don't enjoy like knitting just to meet women. So here's what I PLAN to do:

Salsa nights - LOTS of women, partner dancing breaks the ice for you and allows opportunities for conversation; but there's not a lot of venues offering this around here and that could diminish further because of the 4th wave and winter is coming (fuck Canadian weather)

Karaoke nights - unfortunately mostly an older crowd, but still a good number of younger women; it feels much more acceptable to go up and talk to a random table here than a regular bar (or not so random if they cheered you or you cheered them)

Learn pick up - it's not that younger attractive women don't exist, I just don't seem to have opportunities to talk to them; they are literally everywhere except my social circles so clearly I need to rely less on my social circles, just man up and talk to strangers

Cut down on porn - once a day is way too much and definitely affects my sex drive and motivation; I've tried nofap in the past but never got further than 60 days and usually can't get past a few days

Move (maybe) - being a restaurant server, quitting and finding a new job  shouldn't be too difficult which gives me the flexibility to travel or  relocate especially with the money I've saved; but I currently live at  home since March 2020, and can't realistically afford to live in places  like Toronto or Vancouver; in Canada, there aren't many options in terms  of affordable big cities as opposed to the US (I wouldn't qualify for a work visa); it may even benefit me to stay in the Greater Toronto Area rent free for the near future as opposed to moving to say Calgary where it could be worse

Your life partner fills that vacant space and provides you the energy to move further. Eventually, you will tend to fall for the one with whom the emotional bonding thickens. Its nothing wrong, we should feel good that we are able to choose our own partner. Love that one guy and your life will engrave you in its magical path .

In July, I met this man on tinder; we chatted for a bit, and then I deleted my Tinder profile only to join back in August, and we then matched again.

The second week of August, we meet up for brunch, and we click, and the conversation is easy flowing, and then he drops me home following the end of our meeting, and we plan our next rendezvous.

The second/Third/Fourth meeting is at this apartment as he works until 7 pm, so he picks me up after work, and we usually go to his home and watch a movie/eat/play a board game or talk for a few hours.

With that been said, our second meeting escalated as we began making out and fondling, which I did not expect, so I did tell him to slow down a bit as we were moving way too fast.

He then asks me what I want out of this; I then tell him that I want a relationship, and he tells me he wants a companion that he hopes will lead into a relationship and that he likes me and was shocked at how well we clicked from the very beginning.

Anyhow, we do try to hang out at least twice a week depending on our schedule, so on Friday, we met up, and he created a wine and charcuterie board for me that we had spoken off. It was lovely, so brought a fun conversation card game called convo and chill, and we talked/drank and ate.

The conversation was intense as the questions on the card were about marriage/love/gender roles and so forth.

We had disagreements on gender roles, which worried me a bit, but I was glad we had those conversations.

However, now im worried as I did tell him that I like to take things slow and build a strong foundation/friendship that leads to something romantic.

He felt as if I should trust that he has good intentions and that regardless of the time factor, his intentions are pure and that he likes me.

Anyhow, we had a short conversation in his car/kissed/hug and said goodnight, and he then texted me when he got home.

We then chatted a bit on Saturday about his job and so forth ,and then I did not hear from him. 

Anyhow now Im scared that I have messed this up by showcasing my insecurity/distrust etc.

He texts me every day in the early morning so I haven't heard from him today so I'm unsure if he has lost interest or if I should text him or what is happening.

I think health and fitness are important. I work out every day (biking, swimming, weights, or body weight) for 30-40 minutes. I practice intermittent fasting and try to eat mostly healthy foods. My body fat is around 14% and going down slowly over time. 

I would like to date someone similar to me who also maintains a healthy body composition. I asked about this yesterday in another forum, and the answers I got all essentially said that it is unrealistic for a normal man to expect to date someone similar to him in this regard. 

The answers said that a woman with a healthy body composition has so many options she will demand the man be tall, or white, or beautiful, or look like he's on steroids. I am none of those things.

Thus I was told I should not expect to date anyone similar to me. Parallel to that, someone in another thread suggested I also increase my exercise to 10 hours per week (1-2 hours per day) as I'm not getting exactly the endurance and strength I want from my current routine. I'm considering it but I also fear that this will just disconnect me from the women I am able to date further. 

If I am working out 10 hours a week, I am concerned the prospect of meeting someone compatible likely goes down not up. Since I'm still not going to be using steroids, I still won't reach the movie star physique threshold. Thus I won't get the benefit of standing out against the steroid users on apps. At the same time, my lifestyle will become even more abnormal compared to the average sedentary person.

Don't know and can't tell if he is into me. Too shy to initiate anything. Feeling miserable. 

So, Ive (26f) been depressed for +2years. Haven't dated anyone since 2019. I mostly work from home and have to take care of my elderly grandparents. Don't really have an active social life.

After lot of thought, I've joined gym in late-July. Due to pandemic the gym is mostly empty. I am the only girl who is regular and maybe 1-2 teenagers work out on alternate days. 
Staff: a trainer and his assistant. And just the manager who also manages adjacent spa and saloon. 

In August, I decided I need to lose weight and tone up to get back in dating scene. That's when I ve asked the trainer (25M) if he is open to train me.
He wears a mask all the time, as per the protocol. But when he removed it, I was instantly attracted to him. He is in great shape and hot af. 

Now I've been training under him for over a month. Every day I look forward to see him at the gym. Every day i feel butterflies in my stomach. 

what I've noticed is he is very professional. And takes his job seriously. He doesn't like when I joke around during workouts or try to talk too much. And would like me to rather focus on what he instructs me. 

I see him for 1-2 hours everyday. I don't want to initiate anything and get rejected. it would end up awkward for him (since I'm the only client in that gym for him) and I would lose interest in going to gym and may fall back on my old habits. 

He does small talk: asks me about my diet that day, if I had enough sleep and how is my work going on. Thats about it. Very few times he asked about personal details. 

Since he wears mask all time during workout, I can't figure out or read him. (I'm allowed to not wear a mask).

I have his number and update him about my diet. He gives me a one world reply or a thumbs up emoji (annoying af). The conversation goes nowhere.

I am mid 30, have a house, about top 1% income in the US, no kids, never married, etc... here is a list of my recent attempts to get a date:

23 year old meets me at a bar after 1 year of on and off texting. Randomly we meet she is 1.45 hours late... I had ironically left to my car to leave the bar when she pulls up. I calm down, and offer her a drink. We go back to the place and she is all handsy, lovey, close affectionate to me and really interested. She text me the next morning and haven't heard from her since. - BTW when we were out some dudes were spam calling her # like 10 times in a row....

I'll skip the insanely stupid OLD stuff and get to the people I met or video chatted with: 

24 year old that was talking about a future, we are long term compatible, etc. Date ended sorta abruplty, after I took her to breakfast and bought her a plant since she likes them. 4 weeks later after not hearing from her or anything I text her and she says she is in a serious relationship with someone else. She def knew this person while she went out with me and kissed me in my car. COol bro.

21 year old that text me she is coming back (we hooked up before many times) from another city and wants to see me again. When she is supposed to be back I text her ""what's up are you back ok?"" and she said ""I'm in a relationship with someone seriously"" sorry. 

24 year old tells me ""we are too different"" after we saw each other 3 weeks. She was willing to still come over and hook up even though dating someone else. She told me he was really controlling so she broke it off. OK dude.

19 year old talks to me for 3 weeks then randomly unadds me on snap, no explination. we sent many videos and texts she was coming here for school

20 year old talks to me on video call for 2 hours, talks about a future, etc, setting up future meets, asap... text her 2 times after our call and haven't heard from her agian.

26 year old ""doesn't drive"" &amp; ""doesn't talk on the phone"" - we arranged to just meet and chat. I got her an americano with cream for her morning as she asked me to. Then when I get to her place I called her and she blocked me. We chatted on the phone and yes can confirm she said ""yes,"" ""no"" ""yes"" type short answers to my open ended questions.

26 year old was going to meet up with me Friday said ""see you tomorrow"" on Thur and never herad from her Friday.

On our second date we went to play pool and drink. When we were done we went to my place to cuddle and make out. She didn't show any signs of discomfort and I made sure to ask if it was ok to touch breast when making out (she said yes). She said she wanted to have sex but wasn't sure if it was the right move since it was just our second date, so we didn't end up having sex but we kept cuddling and making out. Plus she also had to go to work early in the morning. So she left around midnight and we made out one last time before she left.

The next day we didn't meet up because she was working and was tired. I asked if she needed a ride home after work, but she replied with ""I drove here but thanks anyway ü•∞ü•∞"" I was already feeling kinda anxious if I did something wrong but that reply made me think that we were good.

So the next day I asked if she wanted to meet again sometime later within the next few days... but then she said ""I have to tell you something..."" 

So I said ""okay"" and was starting to worry if it had anything to do with our second date. So being the anxious dumbass that I am I sent her ""sorry if I made you uncomfortable last friday"" it took her around 40 minutes to open the message and reply. She said ""its ok... I dno"" I thought for sure she didn't want to keep seeing each other and I don't know what it is she wanted to tell me. So I asked if she wanted to stop going out with me? I realized my mistake and sent another message couple of minutes later ""sorry that I asked so quickly, take your time"" and she left me on read, I saw her ig story and she's out with a friend rn.

Hadn't really interacted with her outside of school stuff except I went to her house 1 time to ""talk"" nothing happened except for a lot of talking.

Fast forward 9 years later.

I was cleaning out some old HDD and usbsticks and came across all the photos that had been taken during schooltrips and found a couple of just me and her.
The feelings came back immediately. I decided to send them to her.
We began talking about the pictures and how I still had them.

I knew immediately that I would want to meet her again in real life. So I asked her if she would want to grab a drink with me.

She read the text a couple of hour's ago and hasn't responded. But I've seen that she been online a couple of times.

What would you guys/girls do in my situation?

I hope you all are in good health. 
Today, I am writing this because I am starting to give up on the idea of finding the one or being in love. Let me start, properly. 

I haven't been in a relationship in a long time, mostly because of past experiences/relationship and certain events plus I didn't felt that I was quite ready to be in one, and didn't wanted to make someone else suffer because of it, I avoided coming in one.

But now, when I am finally feel ready and want to be in one, I have been having nothing but awful experiences like I tried everything but something will just happen that will make it all go away, or will just act as a barrier/wall and I will be left alone questioning everything. 

Like, I want to be in love, like having that one person that I can talk to everyday, that I can take care of, be with her, go on dates and long drives with her, can have late night conversations with her on about anything. Like having someone I can finally turn to when I feel low, like having someone who just wants to be with me, and actually feels happy and filled with joy after seeing me, both of us will encourage each other to do our best and be there for each other when we need us the most. I know, that when I will find her, I will take care her of her, and love her a lot but I don't think that I am meant to be loved or that I can be in a relationship, like its not just not meant for me. Like, it's not made for me. I might be a little over dramatic here, but the thing is I have tried everything now, I mean people who don't even value their girls or their partners are still in relationship. Did anybody else went through something like that, or is it just me?

I am not here to complain but to put it lightly this is a one way relationship. Everytime I tell her I am leaving something drastic always happens. Someone dies or her parents are getting divorced or she goes to the emergency room and I feel terrible and stick around a few more weeks and just have an open convo about what I need to change for me to stay. Always promises to change.... Never does and we have the same fights all the time. At this point I don't even say anything I just do the extra whatever that she doesn't do to avoid her loud exhale and complining. Then I read on here how terrible dating is these days and I'm just thinking... I know I don't deserve this crap but is it better than trying to meet someone new.

My guy roommate is SO handsome and such a gentleman. He moved in a few months ago and I thought I heard a girl over a few times, but he said they were ""JUST FRIENDS"".

The past month he started asking me to hang out, buying me drinks, dinner, holding the door, telling me I was pretty, etc. He's never taken me in his car though, just to local bars within walking distance (2 minutes). 

We've spent a couple nights cuddling and he tried to have sex with me. We almost did but at the last minute I decided not to let him go in. 

Now we haven't hung out in 2 weeks and this weekend I heard the SAME girl that he said was ""just his friend"" over again, he took her out in his truck for dinner, and she spent the night in his room and I could awkwardly hear them having sex. 

I also checked Facebook and she appears to know his family and is in lots of photos of him posing at the beach. Regardless I asked him like 4 times and he still claims he doesn't have a girlfriend.

I have to live with him everyday and it's painful for him to have ignored me for the two weeks.
