0,nnbalb,1622247249,Am I reading these signs right?,"I have a good female friend that I've known for about 15 years. I will refer to her as S. We know each other well and we've definitely connected on some levels.

Recently we've taken on the subject of talking about relationships. We've gone back and forth in the past 48 hours on our wins and lows of dating; though both of us are single now. I'm definitely getting some vibes from as signs she may be welcoming to me asking her out. Here's a loose transcription of our conversation, edited for confidentiality of course.

S: Hopefully I'll have better luck in the future
Me: I haven't had the best of luck lately either
S: Ya I only attract &lt;redacted&gt;
Me: I only attract &lt;redacted&gt;
S: omg...hopefully both our luck changes

I feel like she's likely just being a supportive friend; but at the same time, I know I'm notoriously bad at reading women's signs and intentions. 

What does that conversation come across as? Should I be asking her out, or simply keep her as a good friend she's been to me for years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnbalb/am_i_reading_these_signs_right/

My ex was abusive and I'm very shy.","Backstory: My ex and I were together since I was 18/19 and she was my first real girlfriend. I'd been with a girl that was 14 when I was 12 but outside of that, she was my first girlfriend since that wasn't a proper relationship.

She cheated on me at a party and my friend (f) told me and I broke up with her. That was close to six months now and I'm not sure where to go, I've had 3 sexual partners since my girlfriend and I use to have threesomes with her friends and I'm somewhat experienced but it was sexual abuse in a way since most of the time I didn't want to do it and she would guilt me into it. Our relationship was toxic and she use to mentally manipulate me and we lived in her house that her parents gave her and I spent an entire year looking after her and not pursuing a career or life because I her.

*THE NEXT CHAPTER*

We were introduced through a friend and now I kinda lost almost all my friends since grew apart and I never made new ones because losing friends of 10 years was hard for me... I literally knew them half of my life!

I'm the shy/quiet guy and alright looking I'd say but definitely not great looking, I use to have huge self esteem issues because I was obese and hated myself but have lost most of my weight and looking for someone but still scared due to previous experiences.

My usual way of meeting people is smiling and nodding at them and going over to talk to them or I use to go and sit next to girls from college at lunch and talk to them but that didn't really go well! A girl I knew before that wasn't interested because she had a girlfriend told me that I'm very gentle and kind but yeah.

I tried online  like bumble and tinder but I rarely got swipes and when I did then I usually lost them because I'm not good at chatting up or looking for casual sex and I have poor social skills due to being autistic. Also I asked for profile advice I was told to take more far away shot but I have no one to take them.

Last week, her parents made her break up with me via text because they said that they disapproved of me being two years younger than her, not graduated college yet (I graduate in the fall), and not having a job lined up.

So when that ended, I decided there was no harm in telling my parents since it was over.

They got pissed. They got angry about me not telling them and said that they would have made me break up with her too because she’s two years older, was a film major in college, and because she doesn’t have a steady 9-5 or a guaranteed strong source of income from her online business.

Is it possible to move on too fast? Do I need more time to recover from the last guy? 

I had a friend from college I knew for years who liked me. I didn't at first but the more we talked, the more I feel for him. For a year, we texted and called each other often since I was living outside the US. Then this year, I moved back, to the same state as him and started seeing each other in person. 

He'd say ""I love you"" ""I've always cared for you"" ""you're a great partner"" and so on. We weren't in a committed relationship. He stopped texting me for a month and decided to reach out to a mural friend of ours. They know him longer and said that he's manipulative, cheated on all his exs and that I dodged a bullet. That he's been talking with her and telling her stuff (even though she doesn't like him and had a bf) and trying to get with someone else. 

We talked on the phone and he just apologized for not texted back and for the miscommunication. Because of some family issues, he didn't was to go further into he conversation. I understand that we weren't in a relationship but I felt really hurt since this was someone I trusted and knew for years. 

I know it's long and I left out some details to save time. This all happened over a week ago. He said he would check in with me but we haven't spoken since.
However, I feel like meeting new people. I'm not mad nor crying anymore. Not necessarily dating seriously, but something more casual.

18,nncnhy,1622252145,Should I(25) reconnect with one of my exes?,"Here is the situation. I've never  been in a long relationship with anyone. There were 2 times with 2  different girls that I always felt were the right match but I just  couldn't commit (for things like being scared of the big change, sharing  and being so related with someone, not because of ""wanting to be  single"") and chickened out. I recently have been thinking about this  girls, and to be honest I've been here before but now I feel I'm  thinking about them in a more serious way rather than ""a moment of  weakness"",  the problem is I am not sure weather I'm actually just a bit  lonely and if I do reconnect with them I will only bother them again.  What do you think are the chances they even want to know anything about  me, miss me, or hate me? They have a special place in my heart because  like I said I've never been in a serious relationship but felt like they  could really be one if it wasn't for my own fault. I honestly want to  reconnect with them even if we don't date again.  This are the girls:

First(5 years ago):

This  was a long time ago and I am really ashamed of how I handled it, for  the first time I felt I met someone like me(we were so alike) and who I  really liked and then started feeling weird about being in a  relationship and in that confusion I sort of distanced myself until we  started not talking so I never broke things of, and one time I met her  like a year after this and kind of played it dumb. She later texted me  why I did that and I answered ""I didn't know if you'd want"", she  replayed it's okay, next time I'll say hi to you. There was also an  incident of me getting a missed called from her at like 3am after we  broke up and not doing anything about it.

Second(2 years ago):

This  time the same thing happened even though I promised myself not to, I  met someone who maybe is not too similar to me, but we had a great vibe.  But eventually I spaced out, however this time I handled it properly  and made my decision and told her she is amazing but I am not in the  right head space to date someone, she said she also had a great time  with me and cared about me, but understood and thanked me for not  ghosting her.

Writing this I know  is a bit questionable to be talking about two girls, like I should maybe  pick who is the one I should contact. But like I said, I like this two  girls and I would love to reconnect with them even if we just chat for a  while, become friends or start dating again. I am here posting because I  want to make sure what I want to do is right. Do you think they would  want me to reconnect with them? Do you think I could be in a similar  place in their hearts? should I try to date with any of them if I am not  actually sure I won't do the same thing again(aka chicken out after a  while) I feel I am in a better spot in that regard now, but I have no  way of telling.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nncnhy/should_i25_reconnect_with_one_of_my_exes/

I met a girl through a mutual friend and asked her out. We had a really good first date and have since had quite a few hookups/hang outs since.

However, she is a little more…coy about her feelings towards me? Not to say she doesn’t have those feelings towards me, more the way she expresses them involve sarcasm or humour. 

The end result is I kind of feel dumb that she has “power” over me, while I don’t seem to have that on her. This is pronounced in the bedroom: I like mentioning how hot she is, but this often turns into her getting off on having control while also denying that I have any on her. I’m a switch and all but it feels shitty to have none of your seduction moves work….

24,nnczmo,1622253400,Got ghosted and the guy came back? Why?,"This isn't super recent, but I got ghosted a while ago and can still never figure out what or why it happened. **Please read the full thing before responding**.  I'm interested in mostly male perspective on this, but open to women's opinions too. I'm a female in my 20s.

I started seeing this guy after knowing him for about a year and a half. We both work in the same field and had met a few times. He always had made in clear he was interested in me, (I was open, but kinda unsure how i felt – as I usually am). We were both busy at the time and it took a while before we ever really started dating. 

He planned great dates, is smart and successful, tall, cute etc. We started seeing each other and it started out really great. And I started to like him a lot. and then at some point a few months later something got a little weird. Unsure exactly what happened. But I started to feel like he was pulling away or not trying as hard (I don't know if this was real or imagined tbh). Being young and immature at the time, my reaction to this was to do the same/ try and make him jealous (i know dumb).  I should have just said something. He started giving me the fade, and so I tried to confront him (via text) and talk to him about it and  he mentioned my behavior had bothered him (it was more of a fight than that, but in summary). So I had asked him to a drink and tried to apologize and told him I had feelings for him. It went fine, but two days later I got ghosted. He didn't ignore my texts, but he didn't respond to my last text and I wasn't about to try anymore after telling him I had feeling for him. I found out a month later he was seeing someone new (a person I know).

I learned a lot from this situation. It was also heartbreaking. I still don't know if I was being gas lit or what. In my mind he was dead to me. **I moved on completely.** 

About 8 months later, I see him at my work holiday party. I was kind of triggered and avoided him. He had tried to come say hi and just walked past him. I was honestly confused why he would come talk to me? 

Then a week later, I'm at a different holiday party and he is there again (I know weird coincidence but we work in the same field). I again avoid him. It's large enough that I easily can. I am at the bar talking to another guy and I notice him straight staring at me. Almost in a way that is socially awkward. I again avoid him...... pretend I don't see him.

Later in the night, he tried to come up to me again. I literally dodge him this time.  He comes up to me and asks me how I am – and I just say I'm good and walk away.

I text him a few days later and let him know why I acted that way and how much he had hurt me. He says that he is sorry and had no idea and he just thought we ""fizzled out.""

So this girl I’m talking to (20F) approached me (23M.) back in February and I said we should hangout we exchanged numbers and I kinda felt like she was playing so I ghosted her. Fast forward to April she msg me on IG and we’ve been talking ever since. Hell we fall asleep on FaceTime most nights. 
Talk quite a bit on the phone through out the day. 

We’ve both talked that we want more out of this and that’s the plan to work towards but want to take it slow. We’ve both had pretty bad relationships, her more so. 

We really click, have the same sense of humor. Conversations just flow too easily it’s great. Haven’t met a girl that I click w so well. 

When she told me about her ex and how they are still really good friends. I didn’t freak out, hell I didn’t really care bc we weren’t exclusive. I mean we’re still not to be clear. But seems like it lmao. 

her Ex (of one year.) she’s made it clear that they are just friends and she feels bad bc he literally has no one else (male or female.) her older sister and the ex are friends and always guilt her in to hanging out with them. She said she hates being alone with him but they got breakfast last Sunday. She tells me what they talk about and what not. Im thinking they’re stil friends bc of the emotional support they provided each other but didn’t work out. 

But is this something to worry about? Personally my view is if someone is going to cheat they’re going to do it regardless. And my life journey so far I’ve learned it’s not hard to leave people in the past (for me personally.) so part of me wants to trust her and carry on and the other part of me wants to say fuck it and move on. I was perfectly fine and happy before she came along. So it’s contradicting because idk if it’s a sign from up above that this is meant to be or it’s another Lesson. 

Personally, I’m trying to trust again and push through past experiences and insecurities. So I don’t fuck up something that could’ve been. But idk it’s just odd to me. Anybody have experience with this?

28,nnd666,1622254055,"Please STOP using friends (that you know like you) as emotional buffers for your previous relationship, it only gives them hope, and it's not fair."," 

Dating someone who isn't over their ex is like taking on someone else's credit card debt. You enter a relationship with someone who is still ""paying off"" a significant amount of energy and pain and you both aren't starting fresh from a zero balance. It's a very miserable start. For the partner, it feels like a massive burden to have to listen to the negative stories and comparisons and light comments about someone they don't even know. Even if those comments are meant to paint the current partner in a better light AKA ""you do xyz, my ex never wanted to do that"".

We all have history, we all mention our past partners a few times... but mentioning it constantly and linking it to everything you do or talk about will absolutely kill the potential. When you start a new relationship it should be a fresh start, and it's up to you to make sure your view on this new relationship isn't clouded by feelings from the past. Sure, you might never go back to your ex, or they might make you angry every time you think about them... but that's still mental and emotional energy being expended in areas that could otherwise be spent more productively. Your partner will feel this vacancy, and they will grow distant and disappointed the more it occurs.

Make sure you are wholehearted before bringing someone new into your life. Otherwise, you will actively contribute to the vicious cycle of emotional unavailability by making someone else feel as unhappy and unworthy as you had once felt with your last partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnd666/please_stop_using_friends_that_you_know_like_you/

He’s acted overprotective of me, he will rush to help me when I need it, has complimented my looks &amp; on my personality. He goes out of his way to talk to me sometimes. He’s teased me, called me a few pet names (I don’t really mind, we’re Midwestern and it’s somewhat of a thing around here).. maybe he’s just overly friendly, but I don’t really notice him acting like this toward other coworkers.

39,nne0gx,1622257132,Is it okay to date two people at the same time?,"Before I proceed, my definition of dating is going out with someone with the knowledge that both of us are developing an interest in each other  and want to find out more about each other. This would not include talking about a relationship together or me ever expressing any interest to do so. 

For the past four months, I’ve been somewhat interested in Guy A. We’re really getting to know each other as friends first (something I prefer when it comes to a potential relationship) so the physical intimacy isn’t there but the intellectual connection is. He’s pretty much my ideal guy and while I was the one more interested in him initially, it seems like the roles are reversed now. He’s been hinting at his feelings for me recently, but I know we’re taking it slow which is something I always envisioned myself doing in a relationship anyway. 

Enter three weeks ago, I reunited with an old friend of mine, Guy B. Things are moving quicker with him in terms of seeing each other more often and being physically touchy. Unlike Guy A where our relationship is more linear (i.e. getting to know each other as friends with knowledge we’re both interested then going out on official dates), Guy B and I are doing both stages at the same time. We’re learning about each other as we become increasingly physically open to each other. Though I prefer a more linear relationship, I’m learning to go with the flow and be spontaneous. 

I’m not emotionally there for either of them yet - hence why I’m single - and I’m sure neither of them are ready for a relationship either. To be clear, I’m emotionally available, but I don’t fall for people easily. 

To summarise everything, not a single person has expressed interest in a committed and monogamous relationship, so it is okay for me to continue talking to both guys and going out with them, right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nne0gx/is_it_okay_to_date_two_people_at_the_same_time/

41,nneipj,1622258926,My ex said I was abusive am I?(21F)(31M),"

Why was I the abuser?

I started dating Bo when I was 20 he was 29. I always thought we connected well we both had a dark sense of humor and love for film. He worked a decent job but over his life had bouts of depression where he has significant gaps in his resume. He didn't finish university because even though he went to a phenomenal university, he said the classes didn’t interest or challenge him enough. I



I work and go to school part-time at a university in the Los Angeles area. About six months into our relationship, he quit his job because he said they were not letting him progress. He had to move home to Denver in with his parents because he couldn't afford rent. I was devastated and hurt because I tried to talk to him about options for a new job, but he was stubborn and refused. I bring up how much it hurt he left he says he doesn't feel bad he did nothing wrong




He has been home for a year and a half not working because he says his depression is so severe. When he moved back, he tried to talk to me about suicide. I said I'm not a professional I love you, but you need to speak to a doctor I can't handle that. He brings up consistently how I abounded him in his time of need. He had gone to a residential treatment place before but left because he thought they were ripping him off and that their advice was terrible. I stopped dating him officially after he moved but still talked to him.




He would say that I'm a liar. He would always try to catch me in lies like ask me aggressively if I've taken my sleeping meds (I'm proscribed this) I feel awkward to put on the spot so I say no then he goes and counts my pills. If I send him a photo, he's checked the metadata to see if I'm lying and if I don't say the exact date he calls me a liar.


He says I lie more than anyone he knows. He brings up the time I drank some of my roommate's juice or smoked one of her cigs and said I didn't. We will be texting every day frequently. He’ll ignore me for days saying he can't talk because of the depression I get upset and try to text him.



He says I'm entitled and I'm not allowed to someone's attention that I need to learn boundaries. He would bring up regularly how he misses perks from his old job. If I ever criticized him or lost my temper with him he would say I’m the meanest person he’s ever met. When I bring up the mean stuff he’s said about me he says “everything I say about you is objective fact with evidence behind it everything you say is a petty insult”



I would say to him he quit that job for no reason he could quickly get it back or live with that choice. He says I'm mean because I never let him vent. He always tells me my memory is terrible and reminds me about lies in the past. When I try to bring up something from the past, he says,” I trust my memory MORE THAN YOURS.” When I lost my temper he’s sent screenshots of the texts to mutual friends making me look bad. I would never send private texts to a mutual friend.



His plans are nothing at this point he says he's just there that he isn't going to kill himself but too depressed to work. I stopped talking to him because of other reasons, but I can't stop shaking the feeling. Do I come off as a liar? Do I sound like a bad liar? I have bad anxiety and feel not open; sometimes, I go to therapy twice a week.

Do you think they would become salty that you ignored the, or think you're not interested?

I personally don't like getting to know someone and get heavily involved without being able to be with them physically. It's not very romantic to me. And things could feel totally different than when you're with them physically if you guys ever do meet and see how they're really like in person. I honestly think long distance relationships are really cringey. It just seems a bit childish to be head over heels in love with someone you never met or spent a good amount of time with. I'm 25 now and don't want to wait 2 years to be with someone. Plus face time dates are lame. And we all know long distance relationships rarely work out anyway. 

It got me thinking about whether or not it's true that timing matters? Some people say if someone is really interested in you distance wouldn't matter and they would still pursue you? do you believe this too?

why risk catching feelings for someone who you can't be with and might break up with anyway and get your heart broken and probably a few years of your life wasted?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnf4yk/do_you_think_timing_matters_if_you_really_like/

46,nnfd5p,1622262056,"I can handle straight rejection, but being led on and ghosted? Hits like a brick.","So many posts here are about ghosting. Just adding another rant. Rejection is obviously something everyone experiences at least once in their lives unless they avoid relationships or hit the jackpot and marry their first love interest. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you if someone turns you down; you just aren't compatible. He/she doesn't like you back? At least you shot your shot and can move on. 

But say someone is actually into you, or at least they appear to be. You tell them your intentions and they say they want to get to know you better and see where things go. Not exactly a rejection, right? So you continue to talk and develop a deeper connection until they one day disappear. Usually it's because they're afraid of commitment or found someone they liked better. But at this point you were already forming a relationship of some sort with that person for months only to find out you were on entirely different pages. Even if you saw it coming, it still hurts like hell. It feels like a breakup even if you weren't official.

So what do you do then? Move on, obviously. But unfortunately for people like me (8 months and going wtf), moving on isn't that easy. Rejections like these are closer aligned to being broken up with in a way. It's not the same as asking someone out and them telling you ""No thanks."" People like them are ex-somethings, ex-almosts, ex-maybes. And while it never would have worked out, it's hard to get over the blatant disrespect and realization that you were played.

(Yes, I'm serious when I say I'm still grieving after 8 months. I'm 17 and this was my first greater-than-a-crush kind of thing. I already have a realistic viewpoint on the situation but my unhealthy attachment persists to this day.

Is it because they worry the other will lie to them about their feelings to continue to get sex? 

Are there other 'costs' of having sex eg. Soreness, having to wash the sheets? 

This is a complex issue but I want to know if it's reasonable in the context of not being secure and worrying about hurt feelings. The clear reasons seem to be risk, being deceived, and other potential costs.

okay so this guy, (M 21), and i (F 21) have been talking for a while, since about mid-March. we matched on tinder and were basically talking here and there on snapchat and texting. he was really nice and respectful and i had to make the first moves and finally we move to texting and facetiming every night enjoying each other's conversation and HEAVILY flirting with each other. it was really nice and i even expressed my trust issues from men in the past and he was always to reassure me he didnt want to just fuck me but he wanted to take me out and do cute things and dates and what not. he lives three hours away, because we matched when he was visiting friends in my college town, but hes only about 45 minutes from my hometown which i'm going to be in the summer and we'll definitely be able to hang out. past few times i went home it was kinda rushed and didnt have time to meet up with him, so this past monday he decided to drive up for me. i was kinda nervous bc we hadnt met in person before but i knew it was gonna be fine bc we had been talking for two months and i thought it was gonna be a good time!! anyway, he drives up and its raining so hard we cant really go out and do anything so we stay home and just basically cuddle and do other things and watch movies the entire time hes here and he left the next afternoon. at some point when we were together, i told him i felt vulnerable because i had never been that close for that long with someone like that including showering and just romantically sharing my space with someone over 24 hours and he said he was too and idk we connected and had good conversation and nothing felt weird after we had sex either. everything felt pretty good and natural. but now hes at home and the first day back he was asleep and tired and granted thats fine because i was too but day by day hes been drier and drier with his conversations and when it was flowing and i would try to flirt he would avoid it and when i asked why he was avoiding me flirting he said he was ""so high"" and then declined my ft call too. which i dont understand bc i was just trying to have conversation like we were having before he came up to visit me. now i think he's definitely avoiding me (and dont say hes busy bc even when he was busy and going thru stuff before he would let me know or always get back to me) because he hasnt watched anything ive posted on my story left my snaps on open and even has my text left on delivered. and i had asked him if i did something wrong? i feel it in my gut something is wrong and its just like if he didnt get what he expected he should tell me but i think hes not going to and then fish me along to have sex again or something. i'm not being crazy right because i feel like its completely valid to wonder where his energy has gone? is there anything i should say or do to make him come back or or should i just see how he reacts these next few days and if he decides to reply to my message and then confront him for using me for sex?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nni0qf/idk_what_this_guy_21_wants_after_he_told_me_one/

71,nnie9i,1622274539,Dogs and Personality Issues,"So I'm approaching 30 (29M, birthday in 17 days), and there's something that's been a concern for me for the past few months of dating, and in particular online dating. Thought to bring these feelings to Reddit to see if there's further general consensus on this, or if I really am a huge outlier for feeling this way.

Whenever I'm looking at someone's online profile, whether it's Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, I've noticed a few specific qualities in people related to dogs:

\- Profile pictures with their dog. Often the first photo!  
\- Prompts, or bios, that specifically state their dog as their main priority. Statements such as ""must love dogs,"" ""my dog is my best friend,"" or my personal favourite, ""will love your dog more than you.""

Now I really don't know where exactly to start with all this. I feel like I'm a huge outlier in feeling this way, but please I would like to address the following:

\- If your main profile picture is you with your dog, this gives off the impression to me that you don't have any personality outside of your dog.  
\- In a statement that's more based on an all-encompassing personality judgement - if your dog is such a main portion of your profile, and if this is what one bases their whole personality on, are we somewhat doomed as a society in knowing that this is actually somewhat of the norm?

Don't get me wrong here - I know I probably come across as someone who doesn't like dogs. This is not the case!! Dogs are adorable, and teach tons of life lessons in regards to responsibility and empathy. However, we are human beings, and our first priority should be ensuring we are able to connect with others on a meaningful level. The amount of people who base their entire social lives on their dogs is extremely disturbing to me, and which is why I always ask the question about dogs, and if the person's lives revolves around their dogs, during the first conversation (not even the first date)! I cannot be bothered with someone who's entire existence revolves around their dog(s).

(Which hardly anyone.) long story short I suck at socializing when I like someone. I don’t know how to validate because it scares me to be vulnerable. I always imagine they’re going to exploit it. Well after a lot of dating. I got into contact with a guy I’ve been crushing on since I was 16. We hit it off and hung out after I got off of work at 8 pm till like 3 a.m. and even then we didn’t wanna go home. There was nothing sexual we literally just talked and talked and at some points I rested my head on his shoulder. And he didn’t move away from me like I was used to. He validates me, and tells me things he remembers I like or said. I want to be as validating to him but I am scared to and I think I am sabotaging myself. We got intimate in a natural way that i actually really liked and he still talks to me (yes I’m realizing I talked to a lot of Assholes for this to be as exciting as it is for me.) we hung out with his friends, I know ppl in his family including his mom. Idk if it’s his ex or the fact that I’m not the best at social cues because I get nervous when I like someone. I try not to show it but I think it shows in my reactions. I am scared to show emotion. He ended up telling me the other day he doesn’t want a relationship rn but if it happens it happens. And then texted me saying he doesn’t think he could handle one right now but still keeps in contact with me. Did I sabotage myself because I come off emotionally unavailable?

77,nniqgk,1622275995,Today I realized how lonely I am right before a hookup,"I don't really expect anyone to read this. I just use these forums to blast my thoughts and feelings into the anonymous void, and somehow it helps me. She here it is.

All I want is someone to date. I want to meet someone and fall in love slowly as we get to know each other and just enjoy our lives together. I haven't had sex since my last relationship 6 months ago. But I really haven't even been trying to meet people.

I met this one girl I really liked, we have a lot in common, we hung out quite a bit but for whatever reason she lost interest and I quit trying because I didn't want to force something with someone who didn't want to make an effort to see me.

Then today I met my new neighbor. She's really cute. So we're talking while we're doing laundry. And it's going well. I ask her to a little concert that's happening tomorrow. She says yes, we trade numbers. 
Anyway she hit me up tonight and was like, ""you got movies"" and I'm like yeah come over. She gets to my place and she's just drunk. And I'm sure it could have gone one way, but I just felt weird with someone who definitely couldn't drive and probably couldn't consent. So I just put on Netflix and sat down and watched it and kept my distance and it was awkward and then she's like, ""I'm going to go back to my place"" and it was just down the hall so I knew she could make it there safely so I just said sure. We hugged and I walked her to the door. I texted her after just hoping I didn't make things weird and maybe hopefully we can try again when she's sober but I kinda get the feeling that won't happen.

Now I'm just sad. I want a relationship. And for the last 6 months I've been thinking about downloading tinder again for some hookups but I could have had one Tonight but all I could think about was how I just wanted emotional connection with someone. I am just so fucking lonely in this world, I have no one to share my passions and interests with and it just sucks. And I kinda didn't realize how down I was till tonight.

81,nnjbe4,1622278503,Can I control my feelings before they grow? Are they mutual?,"A little background, it’s not really a “friend” per se. it’s my ex’s best friend (ex is engaged now so it’s okay). We haven’t talked in years and then had a little encounter over social media and realized we’re both kinky so we decided to go at it. 


He texts me good morning and goodnight and checks up on me every day, we see each other once a week for a whole day. His last relationship started off like this and he got heartbroken. This is my first time trying this “FWB”. 

He’s very adamant about not having feelings, since the beginning. 2 months in now, I expressed I’m a little scared that I might develop any. He explained how he loves this and doesn’t want to lose it and it can’t be a relationship because he’s not into me and if I can try to control my fear and he would even help, he just doesn’t want to catch any feelings. 

Since this is my first time, I’m not sure, but I find it a little hard to believe. He explained he’s very comfortable around me and that takes him months. When I catch him gazing at me, he smiles and tells me how beautiful I am, kisses my forehead. He always kisses my hands, holds them, smells my hair. He always wants me to sleep over. He always compliments me, always texts me saying he misses me. Every time we’re done with sex he asks me “where do you see us in 6 months?” Like... you just said you’re not into me so obviously either still fucking or just going back to being strangers/acquaintances. 

I’m not THAT into him, I’m just scared because it’s all really new to me and I’ve been single for quite a while. So, I’m okay with it staying the way it is... but we were very honest and transparent from the beginning and that’s why I professed my fears. Maybe he is being honest but his actions tell a different story. 
My question(s) are am I reading too much into it because I’m new, maybe he’s honest? Is this how you act with your FWB (considering you never really were friends)?

Same with “looks don’t matter” or “ur height doesn’t matter”. Studies have shown that looks and height are some of the most important factors for a girl looking at guys. Definitely in the top 5 most important.

91,nnl6lb,1622286385,"""You're failing in OLD because you are only swiping on hot guys...""","I’ve seen a lot of guys on here criticize women who have had bad luck/experiences with OLD and say they are choosing the wrong guys/only swiping on hot guys. I wanted to make this post to bring a different perspective into light as I find this argument flawed for several reasons;

**Not all are only swiping on hot guys.** 

* I myself have had crap luck whether I talked to/went out with a guy I thought was very attractive or a guy I thought was average or less than attractive. When I was using OLD I was looking for a real, genuine connection and possible relationship but many of the guys on there only were looking to hookup, have something casual, or fwb. The level of attractiveness of the guy did not matter. Guys who were conventionally attractive were this way and so were guys who were not conventionally attractive. I have gone out with guys who were 5’6-5’9, skinny and not super fit, average looking, and “nerdy.” I attend an engineering college so many of the guys at my school fall into this category. And many of them also were only after sex. It’s not only tall, fit, hot guys on these apps looking for hookups it’s definitely also ugly/average guys as well. 
* Maybe many women are being extremely picky with looks and only swiping on hot guys but this is not all women so please do not assume it is and assume that’s why a girl has been failing in OLD.

**Even for the ones who are being physically selective, if roles were reversed wouldn’t you do the same? So why get mad and blame them?**  

* I understand the power dynamic with dating apps is skewed immensely, esp in the early stages. Women and attractive guys do get more matches than most average men which leads to more options. It may be unfair but that is just how our society is in general. So if roles were reversed and say you are a very hot guy or a girl, would you not choose to message the matches you found the most attractive first? Hate to say it but OLD is extremely shallow because it is primarily based on looks. You swipe on someone you find attractive and hope they find you attractive and you go from there. So if you had 100+ matches why would you message the girl you are least attracted to? So why blame women and get mad at them for not doing that? I myself have swiped on guys I found less attractive eventually because at one point I did think maybe that was my problem but it still ended in the same result. Yes there are women who are very selective physically, but there are also men this way and if roles were reversed and you are the hot guy with 50+ matches or the girl with 100+ wouldn’t your first messages go out to those you find most attractive and desirable?  Even if you aren’t being selective in swiping, and you get a ton of matches because you are a hot guy or a girl, How is it possible to message and talk to all 50-100+ matches? Guys complain we aren’t giving the “right guys” a chance when maybe there are only 10 “right/good” guys out of the 100 matches. 

**There are several problems with people's failures with OLD and attractiveness level is only one.**

* Attractiveness is a huge problem but it is by far not the only reason both men and women have problems and bad experiences with OLD.  A lot of men seem to jump at the reason women have bad experiences is because they are choosing only the hottest of guys and those guys are bad people and it's her fault for choosing a fuckboy in the first place. This is not the only reason women or anyone has a shitty experience with OLD so please stop using that as the only reason. 

Many people, no matter their level of attractiveness, are only looking for hookups, so finding someone genuine and who is not is hard. Also a lot of people there are unsure of what they want to begin with. You end up matching and clicking with people who want different things from you very often even if it seems the same in the beginning. Another thing, it seems a lot of people use OLD when they are not emotionally available, are fresh out of a relationship, or too busy in school/their career. This leads to a string of problems such as ghosting, leading on, pump/dumps, or getting back with exes and hurting the people they met. Lastly, OLD has also just made the culture of hooking up even more strong and appealing to both genders so it’s hard for those who aren’t into that to find something genuine.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnl6lb/youre_failing_in_old_because_you_are_only_swiping/

93,nnls53,1622288786,Confused 😕. What do you think I should do?,"There's this friend [21f ]. We been friends since we were kids. We don't usually check up on each other. Although she has a boyfriend, she texted me last two weeks saying she likes me and that we're meant to be together(soul mates). And yet she doesn't text me first unless she needs something. And when I do text her she sometimes doesn't reply. I think I like her too but I'm kinda confused and losing interest. Do you guys think I should still continue texting her or forget her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnls53/confused_what_do_you_think_i_should_do/

97,nnmfax,1622291145,Gotta get this experience off my chest...,"Last October, I (m23) found myself on Omegle of all places. Yeah, I know. That was problem number 1. Yet one night, I met this girl. We’ll call her Izzy. Izzy and I hit it off, and had added each other on our socials. Over the next few months, I would spend practically every day talking with her, laughing with her, playing video games with her, everything. I felt like we became really close. She struggled with depression and self esteem and I was more than happy to be there for her best I could. Embarrassing to say, but she struggled with money, and I helped her out many a time there as well. It all made no difference to me. I really liked this girl. She felt like the closest thing I’ve ever had to a girlfriend. In my actual life I had never been on a date, or even kissed a girl to this day. Having her around was a feeling I hadn’t had before so maybe I was disillusioned. Anyway, come March she had started to become distant and wouldn’t call me anymore. Next thing I know, I wake up one morning and she sends me a message saying “sorry for being a huge burden in your life, goodbye” and that was it. All ways of contacting her either deleted or blocked. 

I know this is all really my own fault but, I guess I’m just looking for advice on trying to find worth in all this. I think somehow this experience has made me feel even worse about myself. I’m not sure what to do to be confident and feel like I can go out and attract women.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnmfax/gotta_get_this_experience_off_my_chest/
98,nnmmrz,1622291898,Emotional unstable made me attractive,"All my life, talks about dating made me angry. I told people that if you like a person, just tell them. I grew up with all kinds of people and I noticed early when people were interested in each other and helping those to take the first step were much easier than taking care of my interests in people. I grew and on those years I noticed when there were those who liked me more than as friends, I were scared, flustered and shy. ""How should I respond? I like that person but not in that way.. how should say it without hurting them"" deep down i knew it was more on both ways, if they get hurt I will get hurt. But a selflish thought made me confused at the same time. ""I dont like him/her""


Background
A flash through my life I saw many times that my parents werent lovey dowey as others, my parents didnt have any real common interests with each other either. They were yelling at each other alot and many times it escaleted to whole family yelling. They talked nicely and cordely when they were out, making the facade that everything was great. When my mother told me ""You children are my everything"" I thought to myself ""What about father?"" 

Both of my parents are great, do not think otherwise. In my whole life they were strong and were as human they should be. It was just at this moment I began too see my mother as an enemy that I both respected and feared. My father were idolized as the more funny and easy going and I thought he deserved better. I still liked my mother but not as much. But as life dicates in the years older you see the layers of grey.

Still I vowed to never be like them, if I were to find a love interest we should be friends as a top priority. A vow who sounds lovely and sound.. but as life is complicated a vow can make life more complicated.


People liked me when I grew up, I knew when people liked me and knew when my actions made others my enemies. I made  people feel more worth in themself and others the latter. I saw myself as great, on top to greatness yet I didnt want it. Just imagining that I could do it was a great feeling. Life could made me into player but loving to observe and try to understand the layers made all better. At a point it can be a weakness, when growing up you want see were you fit. Where you can use what you are as a person to thrive as a living being. 

It became several weaknesses for me that I began too see and slowly turn the hate to myself. 

I began to move, using this as an advantage and I noticed the strong feelings could make me change. I began to loathe myself and uplifting my family and friends on piedestals. ""I may be the worst but I must get better because they are the best"" at same time I could look down at people. An unhealthy habit that both did the worst and the best into me. Still people liked me, they couldnt see it but if they were happy with me, thats okay. 

The strong feelings for others and loathe of myself was made to my own desire. Attraction and love were to those made me change most. I have a very shy nature when it was about the feeling expressing love to another person. I also had several chances in my life for a real romantic relationship. But it was especially one who made me see ""Is this what I want be for that person?"" 

At that time my strong feelings of love made myself more dangerous to myself. I wanted to tell about how I struggled, but I couldnt. The person I were in love with struggled with its own struggle, that I knew of but my clouded mind made me stop in motion. A part of me wanted to run and another to stay. I couldnt talk, couldnt express the layers I had. I couldnt give what the person deserved, because I were scared. Scared to truly love and love myself. I wanted always to run a quality not desired for a long term relationship.

I did my mistakes and learnt more of me and others, but learned the most to love myself so I can use it for others. I believe I saw truly what they saw in me, it was my unstable and mind they liked. Nowa days people still like me, but the social circles is smaller and im content in living by myself. And I spend alot time alone and loving it. I see fascinating eyes on me as now i have embraced my insecurities and confidence I have. It can also be the funky hair they look at.

Now Im looking for a person as a long term romantic friend that I love for all the layers they are and what I am. If not im not finding the person, then its okay. Because life is pretty good.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnmmrz/emotional_unstable_made_me_attractive/
99,nnmwer,1622292864,My ex called because I accidentally liked a pic snooping.,It’s been 2/3 months since we broke up. We went to no contact but broke it after a month we argued. Now I had a feeling he had reconnected with his ex before me so I went snooping. He called asked how I been &amp; there wasn’t any hard feelings. He joked about the “accidentally caught snooping”thing. Because he got caught doing it a couple weeks before lol There was a lot of small talk like he was trying to get me to talk but I’m still upset. He said he’s been working on himself he went threw a couple things that led to our break up. But he said I was wondering if you had anything to say? I asked if it mattered because I feel like I’ve said a lot that he didn’t acknowledge. He said it would but I didn’t say because I knew I would cry. I’m emotionally drained I don’t know how to feel. I’ve been in a mild depression since &amp; I’m always wishing for hope. He said I’ll talk to you again sometime. I’m wondering if “no hard feelings” mean goodbye/it’s over? I don’t know if there is any hope. Was this just little talk or a sign of hope?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnmwer/my_ex_called_because_i_accidentally_liked_a_pic/
