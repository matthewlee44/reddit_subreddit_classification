It was more of a passive approach. I’d go about my normal life be open to the possibility and it seemed to work out ok. Obviously I didn’t get as many dates as when I was in OLD but they were higher quality ones so I was pleased. Whenever I felt lonely I had a couple of single friends I could hang with...one of which we physically comforted each other on rare occasions. 

Then covid hit. My previously single friends got married, I pretty much didn’t interact with anyone except one coworker and even my occasional NSA hook up doesn’t seem to be an option.

So I thought about putting myself out there again but I’m thinking I might just wait. I want to have some single friends to rely on again, get more active and healthier (quarantine meant I spent too much time on my ass binge watching shows) and getting settled at my great new job.  When I look at it like this I can see it’s probably going to take another year before I’ll feel like enough of myself to hit the singles scene and that kinda bums me out.

Sounds amazing so far, right? He will text in between dates, and sets them up in advance but when I text back he takes up to 12hrs to respond.  He sometimes will ask a question and I’ll answer and then get crickets...which is completely frustrating.  Why ask a question if you have no intention of following up?  I’ve mentioned how this a trigger for me due to past relationship cheating trauma and he said he’d work on it.      He has two phones for work and one personal phone, so he’s always connected.  I just got a tattoo done and was sitting for it for 6hrs and he hasn’t even inquired about it.  To me this is an indication of lack of interest.  I realize everyone has different communication styles, but if you were really interested in a person wouldn’t you be more invested in their daily life?  

It also seems like now that he has me “locked in” the communication has waned a bit.  Prior to our first date we’d talk on the phone at length and that has completely evaporated.

I (F41) met Javier (M32) on Bumble in September 2020. We hit it off immediately. He was clear right away that he wasn't looking for a relationship right off the bat (he actually said he was just looking to meet new people and new friends) for reasons that would later become clear to me. I was always clear that I was looking for a relationship. 

Well, without boring you with the details, you know how the best laid plans go. We dated exclusively for about six months (during the pandemic, meaning that we spent a lot of one on one time together), neither one of us changing our minds about what we wanted. What did become operative information over the course of the six months was why he didn't want a relationship - his father had passed away six months before we met in March 2020 and at the same time, he realized the six-year relationship he was in wasn't what he wanted in April 2020. He felt like he was always ""falling into"" relationships and not making the conscious choice to be in one. In short, his world had been shaken up and spit out and he had a lot to figure out about himself going forward. 

I understood this. The upheaval in his life is unprecedented, especially in the midst of a pandemic. I once asked him, ""What if you met the right person for you right now? What would you do?"" He said, ""I would blow it. I wouldn't even recognize it. I am not open to it.""

We broke up almost two months ago. We finally had to come to terms with the fact that we weren't (and never were) on the same page and it was getting into territory where someone (me) was going to get very hurt. It was amicable, respectful, and kind. It almost felt like we were on borrowed time as it was. I'm not over him (and I don't anticipate I will be anytime soon) but I also recognize and accept where he is in life. I know sometimes ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" is just an excuse, but it isn't here.

When we were breaking up, he truly wanted to find a way for us to stay in each other's lives. Our friendship was strong and we both opened up to each other so much that it almost seemed like we shouldn't let romantic timing get in the way of our connection. I told him I needed time and space and he told me to take whatever I needed. 

I reached out to him this past weekend and asked if he wanted to go on a hike next week. He said yes. In the past week, I've vacillated between ""I'm not ready"" to ""But I accept where he is in life.""

I'm not over it. I just know that right now - and for the foreseeable future - that a relationship with him is not going to be an option. He needs to heal, he needs to make sense of the world in the wake of his dad's death, and he needs to not get roped into yet another relationship. But I miss his friendship - and I know he misses mine - so much.

I love my kids, and I've been a damn good dad to them through some rough times.  I'm blessed to have a healthy and loving relationship with all three.  I'm also ready for the proverbial finish line and empty nest.  I know that I don't have a proverbial round 2 of parenting left inside of me at this point in my life.  I know how much effort it took.

I guess my question is ""Are most (or nearly all) childless yet educated and successful women in their early to mid 40s still looking to bear and raise kids of their own?""  Or have I just run into a small sample size statistical anomaly.  Because to my experience that desire to have kids has become the general rule rather the exception.

As an extension from another post by a member who thought he was ugly, many replies referred to ""staying in his league"" or ""searching below his league""...... all of which were referring to appearance only.

Are there really aesthetic ""leagues"" in which were expected to play in? How do we know which league we ""belong in""? Is there a way to specifically categorize each of these leagues? If we figure out which league we belong in, should we then be dismissing people in other leagues? Who decides which league is higher or lower?

For me, I have no idea which league I would belong to. Some people find my very attractive, while others dont at all, and still some others have no opinion at all.

Additionally, I have ZERO standards as to a persons physical ""build sheet"". I truly couldn't care less what a persons genetic design is. I care about the person inside. Yes, the mind shapes our we present ourselves. That matters! But how our genetic code came together? I'm all in for every shape, color, or size. Asymmetry is the artistry in genetics for me.

Well, communication slowed noticeably since then.  I finally asked him what was going on, and he said he thought maybe we shouldn't see each other because if he can't have sex anymore he doesn't want to ""put me through"" it.  Mind you, he hasn't seen his doctor yet (later this week), had any tests done or even tried a little blue pill.  There could be dozens of reasons why it wasn't working that don't necessarily mean a bigger problem.

We dont live together but I'm worried that when we do it will become a big issue. I don't want it around me or my children or in my house.

He has a one bedroom place- I know they probably stared a bed. Goodness we are adults- we all know they did more than share a bed. 


I am not upset but I feel like I just need more space than 24 hours between her being in his bed and me coming over. I wouldn’t have any problems seeing him next weekend (because time and space helps that sloppy seconds vibe go away) but he leaves out of town for two weeks this Thursday and then I’m on vacation for a week. So I felt like I needed a boundary here and simply suggested skipping our Tuesday rendezvous this week and said Let’s rally in a few weeks when we are both back in town. He said he understood- said yes he only has one bed and he and this friend will randomly stay with each other to visit over the past 5 years.

 I know the best way once and for all is for me to get tested but the fear of that knowledge ( and I would share it) just drives me to deep despair because of the stigma. I just don't think mentally I would be able to handle it.

It seems that I often attract and date women who express the desire to be with a man who can talk about his emotions and have good communication in a relationship. These women have also told me they think I'm quite good at expressing myself and feel it's a relief over previous partners who are unable to do so. Yet inevitably, when issues in our relationship arise, they are unable or unwilling to talk, often going silent for several days despite my attempts to reach out. It ends up causing strain and ultimately the end of the relationship.

I also like photography sometimes, though that also doesn't usually lend itself to being around a lot of people.

Over the years, I never really thought of joining a group to go out and do things, and lately I feel like maybe I should have.  I feel a little awkward going out to do activities by myself, though I recently (in the past few weeks) went out to a trivia game and a bingo game alone.  I sat with some people at a table for the trivia game, which was fun.

As far as meeting someone at work, the jobs I've had in the last 20 years usually have all or mostly males employed at the workplace.

It just feels like it would be hard for me to meet a woman in person who I'd end up dating.  It feels like it pretty much never happens for me.  Also I desire a relationship, but it seems like when meeting people in person, it could take a while to build rapport for a woman to even be comfortable going out on a date.

However, I keep getting these little cringey moments with some of his texts. He's been asking me to send him selfies, ""send me a pic of you right now"", type of requests.

Glass of wine turned into dinner (he asked). Hug and a tasteful kiss goodnight. Fellow church goer and a lot of great parallels. Attracted to one another also.

I always respond back happy to hear from him and looking forward to hear how his trip went, safe travels back etc. Met for 2nd lunch date. That was great conversation more in depth and we were also on the same page and sharing about things that were happy stories and laughing. Parted ways also with hug and kiss. He waved from his car happily as I passed him down the road to reach my turn. He was getting back into his work routine for end of month (finance). Understandable that is busy.

Notably, most of my pairings have involved strong chemistry &amp; significant dysfunction.  I've dated a few cheaters &amp; my last major relationships were with a narcissist (6 years), an alcoholic (12 years), someone with significant mental illness (2 years).  I've been working on healing my codependent tendencies &amp; unhealthy relationship patterns.  

I got back on dating apps a couple of months ago to distract myself from the FWB because I was trying (again) to cut things off.  OLD is pretty dismal in your 40s.  I kept matching with guys in their early 30s (maybe I should adjust my filters) but I'm not really looking for a young guy for a summer fling, I want companionship.  Someone to go for walks, bike rides, to watch sunsets, watch movies, etc. 

I was just getting ready to delete my apps about 3 weeks ago when I stumbled upon a guy on Hinge who was very attractive to me &amp; only 4 years younger. He gave me his # the next day &amp; we started texting daily.  We've had a couple of phone calls, too.  Conversation flowed super easily &amp; the vibe was entirely different than the anxiety I felt with my FWB.  I told him I think he's my kind of weird :)  

We met up for a walk/lunch about a week into communicating.  I was nervous that I'd be blinded by chemistry (again)  While he's a good-looking guy, I wasn't blown away by physical attraction (thank god!).  But I liked his chill vibe &amp; openness.  We're much better aligned than the last guy.  My closest friend thought I wasn't interested because I wasn't talking about him incessantly after the first date. I'm usually ***super*** into someone right away or definitely not.  This is a grey area.  I definitely like him, but not because of chemistry, because I like him as a person. What a concept!  Honestly, what's most attractive is what a dedicated dad he is to his 12-year old daughter. He also told me early on  that he's not a fan of dating, either.  He just got out of a 2-year toxic relationship; it sounds parallel to my last experience, 

I'm trying to determine his interest level. He texts every day, but it seems to be less voluminous than before we met. He sends selfies pretty regularly; including some chest/torso shots of him in bed--but nothing inappropriate. He also sends me videos of him playing guitar &amp; piano, he's a really talented musician. But he hasn't suggested meeting up again.  So at the risk of sounding totally clueless, I'd like feedback from those who are less ambivalent daters.  Does he seem interested?  Should I just ask him out again--I was planning on it. I don't just want to text, I want to meet up &amp; get to know him better, even if he ends up being just a friend.

I’ve gone to her house, made plans, set up a date, etc. She has probably been to my house or driven to see me less than 5 times. The last time she has been to my house was in October and that was only because our flight got cancelled and we had to wait to leave again the next day and I live closer to the airport. I’m not a slob and my house is not dirty, dangerous, or in a bad part of town.

I really like this woman, and enjoy my time with her immensely. We see each other every couple weeks, though things have cooled off in the bedroom by agreement.  I've made it clear we are dating casually, and I know she's still meeting and going out with other guys. 

Anyway, today is my birthday and she asked what my plans are.  I'm going to an hibachi restaurant with my 12-year-old daughter, who knows about her and has indicated she'd like to meet her.  So I asked my lady friend to join us, without thinking it might be a big deal to meet one of my two kids.

Never married, seldom date, and I want to start dating soon. Ever since college, whenever a man approaches me in some sort of social setting and I think “hmmm, he seems nice, maybe he’s single and he’ll ask me out,” within the first five minutes of talking to me he mentions his girlfriend or wife. And this afternoon it happened in Facebook Messenger. 

This man and I are both members of a Facebook music fans group. We live near each other, have a few Facebook friends in common, and ended up Friending each other. 
Recently in Facebook Events, I said I was interested in seeing a concert in the park nearby. This afternoon, this man messaged me and asked if I was going to that concert and wanted to meet there. 

After checking my calendar — and wondering if this could be a meetup for locals in our Facebook group — I messaged him back saying yes, I was going. 

And as I waited for a reply, then I thought, could this possibly be a date?!? After wondering if or when or how to finally start dating after over a year of isolation, could this be something?

He replied saying he was waiting to find out if one of his friends was going. And his wife wasn’t sure yet if she was going. 

So once again, someone seems interested in me then tells me he has a wife. People never seem to believe me when I tell them this happens nearly every single time a man approaches me. And no, I absolutely do not want to become involved with a married man. Or any man who almost immediately tells me he’s already involved with someone. Not that they ever do ask me out in the first place. 

We women often tell men about non-existent boyfriends or husbands when we want a man to leave us alone. But why have so many men done this to me since I was a college freshman?

Please i need your advise.
I have been dating for 3 weeks a man that (for the first time in my life) seems very promising. We share the same culture, values, we have the same age and we want the same things for the future. Our communication was naturally since the first minutes we spoke, he’s affectionate and kind, calls me for hours, every day, we are attracted by each other but... yesterday he started to act weirdly.

First of all, on Monday he said that he was going to have a very busy week and the he was going to go “off” the phone.
I understood because I know his planning for this week and it’s truly crazy (he’s moving and he’s also very busy with job and kids).
BUT yesterday night he sent me a text on WhatsApp at 23:36 saying that he was going to sleep and that I would be the last person he was going to have in his mind before sleeping.
I felt happy. But at 00:10 I wanted to see again his last messages on WhatsApp and, when I checked, I saw him online.

So I sent him “I tough that you are sleeping and that I was the last in your mind before sleeping, I see that I’m not the only one”.
He answered “pardon???” And I didn’t reply.
This morning he asked me what was happening and I explained him how I felt after having seen his actions not matching his words.
He said that I mustn’t jump on conclusions, that he’s not a liar, that he cares on our relationship and doesn’t want to spoil it with suspicions. That the fact that he was online didn’t mean he was talking to other women, that his mother had called him (at 00:10?) to tell him that he’s father, who’s suffering of Alzheimer, had left the house again (it’s a problem that I knew already).
He said “next time you have a doubt, instead of jumping in conclusions, please ask. I want that things works between us”. We agreed on this.

So this night he was supposed to pack his stuff with his daughter. At 23:14 I sent him a good night message and saw that he was online on WhatsApp. But since we had had that conversation, I was serene.
I checked my emails on my phone and at 23:25 (9 minutes later) I received a notification from Signal (the competitor of WhatsApp). I opened it and signal was announcing me that (him) had just joined Signal.

How can I avoid to jump on the conclusion that, for the second night in a row, I found him on WhatsApp late at night, the week where he is supposed to go “off” the phone as he’s so busy, and that he just installed signal in order to avoid that I see him online again on WhatsApp?
“In case of doubt, just  ask” he had said... so I went on WhatsApp and I asked him “have you joined signal?” His answer “yes longtime ago”. To which I replied “I have just receive the notification”. 
At the same time he sent me a pic of his “work in progress” with boxes, so I said good night.
He answered that he likes me a lot and wants that things works between us.
I didn’t replied.

What I am supposed to think? And to do? 
I really believed in him, he seemed so “genuine”. so “honest” compared to the men I’ve met until now (in 2 years of OLD).
