I'm currently trying to revamp my profile and starting an Instagram account to post random photos I took

Background: I'm a 24 years old guy. I've never been interested in dating before, nor in friendships either; I was too depressed, too overweight, and too poor to afford any kind of fun. However things started taking a shift recently. During the pandemic I lost so much weight (90lbs) and got into my dream MSc degree. I graduated this summer and signed a job offer after my summer internship, that was a month ago. It had been 6 consecutive years of studying and working excessively, I was extremely burnt out. I took my signing bonus and planned a trip solo, visited 8 of my favorite cities around the world and took really good pictures in each one (with a Fujifilm x-t200). 

Now I finally have a lot of things I never had before (job, money, fit body, mental stability etc). I'm getting on dating apps but honestly my first experience was traumatizing. I'm thinking about adding those pics from my trip to showcase my personality. I'm just too worried about how they'd be conceived of. Is it too pretentious/shallow? Is it a terrible idea?

11,pziszx,1633127774,"How do people who ""date casually"" while looking for a better partner live with themselves?","I genuinely don't understand this fake-casual dynamic lol. How can someone be so evil as to rationalize keeping someone in a relationship / situationship while also being unsure of what they want and actively looking for someone to replace their partner? 

It's spoken about so casually. I don't get it. As an adult aren't you supposed to realize that you're inflicting horrible trauma on your partner that will take years or even decades to resolve? Aren't you supposed to stop for a second and say ""hm, well maybe I should stop traumatizing them and wasting their time""? Especially when one of them is more in love with the other one. I genuinely do not understand how childish this behaviour is, and yet it's basically the norm in our society. 

Don't get me started on the ""oh we're just using each other"" trope. Nope. I will never understand how people will go out of their way to minimize entire months or years of time spent with another person. 

I think people use it as a flex, to an extent. For instance, they have such a good support system you can fall back on to whisk them away at a moments notice, so they blindly allow themselves to step on other people and form situationships while narcissistically focusing on their personal melodramas. Most people don't have the luxury of being able to go on a bunch of vacations or 'busy themselves' with their incredible lives after experiencing something so devastating. So why are we letting these types of people walk all over everyone else. 

Any time I hear a story like this one, I immediately think of Jennifer Coolidge's character from the white lotus - just completely delusional.

She's absolutely stunning, tall and fit. On our first date, I thought she's pretty cool, we had common things to talk about etc, then we went to my place and watched a movie. During the movie, we touched each other and eventually kissed each other, which led to more kissing more touching and you know the deal. But we did not end up having sex, she said she needs to go I was like okay, it's a first date.

Today, we went on our second date, and ended up at my place again watching another movie. This time it was hell of a much more teasing from her side. She was touching me even down there, i was touching her, we kissed, she was on top of me and you can just imagine. I even got to take off her bra. But when I put my hand in her jeans she put my arm away and we started laughing. This happened like 5x times each time I was more hornier only to end up laughing.

She even asked me when I was driving her home, what's wrong? I said o, nothing and she just laughed again and kissed me. I texted her if everything was fine and she said yes, I've enjoyed the night and was wondering if we could watch another movie again tonorrow. I said fine, why not.

Hey reddit, hoping I can get some good advice here regarding who I am as a person and see if there are any other people like me and what they use to manage their feelings. This fatal flaw of mine is falling for people way too fast. It always happens to me, I start to talk to someone else and within a few days of talking to them they completely fill my head up, and almost every thought starts revolving around them and how much i like them and how much I want to build a future with them and imagining a future with that person almost immediately. This of course is something that I never mention to any of the people I have talked to before or dated before. Because a lot of people find that someone getting emotionally attached to someone too quickly is red flag, which is completely understandable or they will try and take advantage of this. 

This has happened to every single person that I have ever had any sort of romantic interest with, so when things don't work out, I find that I already had a strong mental attachment to the person so it really drags on me for a few weeks.  I am already a person that will go out of my way for others and really try to be the best I can possibly be for someone and looking back some people I have dated before in the past before have taken advantage of that fact. 

This just recently happened to me again where I started seeing someone (for about a month) and they completely filled up my mental space. Looking back on it they weren't a good match for me and that I had ignored some red flags just because of the way that I had already grown some sort of emotional attachment to them. I genuinely think I would have kept talking with this person much much much longer and putting up with some really questionable behavior from the other person however I only pulled back because my friend made me realize that they were kinda shitty and were using some borderline manipulative tactics on me (hot and cold cycles of attention, flirting with others in front of me) This is not the first time that this has happened to me.

I notice that this is a recurring theme when it comes to me talking with anyone, and I notice that this opens me up and leaves me emotionally vulnerable to some potentially really shitty and borderline manipulative behavior.

I think I get attached too quickly to people because I crave a stable source of romantic affection from someone because of some of my insecurities. I definitely see myself as someone who's mainly an anxious attachment type. 

I am trying to work on myself and be a better person, like dressing better, taking care of myself, really trying to improve my physique, but yet I still find myself falling hard for people that I shouldn't fall for. 

I really need some advice to help me be a better judge on people before my brain starts to irrationally making mental attachments to people and leaving me potentially emotionally exposed to bad intentions from people. How do you guys deal with this sort of attachment style manage your emotions and attachments?

I continued the conversation from there onto another topic but all of the sudden she stopped responding. I can see that my last message was read and that she's been active on instagram throughout today, but I don't know whether to text and give her my phone number so we can talk more for plans or whatever or if I'm just being ghosted in general. 

I can see how maybe she just thought the conversation was over and that we'd talk another time or something but idk usually when texting its a continuous thing at least in my experience. If that's the case then I'd be at a loss for what to do at this point. 

I've been ghosted after making plans with a girl before so I'm nervous about that but this seems different since we have class together and it'd be incredibly weird if she did. I just don't want to come off needy or desperate so I'm at a loss for what to do from this point on.

Like many other things, I feel like it would ease that anxiety if men on dating apps knew that from very start, women talking to them are fine with it. Like other sections, there would also be the ability to simply put ""rather not say"" or ""ask me"" etc, which is very common.

First two times we went out we were out for hours and had an awesome time, conversation flowed well, and she told me she was into me. I paid both times. But each time she said goodbye she clammed up and left in a hurry, she even admitted she was nervous and felt out of her element. No big deal, it's cool. 





Just went out to a nice restaurant for drinks and dinner, took her out for ice cream.

She just texted me that she doesn't feel the same way.

I(f24 moved to college and befriended one of my housemates(m21). At first we hung out a ton, as I didn't have friends and why not invite him if he's free? Well this turned into him basically getting a crush on me and trying his luck after 2 or 3 weeks of us hanging out. He asked me out to dinner and I was very clear and straightforward. No dating. He's a housemate (bad idea for many reasons), he's a senior and I'm basically a freshman, and we have dont have the same life goals. (I'm a Business/career woman and he's a stoner). 

No issues, he totally understands and wants to be friends also. He's starts acting chill and not being so nervous around me 25/7. Which in turns means he asks me to the Fair. I say sure because why not? Then on the way back he was like ""Let's decorate the house for Halloween!"" Then it turned into him planning for us to go to a pumpkin match, haunted houses, decorating, and even asked if he needed to leave his club early so he could join me on a plans I made without him. 

I set clear boundaries but I feel like it's not there. I don't flirt with him. We never touch. Nothing. Yet somehow I feel like these ""fun things to do"" aren't just friends hanging out to him. Should I just stop hanging out with him? It's feeling kinda shitty that I'm just trying to go enjoy events and he's seeing this as something more. Would I be a dick if i told him no more?

I just blocked him, everywhere, i couldn't stand his face and felt like i was played or what.

But when I calmed my anger and i talked to him and he said those words again and i said that yeah i am not serious either and have no feelings right now but I want us.

66,pznrli,1633146469,"I (23 M) cut my ex off (21 F), and I have some mixed emotions ‚Äî did I do the right thing?","
Hey everyone,

So, my ex (21 F) and I (23 M) dated for about 7 months (the longest relationship I‚Äôve been in), and she decided to end it a couple months ago or so. She‚Äôs originally from Spain and goes to college in England and was in the states for a year long study abroad. We lived in the same building, and we met in the shared kitchen. 

We hit things off and hung out a bit, and then things became romantic. She‚Äôs never been in a relationship, and her parents have always told her to not date/try to control her almost. Every time we‚Äôd hang, her mom would call and deliberately interrupt us. I‚Äôve talked to her parents via text and email, and they liked me because I made their daughter happy. 

The main issues we had in our relationship were communication and expectations ‚Äî she would often blow me off when I‚Äôd invite her over, even though my schedule is way busier than hers (she did research full time but didn‚Äôt have homework or studying, whereas I‚Äôm a dental student with exams every week). She thought I was ‚Äúneedy‚Äù because I checked in on her everyday and tried to maximize our time together because I knew she was gonna go back to Europe in the future. I cooked for her, bought her gifts for special occasions, and took her site seeing in our city. I feel like she never appreciated me and always reluctant to spend the night with me after hanging out late in my room. 

I even protected her from some creepy stalker who lived next door to her. I had to call the cops on him after he threatened to kill me when I told him to stop hitting on my girlfriend. I ended up having to eventually move buildings to get away from him (my parents were concerned about my safety, and my ex told me that she overheard him saying he‚Äôs been to jail before). 

So how things ended: her parents called us while we were hanging out and told her to break up with me since she was leaving in a few weeks. I told her to let us enjoy the time we had left together, and she said that she won‚Äôt disobey her parents. 

So her goodbye was a BJ and she just left me. She removed our relationship from Facebook without talking to me at all. I got pissed and blocked her on everything. I then felt bad, and I decided to unblock her number. She texted me, and I kinda shut her out again for how she ended things.

I could tell she was upset, so I went to talk to her in person, and she ends up all over me kissing me. I had to push her back, and we agreed to be friends. I felt like she was manipulating me to make herself feel less guilty (she persuaded me to be her friend), and she promised to be my patient in clinic since initially none of my patients were returning my calls. However, without explanation, she backed out. 

I moved out of our old building just before she left, and she texted me saying  it was a shame that she couldn‚Äôt say goodbye and that she‚Äôd miss me (she knew when I was moving and didn‚Äôt bother saying goodbye). I just told her it‚Äôs for the best we go our own ways - goodbye. 


I then reblocked her and haven‚Äôt talked to her since (it‚Äôs been almost 2 months). Her friends and family still follow me on social media, but we don‚Äôt interact. 


Since being away from her/being single, I‚Äôve been enjoying my life and can really focus on what I need. I love my new building too ‚Äî I have more privacy, I‚Äôm safer, and I have access to a 24 hr gym. But I can‚Äôt help but think about her from time to time ‚Äî sometimes I miss her companionship, and other times I feel anger towards her for disappointing me too many times, and I‚Äôm also upset with myself for taking her crap. She wasn‚Äôt very mature or grateful for everything I‚Äôve done for her. She thought coming back to America long term, and I told her I‚Äôd support her, and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy her plane tickets any time she got homesick and would go with her if I could.

Alot of drugs were involved and long story short, I never really recovered. Although Iam proudly 5 years sober, the once confident, go for it kind of guy died with my addiction. Or so I thought. 

I've been trying to meet someone for a few years now and found dating apps worked best because I could really get to know someone with out even meeting them. You know what I'm talking about. All those word for word same conversations that literally lead to nothing? Years I did this. I would even set up dates and when it came time for the actual date, I could never pull myself to go. I don't mind being single but I know I want to be with someone. 

I just got home from the first date I've been on in so damn long and my god it went so well. We laughed, we shared great conversation and I even got a little kiss at the end of the evening. We already have plans to see each other again and we'll I just haven't been this happy in a really really long time. No matter what the future brings from tonight, I'm just glad I went for it.

This post will surely get buried but I've lurked around this sub for alot of those years and learned alot, I really just wanted it say thank you. I've chatted with alot of other subscribers here and our conversations were always uplifting and inspiring. Helped me feel like I wasn't the only one who felt broken in this crazy world we all live in. 

So for the few people who read this I say this, just go for it. No matter the outcome. Meet her/him for that drink, coffee, brunch, dinner or whatever and just see it through. 

Thanks again r/dating",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzo3xs/after_not_dating_anyone_for_8_years_due_to/

We talked for a bit and we really hit it off, especially after learning that we had a lot of things in common, things normally considered somewhat niche. We played a bit of guitar together and by the end of the event, we both had to leave with our different group of friends. She asked for my number and I asked for hers in return. She messaged me later that night and told me that she had a lot of fun with me, and asked that I let her know when I was free so that we could hang out and play together again. We chatted for an hour or so. 

The next day, I asked her out to a place where we could play together. She said that she left town in the morning and that she'd be back in 10 days. Cool, I told her I'd ask her again then. 10 days later, I asked her out again and she said yes to the date/hangout. The day of, she cancelled on me saying that something came up. She followed it up by saying that she'd love to reschedule for tomorrow if I was free and I said I was. Later that night, she cancelled again. Said she was feeling sick. I wished her well and just ended the conversation, but she said we could still meet up next week.

At this point I'd had enough. Cancelling's better than being stood up but yeah, at that point I just wasn't feeling it anymore. She still continues to text me though, almost every day, but I'm not sure about this anymore. 

TL;DR: We met less than a month ago, she asked for my number and initiated conversation. I asked her out multiple times but something always ""came up"" last second.

We only had 4 dates because she is quite a productive and workaholic person which I respect greatly for all the work she's supporting for herself on her career. But with this, turns out she no longer was able to keep the spark going with me since hasn't been able to catch a break from a job she worked previously and that her semester of classes were starting soon. She stated that she wasn't ready, but also said that she may possibly get back to dating after her semester of class is over but is unsure of it. I couldn't really tell if she meant dating other people or with me. Of course, as much as I was saddened, me and her really had great interactions one on one and even had fun phone calls along the way, she really gave me a drive to work harder on my own in my side of personal career. And heck, I was actually hired to a part time job I applied too! I respected her decision and truly understood that some people can't always prioritize everything at once and they needed to focus on important ones for themselves. She however did stated that she still wanted to be friends with me, we can still have phone calls sometimes with each other, and that if Im ever visiting around her area I can come through to see her still. Obviously just without me doing anything beyond which of course I will not do except being platonic. As much as I was okay with that, there are insecurities that I have that comes in and out. One being having the thoughts that she ends up dating someone else, and two with me having the mindset assuming that I still have a chance later on with her becoming wishy washy that she'll come back. Venting to friends, I was reaffirmed with a close friend of hers that she isn't the type to really date around nor even have time to date men and that she's always about being productive to her career. She only dated one person back in H.S but nothing really happened between them, and I was the second and longest one she ever dated with. I was ease with myself after being told that, but people can sometimes change their minds. My insecurities can be in and off sometimes as I tend to overthink a lot. I took a time off not talking to her for a week and then later on decided that I'll be friends. Apparently Im also the very first person she emotionally opened up to about personal issues on her end that she never opened up to her family or even her friends. Which I was tbh honored for that.

82,pzp9vn,1633153169,I need guidance from my fellow black folks,"Why is acting hood so important for dating?


In my area, a lot of my non-hood friends act street or hood to get sex from other black women. I don't blame em, because they either do that, or have the situation I have.

 If I'm anything other than hood, I'm pretty much invisible to most other black women.(atleast this is what it feels like) I really dislike this dynamic. 

I've been searching for a black girl that doesn't subscribe herself to this, but I've only met 1, as I'm in my late teens. For other groups, I'm more accepted, for not being a hood type guy. I'm definitely not waiting until I'm older for some to get past ""the bad boy stage"" either.


I refuse to put on a facade of acting hood for sex.  Here's why.

1. It's not a genuine image of how I feel/think about myself.

2. My family won't allow me to because I was raised to be a classic man.(principled, and prideful of intelligence)

I'm contemplating on just dating girls of other cultures or finding a fellow black girl that isn't into hood guys. Thank y'all",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzp9vn/i_need_guidance_from_my_fellow_black_folks/

He always said ""I was drunk"" or ""I never said that"" but then he said that he remembered everything ...

we watched movies together and spent hours talking (even though he's always been a person of few words) we had video calls for hours .. we even slept ""together"" with the camera on..
He told me that he was nothing interesting and that his life was boring but if I did not write to him daily he would get upset ... and when I did it as he wanted he would say ""You suffocate me""...
One day overnight he asked me for ""time""
I asked him what had happened and he told me that we were looking for different things in a relationship (When obviously he was talking to me about settling down and having children too) I remember I told him and he just said ""Maybe I'm wrong""

Me and this girl started seeing each other about 2 months ago and we started talking more frequently and eventually told each other we have mutual feelings. But, ever since she kinda started playing as in she never asks to hang out or most of the time i ask she says she has university work to do eventho i study engineering and have 5 times the course load she has. 90% of her texts are her computer coding assignments questions or math and her asking me to help her. I told her multiple times that i feel like she is not interested in me and kinda wants me for those stuff. One other reason is that whenever i try to initiate something sexual like kissing or  touching she always pushes me away or kisses me with hesitation and we have never gone past making out after 2 months eventho we have slept in my house on my bed 3 times already but i never pushed anything cause that's just fuxked up and against everything I believe . She told me the reason she doesn't hang out is she can't study with other people in the same place but i saw her multiple times studying with her friends. I have communicated with her about all these and she always say i knew u before school so im not using u for math or stuff like that, but i feel like she is not the girl i want.

 Should i end this relationship or I should wait ? I never had such an experience with girls since it was always they like me or they don't but this one is in the middle so im lost .

Planning day after day of hopefully getting tonight, for sure, I just know it to another night of I'm too tired or my stomach hurts or back or head or legs...... you know the story. Well after many many years and rejections later I have learned to love myself. And I really like to love myself. I am just horny all the time and when I couldn't fuck someone I would fuck the next best thing that would not cause a divorce, I learned to fuck my ass. It took a while to work up to a dildo size but now that I have mastered that and leaned how to give myself prostate O's I really enjoy it but I tried to bring it up and she made a gay comment but I am anything but gay and by the way she created this sexy beast. We have a beautiful Vaca home in the mountains. Its got an amazing view a hot tub and now that the kids are grown I thought it would finally happen. She could finally relax. Still nothing extra, plus she sleeps even better at 8500 feet. LOL

So couple things.

Since she doesn't give it to me except once every 2 weeks sometimes 3, Now with 2nd home I go to the mountains and have my way with myself with my toys and then go home every 2 weeks to satisfy her. Stay for a while and then boogie back up the hill. It works out great till something needs to be fixed at home and I do miss her. But it is getting harder and harder to try and not make some friends. They have lots of things to do up here.

1.Ladies, is this ok in a real man, not some whimpy Ladyboy but like your manly husband?

2.Do any of you ladies like to chase the rabbit when you tickle the trunk? or is that just like a never, no way thang that just never enter in to a girls mind?

3.Do any Ladies think it's hot and sexy, want a man like that or just think that it could be fun?

We did all the things we were supposed to do, kinda more apparent now without kids we are on separate paths. Is just the lack of Libido in one's partner worthy enough of a reason to get a divorce. It does cause some friction and possibly resentment due to the fact that it's always been like this HLvsLL. And if anyone did was it worth it?

I'm 25 and I've never had a relationship. When it comes to dating, I'm probably one of the worst lmao. I have a condition called Neurofibromatosis type 1. While I have a mild form, my face is still disfigured. I have a tumor at the left side of my face.  

In elementary any time I had a crush girls would be repulsed at the idea of me liking them. In grade 4 or 5, a friend told me girls don't like me because of my face/eye. Another guy said that if girls reject you you're not a real man.  I know all of that is fucking ridiculous but still in my preteen and teen years I grew up thinking like that and now it's stuck in my subconscious. 

In grade 8, my classmates would play this game called MASH. It's basically a game to see who you would end up with, what job you'd have, what type of house. Whenever it land on me most if not all girls would be disappointed that they got me. 

Also online dating has sorta ruin my confidence even worse. I barely get any matches. Granted, I know for a lot of people it's a lot to take in and it's a split second decision so I'm not bitter about that. I know other traits are hard to showcase. 

I have a few chances here and there but I am also a dumbass lol.

I know I have the confidence with in me to get over my issues and anxiety. I have several public speaking events, I have done live radio twice. I was elected the president of my student body at my university.  I've done canvasing, door to door campaigning. The point is while I sometimes fear doing those things, nothing and I mean nothing compares to how much anxiety I get to approach a random girl.  

Other than maybe therapy, which I probably do need, what can I do build up my confidence and what sources are good.

He hangs out with us for a couple of hours, and I just really liked him. He's funny, he's kind of dorky. He seems honest and kind. He's cuuute. So I take him home. And it's pretty amazing.

The next morning, he's driving me back to my car. I'm hungover and really just generally confused in the morning. He's asking me personal stuff, and so I ask him about the girl. He tells me this heartbreaking tale, he made a mistake, he wants her back. This story ends right as we pull up to my car. 

So I say, ""Good luck."" And get out of his car. As I do this, I'm thinking, he's got a lot going on obviously. This is a nice tidy little ending to a lovely evening, and I will just walk away.

But the moment I see his car in my rear view mirror, I am just filled with regret. Like deep instant regret. And I have been thinking of him so much since.

There are a few factors: I've been really isolated during lockdown and this was my first time out out in quite a while. I'm not a one night stand/hookup person generally. My reluctance to let this go could be stemming from these things.

Should I keep trying even though I feel like this is taking a toll on my self confidence?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzqm46/am_i_supposed_to_keep_looking_or_just_stop_and/
