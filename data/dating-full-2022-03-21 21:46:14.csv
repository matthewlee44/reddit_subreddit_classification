She \[21F\] and I \[23M\] have been fairly close friends for over 2 years, to the point where there are some stretches where we text/snap each other every day. At the beginning of our friendship, I remember sorta asking her out but she said she wasn't really interested in seriously dating anyone, and wanted to focus her attention on studies and extracurriculars instead. I took that as just a rejection of me, but she actually has stayed true to it and hasn't had a relationship with any guy for the 2+ years I've known her (she had a toxic relationship beforehand that ended badly). We did however make out once (she initiated) about a year and a half ago after a night out with friends. We kinda haven't really talked about that night at all, so I don't even know if she sees that as a mistake, but it does give me some insight that she is at least somewhat attracted to me, or was in the past.

Anyway, lately I've been having a lot of fantasies involving her and I just really want to spend the night with her. I'm not really into a relationship at this point, but I just want to make her my girl one time. So I'm thinking about just flat out asking her if she wants to hook up sometime.

So I (26m) matched with a girl (20) last Tuesday on hinge. There were a few messages, and I mean a few, on the app and then she stopped replying on Thursday. 

Flash forward to Saturday, she randomly messages back around 5pm. She started to hint about wanting to go out that evening, as apparently her friend who she was meant to meet for pre drinks cancelled on her. I wasn't sure if she was hinting or not, but I thought I'd shoot my shot and see where it could go, I did it in just the right way where it was jokey and would work if she was or wasn't hinting. And she was up for it, so we agreed to meet for half 9 that evening for pre drinks before we both went off and saw our friends - I was due to go clubbing with my mates at 11 and she was going to a rave with hers the same time. 

I wasn't sure if she was gonna show but I didn't care too much because I thought I'd be out anyway so it wouldn't affect my evening. I still had this feeling however that given her age and just how random it was, that if she did show it would only be for a one time thing and I'd likely not hear from her again after, because it felt like she only suggested it because she had no one else to fill that gap. Again this didn't really bother me because I was going to be out anyway and thought why not it'd be spontaneous.

She did show up and the date, well not sure if I class it as that, went really well. Lots of laughs, good conversation, and some touching as well. It ended in me walking her back to the station and a kiss which I initiated - she did like the flirty giggle after the first one and she went into the second and initiated tongues. Again I still knew this would be all it amounted to. 

Come the next day, I waited to text, I was up late anyway because of said clubbing, and text her something along the lines of 'had a great time would pre drink with you again', and asked how her rave was. And I haven't heard back after a full day. 

I guess it always sucks when this happens but I did always have my expectations low because of her age, probably a wise thing to have and helps, and just how random it was. But it's a shame because I enjoyed her company and it would be fun to have seen where it could lead even if it was casual.

The only thing that makes it less sucky is that I just liked how spontaneous it was, it's not like I had a bad time or that I lost anything, if I just take it as a random thing to do before a night out, then it went as good as it could be. I've never really had someone decide to do something like that then and there and that quickly, so at least I have that experience. 

I've kept her number, because you never know, but realistically if she wanted to text she would, and let's face it she probably never had any intention of meeting again.

I really like this guy. He has quite a few hobbies, and we have some common interests as well. When we get together I feel we have great chemistry. We‚Äôve been dating for a little over 3 weeks now (not including a week I was out of town). The first couple weeks we went on about 3-4 dates a week. It felt like a lot but I thought maybe he was taking into consideration the week I‚Äôd be away, which was the third week. Plus we were having fun, things felt natural. 

Then this past week, things seemed to slow way down. I will admit, he‚Äôs been the one initiating almost all the dates so far, and other than a couple scheduling conflicts-I‚Äôve been available, even last minute, and even invited him to things I was at with friends. 

But there‚Äôs been things that have left me questioning. Like the first couple dinner dates our conversations were great and I felt like he asked a lot of great questions and it was like things were off to a great start. We had a few nights listening to live music/dancing and those were a lot of fun. And a couple nights in watching movies. Then we had another dinner date where the energy felt so different. He even said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to think of something to talk about because we just saw each other yesterday‚Äù and I was thinking what, how is it that he doesn‚Äôt have ANY questions for me when we are still very early into getting to know each other. I had questions for him, so I dived into them. And he didn‚Äôt even respond with ‚Äúwhat about you‚Äù after finishing his answers. So it made me feel like I was just interviewing him. And like maybe he didn‚Äôt care about getting to know me. 

Fast forward past my week away and then a couple more fun bar/music nights, to a more recent dinner date‚Äîthe fun good energy was back but again the conversation was mostly him answering my questions and talking about ideas he had. So then I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if he‚Äôs just very self-interested. Then the weekend comes. We hadn‚Äôt made plans, however I did stay over at his place Thursday night and he asked me in the morning if I had plans (I had none yet) and he said I‚Äôll text you tonight. 

By 6 he hadn‚Äôt texted me and my friend was inviting me to dinner, so I went out with her. While at dinner around 8:30 he texted me and asked how my day was. I answered and said I was out at dinner with my friend -her name redacted- . He responded and said he was about to go to his dance club later on. I responded a later, around the time he‚Äôd be getting to the dance and I said ‚Äúcome over after?‚Äù - about 30 minutes later he responded and said ‚ÄúI actually changed my mind about dancing. I'm kinda tired. I'm going to catch up on sleep tonight.‚Äù 
So I said okay good night. 

The next day, Saturday, I texted him mid-day and asked him what he had going on that day. He responded ‚ÄúHey, today I've been relaxing. Practicing some bass. Going to my dad's house later for dinner and a sauna haha‚Äù and that‚Äôs all he said. So I was like okay sounds like he‚Äôs busy today too. I didn‚Äôt respond right away, especially since he didn‚Äôt really ask me what I was up to back.. then 15 minutes later he replied again and said ‚Äúwhat about you‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúJust been cleaning the house a bit and now running a couple errands. About to get together with my friend -her name redacted- to catch up with her‚Äù. And he never replied. 

Sunday morning, at 9 am he texted me (which I was surprised because he‚Äôs never messaged me that early).
He said ‚ÄúHi good morning. How was your night?‚Äù 
And I was still sleeping. 25 minutes go by and he texts again and says  ‚ÄúI was super tired/relaxed after sauna at my dad's house last night so I stayed in again.‚Äù 
At almost 10 I woke up and responded ‚ÄúHey good morning. My night was good. I got dinner with -married friends named redacted- and then we went axe throwing. And then -her name redacted- and I went to -live music/bar name redacted-.‚Äù And also ‚ÄúAw sauna sounds nice‚Äù
He replied ‚ÄúNice! Sorry I didn't text you last night. How was live music/bar name redacted-?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhat are you up to?‚Äù
So I replied ‚ÄúIt was fun!‚Äù And ‚ÄúI'm laying in bed being lazy‚Äù
Then he says ‚ÄúSound nice. Can I come join you? :)‚Äù and ‚ÄúI'll bring you some coffee if you want‚Äù
And I replied ‚ÄúI've got lunch plans so I'm about to get up and start my day‚Äù
And he said ‚Äúok‚Äù
And that‚Äôs been it since yesterday. 

Part of me feels like worried because it seems like he‚Äôs not asking me a lot questions about myself, and I‚Äôm afraid he isn‚Äôt interested in getting to know me. And I feel hurt that as of late - we haven‚Äôt made plans to spend time together in advance. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm a last resort. Or a low priority. 
I also wonder if he‚Äôs trying to see if I would initiate plans. Which I would be willing to step up in that way, and I‚Äôve tried a little but it was the times I tried- he was busy.

I haven‚Äôt communicated any of this to him yet, but I would be willing to. 
The other part of me thinks I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell a guy how he should treat me, and that maybe all this is enough of a flag to just walk away. Which is why I didn‚Äôt make myself available to him Sunday morning when he so randomly invited himself over (which is super unusual to me). 

I just want to know. Do I make a last effort to try and communicate my feelings to him and see how he responds. Or ask him how he‚Äôs feeling about things to see if he explains things and it starts to connect the dots. Or is this an ‚Äúall signs point to the door‚Äù situation?

Was it anxiety? Will he still find me attractive?

I don‚Äôt know what happened to me today. Was it anxiety? Can this guy still find me attractive?

Ok so today I had a work party for a coworker who is promoted and is moving to another city for this promotion.
I was in charge of organizing it. 
There‚Äôs this guy at work that I reaaaaally like. Usually there‚Äôs a fling going on between us. He‚Äôs with a girl but I know their relationship isn‚Äôt too serious. We always look each other and smile and flirt a bit but I haven‚Äôt seen him lately. I haven‚Äôt seen him in ages so I invited him on purpose. I went shopping and looked for something to dress up with that looked nice. 

Before going to the party I realize:

1. I‚Äôm on my period.
2. The dress is not flattering at all and it makes me look big
3. I‚Äôm tired

I arrive at the party and soon he comes in and says hi. No small talk, nothing. 
I feel really tense. My coworkers point it out to me and ask me if I‚Äôm ok. I say yes. They tell me ‚Äúrelax don‚Äôt be so stressed out the party is great you did well‚Äù after that a coworker tells me ‚Äúare you sure you‚Äôre ok? You look like you‚Äôre expecting something and it‚Äôs not happening‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù then someone else comes to me and says ‚Äúhey are you ok? You look like you‚Äôre mentally somewhere else‚Äù

At this point I go to the bar and down a drink without anyone seeing me. I feel like shit. I‚Äôm still tense. I take two shots. Still tense AF. I drink more and I get very awakes and stay all night with my friend in a corner. I look at the guy and he‚Äôs there with his coworkers not even giving me a glance. Usually he‚Äôs flirty with me and tries to catch my look.

After 3 hours he comes to me and says ‚Äúthanks for inviting me I gotta go‚Äù and he leaves.

I feel like shit.

1. What the fuck happened to me? 
Usually I‚Äôm chill and easy going.

2.  Did I ruin all my chances with him?

3. How can I not be awkward when I see him in the office? How can I subtly flirt with him?

She really matched my energy and seemed to take an interest in me as much as i did her.

I asked her to lunch and she said she was down for that.

So I have been dating this guy for about 3 months, we have hung out almost every single day. First date was amazing and even in the beginning it was, well over time I started noticing things that didn‚Äôt feel right. After two weeks of dating he told me loved me and then told me how he wanted me to meet his mom. I thought maybe he was genuine and I really like this guy and he could be the one. 

Welllll a month into the relationship we still haven‚Äôt hung out at his house and he told me he was getting work done on it so he was staying at a hotel. So I stayed the night with him at the hotel. Thought that was weird but I was trying to fully trust him. So after that I tried to come over again and he told me his bestfriend was going through a divorce and he was staying with him and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with having me over. So I didn‚Äôt. 

We would go out on the weekends and I would hint at going back to his place and he would say no and that he would buy a hotel. He paid for a hotel 2 times instead of me just saying at his house!! Btw, I live with my mom so my place was off the table lol. So after staying in a hotel 3 times with him I told him it was weird and I didn‚Äôt trust him and he insisted that his friend would be out soon and I could come over as much as I want.

Flash forward to 3 weeks ago, he told me randomly one night his bestfriend moved out and I could come over. Ever since then I have been over multiple times throughout the week. Well the first time I came over I went to use the bathroom and there was a woman‚Äôs hair EVERYWHERE!!! And he set out a ton of bath and body candles that weren‚Äôt lit to make the place more ‚Äúhomey‚Äù he said. Also on our first date he told me he doesn‚Äôt drink wine and he had a huge wine rack at his house. I ignored these signs cause he told me to trust him. Well one day I happen to see his mail on the counter and it was a girls name.

I looked up the girls name (I know crazy) and it said she lived there. Well I found her Facebook and I saw where she posted pics In his front yard a couple months ago and in his bathroom like selfies. My problem isn‚Äôt him being in a previous relationship my problem is that he told me the last time he‚Äôs been in a relationship was a year ago and he never lived with anyone. He always told me how he never dated anyone last year cause he wanted to focus on himself. Oh and they had matching tattoos. So on top of that he was showing me something on his ring camera and while it was loading I saw where previously in the day her car was there. 

I know I probably sound stupid but this man is always telling me since day one he never lies and he will never lie to me and do me wrong. And how he has never felt like this about anyone and I‚Äôm the first girl he has ever said I love you too. And I guess Im confused because we spend so much time together and idk when he could of done all this.

So the story is, I‚Äôve (F21) been talking to this guy (M23) for just over a month and it‚Äôs been great.

The only small issues are I feel like the texts are getting slightly repetitive and he doesn‚Äôt seem as interested in talking to me (taking longer to reply, sticking to just casual talk when we‚Äôve been flirty and slightly more romantic sometimes) We‚Äôve talked about meeting in a week or two as we wanted to get to know each other better first, he was busy with work and was waiting to get paid before meeting up. 

The other issue is there‚Äôs a bit of a distance between us (30 miles/3hr journey by train) so we‚Äôd either have to find a middle ground to meet at or go back and forth to each other‚Äôs cities every time we meet.

A guy (19m) who I‚Äôve (22f) been seeing for a while personally invited me over to his place Saturday night. We agreed to confirm plans at 9 to give him time to see if his roommate came back. When I reached out to confirm plans he left me on open. He broke our snap streak and continued to leave me on open the following couple days. I messaged him apologizing if I had been ‚Äúpushy‚Äù about coming over - again, he invited me so it wasn‚Äôt necessary tbh. He said I was fine and apologized for not responding and that he was overwhelmed with work. (I don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt let me know before instead of leaving me on open‚Ä¶ disrespectful, but okay) I left it at that. 

St. Patties Day night I went out to our local bar and was fully prepared to ignore him if I saw him there. When I walked in, I immediately saw him and just continued scanning the room like nothing happened. He then proceeded to come straight up and say hello to me, gave me a hug, said like two sentences more and then we parted ways. 

I still haven‚Äôt talked with him, and I‚Äôm kinda confused on what happened‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt get the invitation to come over, going AWOL and then finding me to give a hug acting like nothing happened‚Ä¶

That was the original plan. But we then decided to extend it for some dinner. Which also went on way longer than we both anticipated, during which we basically non-stop talked about food and family, shared the food and at one point shared middle names etc.

I declined his request, despite me having a massive crush on him and I feel like all I did was make myself suffer. Because I didn't cuddle with him/sleep with him, this guy eventually stopped treating me like a person and would literally walk by me in the kitchen to call up his girlfriend.

He also took her to weddings, parties, a tropical vacation, and I GOT NOTHING. It was so unfair and humiliating that he wouldn't even talk to me just because I didn't have sex with him.

I tried dating dozens of other guys but they have all been unattractive and boring compared to this stud guy, and I know he's bad for me, but he's like an irresistible drug and I can't forget about him.

She went on to say how bummed and confused she was regarding her own lack of sexual desire for me because she absolutely loved my personality and felt very emotionally close to me.

We have a lot in common and whenever we are together we are laughing and joking around. I made the ‚Äúnext move‚Äù and asked him to go out for his birthday which is next week. He enthusiastically agreed to go out for dinner and drinks this weekend. Which I think is a good sign??   


At this point I have clarified with him we are not sleeping with other people, but what the heck is this! I feel like 5-6 weeks is too early to be asking for clarification. But on the other hand I am a pretty straight forward, confident woman who has no problem asking him. Is this considered dating by today's standards? I feel like I should wait until after this weekend to see how he behaves when we are in public. Or should I just ask him? Or should I wait and give it more time‚Ä¶and just go with the flow?

He has also told me he loves me (albeit it was just him him texting me 'I love you' twice while he was drunk). We haven't had sex yet but make out and touch each other whenever we see each other.

We talked a lot and laughed a lot and I felt like we really clicked. At the end of the walk when we got to her dorm I ended up telling her that I like her and I want to take her out sometime. 

She asked for the where and when so we made plans to go to this place in town whenever her schedule is cleared up, possibly Frida. Before she left I asked her if I could give her a hug and she gave me one saying a hug was okay and that she liked hugs but it felt a tad bit awkward. It was kind of a side hug.

Anyway so I still took it calmly we just Kiss and kind of Kiss her on her neck touch her ass but from the outside, etc. thata was on a Friday about a week ago and on Sunday we went to the church, we both Are very religious and try to act right, and after that we went to a coffee, we we're holding hands on the way and talk really cool for about 2 hours, then when I was going to drop her on her house, I try to Kiss her, but this time more calm and maybe real, but she kind of didnt want to, felt a little awkward, but what I AM assuming she felt kind of Bad to get drunk and making out that sudden, and maybe wanted to give a litlle bit of space on the situati√≥n, So now on Tuesday we went running had a good time for an hour kind of flirt but a litlle, and then on Saturday we went to a concert, with a friend of her and a friend of mine, we had an excelent time, but my main issue is that, since we made out and kiss I am the one who constantly tries to flirt or get something, even like a hug or holding hands, or whatever, this has happened to me before, like wanting to start some kind of flirtatious action, but don¬¥t get any action in return, and thats why I was taking things slow in the beggining.

Personally I feel like maybe I have been looking a litlle despertate and thats why she has back up a litlle.

I saw him walk up to the restaurant before I got out of my car.

My nerves vanished immediately and for once I got to experience who I am without my anxiety lurking. For the first time approaching a date, I felt excitement and no burning desire to cancel and flee the scene.

What a rush.

I walked inside. We had the slightly awkward introduction and then sat at a table. 

I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to connect with a stranger so well in 90 minutes. Especially because it‚Äôs me, the awkward twenty something introverted girl who has never been in a relationship.

There was almost no awkwardness.

Conversation flowed. We share values and common interests. Our server even made a comment about things going well. He didn‚Äôt say it outright, but he found me beautiful and I can never tell with those sorts of things but with him I just knew. He‚Äôs not the physical type I usually find instantly handsome but I felt attracted to him too.

What a rush.

But like all the good things, it came to an end. We said our goodbyes and have texted a bit back and forth though it has been limited due to our hectic lives.

He said he wants to see me again. Now it‚Äôs a matter of planning.

What a rush.

I am not the highly emotional type. I lead with my head and not my heart. And yet my heart is burning to be with this guy again. And yet my head is reminding me to not be crazy; after all it was one date and I don‚Äôt even know his last name or favorite color. And yet my heart sees the possibility of a joyful future and an end to my lifetime of singleness. And yet my head says not to be a creep and not to give into all these emotions so soon. So to put it all at bay, I sit in my bed and write out my thoughts and feelings as I finally experience excitement instead of anxiety.

Bit of a backstory, I recently went through a divorce with my ""highschool sweetheart"". She was obviously my first and only serious relationship. Started dating freshman year and that was it. We ended up splitting due to communication problems and she started messing around with a friend.

Anywho! Now I'm having to get into this whole dating scene. The issue I'm facing is that it seems like everyone is either looking for hookups or people my age especially (24) just don't want long term relationships.  I am not a fan of the whole date around thing. I would rather just settle down and that be it. Old fashioned I guess but hey that's me. On top of all that i would like to find someone with similar interests which means going out to tabletop game stores or soccer events and talking to people but I'm way to awkward for that. Which means I have to rely on dating apps.... Which I can't say I have a whole lot of faith in. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!

So now our relatinoship is kind of friends I respect her relationship, and we are good frinds, it felt like I truly bury my feelings. So fast forward aroun 2 years we are about to graduate and we are becoming closer, but I dont mind that much. One night we start holding hands and she start bringing up if I ever was in love with her, I confess that I was, and next week gave her the letter from 2 years ago. Now all the feelings that I ""buried"" came out and I truly fall in love again, at that time I had been hooking up with a girl for a year, but we werent official since she was 7 years older, so I sent her flying, also she then goes to break up with her BF at the time, which was the guy from other state. We start dating and were in love, at least from my POV, but after we kissed, she stars acting all weierd next weeeks, and then the pandemic started. So basically she took her distance and went really cold, fast forward a year later she now has a BF and was her birthday and got invited to a party since all our friends in common were invited, I also was invited. I decided to go since I truly care for her, and still had feelings,  so when I arrive I recognize that her BF is the ex of the girl that I was hooking up, and they were engaged, so it definetley hit me hard, it felt like a movie or a script. I never told her anything about it and we dont talk much other than the times when we go to a reunions with friends in common, but I am preety sure she knows that her current BF was engaged with my ex hook up.

Its just fucked up how my ex hook up didnt want the other guy, how I didnt want my ex hook up, how my crush didnt want me, and how they end up, and I am the only one with kind of view of the whole story.

I try to describe it as simple and brief as possible, let me know if you have any question and thanks for reading.
