0,p3zdao,1628907099,Is this a red flag? Would you find this strange? Is he not interested? I need your opinion.,"So i have been talking to this guy since May. He is 10 years older than me. I am 26 years old and he is 36. We live one hour and a half away from each other. With our busy schedule, we only hung out 4 times. 

Two weeks ago, i asked him what was he looking for. Something casual or serious. He told me, he was looking for something serious. And he told me that he was glad that i asked him cause he was thinking about it. But he told me that he doesn't want to rush to anything or pressure me. Also, he likes spending time with me. I agreed with him. I told him the same thing. He ended the conversation with, The feeling is mutual. The thing is it's been already 3 months. He came to my town to visit me. We spend the whole day together. He gives me compliments. Like for example, he told me that i am a beautiful and smart woman. And how i got my stuff together, etc 

At the end of our date, he asked me to his plus one to his friend's wedding. He told me that he would pay for the trip. We have to fly to another state, but he told me He wanted me to meet his friends. He told me he would be honored to take me. 

The thing is that im having a hard time communicating with him. We dont text between dates. Like he would only text me once a week. I am used to talking every day to the guy im dating. Or at least they would send me a good morning text or Ask me how was my day? Etc.

She was beautiful and we had much of the same interests. Our 1st date was a virtual Netflix viewing party, our vibe was great and it continued in to our text messages. We finally decided to see each other in person for a date where I would show her my photography. It was a horrible decision.

It was burning outside. We were in a public place so it was loud and disruptive. I was awkwardly spending half the date teaching her how to use my camera. There was no ideal place to sit so we were awkwardly standing. I tried to get her to talk about herself but she didn't have much to share so I ended up rambling on about a number of different topics the entire time. I was in my work clothes so I was visibly sweating and uncomfortable. She ended up leaving 45 minutes later because she said it was getting dark. Her responses to my text messages became brief and delayed after that. Stupidly, I told her that the vibe felt off and I would give her a couple days. I tried to walk it back the next morning, apologizing for being awkward. I asked if we could try a 2nd more low-key date but she responded by agreeing that the vibe was off, wanting us to go our separate ways. 

I'm absolutely devastated. I chose a horrible first date idea that likely ruined everything. It exposed that while I'm a sociable and communicative person, I sometimes struggle to establish vibes with people who don't communicate as openly as I do. What can I learn?

I am 15 (for the record AFAB and interested mostly in men), and so, I am not looking for that. I don't expect any (romantic) relationships I make now to last past high school, and I know from experience that I *will* need time by myself as an adult (outside of a relationship started in HS) to find myself and grow as a person (my parents divorced because they started dating at 14, and never got to develop as individuals).

However, I do want to try being in a relationship with someone. That might sound really shitty (not wanting a long-lasting commitment), but I want to experiment and figure myself out. I can't do that unless I try out a relationship, serious or otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, anyways: *how.* I really don't feel comfortable talking to my mom about dating, and Google is most likely a poor source of dating advice (though I guess Reddit isn't much better...).

So, not sure what ""clubs"" one can join at the age of 32. When I think of clubs I think of the ones kids get involved in in high school or in college. As for volunteering, I did try that. I sent out the applications to multiple places that I was genuinely interested in. So, what do you do when none of the places you apply to don't need any volunteers or simply wont respond back when you contact them? I finally gave the ""volunteer somewhere"" advice a chance and when I got the results as I just described I just laughed as it was oddly reminiscent to all of my attempted relationships.

I have tried many different OLD apps (even had a friend fill one out for me and pick the pictures) to no avail. I have learned that trying to meet people at work is not worth it if it doesn't work out. I was really hoping the volunteering attempt would go well as all my friends are gone now since they're all married with kids and pretty much am alone all the time now.

I will probably remain single and a virgin well into my 20s because of this mindset I cant seem to get rid of no matter how hard i try and no matter how many times i bring it up with my counselor, or how many times I try to fix it.

I went out for the first time in a while with a couple of girlfriends and at the end of the night a guy came up to me and started hitting on me. I quickly told him i had a boyfriend but as most women know men can still be pretty persistent regardless. At this point my friend joined the conversation and he said he would buy all of us drinks. Me feeling bad because he bought us drinks, I gave him my number when he asked for it. My plan was to quickly block him after he left and never talk to him, I didn’t even know his name nor care to. Nor was i attracted to this guy. He texted me things like “see you soon sexy” and facetimed me as soon as he left the bar. I quickly blocked him and didnt delete the messages because I didn’t think much of it. My boyfriend went through my phone while I was sleeping and assumed since he facetimed me and the messages that we had sex. This is not the case. I genuinely had no physical attraction to this guy and had no intentions of ever speaking with him again. After the bar I went straight home and proceeded to throw up for 12 hours because I was shitfaced. When i woke up he was leaving for work. We didn’t talk about it until he got home and he had asked if i cheated on him (meaning have sex with the guy) I promised him I didn’t and told him exactly what happened. He believes me that I didn’t have sex with the guy but i can tell he is disgusted with me for giving the guy my number. I’ve done this once before when a guy who had previously sexually assaulted me at age 12 ran into me at the bar and I was so panicked I just gave him my number because I wanted him to go away. My boyfriend was kinda upset and couldn’t understand why i didn’t tell him to go fuck himself but i thought he understood after explaining, it was because I froze and that saying yes is easier than saying no sometimes. I feel really bad but to me i felt as if i wasn’t cheating, i love my boyfriend to death and i don’t want anyone else but him. He didn’t say i cheated necessarily but isn’t going easy on me either. I feel horrible that he thought I cheated on him or that I wanted to be with this guy. We just signed a year lease. He said he will forgive me but he is being really cold to me. My question is, has anyone told a guy yes or given them their number with no intentions of getting with them, they just are being persistent and yes is easier than no sometimes? Also, I’m always terrified of a guy getting super upset with me if i turn him down.

We’re sort of talking while my other two friends are playing pool and I remember him asking whether my one friend was bisexual.

21,p40pxl,1628912572,What to do when you suspect your partner of cheating,"I suspect my bf is cheating on me and texting another girl. It’s not a full on suspicion though. What I mean is I believe him when he says he’s not with anyone else but I can also see him lying to me about it. He’s done so before when we broke up. I had asked him if he didn’t want to be with me and he said no. 

Yet he broke up with me a week later despite claiming to still want to be with me. Now I’m afraid he’s texting another girl and waiting for some golden moment to break up with me. It’s a common theme amongst dumpers to hold control over when the relationship ends rather than confess their feelings. 

My dad did the same with my mom cheated on her for 6 months and then divorced her. I don’t understand if you want to be with this other person so bad why not do anything to be with them including telling your former partner you no longer want them?? 

Anyway, the only inkling I have that he’s cheating is him texting on his phone for most of the time we’re together. I know that’s not evidence but he is super secretive about his phone. The other day during an argument he left his phone right next to me and I saw a text from someone named “Mer.” He came back in the room and acted panicked asking if there was something wrong. Then he grabbed his phone and made sure to have it on him next time he left the room.

28,p41ixn,1628916000,I (22M) got possibly taken advantage of by a girl (21F) through Snapchat. What should I do?,"I (22M) was scammed by a girl (21F) through Snapchat

Over a month ago, I met this girl through Tinder. She matched with me and I later followed her through Snap after apparently (possibly conveniently or coincidentally) deleting her Tinder profile. (I snapshotted it to keep it in case) After some initial texts through snapchat, we got through talking about common interests like how we were both nerds and how we liked to watch movies and anime. She then told me about what types of games she plays as well.

We get to talking further and really start vibing through Snapchat, but this was when she told me about her job. She does this live streaming thing through something very similar to an onlyfans page. This is supposedly to help her pay for her younger sister's school. I tried to look past that and operate under the mindset that as long as she was working an honest job, then she's okay for me. 

It was a few days later that she actually wanted me to see one of her streams very late at night. Apparently, coming from her, you would normally pay to see her, but this girl was going to send me a link that would allow me to see her for free. She told me that I would be putting my credit card information down but she said to not worry about it because it wouldn't charge me. 

Of course I had my doubts about this link, but I decided to give it a shot. This was when the link started to not work. I told her about this and she kept on sending several more, only for each one to keep on not working. They just kept on taking me to NSFW live sites where I couldn't find her at all. She saw this and claimed that they were wrong. After a few links of this happening, as well as her talking to her ""moderator"", I gave up and went to bed later than normal on a weekday.

We still kept in touch on snap because my naive dumbass thought that those links all didn't work. I still thought she was a decent girl even though the only photos I saw of her were from Tinder. For a girl on snapchat, she hardly ever posted anything on her story. I tried finding her on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, but no luck. I don't even know her last name. 

We still kept in touch and for a little while, she became ""open"" to the idea of getting coffee with me. I of course, was open to that too because it meant meeting her in person for the first time. However, she still wanted me to see her through her stream again to ""feel more comfortable"" with me. Because of this, I gave the links another shot. Only this time, I told her that if the links didn't work, I wouldn't go on that coffee date. I know. Not much of a threat, but it was the best I could come up with on the spot. I tried to use two more links to see her, but they didn't work either. I asked her if I could see her the normal way, but she never told me how to do that. She told me she was ""talking to her moderator"" again. After that, I just decided to give up again, fall asleep, and not speak to her after that. In fact, I still haven't spoken to her through snap or any means to this day. 

What I didn't know until the day after the first time with going into these links, was that each link I put my information in (email and credit card # among other stuff) created a new account for that particular NSFW site the link led to. Since my dumbass did this around 6 - 9 separate times, I went through the time consuming efforts of canceling each (up to) $40 weekly/monthly subscription or membership bullshit that was charged to my account.

Even after canceling most of them and getting refunded on most of those, I was still being charged for transactions I didn't make later on, just for as little as a cent. No doubt her or (possibly more likely) some other cyber scumbag got ahold of my old debit card information to make payments on. Because of this, along with memberships I couldn't really cancel, I decided the best course of action would be to permanently deactivate my old debit card and got myself a new one with the bank I'm with. This was to wipe any shady subscription I had. I plan to file claims with my bank for the transactions that were made without my knowledge in the coming few days. 

As for the girl, we still haven't spoken ever since I tried to see her through those links for the second time, which was a few weeks ago. I don't know what to think of her, but I feel like the best decision here would be to cut her out and move on. I don't know what her intentions are, but I don't want to give her the benefit of the doubt and have her potentially scam me again. Finally, I don't know if all that movie and anime/younger sister helping conversation through snap was the truth or just her way of reeling me in. 

Either way though, I want to get rid of these lingering feelings about her, but I want to see your advice first because a little part of me feels like I’m wrong. Hopefully it'll give me a bit more security when it comes to not only her, but other potential dates down the road too. 

TLDR: I met a girl through Tinder and we got to know each other through Snapchat until she wanted me to see her livestream through shady links that would let me see her ""for free"" as opposed to the normal payment method (which I couldn't find apparently). I got scammed and charged for transactions I didn't even make by inadvertently creating accounts for the NSFW page that the links had before canceling those payments and ""subscriptions"" a few weeks later. I also stopped talking with her too, but I'm having trouble getting rid of any lingering feelings or doubts I have about her. That's where I need some solid advice/help here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p41ixn/i_22m_got_possibly_taken_advantage_of_by_a_girl/

30,p42275,1628918434,Are my standards 'too high'? [26m],"Recently talked with a friend about how my standards include anyone I'd date having to share one of my prime two hobbies, Anime or gaming, and feeling frustrated about not finding anyone on dating apps who conforms to that standard. He suggested I simply needed to lower my standards and try to find someone I can just get along with even if we don't share these same hobbies, and romance can be built up off of more basic interest.

I generally include this as a prerequisite because my hobbies play such a massive part in my life, like, i'll admit, I'm a gamer/otaku to an ~~almost~~ unhealthy level, where discussing anime titties is more appealing to me then... I don't know what other people discuss, sports? The News? I just find I do not relate to people who do not share my hobbies on a fundamental level, and often find people do not relate to me unless they're also fairly engrained in the culture. Personally, I find these standards to already be extremely limited and lowered from what I'd consider an ""Ideal partner"", I'm already compromising by limiting it to just sharing one of these hobbies, but should I just... give up, for the sake of the intimacy i'm craving, and just start swiping right on everyone who's even remotely attractive? I am feeling exceptionally alone and isolated, and I feel like there is validity in simply trying to make a relationship work even if it's not anywhere near the idealized version I want, but on the other hand I don't know how long such a relationship would actually last... I don't consider my standards too high, but Sometimes I feel like there's nobody out there for me, with most of the few women I meet in these hobbies already being in long term relationships, or being lesbian, or simply not interested... and I'm stuck into online dating with tons of uninteresting people which feels so disconnected because no events are happening due to covid....

31,p429ja,1628919397,I got someone’s number today,"A little background about me, I’m 21m normally for me relationship would just happen I never really asked for someone’s number, it was just we were friends then started dating. Until I had a huge life changing event and start having fewer but more meaningful friendships. So after my last relationship I got in the trap of online dating, which I hate. I go on dates but I never feel the connection I am looking for. But it’s been a while since I’ve asked a stranger in person for their number so I do get nervous and usually not even talk to them

Fast forward to today, I was talking to a girl who had similar interest as me and I felt a real connection with her. So I decided I need to ask for her number or I’d regret it. She was a little unsure because she is 7 years older then me, it doesn’t bother me but I understand why it would to others, but she decided to give me her number. Later on she did text me saying that she wasn’t interested in a relationship.

Yeah rejection always sucks but this has really helped me. First of all the honesty was really refreshing and she was very nice about it. But the most important part I was starting to feel defeated about dating but this reinvigorated my hopes. After going on many futile first dates this gave me the clarity to see where I need to change in terms of where I’m looking and what I’m looking for.

In the beginning of our relationship there was so much passion and communication and I took a lot of pride in that. These last couple months have been nothing like the beginning. My boyfriend has gone through a pretty tough year but I’ve been by his side trying to be as understanding and supporting as possible but sometimes I feel I don’t get that same energy from him. Nowadays I feel like a chore and an annoyance rather than his significant partner. Sometimes he prioritizes his friends and video games over me. Don’t get me wrong, my boyfriend is kind and he’s always open to communication. Issue is I feel everything I say goes through one ear and out the other. It’s been about 6 months since he’s initiated sex with me. At first I left it alone because I figured it’d had been a tough year and he wasn’t ready, but our relationship had finally started to get better. I help him get a new job, he got a new place but still nothing. I’ve tried wearing some sexier clothes and still nothing. Eventually, I sat him down and told him about the toll it was taking on me and he got really defensive about it. For the past 6 months, I’ve been asking for sex and most times, I’ll have to wait after he finishes his games to please me. I’ll usually wait until he finishes. I’ve tried skirts and shorts and just nothing. Sometimes he’ll smack my ass and make a comment and I’ll get excited but nothing ever comes of it. I haven’t asked/ Initiated sex for about 2 weeks and as a result we’ve had no sex. I feel really shitty and selfish about it. I don’t mean to nag him but I feel so shitty about myself and I don’t know what to do. Every time I bring it up, he either gets upset or i don’t get much of a response. I try to make him feel special and desirable but I stopped feeling those things a while ago.

I hate one night stands and this was established at the beginning of our relationship as we used to be friends and this discussion was had before and she said the same thing. She thought one night stands were just having sex with strangers met at random clubs and bars and not knowing that person at all....

39,p42w8p,1628922502,Need some relationship advices,"
Hi guys, first of all let me start by introducing myself, i'm a 17 year old Male (virgin) who hasn't had a serious relationship until now, just hoockups with 2/3 girls. So there is this problem i have I need advice on how to react, I am decent good looking and good at flirting and when i meet someone new and after talking and checking that she enjoys my vibe everything goes well. The problem is when we meet, generally with a group of common friends, although i interact with her and such, i fail on making me alone with her so we can know more about each other and hookup. This has happen almost everytime im in a party, like 2 days ago i had a party where would be this girl that i met previously and flirted throught texts to literaly the point where we said we would kiss  and more.  Then, on the party, we are all drinking and such and she has to go to the bathroom and some time after, i notice that shes alone with other guy, probably making out. It teared me appart the rest of the night because i felt like  why would she texted me like that and then do that, and even tought i tried to be with her and such, the other guy aproach was probably better. When im in a group of friends and a guy is hitting a girl i have interest in, i just ignore the situation and hope that she turns him down and comes to me which rarely happens. I know this sounds dooch but idk why it is my mechanism to cope with those situations. Maybe i am not built for casual hookups? Maybe the right girl hasn't come yet? Maybe i should ask her out just me and her? Probabily my aproach sucks and i need help because I stay sad many times 😓 what advice can you guys give me? Sorry for the english bc it's my 2 language and im half drunk btw

40,p42wfe,1628922528,Getting back into dating after one year out AND moving to a new city,"TLDR- Haven’t dated in a year, and also moving to a new job and city. What advice would you give?

My (M23) last date was in Sept 2020; at the time I was a hopelessly depressed and desperate person who was seeking any form of human interaction and my dating track record hadn’t been that great. I was definitely overweight, unkempt and probably smelled rough. I left the dating apps shortly after I was stood up by somebody else.

Since then, I’ve used this passed year to become the best version of myself; lost 50lbs with a good diet and regular exercise, graduated with a high quality degree, whitened my smile, got my own sense of fashion and genuinely improved my mental health. 

Obviously, deleting those apps has helped a lot and I feel ready to get back on the scene, but I maybe feel hesitant(?) about it. A big part of my depression meant that I felt unloved or unwanted, and after rejection, dating people with just as bad mental health, and burning many bridges, I don’t want to screw up my mentality yet again. I have obviously learnt to deal with rejection in that time; just last night, a ‘friend’ ignored my message to go see them as I move out of this area).

I’m also moving to a new city for my grad job, where I know no one. I’m moving into shared accom, at least for six months, so I’d hopefully have good relationships with my housemates. But beyond that, who knows? Is something like Bumble BFF (as a way to gradually ease myself back in) worth a shout? 

How should I go about taking new photos that represent the happier me? Drag my brother along to take them?

I’m a bit clueless again, what’s covid changed? Any advice would be appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p42wfe/getting_back_into_dating_after_one_year_out_and/

43,p433g5,1628923495,How do you avoid falling in love?,"I (32F) started exploring a new relationship with a guy (45M) a few months ago, almost a year, who is really amazing. He is handsome, very sweet, super smart and we have a lot of the same interests and approaches to the world. I have liked him for a long long long time, even while I had a boyfriend which was unfortunate. I have only gotten to really know him recently, after my last breakup, and it turns out that in addition to all those great things, he is also super intense, emotionally,  and lives this crazy ass lifestyle that I know I just can’t do. If I were younger and not looking for something serious, he’d be perfect but he is just too much for the adult me. I decided a while back that we’d be great friends because I care about him a lot and we help eachother but there is just zero way that a long term romantic future is in the cards and even a short term one could be disastrous. He has a poly girlfriend now and seems pretty happy with her which I figured would take some pressure off me. 

The problem is that the guy is charismatic as fuck. He oozes sweetness and charm. He thinks I’m super funny and great and has so many nice things to say about me. It’s impossible to not like him. He’s also a little bit of a Svengali, I think, and on some level senses I am trying to pull away from him and is not having it. I try keeping him at arm’s length, being distant and doing that thing guys do where they just act like you’re broken up and are just waiting for the girl to get sick of it and go away. I don’t want to create drama with a full on “leave me alone” because that seems like a situation he’d thrive in and before I know it I’ll be knocked up somewhere while he bangs our doula or whatever. I really would like to stay friends and skip to what I thought was always the natural final stage of our relationship, which is platonic and a sort of vague fondness.

We only spent time together a total of like 7 times. He was embarrassed to even see me again. I honestly didn't even like him that much at first &amp; he pursued me really hard for awhile. He told me he didn't feel like he was getting enough from me, this was because I hadn't caught feelings yet &amp; wasn't showering him with affection enough. I had a change of heart, we hungout again. He invited me to the lake the next day for The 4th of July &amp; introduced me to his family, where alot of shit went down, alcohol &amp; fighting, and he said he couldn't see me anymore.

He was talking about me stopping birth control in a year and how he thought he loved me and all that literally the day before.  I was finally catching feelings when I decided to go meet his family at the lake. It broke my heart not seeing him a whole month. I deleted him because I was just over trying to get him to see me again because he was so embarrassed but I was just over what happened &amp; missed him.  He finally said he was free to hangout when I can &amp; how he really does like me, just was still embarsssed. He insisted he wasn't playing games.

We hungout and ended up having a sleepover &amp; had sex like 3 or 4 times. It was also super passionate &amp; romantic  compared to before.  I hadn't seen anyone else that whole month we didn't see eachother and I honestly realized I was falling in love with him.  I also had a new job, I was visibly more confident,  actually made him a laugh alot, my skin was glowing, and I felt like I was ready to continue forward with things. It felt like it was good for us...I was like fuck games. I'm just going to be straight up and tell him that. I did. I also told him how if we weren't going to possibly progress into a relationship, my feelings were getting really strong, and I can't see him &amp; be having sex with him without that, or I would get really hurt. I told him I wished he would be my boyfriend...which I never said before. 

 I only got one single message from him that night I saw him, super late at night, about how he wished we could cuddle but he worked early. I was then ghosted the entire next day &amp; then he apologized &amp; then he did it again. I saw him on Snapchat online throughout the day. He could've messaged me. It feels like he LOVED that I was chasing him &amp; obsessing over him like I was. I got big vibes that he liked being the one in ""power"" &amp; anytime I tried to stand up for myself, he would try &amp; take the power right back.  He said he wasn't ready for a relationship &amp; that he can see me sometimes but not all the time. He said we should just take things slow and see what happens. I said I was willing to take things slow but then he just wouldn't reply to my messages after that.  

My friend told me he clearly just wanted a fuck buddy until he decided he was ready. He literally told me before I left that he wanted to see me again later that night or the next day. I didn't even bring it up. I told him I don't want to be your ""sometimes"" &amp; that I really meant it when I said I was falling in love. I told him that I'm going to distance myself because he's hurt me way too much &amp; I hope his life goes well. I said I was going on a real date &amp; that I'm moving on because I want something serious. I deleted him. I was so proud of myself for not excepting less than I deserve, just because I craved having him so much. 

I woke up to a message after he ignored like all my other ones, and it said he was going to block me &amp; that I was talking down on him &amp; how hopefully I'm not pregnant, because I won't be able to contact him.

So meat and potatoes of it, is at the start of our relationship she was still talking to another guy because she says she didn't want to hurt his feelings but ended up doing so after an argument, so we move on, then find out she would send pix to guys which she says is to hard to do for me, the about a month ago, I catch her sexual role-playing with some random female on Facebook which I told her not to do, it's disrespectful to the relationship but she went and did it anyway but feels it isn't wrong because it wasn't physical, so got mad at me because I went off(yelling) so because of that I stopped listening to her, held it against her and wouldn't let her find new friends(bad on me) but it was a trust issue but yesterday was it, I broke up with her.. but we had good times, I just can't get past her transgressions... but why do I feel like I did the wrong thing? She says she loves me and she'd never actually cheat on me but in my head, I feel she would..I've explained myself in detail about it to her and all she would do is get defensive and find ways to redirect on my response to what she did....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p43xpg/confused_and_hurt/

2 days ago I 28M went to a date with a girl 25F I met on tinder. I'd say the date went amazing I had an awesome time and I think she did to. Basicly we went for ice cream and talked for 2 hours there and then went for a walk cause it's a nice area the place we went to. 

Anyways later I offered to drive her back if she wanted and she was said OK and so I drove her home. What I noticed before I dropped her off is that she would make conv and wouldn't leave.

I loved it cause I genuanly enjoyed talking to her however now looking back at it was that a sign that maybe she wanted possibly a kiss?

 I'm not feeling bad in terms of like missing a chance to kiss her cause I'm a bit shy and maybe want a 2nd date for that however I feel bad in terms of maybe she thought I did not like her and that's why I didn't do it.

We talk everyday since the date for like an hour or 2 on whatsapp and we will go on date 2 tomorow or sometime this week cause tomorow is a weird day for both of me and her but yeah I just wanted to know if she wanted a kiss cause I might be 28 but only had one gf and all I know about flirting and stuff is limited to that person lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p441c1/did_my_tinder_date_want_a_goodbye_kiss/
56,p44402,1628928844,Did I ask her out too soon?,"Tl;dr. A girl I matched with on Tinder seemed really into me but suddenly went cold when I suggested a time and place to meet after asking her out, leaving me on read. 


I (29M) matched with a girl (29F) on Tinder on Thursday. She seemed really into me, sending the first message, saying she loves my long hair, and asking a lot of questions. We seemed to have a lot mutual interests. I thought I might as well ask her out. My exact words were ""this is the kind of conversation we could be having over a coffee or drink"". She said sure, what do you have in mind.
On Friday afternoon I asked if she's free over the weekend. I sent the message at 1pm.
Sunday would be better to give a bit more notice, I said. We can meet at (insert place here) at 1pm. We can go for coffee (turns out neither of us drink much) then a meal afterwards.
She read my message at 1345. I sent a follow up at about 7pm because it was the kind of text that needs a response. She hasn't read that follow up.

I'm wondering if I asked her out too soon. Her interest seemed pretty high so I thought I might as well strike while the iron is hot.
I'm just finding the lack of communication annoying. If she said it was too soon, I'd apologise and suggest something a bit later or try to make her feel more comfortable.

Who knows.. Something may have happened. Her dog may have got sick, she got busy with work and forgot. She's a teacher as well. This should be a fairly quiet time of the year. I've got a background in working in education too. 

I'm wondering if there should be a cut off point for her to respond.

66,p44rl3,1628932306,Would you give another shot to someone who chose someone else?,"I am just curious. Would you give them another chances if they came back and wanted to date? Also, does the amount of time or effort you put into making it work affect your decision?

To help with your answers I will give you a few scenarios and I would be curious about your answer for each:

1. You matched on a dating app or anywhere else, but they point is they were new into your life. You went on a few dates, 4-5 at most. They chose someone else. Also, those dates were over the span of a short amount of time, 1-2 months at most, so not a lot of talking online either. The person they chose had more history with them or just as much.

2. You didn't go on dates and just talked online for a few months(especially if it's a long distance thing). Of course, the romanting interest was mutual. (I am saying this to make it clear it's not about someone you were talking to that had no idea you were even interested in them. You probably met them on a dating app or the interest was made obvious). They chose someone they either had more history with them or lived closer to them and met with them in person.

3. You've been on many dates and talked to them for a few months. They chose someone who has been dating them for just as long or longer.

4. You've been on many dates and talked to them for a few months. They chose someone who has been dating them for less time.

5. They were more like a crush to you and they didn't know for sure you wanted to date them.

6. They have been in your life for a while but you were getting mixed signals, so you weren't sure they were interested. Finally someone has the courage to ask the other one out, so things become more obvious. But after some dates they chose someone else, maybe who they have known for less time than they knew you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p44rl3/would_you_give_another_shot_to_someone_who_chose/

I'm not a virgin (2 women) but I haven't had an abundance of sex. I don't have any crazy hook up stories, and most importantly, I have never been in a long term relationship. I would love to have a girlfriend who I can go on hikes with, cuddling on the couch watching a movie and have great experiences together, but I think I won't get this due to the fact I'm that inexperienced when it comes to dating and relationships. I see a lot of women talk bad about inexperienced men and it makes me think there's not much point in trying.

I feel like if I did start dating I would just be shooting myself in the foot and making a mockery of myself. Is there really any point in putting in the effort when I'll most likely not even get a chance due to my lack of inexperience?

I figured being a well-intentioned and well-established young guy would at least net some results but I have had literally zero luck in the past month or so that i’ve been trying to date. I can’t even get past the first few texts, let alone getting a first date. 

I’m not big on dating coworkers and even if I was interested the nearest lady to my age has a decade on me and probably has better prospects.

For our second date I planned to drive/arrive separately because even though our first date went well and I’m interested, I don’t know the guy well and it’s not like I met him through friends that can vouch for him.

Apparently driving separately is a huge issue for him. When I explained that I wanted to drive separately because I don’t feel comfortable being in a car alone with a man I’ve only met once, he seemed to understand but was then offended that I called him “a man I’ve only met once.”

My gut instinct says to cancel the date and start looking for someone else to see.

His response to being described as someone I’ve only met once seems childish to me and a bit like a red flag.

82,p4713g,1628943681,Anxieties about find “Love and companionship”,"I’m not sure if this extends beyond myself into general opinion, but I’m hoping my ideas are relatable

I’ve realized from a young age I was constantly exposed to this western idea of love. It’s romanticized and hyper focused on In a lot of our culture. My favorite songs literature and films are about love. I use to fantasize about it frequently. Holidays and events are either special because I’m with someone or they can be rather depressing because I’m not(Keep in mind these are arbitrary days invented by society and objectively they have no true significance).

Freshly in my 30’s Id have an anxiety about running out of time. Id feel pressure from friends and family to settle down. It was and is expected of me to find a spouse and have kids. I sense this anxiety In a lot of my friends and relatives too. I almost married twice now and probably would have had decent lives with these woman, and with them both I was so convinced they were “it”at one time and I was comfortable and felt a connection with them. However, I know we had our differences. I know I would have had to forfeit apart of myself to be with them. What are the repercussions of that? Divorce in 20 years? A life of subtle passive aggression? A yearning for something I don’t understand or can’t conceptualize? Them feeling my distance? Them feeling lonely sleeping next to me? 

I see people settle all the time like Legitimately, not in a judgemental way. I see some are even comfortable and content. Maybe this is the mature thing to do. I know there is probably no perfect fit, but there has to be something pretty damn close. 

So I’ve also learned that lll be okay with being alone. I’m not terrified of it anymore. It’s likely considering how different and particular I am.It’s not ideal and yes I crave intimacy, but I also accept that I may never find what I’m looking for, but at least I won’t (in my opinion) cheat myself and or worse someone else into some idealized situation that isn’t honest. 

Yet, I also feel empowered in a way…. Am I often Lonely and horny?? Yes but also im in control and aware…. I’m honest with myself and yes still scared of being alone forever, but I’m not desperate and frantic about finding love that I may make rash decisions that end up hurting others or myself more than I would if I was still driven by this anxiety. I’ve seen people together who are unhappy. I’ve seen many marriages end. I’ve seen a lot of regret and heartbreak. I want to avoid this and I feel and hope I can.

I’ll keep living my life. The way I want. I’ll put myself out there, because I do want someone, but I need to know they are compatible with me. I want a connection beyond just wanting companionship. I won’t be driven by anxiety where I project my ideals on someone or mistake my desire to be with someone with actually liking this person. I won’t be so afraid of being alone that I rush into something that doesn’t entirely feel right.  

I know most people don’t want to or don’t think they are a settling, but it’s easy to see past things and truly see a situation for what it is when we project our ideas of love on a person or when we dismiss things of significance because we feel pressure, anxiety or so badly want that fairy tale love we observed in our culture since we can remember.

During the first lockdown last year, I matched with a guy on a dating app. Let’s call him (guy number one). He had loads of videos of his music and honestly I have never matched with someone so hot. I was swooning, butterflies when I see his videos, deeply excited about him and fantasies. I’ve never felt like that before. He looked like a celebrity 

But guy number one was terrible at replying leaving me waiting for weeks. Flaky and late for dates, ghosted then came back so I was constantly anxious about never hearing from again. I cut him off but always thought about what could have been. It felt like a teenage crush and I haven’t felt that for years!!

For a whole year I’ve never found anyone else that makes me feel like that. He felt like a celebrity crush to me. Totally out of my league.

Recently I matched with a guy who looked lovely in his photos but didn’t give me pangs of desire like guy number one. He’s cute but I’m not completely physically attracted to his looks yet but only one date. Good at communicating, we get on so well and dates fly by! He’s kind , the dates were nice but I never felt the same level of physical atttaction as I did to guy number one. I can defo see potential for relationship but I don’t have sexual desire after one date even though my fantasies were wild for guy number one.

What I wonder, is what I felt to guy number one unrealistic and just lust? And should I let things develop with this other guy? I don’t feel a strong physical pull to this other guy but it’s just been one date. Because I felt it so strong for the first guy, I don’t know how it should be felt or how long it should take to develop

85,p47bpv,1628944956,Red flags,"Hi, 

Im basically thorn about a person I've been seeing for 3.5 months. We are not exclusive but I belive he has told some people about me. We live in a small comunity and we both want to get to know each other better  before we go exclusive but haven't talked much about it. So I've created a bad and good things so far in our relationship. Also we are in a hard lockdown so we don't have many chances to go out with friends. 

Bad. 

1. Forgot mine birthday two and a half months after we started dating. He says he forgot but knew about it because I've mentioned it couple of times. 

2. We met on tinder and he still is on tinder. Last week he said he is happy to delete account but since we met he has updated education section. I'm not sure when he updated it but I've just seen it last night. Since he said he is happy to delete and still hasn't and  it's been 7 days. 

3. Is a terrible texter and he said that from the get go. We don't text 3 or 4 days since we meet up.

4. I found a Bobby pin in his car next to passinger seat. I have exactly same Bobby pins at home but I haven't used any since we met. Thing is I had an old jacket that I wore that day and it could've fell from the pockets as I had dropped some other items on the car where found Bobby pin. I've asked him about it, he was a bit flustered but said that he hasn't driven any girl in that car since he bought it 5 months ago. 


Now the good points. 

1. We have lots of things in common and grew up similarly, share same family values. 

2. He plans the dates and puts effort in. Get me food and is very genuine and affectionate. He holds hand all the time. 

3. We spoke about the future and he is keeping me in his plans. He uses a lots of ""in the future we will do this, go there"" talk. 

4. He talks about his family and his friends and gives me compliments and also asks questions about me and my family. Also he seems keen to get to know me as a girlfriend and ask a questions about my personality and how I function in a relationship.

In my case, I've never had trouble with women and have had multiple sexual partners. It's just unfortunate that it usually ends up becoming a FWB situation, just casual hooking up and/or they end it because they don't want to get serious. 

Not sure what my deal is or why this happens because I'm usually very easy-going, financially-stable and fun to be around. This happens both IRL or with online dating. For dating apps, I even make it clear that my goal is a relationship.

88,p47gpr,1628945514,Getting a girlfriend (a.k.a winning) should NOT be your end goal!,"Hello, to the incredible dating community!

After being active for several months here, I've seen most of the guys are trying to get a girlfriend no matter what. In other words trying to win. Trying to get what they need.

Unfortunately, in building a healthy dating life, that's the worst thing you can do. Let me explain you why!

So, in my mid twenties I didn't have a clue about women, how to date, how to not getting ghosted and how to get on a date through dating apps.. I was clueless, lonely and depressed. All I wanted was someone to understand me, hug me, and have beautiful moments with..  In my mind it was always: I want to get a girl, I want to have a relationship. 

👉The truth is, I was focusing on the end goal, which basically was to ""win the girl"". And every time I wasn't ""winning"", I was getting back thinking ""oh I have to be more handsome"", ""I have to build muscles"", ""I have to be perfect for the girl"", ""make more money"", watching endless YouTube videos about dating and social skills.. False perfectionism, in other words.

👉And slowly, but steadily, I wasn't reaching my goals of being perfect, and that led me to procrastinate, and slowly giving up on the dating game. Every time that I had the opportunity to ""play with girls"" at the back of my head I was thinking ""I am not perfect yet, I am sure she will reject me"". And of course, being out of the game for so long, I stopped learning. And because I stopped learning, I was failing to get what I wanted. So I was stuck in this endless cycle of either I lose or I win.. 

And then again, because I wasn't winning, I was feeling discouraged and of course, I entirely GAVE UP. Again, feeling lonely and depressed and of course not good enough..

✅ So, after some months of deep thinking and  by getting help by others, I start changing my mindset!! I stopped trying to win, but I've put all my focus on LEARNING!! You know why? Because, if your goal is to always learn, you CANNOT LOSE, and that's a beautiful thing! This was the opposite of perfectionism! Basically, every action I was taking was learning something new, by real life experience. So, just by taking small action steps, I was learning something new every time, and because my goal was to learn, I was WINNING EVERY TIME!!! Either I was learning something wrong or right, at the end of the day, I was learning and so again I was winning.

And, INEVITABLY as long as you do this, being in the cycle of learning, you are going to get more dates, and maybe the girl. And that will boost your self-confidence, and you will learn more and more. Will you be 10/10 confident? Of course not! But, adding up a little bit of self- confidence every time you take action is the only way to be successful.

And this my friend is the awesome cycle of building your self-confidence. An upward spiral of learning and learning and learning! 

So, if you read this post, stop focusing on winning, but put ALL OF YOUR FOCUS ON LEARNING!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p47gpr/getting_a_girlfriend_aka_winning_should_not_be/

90,p47wqz,1628947254,Any advice?,"Many people have told me I am very innocent, naive, childlike, and not malicious. I love everybody and I can't see when a person has good or bad intentions. I sometimes am surprised when people tell me when this person did something not ok because it is hard for me to imagine that person doing not so nice things. I tell people I love you but my parents, family, and other people are correcting me because they tell me that when I say I love you to another person him/her can interpret it the wrong way especially since I am a 21 year old female. I was born very prematurely and according to my doctors I was born with my frontal lobe partially damage and many of my doctors suspect and know that I have autism so my parents are in the process of trying to make me get an evaluation for autism. Currently I am doing volunteer at morgans wonderland and I love it! The people who lead me or who teach me or who give me orders are always correcting my grammar and teaching me how to interact with people the approrpiate and proper way. For example las week I had to give people stickers and they will always accept it. However, my boss, leader, or instructor corrected me by telling me not just put the stickers on peoples shirt instead ask them first and then they will point it out where they want me to put the sticker or they with pull their hand out so I can hand them a sticker. So I am learning this stuff and I am very happy about this. People especially my family have said that I lack common sense and that I can't see common sense and I can't think abstract thinking. I can't analyse things easy or quicker. It takes me a long time for me to process things. Many people say I have developmental delay physically, emotionally, personality, and etc. Would a guy, girl, men, female, intersex, whichever gender, binary, anyone, still accept me and date me then maybe if things work out then marry me?

91,p47yko,1628947441,It is okay to be a girl who wants a relationship,"While I am all for the ""strong, independent woman who don't need a man"" movement, don't let that minimize your own struggle. This is coming from a woman who has always dreamed about having a happy marriage and lots of kiddos. That has always been one of my biggest life goals, I would never be able to feel fully complete without experiencing that, so it is perfectly reasonably for me to be sad about being single. 

I just want to let girls like me know that it is okay to be sad about being single when your goal is to be married one day (or even if that isn't your ultimate goal). You are essentially experiencing the equivalent of not getting accepted to your dream college or not finding a good starting position to eventually reach your dream job, but just with relationships. You should not be made to feel that being strong and independent is the opposite of being in a relationship, you can be strong and independent and still want a relationship. I can take care of myself just fine, I don't want a man to take care of me. I just want a man to share my life with and that's perfectly fine.

Basically what I'm saying is that we should definitely encourage girls to be their own people and not seek relationships if they don't want them, but we shouldn't go in the opposite direction by saying girls who are sad about being single aren't being independent enough.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p47yko/it_is_okay_to_be_a_girl_who_wants_a_relationship/

There was this one time I said “I love you” through text first and he didn’t say it back and just sent an emoji.

Although she's really into me and keep complementing about my looks, personality and having both clicked on the same side of interest. I mean, im supposed to be comfortable around her right? But, that's not the case. But i really felt, uncomfortable and insecure around her physically. Regardless of her personality, looks and all that stuff. So i ditched her on our second date with a lame excuse. I mean, don't get me wrong, i invest on myself well enough, i think. I'm a model so i thoroughly care myself.  I'm not choosy. But, i don't get the logic why i naturally run like a chicken and ditch a women with a body figure like those. And why i'm into women who's smaller than me.

98,p4887f,1628948469,Getting girls,"Can someone please help me understand what in the hell I am doing wrong. 
So I can not get girls to save my life. Let me list of some personal things about me real quick. 
-I’m 22 
- I’m 22 
- I’m 5’’9’ 185 pounds with very low body fat percentage (I’m very fit) 
- I’m an amateur boxer (pretty good tbh)
- Work at Tesla (have tens of thousands in the bank) 
- Very smart (not bragging just being honest) 
- Extremely confident (say what I want and not afraid of rejection)
- Wear nice clothes
- Take care of my hygiene (beard , haircuts , etc) 
OK so you got the gist of it. I perceive myself as an absolute catch and somebody that girls should be chasing. One of the reasons why I built up confidence is because I’ve literally worked so hard on improving myself the last two years and I feel like I am the best version of myself right now. The problem is is that despite all of this I still for the life of me cannot get girls. They literally treat me like I am A scary bogeyman and they run away. So as an example I’ve been on tinder for like six months and have matched with some beautiful girls some in my league some outside of my league some below my league but I have literally not one time gotten any girls to do anything with me from tinder. They will literally tell me they find me attractive and if I post a boxing video on my Snapchat they will comment with emoji‘s seeing how hot that is. I play it so cool and obviously eventually I come around to say to these girls that we should go out and do something. The second that happens they run like bandits. THEY LITERALLY DONT WANT TO DO SHIT WITH ME! ITS DRIVING ME INSANE. No I do not want to come across and say that these girls owe me anything. LIKE I SAY I AM NOT BEING WEIRD OR ANNOYING OR DESPERATE. I am being so cool about it when they reject me to do stuff. I will say something like hey no problem why don’t we do something next weekend just let me know and leave it at that. They will never contact me again and then I will have to reach out to them again if I want to do anything. Eventually I’ll just delete them off my Snapchat because I don’t wanna waste time but they don’t give a fuck. I do every single thing that I am “supposed” to do to get girls but literally I cannot get them to do anything with me. I feel like I am constantly having to deal with girls looking for other dudes and I am just one dude in a stack of 500 at any given time. I literally feel like even girls below my league girls that I am better than getting won’t do shit with me either. There are girls that I would give a rating of a three that will not do anything with me. I literally laugh at how pathetic it is that even girls that are objectively ugly don’t wanna do shit with me. SERIOUSLY. And trust me , I have girls that are 10s saying “omg that video of you boxing is so hot”. “Omg you are so  hot” AND THEY NEVER DO SHIT!!! I have tried to pick up girls in person to but I honestly feel like most girls don’t want to do shit. I’m also not even seeking validation. I don’t give a fuck about having girls tell me anything about my appearance or anything. I literally just want some fucking girls to hook up with and have fun. It should not be this fucking hard what the hell am I doing wrong please someone explain!!!!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4887f/getting_girls/
99,p48cpv,1628948951,Reflection on Interactions with crush,"I met this “super nice” guy about a month ago through new mutual friends. He was super cute and smart, but I did not think anything about him until my birthday. At my birthday dinner with many of our new mutual friends, he was super flirty, gave me a birthday card saying he was excited to hang out more, and paid for my birthday dinner. Even my own parents do not give me a birthday card. 

I threw a party the following week and he kept asking to invite his college friends. When I met his college friends, it was obvious he told them about me because they knew a little about me including my occupation and hometown. 

I wanted to get to know him better so I asked him to grab happy hour and he picks 8:30 pm at a bar. Of course, I thought this was a date until last minute he drags his friend that I have met before to the “hang out/date”. I completely read him wrong and he texts me the next day and basically friend zoned me. 

I’m okay with it now, but man it sucks to feel like I was led on just a bit. I know I should have just straight up asked him out on a date. Even, my other guy friends thought he was into me with all the interactions. This was probably the first guy I have liked in a long time, but it was a turn off seeing how he was so dense and couldn’t realize his actions could be somewhat misleading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p48cpv/reflection_on_interactions_with_crush/
