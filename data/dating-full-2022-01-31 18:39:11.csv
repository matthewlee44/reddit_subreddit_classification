I am 20 and never dated / was in a relationship before this and she was 19 and had been in one which she told me was very toxic.   
I was always very careful because of that always made sure she felt safe and never did anything to betray her trust. Now granted I do want to admit to a potential mistake that I made, we were together for 4 months but for the first 2.5 months I didn't ask her to be my girlfriend now I blame this on indecisiveness and perhaps this being my first time date I just thought we were ""together"". After those first 2 months we talked about this and decided we wanted to do this and talked about working on that aspect and being in a relationship.

  
Now right around this time I got suspicious of one of her ""friends"" who wasn't in the country at the moment but she told me they both had feelings for each other before but that was a year ago and now they are just friends. Despite my insecurities and doubts I believed her and never really asked questions about this dude. One month down the road he came up again and I asked her if he knew me and her were together and she told me he didn't I suggested she tell him because it only makes sense.   


New years eve was around the corner and apparently he was supposed to fly in around then so she asked me if we could spend NYE with him I shut that off because I thought it was weird but I did tell her that I would like to meet him some other time.   


A week later he finally came to our city and even though we could have met him together she opted to see him alone. That night I went through her phone and saw all the texts. For the past 4 months she and him have been calling each other cute . He obviously didn't know she was in a relationship or seeing someone so he was flirting hard, suggesting watching Netflix with her and cuddling etc etc. She never once shut this down or told him.   


I broke it off right then and there.  


We talked a week later and she has no fucking remorse none, she has this straight look on her face and just keeps on apologizing saying that she fucked up and she doesn't like him at all and doesn't know why she was sending those messages. She still wants to be with me and sent him a message in front of me saying that she is seeing some one else and she's sorry ( which she told me she sent 2 weeks ago )

27F matches with 31M on a dating app (hinge). Conversation flows smoothly, very funny and he even starts sending audio messages on the app which seem a bit weird at first (no one’s sent me audio messages on a dating app before) but it’s all good because I love them. 

1. Asks for phone number - we start texting a lot. Back and forth. Everyday. Good morning messages through good night. Tons of audio texts etc etc. however the conversation is pretty superficial and laced with innuendos and banter. 

2. Cut to 1.5 weeks later, he’s not asked me out so I ask him for a video date and he agrees. We speak for 3 hours but again the same topics (just jokes and jokes and jokes the same old again and again) with very little information about actual heavier topics. 

3. He asks me for a real face to face date on another video call and I say yes. He asks me on Friday for a date on Saturday without a concrete plan because he’s new to the city. So I suggest some ideas and we decide a time. 

4. Cut to the day (14th day since we matched ) - I haven’t heard from him all morning which is atypical of him because he always texts. It’s 2 hours before the time we agreed to meet and I’m feeling anxious because it feels like he stood me up. So I text him. He says he had a doctors appointment and he couldn’t message me (which seems odd but okay). I was pretty shaken up to this point but he arrives and we have generic fun. 


5. The date - We hug, hold hands briefly, he touches me warmly and we laugh a lot. We spend 6 hours together. However the conversation is still pretty flat. He remembers minute details about what we talked before but he’s not asking any personal questions. I try to bring up one but he doesn’t want to talk about it. I let it go. I ask him more about his family and dynamics. Etc and he opens a little bit but still doesn’t ask me anything. He plays the guitar and teaches me and we sit pretty close and there’s a point where it feels like he’s gonna kiss me but he stops (no idea why) and after a few minutes, he decides to leave. Hugs me and says he had a great time and “we should jam soon again”. I told him I enjoyed the evening as well. 

6. After the date - I text him to drive safe and let me know when he reaches. He does and that’s it. Again I don’t hear from him the next morning(last text was mine) so I send him a funny message at 5 pm and he replies casually. No personal questions. No mention of date. No how are you? At night I also see he has changed a detail on his dating app profile. 


**Other things** - I had asked him what he was looking for on the app and he said a relationship. His profile was decent too. We talked about our mutual hate for tik tok and how we aren’t on it but During the date he got a message and his phone was pointed towards me so I saw it was a tiktok notification on the app. 


If you’ve made it this far, thank you for investing your time in my life problem. I appreciate you❤️

**Final detail**- I tried a lot to ask him questions and put my bestest foot forward. However, I’ve never been so confused about someone. I also recognize I’ve a fearful avoidant/anxious mix style of attachment however I prefer clear communication and genuine effort. Texting him for so long everyday and him being so funny and so easy going made me feel connected to him. But seeing these mixed signals and the update on the dating app has messed me up. I’m searching for a therapist to talk through my attachment and traumas. 

**But at this moment with this specific person, how should I proceed?**

Online dating and in person dating has become significantly worse since the lock downs. People don't want to meet anymore. It's all digital interaction.

As a single guy with my life somewhat put together - I work a decent job, have my own place, grad school, etc - I do have a decent amount of matches but it's always the same.

Women that I match with will want to talk a lot, but when it comes to actually meeting up in person for a simple cup of coffee or a quick 30 min. lunch, that becomes a chore and pulling teeth. 

I feel like people have become so self absorbed and materialistic and want the instant gratification that the concept of actual dating doesn't exist anymore. 

I don't care too much for the hookup culture and would rather focus my energy on something that'll at least be more than a one night stand but at this point that doesn't seem too likely.

I know dating is hard for both genders out there but I needed to vent after having to just go cold turkey on most forms of social media and online dating because they're just not for me. I prefer meeting people organically but that's even becoming less of an option these days due to the health crisis and general overall behavior of people being skeptical of interacting with new people.

Anyways just thought I'd put up a vent out there. I think I have my life at least somewhat together enough to be dateable / presentable... 

I don't get what the point of dating these days is if when you talk after a few days / week, ask to meetup for a quick mutual public place that's now a chore.

Only in the last year have I signed up for all the apps and tested the waters. After maybe ~50 matches for people I would potentially see myself dating I finally got far enough with one (24f) to actually ask on a date. We went on a first date, coffee, had a really good 2 hour convo. Second date, walked around the city, got dinner, spent ~6 hours together. Third date the other night, got dinner and went back to her apartment to *watch TV*. Now I know what y’all are thinking after that last one, but it wasn’t like that. We’ve both been incredibly reserved throughout all our dates, minimal physical contact (furthest we got is that we snuggled up pretty close at her apartment where we literally just watched TV), haven’t discussed anything relationship wise, past experience etc. or shared any deep feelings.

At the end of the last date when I was leaving her apartment she guaranteed a next date saying I should pick what we do next because she planned this last one. I was discussing it with friends yesterday and they couldn’t resist calling me a “fucking idiot” because I was alone in her apartment with her and didn’t make any moves, and all I could think was “so what”. I’ve heard no shortage of stories where couples take months to get intimate and serious, and I don’t see any problem in that if we’re both really enjoying spending time with one another. If she really felt like I wasn’t *satisfying* her, she would have called this off by now or made a move herself, right?

I know she’s had at least one ex and she mentioned some funny things guys have said to her on tinder/bumble in the last couple years so she’s been dating for a while but I don’t know how far any of those relationships had gone, for all I know only as far as we’ve gone. She’s also mentioned that PDA makes her uncomfortable and she considers herself rather prude. I guess I sort of feel the same way, not sure if that’s just the way I am or the complete lack of experience. My friends say I’m going to lose her if I keep things at this pace and I just can’t fathom the mindset that if you’re not smashing by the 3rd date you’re not meant for each other.

But I had a lot of love for her and when she made me feel bad, sad I would just think thats how she is and its normal.

Then at the end of November she, my best friend and I were talking then my best friend asked her what kind of music she listens to and I answered saying that she listens to pop and some alternative rock (she listens to taylor swift and arctic monkeys the most). Then I realised what I did was pretty rude and should've just let her answer herself then she got pretty upset which then I told her she did that to me 3 times that same conversation. I know like ""getting revenge"" is dumb but I actually didn't do that to get revenge I just did it randomly. Two days later she tells me what I did was really disgusting and among other things she told me that we should put some space between us for some time so I basically said alright however you want and I didn't want to lose her. I have been through a lot of insults 

Then until now we had that space between us and whenever i tried to move a little closer she told me that we still aren't like our past selves, give me time, let me heal and I always said alright however you prefer I'm always here. From last week to now she has been acting colder and further and I always told her that she's acting like that she said ""no you are making it up"". Now like 2 hours earlier she told me that she wants to be friends and wants me to be her friend and that she has lost feelings so I said alright let's stay friends because she pushed me away so much I kind of lost feelings as well.

Then an hour earlier I asked her for my bracelet that she had. It is very very very special to me and she knows that. She told me that she was going to give it to me anyways and she didn't want anything to do with my bracelet, she told her that she would have threwn it to my face right now if she could called me disgusting and said don't ever do anything with money involved with me ever again.

He agreed, but didn’t show enough enthusiasm to actually set the plans and never contacted me. Probably a new girl in the picture, and now I felt like I was just a hookup to him.

Then 3 weeks later I get a random snapchat of him taking a selfie and a text “so tired after work”. I didn’t respond, because I didn’t like the way he flaked on me earlier.

I just don't feel same as few days ago. I feel so suspicious and paranoid the she would break up with me or something and also idk I don't believe that girl like that even exist so I can't feel comfortable in this kind of relationship...I also had phases like that before, than a few months of relationship and than again same thing.

So many rejections. Its not that I cared sometimes, I only offered a 2nd date because I tend to think its not a bad idea even if you didnt feel a really strong connection. Then I had two situations where women vented to me for a whole date. One was a 2nd date and she vented to me about another guy she was seeing. I had other instances where all signs where good that we connected, but then didnt here back from them for days after, then to be told they didnt feel a connection.

People ghosting or just not being fair of my time. Like going into a 2nd date knowing your not interested and venting to me like im your therapist.   


I feel like I've come a long way though. I have more confidence and im started to care less if someone rejects me.   


But I notice i get really sensitive to small things. I had a great first date last night and we both exhanged the ""I had a great time"" text. We texted a bit this morning about something we talked about yesterday. When I went for the 2nd date question she took hours to respond. She actually responded as I was typing this out. I was legitimately thing ""here we go again"" and was bracing for rejection.   


She was working lmao ofcourse she cant respond right away, but it took me back to the times people have taken 24 hours to reject me or choose to be very vague instead.   


I know this is all typical modern dating experiences, but I struggle to not project. I guess maybe the answer is to care less. It is just rough how many times rejection happens.  


I know its just the process. But I see potential for more dates in 50% of the people I see, but maybe 5% accept it and like barely 1% go past a 2nd date.   


I guess is beats not trying. Just harder then I thought. Every once and awhile I think I might have found someone and that I can be done with this early dating process for awhile, but then things fall apart and im back to square one.

I am 24M new to dating. I recently met this
girl online. We connected pretty well, and after a few
days of talking online, we went on our first date. The
first date went well. We went to a outdoor patio. I even
picked her up and dropped her off. We had some
mutual friends so it wasn't like we were complete
strangers. My question is after the first date, we both
agreed that we'd like to meet up again for a second
date. I suggested ""next week"" when we're both not
working. She said she had plans with her friends on her
days off so no worries maybe another the next week
after that. (So 2 weeks after our first date). We've been
texting back and forth since our first date but her
response time is extremely slow (approx 12-24hours)
just to respond. Her responses aren't really dry since
she usually continues the conversation by sharing
something or asking a question but I am wondering if
this is normal? I usually respond within an hour or two
depending if I am working. I just don't want to be
emotionally invested and then get turned down. I do like
this girl but if it's not reciprocated, I would like to start
seeing other people. Am I being too needy? This is new
to me so I am curious what others think. Please share
your thoughts and advice.

I feel like if I get some thoughts, it'll help me move on.

I met ""Matt"" on vacation. We hung out over the course of several days. We had this great connection going on and we spent several hours talking. We never kissed or anything like that, but there was still a lot of chemistry. I started to catch feelings for him, and I could kind of tell that he liked me too.

One night, he introduced me to some other people he met on the trip. One of them was ""Peter"". Peter and Matt had just met on the trip. Peter was with some family friends of his. We were all hanging out at a bar when Peter asked if we wanted anything. I initially said no, but I started to feel drunk, so I asked him if he could get me a water. I went to sit down on a couch, and Peter bought me the water. He was hitting on me, putting his hand around my waist and sitting really close to me. I had to use the restroom later, so I told him, and he asked if I needed help. I said I was fine.

I don't remember much about what happened after, but I had to get escorted back to my room. Everyone helped, and I was talking really loud in the hallway when Peter literally shushed me by putting a finger on my lips.

The next morning, one of the girls asked me if I like Matt. She told me that Matt said that he liked me. I was really excited, and wanted to know how it happened, but they wouldn't tell me much details except that it was after I was taken to my room and that they were all there. Later, I asked Matt if he liked me. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. I know he got really upset at our friends for telling me what he said.

I tried to request to follow him on Instagram, and left it pending for a couple of days before he rejected it. He broke up with his girlfriend about two months after he and I met. We're still not in contact, but looks at my social medias every now and then. Whether it's TikTok or Twitter, he's always one of the first to view my content.

But right now my pride is too high and I’m afraid to text him back and tell him why I ignored him. (Usually I ignore because if I’m having a depressive episode I’ll just be very cranky and unpleasant to speak to, so I avoid everyone.)
Please tell me what I should do. I feel kind of embarrassed with how I just disappear without closure. But I also don’t know why he would be curious of my whereabouts. I can’t expect everyone to have the same heart as me but it feels like the bare minimum and it’s causing me to overthink things even more, like do you not care? Does he not want to seem clingy? I know people don’t like that, but I personally do. His past 2 relationships went sour with the girl btw, one cheated on him and one ghosted him. I wonder if he’s bringing this fear with him to me, and I have no desire to hurt him because I don’t want to waste anyones time. But I really don’t know because he hasn’t completely opened up.

We met at college. I was really attracted to him for months, or so I thought. He was super good looking and seemed nice when we talked on campus but turned out to be very emotionally available, would ghost me for weeks and didn’t give much consideration to making me feel safe or comfortable. We got intimate in the woods on 2 different occasions. We never went all the way but some clothes came off and we made out and touched each other quite a bit. I realized he was using me. 

The first time we met up was just kissing and walking around the woods. It was okay. He initiated the first kiss way too fast and I should have dipped after that. But I was naive. The second time we got more intense. I felt nauseous pretty quickly but tried holding it back. Eventually I ended up getting sick and throwing up which was so embarrassing. I have since stopped talking to this guy because he’d only hit me up when he wanted physical action. I don’t know why I hated it so much. I went along with the experience because I wanted to make him happy and wanted to have a boyfriend...but in reality I just wanted to get away. Eventually I found some sense and stopped talking to him. 

He was very pushy and I’m a romantic person. I’d try to get him to go on dates like hang out at the mall or to the park and he’d always refuse and make up an excuse as to why he couldn’t. Before getting intimate I want to hold hands, cuddle, and feel close and safe with a guy. I hate hookups. I’d want to be emotionally involved before doing anything like that again. Ideally this would be in a bed. Not in a hot forest with the sun beating down on us. I may have gotten sick because it was so hot out and he wouldn’t let me up for air. 

Since this day, I have a decreased attraction to men in general. My desire to date or get romantically involved with another man has plummeted but this may be because I’m healing and finding my self worth again. But at the same time, I still fantasize about finding a good man someday that makes me feel loved and cherished, where I can express myself physically and emotionally. But honestly I prefer living in my head more. I was so hurt by this experience and it really shook me up. I don’t know if I’m asexual but value romance or me and him were just not a match.

I haven't dated for 4 years because I wanted to work on myself and make sure that the reasons I'm looking for a partner are genuine. I want to be in a deep and meaningful relationship. My biggest kink is to love and be loved back. That unconditional love kind of vibe. That 'us against the world' energy. 
I'm in my mid 20's, average looking so I'm sort of staying in my lane on that area though I don't really care about looks as long as they don't look like they haven't showered in a week. Just decent.


-I want a nerdy guy who is peaceful, quiet, genuine and sweet. Someone who is going to invest the amount of time,energy and effort as I'm going to. Someone who is going to respect my individuality. An introvert because I think I would relate more to someone like that more. I don't think I'm asking for too much. I don't mind if we are different people that's why there are compromises in relationships.
I would like someone who is looking for a partner not  to see me as a means to an end.

-ideally between 23-35 since we can have lots to talk about...I think. 

- here is the twist I want a long distance relationship. Before someone says that's it's better to date from where I'm from believe me I  have tried. There are lots of guys looking for a 'fuckable mommy' and the obligatory mention  'single' guys who are married or in long term relationships. I lost faith in dating around here when I decided to check the instagram page of a guy I thought we had a great connection. There was a video of him in bed listening to music and you could clearly hear a baby breast feeding next to him after he swore he was single. I keep thinking there must someone out there who is going to be worth it.

Here is my experience so far:
 Lots of love bombing 

Intense connection and then out of nowhere the energy just changes. 

Is it too much to want someone who is as sure about me as I am with them. I remember in my previous relationship everything just felt right. At the beginning It was just easy. We both knew within 2 weeks that we were sure we wanted to be together because we put in the effort to really know each other. Communication was not an issue. We shared everything the good and the bad and I didn't have to be careful with my thoughts and opinions. We both felt free. It was one of the most beautiful and genuine relationship I have ever been in and I have set as my standard for the 'bare minimum'. I think subconsciously I'm trying to recreate that kind of closeness.

We’ve shared vulnerable Moments, he’s told me what he likes about me and has asked what I like about him. He has asked me “what i want”

We’ve had heart to hearts and we see each other once a week on the weekends, every now and then skipping a week. When we get together our time spent together her has been increasing, from one day to two days to almost 3 days of being together, having a flow state of hanging out at home and connecting or doing activities outside of the house. We’ve met some of each other’s friends.

But of course I have this weird feeling I’m not the only one. That’s fine to me from the get go- we’re allowed to play the field. But it’s been 3 months I asked once before if he was dating anyone else and he said “he didn’t think so” 😑😑😑 but then asked if I was. I said I stopped seeing others when we met. 

That was after 5 weeks of seeing each other though. I figured I brought it up too soon.

One week ago I asked if we are exclusive and if he is interested in keeping his options open. I told him where I was at- that I wasn’t 
Interested in planting other seeds and that I want to see him exclusively. It was a positive conversation but he dodged it in a way I didn’t expect. I expected a yes or no or for him to dodge but I didn’t detect the dodge.

He said he wanted more time to get to know me and that he needed to think about. Since then he has been calling and texting more. Not surprised, I think he’s worried to an extent about me stepping back. 

 But I expected him to get back to me the next day. I don’t intend to wait for his answer. My goal is to go about this positively so I feel like I can walk away from this with dignity. 

We had our day yesterday which was a Sunday because we both had diff plans on Friday and Saturday.  

When I got to his place it was obvious he had had a get together. Earlier in the week, I had asked him about switching our day to Friday for the wknd because I had an event on Saturday. He told me had plans. I found out yesterday he had a party and he never even told me:( I felt so hurt by that. When he texted me on Friday all he said was that he was AT a party. 

I’ve been so deflated since and pretended yesterday like it didn’t bother me as much as it did. I told him it bummed me out but that was it. He said he thought it was too soon to meet his friends. 

I think this is just fluff he is telling me. I understand space and taking time to get to know each other but he already told me a while ago when I asked him what else he wants to know about me, that he “has a pretty good picture of who I am.” I don’t understand why he would even want to hold onto me if he’s dating other ppl and isnt ready to move forward with me. We’re in our 30’s (me 30, him 36) and he calls to face time me almost every evening and he is into emotionally connecting with me. It just doesn’t make sense. 

I’ve seen him in the dating app a lot though so I clearly have my answer: he’s either already dating others or very much interested in doing so.

I told him when I got home this morning that I was sorry for being off yesterday. 

He understands depression and he thought that that was all I was experiencing but obviously it was because of him. So he was supportive and I told him I would talk to him about it later. I think whenever I get on the phone with him I’m going to give him my shpeel.

“Hey. When I was upset at your place, I was upset about multiple things that I was hesitant to talk about due to being in such an emotional state.

A couple weeks ago I asked you about whether or not we’re exclusive or if you’re open to or interested in meeting other ppl yet, meaning sexually and romantically. When I asked it, I didn’t intend to wait for an answer.

I misunderstood how much time you needed on that. I thought you merely needed to sleep on it. NAME, if you need more time to think about it then you should do that. Your happiness is important to me. I want you to go explore and figure out what you want. But I can’t be here for that. The part where you need to figure it out- You have to take space and do that alone. I like you ñame. i just can’t be so sure about you at this moment if you’re not sure about me. If you figure out what you want you can reach back out to me. And I hope I’m still here if you do. 

I know you like me too. It’s not okay for me to wait if you’re still figuring it out. If we’re not on the same page but we keep seeing each other, in the same way we have been, we’re not going to be able to get anywhere. I don’t want to resent you for not reciprocating and stalling with me or have a guard up because I’m afraid to be hurt- that’s not fun. I want to make healthy decisions and I want to emulate the type of partner I hope to be in a relationship with one day.”

My 25M girlfriend 25F of one month is wanting me to go on a trip with her and her sister for spring break. While I’m not against it entirely, I really don’t have the extra money right now to spend on it but I haven’t completely told her or said no yet. 

Anyway, tonight her and I had planned to go on a hike after I get off work and before she has class at 7, so after that, I planned to have dinner and go to the gym. She texted a little bit ago and asked if I had anything planned around 8, because her and her sister wanted to meet and plan for the trip. I told her I was planning to go to the gym, but maybe we could all do it a different night or she could just tell me what they come up with. 

Keep in mind we try to see each other a few times during the week and every weekend so we see each other often. My question is, she seemed like she was a little upset that I was going to the gym instead of going with her and her sister to plan the trip.

I have been dating for 4 years now, with 3 relationships lasting 5 months (28M), 7 months (30M), and 3 months (32M) in that order. Is the following a string of bad luck or is there something i can improve for future relationships?

My first boyfriend was a late bloomer like me and we were eachother's first but I guess after a lot of years of that from him he developed death grip and although I did what I could to please him, he was incredibly neurotic (we could only do a little bit of missionary because anything else would make the bed shake and he worried about noise for neighbours) and despite my patient researched suggestions on how to deal with death grip, he never made any effort. He was always clearly attracted to me, said so in genuine and specific ways, and never had problems getting aroused. So I eventually ended things because he wasn't trying at all to fix the problems, even with my support. We were both big but not huge people and it felt like he was hiding me as well, which also contributed to the end.

My second boyfriend was very conventionally attractive, extroverted, and very sexually experienced but due to strong adherence to COVID, was looking to settle his life down from his previous party ways. He didn't have the same problems but it was clear he was never very attracted to me. He loved my personality and wasn't afraid to show me off to friends. But he never stared at me, complimented me or wanted to have sex based on how I looked, the only way to arouse him was through touch and despite both being high drive, the amount of sex we had dropped off pretty quickly with him also experiencing some problems due to work stress. I never felt valued by him, and he didn't make any efforts to support or reassure me of his feelings/attraction. He eventually broke up with me because he felt I was too mature for him but he was a people pleaser so I will never know the real reason but I suspect that wasn't it.

My most recent boyfriend is the only one I truly felt like I loved and who loved me back. We laughed so much, had similar interests and worldviews, were comfortable together, tried new things together, and understood eachother well and communicated well on most issues, it seems, except for sex. I would check in with him semi regularly to discuss it, and took and gave feedback. But when we ran into even minor issues from him, which I would reassure him on and tell him how happy he made me, he would shut down and want to end things. The first time is when he first wanted to invite me back for sex but I wasn't fully ready yet. He wanted full transparency from me on all my issues and I gave it but when he has issues like this he wouldn't do the same, just withdraw and need space. The second time was our first weekend having sex and after like the 7th time in 3 days, he couldn't finish... Not concerning as it's always awkward at first and he hadn't been with anyone for 2 years prior. He tied to break up with me then but I said we should keep trying, I wasn't judging him for that issue. The most recent incident, which preceded our real breakup, was a few days where he wasn't saying the normal sweet things about me and my appearance as before, not initiating as much only a month in (I did mention this to him as part of his ""open and honest"" policy) and when we did have sex, finishing much earlier than usual because I ""made him extremely horny"" and now a couple days later he breaks up with me because he thinks he will quickly lose his current attraction for me even though it's present at the moment. But yet he finds me so irresistible he does shit like bite my face, he kisses me all over all the time... Not clear signs that someone isn't attracted to you like my last boyfriend gave. He says he was dating me because I'm an amazing person, I made him laugh, and I made his life better. But because he wasn't 100% physically attracted to me, it wouldn't work

In all of these relationships, I tend to date them for a couple months before having sex, being exclusive first, and establishing that we both want a serious relationship. I put a lot of effort into sex, have a high libido and rarely deny PIV sex and if I do for a biological reason, I make sure I please them with hands/mouth. I've given oral to all 3 even though only my second gave me any (I don't need it but it's nice anyway). I make sure to show affection in non sexual ways. I'm easy to please and express myself verbally, I ask what they like and pay attention to what seems to be extra pleasing to them. I do research on oral and other sex techniques. I am a big girl, I have scars from medical issues in the past, but I have a pretty face, nice hair, and wear flattering clothes and light makeup. I have decent self esteem on the whole, though I'm aware I have some underlying issues where I don't feel completely worthy of love so I put in a lot of effort into all aspects of my relationships that I didn't feel was matched until my most recent boyfriend.

What am I doing wrong? Is it just bad luck? If they are not attracted to me, why are they dating me for 2 months only to have a few weeks/months of sex with someone they don't really like inside and out? Am I not worth the effort of moving past the occasional awkward sex session? Is there anything I can do to better support future partners during incidents like these?

TL;DR - I put effort into sex and only have sex with serious prospects but yet it seems all my relationships end because the guys have sexual performance issues and they won't put in effort to work through them, or say they aren't attracted to me after all.

Her boyfriend works for my company, and they're out of state so it was a reason for us to visit. I came along to meet one of my coworkers, who I'd been talking to over the phone quite a bit and we seemed to get along really well. Long story short, we ended up going out and hooking up the first night I was there - I initiated him coming back to my hotel, he spent the night, we cuddled and loved on eachother, and then grabbed breakfast the morning after with my best friend and her boyfriend.

I wanted to hang out with him the entire weekend, but my bf's boyfriend and him got into an argument together (men and their masculinity) and he ended up staying behind for the duration of my trip. Personally, I find that to be extremely immature and was a little irritated about it but wasn't trying to hold any expecations since we hadn't talked about anything further. He ended up dropping by the morning of my flight, we hooked up one more time before I left, hugged and kissed goodbye and that was it.

Now reality of everything - We live in different states, we don't talk much unless it's for work because we keep things casual and we know that. Howeverrrr, the time we did spend together was literally amazing. Everything came so natural and we were immediately ourselves, it felt like this was our hundreth time being intimiate and I've never felt that way in any other hook up situation, and I'd find it hard to believe he didn't feel the same.

1. Would you make plans to see eachother again? (whether he flys to me or I fly to him)
2. Would you make any effort to progess it more than it is?
3. Would you take it for what it was and move on to the next person?

My goals are outside of the need of dating. I have been given certain talents that I would like to use as effectively as possible and not waste any time with other things. i.e. I do not dream of a family or even living together with anyone. However, not having been intimate with anyone for 5 years makes me, from time to time, shiver for needing to hug and care for someone. 

I bury these emotions with even more work and hard exercise which are my main sources of joy and fulfillment. Then I just try to go to sleep before I get so tired that I become sentimental and remember these things again. Funnily enough, this is getting into my dreams as well. Last night I was making out with an air suspension system. Talk about sexual orientation! 😂

Dating real women is hard work for a man. At least harder than mathematics and engineering and I even find the latter more fulfilling. But still there seems to be the primal need for the real deal. So what to do?

I had been trying to separate just sex, but he was the one who kept saying he wanted me to talk to him more, and making comments when I didnt reply fast. Finding all these things we have in common. Commenting on the art I make. Getting emotional, telling me when he was sad too. It’s been a really hard time in general (we both work in the music industry). He said we were leaning on each other. Why do you even want so much emotional connection from me if you dont want anything?

They were all like my main ways I even cope. Sharing these things meant so much to me, and now he's ruined them.  They are the things that made me feel like myself, and usually in this situation I would throw myself back into them, but now I can't, and I'm an unstimulated mess. One of them is Zelda that literally got me through 2020, and he told me he wanted to play it,  and then through 2021 for a couple of months kept talking to me updating me on what he was doing in the game as if it was updating me on his day. And now I cant even play it. 

I posted a book i was reading, and he replied saying it was his favourite (wtf) and now I'm reading the second one and was updating him on it a bit, but now I can't fucking finish it.

How do you not care that that was your favourite book, that we had that in common. These things are a big deal to me.

Fullmetal Alchemist as well, I fucking love it and I never got to talk to him about it more. I'm the stupid one for thinking we could watch anime together, or play zelda with me (it was also distance, so I never got to even see him in the end)

I cant make art cause he was always commenting on my works and being really supportive.

When I was pointing it out that we found all these things in common, he wasn’t even acknowledging any of that. Feels like he doesn’t even care, even tho he was the one who kept finding things. It clearly didn’t even mean as much to him.

So I’m a final year undergrad going into masters this year (in autumn). Recently I met this cute phd student at a local climbing gym, who is coincidentally under my uni and same department at uni. 

I go every week and after a couple weeks we exchanged a few words. The next week exchanged quite a few sentences. I found him on Instagram and added him. Today he wasn’t there so I thought I’d ask him how come. He replied quickly and with some questions which is a good sign :) 

But idk, he never looks at my Instagram stories or likes my post. Actually he looked at my first story when I added him but none since then. I don’t really care, I use Insta as more of a photo book but it’s making me doubt if he’s just humouring me by replying. My friend thinks he’s humouring me. We often smile at each other when climbing though.

I kind of want to ask him out for a drink and normally I would but it’s the fact that a) he’s a PhD student so maybe he would never be interested in that way due to academic/age difference (also there are weird rules with uni dating? I checked and he still counts as student not staff so should be fine. Age differences have never bothered me btw). Also b) the fact he didn’t look at my story but replied to my message is maybe showing disinterest IMO. I don’t want to make things weird; both in the case of the uni and in the climbing environment.

Also I’m not in the US I know you guys are weirder/stricter with age and academic differences over there.

Its just a waste of time. If someone is behaving indecisive then it let's me know where they stand.

And this doesn't have to revolve around dating only, it can be friendships too. Dating however seems to be the dominant factor when it comes to fickleness. 

I've just come to the point after failed relationships, that if someone is taking their sweet time to decide how they feel about you, or more importantly, if they seem really interested in you one minute and then the next they seem distant then it just indicates to me that either they're a 

1.) player
2.) Confused and has emotional issues, unstable.

As much as I may like a person or feel chemistry with someone if they're not taking actions to show me they're interested or do but then don't proceed further then I'll just assume that they're not that interested or maybe they have someone else. 

It's a sad reality but after so many let downs, lies and manipulations I've had to build a strong boundary on what I will allow and what is important to me and thats my peace. I can't recall how many times I've let someone disturb my peace and I know that ultimately comes down to me, but if I feel I'm not getting peace from a situation then its not worth it.

I 18 F entered a university last year. I had been single all my life and i was partially desperate to have a bf since I wanted to experience a relationship.

Now there is this one boy let's call him x 18 M and he had the a crush on me.

Now in school nobody as in particularly liked me, cause most of them were committed.I had low self esteem and the idea of someone having crush on me made me over the clouds.

One day x and I sat with two of my friends and they kept teasing him about me.

And x and I had a common friend  y who literally shipped us.

When returning to out dorm y asked what if x proposed to me.

I don't know what on earth I was thinking but i said yes. I mean I felt attractive but i think desperation took over me.

Next day he proposed and i said yes.

Now the next day we meet and when we held hands together it just wasn't it. I didn't feel comfortable around him. When I walked along with him I had this weird feeling. I can't explain how uncomfortable I was.

So I broke things the very next day just a day year relationship.

Y got mad at me for leading him on but i said I did feel attraction but I don't I was just not comfortable and she said I was childish immature and yea an AH.

But in my defence I said i didn't lie about how I felt I mean it would've hurted more if i lead him on longer. I feel guilty but i couldn't help it.

Past 2 weeks she said that she was going through a lot of things with family and getting rejected from her dream college. I offered help but she didn’t take it. At work she acted weird too so I didn’t know what to do.

Yesterday I texted her saying that she had been acting really strange and other things and she called me crying and basically told me that she is going through so much right now (she finally told me all the problems) and that she doesn’t think she can handle a relationship right now. I understood and accepted it but she said that she still wanted to be my friend because I helped her so much this past month and in the future maybe she’ll change her mind about potentially wanting a relationship. I said idk because I liked her a lot so it would be hard for me. I could tell that really hurt her because she told me she felt alone. I told her if she ever wanted a relationship then to call me but that she needs time to think and space.

20 minutes later I texted her saying that I still wanted to be her friend cause she is going through a tough time right now and I wanted to be there for her because no else was. She didn’t text me back until 3 hours later saying that she talked to her mom and confided in her with everything she was going through and helped her realize a lot. She told me that life is too short for regrets and that she can’t stop living because she’s going through things. She said she wants to start a new chapter in her life. She also apologized for everything she said on the phone and that she was in the heat of the moment.

She told me she wants to do a fresh start with me, to do everything right this time around and for us to go on more dates. She said she still doesn’t have a label for us and that she wants to take it slow and see if we would work. I made sure she was ok with this and she said she was so I agreed to do a fresh start.

I’ve been seeing this guy since Dec 16th. Well.. we had a first date (that went great) and then he ghosted me.. but came back around a week later stating that he was going through something, he should have communicated that better, and he was into me. He even followed up with a phone call apologizing and telling me I can hold it over his head forever. 


Since then.. we’ve had 9 dates (well 5 or so formal sit down dates 5 “hangout” type) and we’ve also been intimate a couple times.
He told me he sees us moving towards a relationship but wants to take it slow since he feels like that’s where his last relationship went wrong. I told him, I agree, we need more time and we’re on the same page about that. He wants to build more of a foundation.

That being said, I’m still on hinge and I know he is too. If I were to guess I would even go as far as to say that he’s probably seeing other women and honestly, I’m fine with that. We just met each other 1.5 months ago. He told me he isn’t having sex with anyone else but he’s definitely still out there. 
When I asked how he thinks “we are going” he said things are going great, he likes dating me, but in a couple more weeks he’ll have to make a “decision”. I didn’t push him on what “decision” means.. but I’m guessing he means commitment. Although we still see each other, he’s been slower to text back, he doesn’t call as frequently, etc. i REALLY haven’t been pushy AT ALL about being in a relationship but I feel a general step back.

NOW IF THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

I’m going to give you the same answer I give every woman. . .

If you want your man to be 100% focused on you. . . Fantasizing about you  
during the day. . .

Counting down the minutes until he gets to see you again. . .

You don’t have to go to couples therapy.

You don’t have to resort to starving yourself hoping to get your tummy sexy  
for him.

You don’t have to buy a bunch of sexy lingerie (though there’s nothing wrong  
by doing that if you want.)

Nope, if you want your guy to become sexually and emotionally addicted to  
you, all you have to do is learn to TALK DIRTY and make love to his mind.

I’ve said this a lot, but a man’s number one erogenous zone isn’t in his  
pants, it’s in his head. . .

Look: Guys live in a state of perpetual sexual fantasy. And we all dream  
of meeting a woman who really understands our sexual buttons and knows  
how to push them in a really powerful way.

And they feel the same way. They support my decision not to be involved. They don't even consider the baby their grandchild.

The mother is now taking me to court for child support. She even wants retroactive child support for the last 15 months. She waited thinking I would change my mind and be involved. I think this is unfair, she knew I didn't want him. Even my parents feel the same way. Base on my income I would probably need to give around 650$ a month.

I haven't responded to her last text message or call, since a week now... I am thinking of just changing my phone number.

For sure paying child support will ruin my dating life..it's less money to go on dates and do activities.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156216,public,self,Would you date a guy that owes child support?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/shh010/would_you_date_a_guy_that_owes_child_support/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Like guys will just keep talking to me and texting me having conversation and then when it’s time to get romantic or something they back out or stop giving the type of energy when you first met them. It’s really exhausting because I’ll be talking so much or being direct and they’ll just not even be trying. Then I’ll just stop texting but they start the conversation back up like??? Do you wanna be friends or what? Like I’m fine with FWB but I don’t want it to be meaningless and dull.
