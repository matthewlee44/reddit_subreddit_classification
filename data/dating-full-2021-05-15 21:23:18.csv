I see on here guys who try both approaching women IRL and using online apps routinely say the IRL method works better 

A guy just approached me IRL and said I look lovely and had a chat and then he asked if we could meet sometime and took my number. 

Now, I can tell you for a fact if this guy had appeared on my dating apps I probably wouldn‚Äôt even have swiped right, I swipe right probably 1 in 35 and take less than half a second to swipe left. Left left left left, soo fast. 

But someone approaches you IRL, now they have REALLY stood out. They‚Äôve shown they‚Äôre polite (the compliment), confident (which is probably the most attractive thing in a lot of contexts) and made an impact on you which is incomparable to seeing a pic on a dating app for 1/4 of a second. 

As I said this guy wasn‚Äôt especially attractive at all and I prob would‚Äôve swiped left but now I‚Äôm excited to meet him as he impressed me and that‚Äôs made me feel glowy 

So it‚Äôs no mystery to me that guys of all levels of attractiveness on here state that going for the (perhaps rare these days) IRL approach have so much more success

I don't know how to explain without appearing mean, but really attractive girls that are just know for being super pretty. The ladies seen with buff guy's or guys with cool car's or a guy with swagger, not a geeky guy. 

This really pretty girl was interested in my last year, and it took too long for me to ask her out because she's more attractive than me and she was car girl. I got scared at first, but I did try to get into car stuff so we wouldn't be a mismatch couple that had nothing in common. My friends pointed I took too long to ask her out because of this, and not just asking her out when she liked me 3 months earlier.

To put it simply in a more understanding paragraph: I mostly all my dating life (school to adult life) have asked out that are just as attractive as me(I hope don't sound mean). I never bothered asking out girls out of my simpler because they'll always think I'm a friend, and friends are good to have.

I've heard of stories on Reddit in which a short son has a short mother with a father thats not short. The short mother wanted to breed with a man that wasn't short so they have a ""better"" chance of having children that aren't short. Then she has a short son and basically verbally and physically abuses him.

Basically telling him that she shouldn't have had him because he was short. Telling him to move out and go live somewhere else because hes not needed. How fucked up is this? I really don't even care about the height of my children myself even though i'm short. I could have a son shorter than me, but I wouldn't care and would still love him.

I've turned down a plethora of opportunities and purposely wouldn't call after getting numbers. I've been focusing on my goals and have been as selfish as you can get.

Part of it was because I was tired of putting in the effort. Another part of it was because of fear after having a tough breakup almost 10 years ago. I've spent many years protecting myself from pain. Most of it, however, was deliberate choice because I love freedom. I'm drunk in it and terrified of doing something stupid and winding up with children, or contracting an STD.

Before going celibate, I used to have one-night stands when I would travel for work. Hotel bar to hotel bar, I never seemed to have much issue with women when I was really wanting to get one in the sack. After a while, I deemed the effort to be exhausting and started to get more in touch with myself and enjoying time on my own.

Fast-forward four years. I've been woman-free since. But I'd like to break out of that shell and at least get back to playing the field again. And to be honest, I've become so rusty at dating, I don't even know where to start. Online dating has accelerated in adoption over the years. I've never tried it, but I've heard it's a toxic environment. People have told me I'm screwed because the playing field has changed, but has it really? Is approaching becoming a thing of the past?

Look out for scams on dating apps. I just reported one on hinge, they've gotten to a few of my marines as well.

The scam is... they lure you in by saying they're looking for something casual. The power of boners is strong, so you believe them. They ask for your WhatsApp and send you lewds in exchange for nudes. After you send nudes, they reveal themselves. While you're busy sending pictures of your junk, they hack into your phone and get all your contacts information (including Facebook). Then they threaten to release them to all your contacts if you don't send them money.

I (18M) work part-time as an elementary school librarian. For the past almost 2 weeks now, there's been a new girl in town, about my age, doing volunteer work at the school. AFAIK, she just goes around looking for people who need help and doing things with them, which is basically what I did the first few weeks I worked there.

One day she came in and asked if I needed any help while I didn't have a class visiting, and I just let her hang out and talk story for like half an hour. We hit it off pretty good, and now she comes and hangs out with me almost every day.

Let me tell you, she's been nice to have around. She's always got a pretty smile on her face and seems to like hanging around me. Plus, we have a lot of common interests,  so there's plenty for us to talk about. And to top it all off, she's really pretty, and she has the cutest smile when I'm around her.

There's also been a couple days where I've come in and found a bowl of chocolate chip cookies with a card from her with hearts on it on my desk. I just think that's sweet.

Anyway, I'd been crushing on her for a while, so on Wednesday, I asked her if she wanted to go out on a date this Saturday, and she said yes! Well, I just got back from it, and let me tell you... it went AWESOME.

I left the house around 12:00pm and went over to go pick her up from her place in my Saab convertible lowrider (top's busted though). She was wearing the prettiest yellow sundress and had her hair up in a nice ponytail. I gave her a plumeria flower to wear in her hair, and then we headed off.

First we went down to the store to fill up my cooler with ice, snacks, and drinks, and to pick up lunch from the counter. Then, we went out to a longtime favorite beach of mine and spent the rest of the day there.

We ate lunch and talked story for a while, then went swimming, then we went for a walk down the beach, then we rested and talked story some more, then we just kicked back and listened to music for a while (and I got to hear her sing, she sounds beautiful), then we went swimming some more, and finally we watched the sunset.

As we were watching the sunset, we were sitting down on the ground next to each other holding hands. I told her today had been great and I couldn't think of anywhere else I would rather be right now. She said she also had a great time, and that she really liked being around me. We looked at each other for a bit until she decided to pull me in and kiss me! It was my first kiss with anyone in my life, and let me tell you, I fucking loved it. We spent the next 20 minutes laying there on the beach kissing and making out passionately.

After we were done making out, I decided it was time to go. I would've loved to stay for a few more hours, but was getting dark, and the area gets really dangerous at night with all the drug dealers and addicts running around. We drove around for a little bit before I dropped her off at home, and we shared another good night kiss before I left.

Well, I can tell this girl is a keeper. I can't wait until our next date, and to see what comes ahead for us in the future.

- The usual advice I get is to have social circles and meet through groups or friends of friends. The problem here is I have no friends and have no idea where to make new ones except ask a co-worker for drinks which apparently no one at my job likes to do. 

- The other is dating apps which have been a fruitless effort the last two years I‚Äôve used them. Nothing but time waster and people looking to hookup.

I don't like the whole proactive dating thing because I've tried it and I had no results all through my undergrad...

I just want to do my own thing without actively thinking about dating, but it just seems like men can't do that.

I'm no looker, probably a solid 3.5/10. I don't mind being honest that I'm not very attractive since I lost the majority of my depression weight and I don't hate seeing myself in a mirror anymore.

I just don't have the patience to mess with actively dating since I can't read nonverbal cues very well and I'm not the type of partner most people want given my career, lifestyle choices, and my interests.

I just wanna go about my life and not have to think about it, but I know it won't happen given men are still usually the one proactively dating. 

And given my appearance, I don't expect anyone approaching me.

So, I guess I just wish I could quit worrying about dating, but at the same time I'd like to find someone.

It's just frustrating because I just don't have any interest in the trying to date part of dating since it's kinda pointless for me given that I haven't been romantically attracted to anyone in year. not even really a crush either.

Basically the guy said that as a man it gets so exhausting because you know you have to not only compete with other men but also put on this act to entertain and perform and provide even if you don't have it and even if you don't want to


The only reason I think I have had so much success so far is because I am 6'6 and conventionally attractive

I am proud of my personality and a lot of women have said that but it does make me wonder if I was short and white and have the same personality if I would have the same success


Something I noticed growing up is specially after hitting puberty was dead other men feel very threatened by me and will try to cut me down and a lot of women would assume I would hit on them.

Looking back it was clear that some of these girls obviously like me but because I was the guy they expected me to perform or impress them in some way and that was never my personality


Contrary to popular belief most men know exactly how most women feel when it comes to dating and that's probably why so many men have it hard because they haven't practiced, and that is because so many women make it clear just how many creeps and monsters they meet


No man wants to be a woman's story about her daily creeper monster and no man wants to be her story about a guy who was pathetic or couldn't keep her going


I honestly do not believe that women or anybody can truly sense someone's levels of social skills or confidence because if that was true then I would have failed so many times but I've gotten by off of charisma and just being socially savvy enough

But it's harder with women because I know how the game is but you do not want to use these type of tactics or be fake when you're trying to form a genuine connection

And get the biggest risk of dating is that you have to be vulnerable and take a leap of faith and sometimes they can leave you with more damage than good


I dated a girl who obviously wanted to have sex but she wanted me to make it happen and it's crazy because she said she wanted to wait

I was completely cool with this and society would judge me negatively if I had any qualms about her reservations but looking back at it, of course socially and verbally she was going to be adverse to sex but because I was the man she wanted me to make it happen because that's the type of man she was attracted to


Everything I was brought up by society and my own family became backward


A lot of women say the dating is dangerous and can be a waste of time because of how many dead in partners that they find but I would argue it's the opposite for men because on our dates we have to act extra careful not to be too overconfident but not to sad or sensitive either and it just gets exhausting because you never know how much you need to be.



I cringe everyday looking back at high school because if I would have stopped acting so politically correct then I probably could have gotten a girlfriend
