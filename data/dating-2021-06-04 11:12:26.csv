1,ns8ygp,1622823519,The only way to not get attacked as a short/ugly/ethnic man for talking about your dating experience is to say you are giving up.,"I just saw a thread by a guy talking about how he feels he is confident and a good catch, therefore women who are rejecting him are making a stupid choice.

This is simple and logical. If he is confident, then he is a good catch. If he is a good catch, then women who reject him are making a stupid choice.

If on the other hand, women who are rejecting him are making a good decision, then he is not a good catch, and he is not confident if he believes that.

In return he got attacked. Many said, ""Well that's just because you're ugly."" Ironically, if he had claimed to be ugly, they would have attacked that and said, ""You're only failing because you think you're ugly!""

This is a common thread I have noticed. In fact, I have noticed the only thing you can say as a short/ugly/ethnic man who is not having success in dating and not get attacked, is ""I give up"" or maybe ""It's all my fault"" (even if that makes no sense since no one chooses their height/race/face - how can it be your fault?).

If you say you're a good guy and you can't understand why no one cares you're a ""nice guy."" If you're frustrated that women keep getting pumped and dumped by the same guys while you can't get a date you're an ""inc.e.l."" If you vent about the frustration of a thousand rejections ""dude you're only failing because you're so negative."" If you talk about all your positive traits ""well I wouldn't date you because you sound arrogant.""

There's literally nothing you can say that people won't attack except ""I give up"" or ""It's all my fault.""

What does that tell you? People should just be honest and get to the point. I think it's pretty clear what this all says.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ns8ygp/the_only_way_to_not_get_attacked_as_a/

Last night we were texting like usual on Snapchat and then out of nowhere I see he’s not on my friends list anymore? So I search his username up and try to add him back but it says I can’t, that they aren’t found. So next thing I do it text his number, but it doesn’t even deliver, just sends as a text instead of iMessage. Looks like he’s blocked both my phone number and my Snapchat? Which doesn’t add up based on where I’m standing. Nothing has happened to warrant this reaction, so I’m suspicious and want to know what happened.

A note I gotta make is his parents are very overbearing, border on kinda controlling by the way he explained it. Maybe something happened with them?

We actually had plans to go out Sunday afternoon. Should I still go and ask him what happened?

There's also a really cute place with a river near her house that we're gonna skip rocks at. We may also do a photoshoot in some cute outfits.

7,nsa1vp,1622826276,Am I (24F) Wasting My Time With My (29M) BF in Our Relationship?,"I have been dating my smart, funny, kind and compassionate bf for the past 7-8 months now. I have pretty bad anxiety, and he has grown so much over the past few months in learning how to help with my anxiety and communicating better about his emotions. I am proud of the progress we've made!

From what I have seen the effort is there: he makes himself available 24/7 to be there for me, initiates convos, drove hrs in the rain to bring me food when I got my wisdom teeth out, always worries about my needs, buys me thoughtful gifts, plans lovely trips, etc....

The only thing is: I fear the interracial aspect of our relationship may cause some issues down the line. I am Caucasian (Italian) and he is Asian (Chinese). He lives at home (pretty common culturally at his age) so he typically has me come over to his place when they're out of the house or in a room where they won't notice my entrance. At one point, I expressed how this was hurtful to me and he assured me that I wasn't being a secret, and that he knows they'll have to meet me eventually. **He stated he doesn't have the best relationship with his parents, and wants to protect our relationship**. A few months later now, I still haven't been formally introduced, but he's made it clear that they know who I am now ( I think they just put two and two together over time). His sister knows about me, and he stated just yesterday that he wouldn't have any issues with his friends meeting me, the fact I only speak English may cause for an awkward situation, but I'm willing to put my best foot forward.

With all that being said, I guess I just want some insight on whether you think I am being taken seriously. I suppose that worry stems from me needing validation from him that I am important in his life, and having me meet the people that are important to him would give me the reassurance I need that he truly wants me in his life. I want to get married, kids, etc, but him and I have yet to have these deeper convos...

Please be kind, I'd had a rough week mentally with the worrying and I just hear: break up break up break up.

tl:dr: Boyfriend and I appear to have good relationship, but I want to know if he takes me seriously",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsa1vp/am_i_24f_wasting_my_time_with_my_29m_bf_in_our/

While you're talking and hitting it off, discovering that you have many things in common and you feel some chemistry, there's actually other guys also trying to get her attention, so there's this ""chasing competition"" after one woman that you're not even aware of. You try to ask her out for coffee or a night of wine, anything that you'd both enjoy, but she doesn't ""have time"" but ""maybe next week?"" because she has to make up her mind. Okay, cool, it's not like you're in a rush, right? And of course, she likes the attention from multiple men, and she doesn't owe you anything, so she'll talk to every one of them that seems interesting. It's been two days, or a week, or maybe even a couple weeks, and that group of guys chasing her has only multiplied by now. Maybe she already went on a date with a couple of them. Why the f\*\*\* would she even pick you now? One of them has a bigger boner than you, another has more money than you, another has a different kind of charm, another one has \_\_insert whatever desireable trait\_\_ that you don't have. It's obviously hard for her to commit to any single one of them. This is what the online dating has created. It's created this culture where it's normal to be non-commital and where you're just disposable. Everyone calls it a number's game, and yeah, that's true, but no one talks about what kind of numbers we're actually talking about.

Everyone's type needs to be the same. Or... Everyone has to display eloquence when talking about eating experience. 

I keep getting bashed for being superficial no matter what topic I bring up on this sub and I also noticed other get bashed if no-one agrees with their anomaly view! 

But dating is not black and white!!!  I am not superficial for wanting xyz in a partner. 

The problem most people are single is probably because they don't fit a certain stereotype of what is considered ' these days '

I on the other hand expose myself and what I want in a partner. I'm ME no-one has to agree with me. 

So I mentioned previously, I don't see eloquence cr a must in online dating. I need them to know when to funny and serious. 

I like symmetrical features. 

I always believe personality matter and if the spark isn't there at all it won't work regardless of appearance. That's just me. I'm not intimidated by men, I'm charming. 

I've had matches and messages from all of them on dating sites, thousands, but only 1 or 2 were physically my type. 

Not being funny but, looks attract, personality keeps you. 

Tall, athletic, dark, handsome? NO. not for me
''Qwerky, nerd ''. NO not for me.

28,nsc7ks,1622832077,Guy I’ve been seeing for one month got mad that I wouldn’t send him nudes with my face in them.,"I (26) met a guy (37) a month ago on tinder. We have hung out four times total, and slept together each of those times. I’m very recently single and he knows I’m not looking for anything super serious at the very moment but I still enjoy spending time with him and sleeping with him. He seems to like what we have going on too. 

He always tells me how much he enjoys sex with me/how hot I am and last week he “casually/jokingly” mentioned how we should make a video of us having sex. I wasn’t sure if he was completely serious but I told him we could only if my face wasn’t in it. He agreed and said how he personally didn’t care if his face was in the videos. 

The last time we hung out at his house, we started having sex and he mentioned the video again. I was a little hesistant but he said he could film it on my phone so that the video would be for me mainly and that I could edit it/decide if I want to send it to him or not. I agreed and was fine with this. 

So he filmed some clips of us using my phone. My face was in a lot of them but I didn’t care because it was on my phone and I figured I could edit it later. I was happy having the videos on my phone because it was a nice reminder of how good the sex always is. We were sexting last night and I sent him a few clips from the videos he took of us, and made sure the only ones I sent had my face blurred out in them. The videos had his face as well but I didn’t blur them out. 

He was responding to these video texts very positively and kept telling me how hot I was and what not. He then asked me to send ones with my face in them so he could “see my pretty face”. I told him how I was not comfortable doing that. He immediately took offence to this and accused me of not trusting him with the videos that had my face in them. He said “I’m comfortable with you having videos that show my face in them, so why can’t I have videos that show yours?” And he told me how he found it insulting. I reminded him that I only have known him for a month and that we arnt even exclusive or anything, and that I barely know him so it was silly to blame me for not trusting him with my nudes. I also told him how it’s different for girls to have nudes with their face than it is with men, because it’s usually men that use the videos to be malicious. He thought that was not a valid point and even told me how he has “way more to lose” than I would due to his career. I told him I was offended he thinks he’d have more to lose than me. I also mentioned how the videos were his idea, not mine. HE was the one who wanted to film them then accused me of not trusting him as much as he trusts me since I have his face in the videos and he doesn’t have my face in his copies. 

I then got very angry and basically went off about how he was manipulating me and not respecting my boundaries. I told him if he can’t respect my boundaries to delete my number and that the only reason I didn’t trust him before with my nudes with my face was because I hardly knew him, and that it was too soon to know what his intentions are we’re with me/that it wasn’t anything personal. I then said how now I don’t trust him for the fact he’s trying to guilt me into sending him something he KNOWS I’m uncomfortable with. 

The last message I wrote was “if a guy I met a month ago, who has zero commitment towards, me has the nerve to complain my nudes arnt personal enough for him, then that is a bullet dodged”.

He then apologized (it was a short apology) and I think he only did it because he knew how pissed I was. I didn’t respond to him and I’m debating on cutting him off completely. 

What do you guys think. If he messages me again what should I respond with? Should I block him? It sucks because I really liked what we had going and it was really helping me move on from my last toxic relationship and the sex was amazing.

Everything was going good but when it was night we were laying on the couch and he had just smoked some 🍃 which is normal for him he does that almost everyday. We saw a movie when he suddenly asked me to touch him privately and I said no. He then placed my hand and sat on my body almost forcing me to touch him and when I didn’t wanted he got a little mad because he thought I didn’t liked his private parts because I never touch him but it’s because I’m quite shy when it comes to taking initiative in a early relationship. We went to bed after and a couple hours later he woke me up wanting sex and I was sleeping but he blamed me saying “why don’t you wanna have sex with me” when I in reality just was sleeping. We ended up having sex when he wanted me to get on top of him and I’m really insecure about that position because I feel like I’m bad at it so I said no and he said that I had it too easy because he always has to do all the work. He finished and took a shower and I had a really bad feeling in my stomach. Like did he think I was boring and bad in bed? When he went out of the shower I decided to tell him the reason why I was holding a little bit back sexually and it was because i was raped when I was little. He didn’t respond to it but went to bed. A couple hours later he woke me up wanting to have sex again but I didn’t want because of what I told him and because I was sleeping so I thought it was little disrespectful because he blamed me again saying I never wanted to have sex with him because I always am tired which is not true. He then masturbated next to me while I pretended to be asleep.

37,nsdssu,1622836194,How do I tell my partners that I (28F) just got diagnosed with chlamydia?,"Ugh!  I'm absolutely gutted. I went in today for my annual exam and just as a  precaution although I have no symptoms of anything wrong asked the  doctor to test me for STD's as I did have unprotected sex one time a  month ago and I knew it was bad news when she called me only a few hours  later with the positive result for chlamydia. I seem to just have  terrible luck with medical issues this year :(

Now  I have absolutely no judgement towards people who enjoy casual sex but  that's never been for me. I was literally in an on/off relationship for  my college BF who I lost my virginity to up until September of this year  - mind you that's a 7 year on/off relationship. He had been the only  person I slept with. I found out in October I had gotten HPV from him,  the first blow. I started dating again in December this year and slept  twice with a British guy I met and we saw each other until the very end  of January but things just fizzled out. We used a condom every time. I  then met another guy shortly after who I fell hard for and we dated from  early Feb through first week of May. We also used a condom every time. I  was then so gutted over our breakup I went out one night with friends  and met a guy at a bar and we hooked up. There was quite a bit of  alcohol involved and stupidly didn't use a condom. I can only assume I  got it from this last guy since we didn't use protection, correct?

Ugh, do I need to tell all 3 guys? Of course I wait till my late 20s to  casually date more and this is what happens :/ I feel so dirty and  terrible. It was a one night stand with the last guy so I don't even  talk to him. Would it be terrible to send an anonymous text from the  Tell A Partner website?

I was honestly impressed with how openly he was communicating with me and it made me like him more. After a little while longer, we did end up having sex and it was really great. We definitely had chemistry and there was a lot of potential for a really fun, intimate relationship. Afterwards, we spent most of the day together and I thought enjoyed each other's company. Since then he's not responded to my texts. I haven't sent a whole bunch or anything, just one ""hey, how's your day going"" and then after he didn't reply for a couple days, I sent a message about how I would have been down for a one time thing and that if he had just been honest from the beginning we could have saved each other some time.

47,nsefhh,1622837838,My date went back to her abusive ex...,"The title pretty much sums it up, but heres the long version:

Me and this girl met online and we started talking for about 4 days prior to the issue.

I was really into her and she was really into me. I then asked her if she would be down for a bite to eat and a few drinks at a local restaurant on saturday (tomorrow) - she was flattered and enthusiastically accepted this offer.

On wednesday afternoon, she said 'Im Bored, I want you to do something about it'. So ofc straight away I said I can come over in a bit, she then decided that she wanted to go on a drive with me first, just to get to know me a bit I guess which ofc Is fine and I agreed to it. After a couple more mssages after this, complete silence - nothing. Didn't even open the messages and the wednesday meet didnt go ahead obviously. I was confused, worried and quite upset tbh to why she had done this. 

I then spent the next day (Thursday) just constantly going through different reasons in my head to why she 'ghosted' me after it felt like everything was going so well.

Fast forward to today (Friday) and my friend who I explained the situation to found out that her ex boyfriend who she said was quite abusive just posted a new profile picture with her...


Fuck man.


This is the closest thing Ive ever felt to heartbreak. I felt and still feel so disrespected, broken and all over the place. 

I know it might sound silly to say I'm 'heartbroken' after only 4 days talking to her, but I honestly thought something special was happening and some real deep connection was there 😞

Anyways, as you can probably guess the saturday date isnt going ahead now and Ive wasted loads of money preparing for the date to only be fucked over by this girl going back to her abusive ex.

Ive tried messaging a couple times, yesterday and today but she still hasnt seen the messages. Fuuuuuuck man I thought we had something.

I guess theres plenty of fish in the sea tho right

55,nsfzuw,1622842075,25F stood up on first date with FB 29M,"From the beggining. Me 25F and him 29M, used to eye each other up for months (he's best friends with my ex upstairs neighbour) and had a few short conversations. Then i added him on Facebook, we talked and pretty much instantly admitted we wanted each other but I said I didn't want a relationship, just a fuck buddy. He was fine with that and we arranged to meet up, 3 days after starting to talk. He stood me up. Text me next day that he's sorry but he finished work late and fell asleep. He stopped replying around 7pm.

I still wanted to have sex with him so I invited him round to mine a few days later and he came round and it was the hottest sex I ever had. It was casual, nsa. 

He came over again and asked to cuddle me after. Then he came over again and again and we had sleepovers sometimes and we'd hang out and have a laugh and a good time. 

About a month in, he got drunk (which he does often) and started texting me mean things (mostly about my friends who i was with, who are a lesbian couple). The next morning, he apologised, said he understands if I don't want to see him again etc. 

We talked, had an argument where we both said mean things and broke up our little thing mutually. Then for 2 weeks we had a couple of texts between us and then I asked him to come round for just sex. We missed each other so much and had very loving sex.

 I asked him to come over again, for the night. We had netflix and chill and ordered Chinese. Then he came three more times, twice in the same day. 

In between that, I decided I wanted to give him a proper chance (he kept asking me for more than fuck buddies, saying he has feelings for me, wants to take me on a date, 'future wife' etc) and he picked a restaurant, I agreed and gave him my next available/childfree night.  He was visibly excited about the whole thing. Told me he's ordering a new outfit, hyping the whole thing up etc. 

Then I had a sudden unexpected free night so I invited him over for the night and we Netflix and chilled, ordered a takeaway (which there was a problem with and he got moody and maybe angry). The next morning, I was annoyed at him because he posted an aggressive sounding status on Facebook about it and I said I didn't like it. He said if I'm gonna be like that, this isn't going to last very long. I left it and we had an awkward hour until he went home because I was going to work. Then he text apologised, said he would never be aggressive like that towards me, he was just annoyed about the food.

That day everything was good in texts but the day after, through the five days leading up to our 'proper' first date, he wasn't as responsive - shorter texts, no conversation making, not responding after 6pm, no calling me pet names like he does normally, no sexy flirty texts. I asked him to come over about three times to drop something off for me and he made excuses.

Date day came and he doesn't text me in the morning. Then reads my sc at 11am and doesn't reply. So i double text, asking if I've fucked it with what I said the night before. (I was telling him some very personal mh struggles as the last message). He said no, that im a lovely girl and he feels bad for treating me like this. That he's sorry and I deserve better. Cancelled our date. Said he's having money struggles and everything is stressful in his life rn and that he's really sorry. 

Then we text more and I asked him if he doesn't want to see me anymore then, he said he didn't say that. We had a chat about something else in between but I said what do you want with me then and he said I was the one who said I don't want anything from this. I sent him a longer message about how I wanted to date and get to know someone first and that my relationships before were awful and that's why I say I don't want one. That obviously dating leads to relationship if it goes well. Said I was dissapointed about tonight and feel like a loser.  Asked if I could call him to talk later on because this is confusing.

He read it and didn't respond. I deleted my message two hours later.

And now it's 10pm, we would be having steak on our date now. And I don't know how/if I should carry on seeing him and give him another chance.

59,nsgjof,1622843629,Online dating: Are my expectations weird?,"I'm starting to try online dating, and sometimes the guys want to kiss or hold hands on the first or second date. My question is, how is that possible? They barely know me! I could be a serial killer for all they know, or we could have no chemistry, wildly different values, political beliefs, life goals, etc.

Are some people legitimately attracted to utter strangers, and if so, how does that thought process work? I feel bad asking these people I've gone on dates with what they are thinking, but I genuinely do not understand this common phenomenon and I want to know why they think the way they do.

For context, I've had two LTRs, both with guys who were my friends for a few years first. I knew them  well and had big crushes on them by the time we started dating. It took months or years for me to develop those feelings. I knew them, so I knew I liked them. I thought this was a prerequisite, but it seems like that is not the case for most people in online dating.

My expectation was that I would get to know various people over the course of a few months and eventually a friendship would develop and deepen into something more. However, people on the apps often want to immediately start a relationship, and say they already like me romantically, which seems wild.

Are these men projecting what they hope my personality is onto me until they find out? Being intimate with someone without knowing them seems like jumping off a bridge without looking and hoping there's water below.

Can people on the other side shed light on this foreign-but-seemingly-common thought process?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsgjof/online_dating_are_my_expectations_weird/
60,nsguqp,1622844491,"Attachment issues, legitimate fears and need or just making excuses?","Back in December of last year, I (35F) met a guy (31) online who rocked my world and was the perfect package. Or so I thought. He respects me. Thinks very highly of me and treats me well. He’s ambitious, has a stable job, earns well, does art work on the side, has a very enterprising spirit, has a head-full of dreams and business concepts in the works etc. Basically he has his life together. When it comes to feelings, it’s another story, which I’ll explain. 

For context, this is taking place in Germany where he lives and I currently am, but I otherwise live in the US. Between December when we met and February when we broke things off, things were going great up until the time we thought my return to the US was imminent. Our connection and the feelings we felt for each other took us by surprise, as none of us expected to catch feelings. All of a sudden, we didn’t know what to do—we liked each other a lot, but had only been dating for 2 months. Things got real when we were confronted with making a decision. I ended up staying, but will most likely go back in August due to work. Despite our decision to stop dating, we decided to remain platonic friends instead, and are still very close. We talk every day and hang out every so often. We still feel very strongly about each other and talk openly about our situation often.

It wasn’t until what we thought was going to be my impending return in February that we had a talk about how to move forward. That’s when it kind of flipped a switch on him, as he enumerated all the reasons he’s reluctant to get into a committed relationship. Prior to that, he was all in:

\-He says he’s in a self-accomplishing phase of his life 

\-He says he has fear of commitment issues

\-He questions monogamy

\-He’s had 4 serious relationships. He says the first three were bad and lasted anywhere between 1 and 2 years. His last relationship ended 4 years ago and lasted 7 years. This was a happy one. He speaks highly of his ex. He is the one who ended it and still feels bad for it and for the hurt he caused her. He says although it was a great relationship, with them living together and being together for so long, at some point monotony set in (for him). She was happy and satisfied with their relationship (he was her first everything), he on the other hand by year 6 or so, got tired of having sex with the same person and started to have a craving for other women. He said he had sexual desire, just not for her anymore, didn’t have butterflies anymore etc. He said he never cheated on her. He said he did cheat on past girlfriends, but not on his last one because he says he sincerely loved and respected her too much for that. 

Instead, he broke up with her, because he wanted his freedom and wanted to sow his wild oats. He soon ended up regretting it badly, but he had hurt her so much by ending their relationship, that she was not open to take him back. During the first two years of their break up, he dove into the deep end. He went through depression, wallowing in regrets of what he had done. He thought he wanted his freedom and sexual variety, but once free, he wasn’t been able to really enjoy his sex life. One night-stands felt wrong. Friends with benefits arrangement lacked the intimacy he was missing. It’s now been 4 years since the breakup. He says he’s doing a lot better now and has come to terms with the past, has matured and has learned from his mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Like his ex at the time they met, although I'm 36, I'm still a virgin. In and of itself he doesn't see it as a bad thing. We got physical but stopped short of going all the way. He respected my boundaries. With that said, he feels a great sense of responsibility, as he doesn't want to be that a\*&amp;hole who takes my virginity away and can't offer me commitment. 

\-He says he would have wanted to get in a committed relationship with me but he himself doesn’t know if once in a committed relationship that same craving won’t kick in, and he doesn’t want to hurt me like he hurt his ex.

\-With me being 5 years older than him (I’ll be 36 next month), he says he doesn’t want to waste 7 or however many years of my life if things don’t work out between us. 

\-He says he still has feelings for me (I still have feelings for him as well), but because he’s not ready, it wouldn’t feel right to start something when he’s not sure about himself. He says it may be a mistake that he decided against a relationship, but he has to learn to live with mistakes. 

By his own admission he is an over-thinker, an extremely measured, and a risk adverse person especially with anything involving feelings. He can handle any other hardship well, but issues of the heart devastate him. When I told him recently I wanted to for us to talk—not to get back together, but to sort things out, get closure and move on, he said he needed time to think it through. It took him a week to process the whole thing for himself. He agreed for a meet, but said it wouldn’t change the situation as he is better off being a friend to me, because as such he would not be in a position to hurt me.

69,nshx1n,1622847709,Do you think its a res flag when someone who barely knows you calls you perfect?,"35f I just had a guy message me on OLD &amp; he told me I seem perfect. While most people would take this as a compliment, I cringed &amp; saw this as a red flag. Here's why. 

In my experience, I've been told this in the past, but the reason I don't like this term bc perfection implies being flawless which we as humans are not. Every person is flawed even the most beautiful &amp; seemingly perfect person isn't. 

Also, it places a great deal of pressure on a person (for me at least) when someone thinks I'm ""perfect."" I think when men tell a woman she seems perfect, I think its bc they're automatically idealizing a woman without getting to know her. True, he used the word ""seem"" but still. He could have said, you seem awesome, wonderful, amazing, etc. but perfect is just a played out word bc again, everyone is flawed but thats not necessarily a bad thing.

And yes, sometimes a person can seem ""perfect"" for us but not perfect for someone else. But I still think this idealization comes with a bit of delusion &amp; fantasy bc more often the person who thinks someone is perfect is usually disappointed when they realize the other person is not. The other person is a human being with thoughts, feelings, strengths &amp; weaknesses.

Also, when I've told men I don't like that word &amp; how I think no one is perfect but thanks for the compliment anyway, they look at me in confusion as to why I wouldn't just eat up the compliment &amp; look at me differently after that. The pedestal they placed me on slowly becomes lower and lower but thats not to say bc I lack confidence or that I'm not good enough, it's simply that I'm not perfect but that's ok bc no one is &amp; we're all beautifully flawed &amp; ultimately I don't want someone bc he thinks I'm ""perfect"" but rather a strong, intelligent, interesting woman who has more to offer than just being boring ""perfect.""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nshx1n/do_you_think_its_a_res_flag_when_someone_who/

It took 2 weeks for 2nd date &amp; he asked a lot of serious questions &amp; said he wanted to be committed to me &amp; i said let's wait till 3rd to 5th date.  He started to text even more.

It took about 10 days for 3rd date &amp; we pretty much agreed we are both what we have been looking for (we are into flr) so we are committed.  We also agreed to see each other about twice a week or so.

1 day later discussing labeling i said he was my bf now but he said we are bf gf potential.  2 days later he says he's not ready to be in a serious relationship.  I told him we are just dating still &amp; not quite serious, it's just that being committed to me means bf gf.  He only replied he still should probably slow down.  I replied we are only dating still.  Since then no text or reply from him.  He's not much of a texter &amp; he prefers the woman to set up dates but neither he nor i like women who chase men.

We woke up the next morning and went back to work all week. She was very warm and cozy the entire night with me, being intimate. The next night, we had a few drinks again and I gave her a hug goodbye after she said she was leaving and we started kissing briefly, until she said I’m still not staying the night and then she left. After this, I made a few more attempts to ask her out or to hang out and she was flat out cold, acted as if nothing had happened and there was no connection. I should not have had expectations, and I know she owed me nothing, but I felt really hurt, briefly, felt used and low self worth. I was a gentlemen and kept it professional at work, but texted her saying I want to cuddle. She said “naw dude that’s not really my thing.” Then next day I ended up asking her if it was a one time thing and she said most likely it was, yes. But then she continued texting me about work related stuff this week almost every day, as if she was making an excuse to talk because she continued carrying on the conversations. So I took a risk and (for the first time) explicitly told her my intentions over text. Received a stern do not tell me that again in person or over text.

I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didn't matter and she wouldn't judge. So I stood in front of the mirror, pulled my pants and underwear down, and took one. I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible. I sent it and nervously waited for a reply. I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic. It was of her with 3 other women, each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the ""small peen"" hand sign!

84,nsjkmr,1622853122,"I broke my own dating rules and, surprise! Got a little burned","So I (M37) met a woman (28) on a social networking site through some friends. We connected and talked every day for a couple weeks. I felt a really strong connection with her so much that I threw caution into the wind and 1) dated her even though she is currently separated going through a divorce and 2) had sex on the first date.

Out of past experience, I generally don't do these things, but in this case I did. Things were going great, but as these things go, I told her that I was looking for something serious and monogamous. She told me she is usually the same but is hesitant to get into something serious right now. She was honest in saying she is talking to one or two other men but hasn't met any of them (one is long distance anyway). I've had flings, and this felt more emotional than a fling. 

Last week she got really silent for a couple days. No texts, very little on social media. I asked her if I could call, she said she was ""randomly crying"" and didn't feel like talking. Asked her if the divorce was on her kind she replied ""A lot of things are on my mind"". This went on for a few days and she started posting flirty pictures on IG but was still quiet. Feeling miserable I told her I know she is going through a rough patch, and we aren't looking for the same things. Also said I felt she was having second thoughts about us dating. She agreed and apologized even though she didn't need to.

So things ended amicably, but it's still hard. Online she looks like everything is great but I know inside her life is a mess. That's what confuses me. Maybe she is just escaping a controlling marriage and is feeling her freedom while trying to make sense of things? I feel like the only good thing here is that I recognized her inability to express her feelings and I took the step of telling her how I felt. In the past I would just let things drag on and try to coax her to talk to me, allowing myself to feel hurt. 

Did I handle this correctly? I'll take the criticism for allowing myself to be in this position in the first place.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsjkmr/i_broke_my_own_dating_rules_and_surprise_got_a/
85,nsjkqd,1622853132,Wrote this to the person who led me on,"I have romantic feelings for you but I know that I can’t change the way you feel. And it seems like you really like this girl. Right now I still feel really hurt and heartbroken over this situation, so I think it’s best for me to step away. After hearing your story of how a similar situation happened to you when you got on your medication for the first time, it makes me think that the probability of you two dating seems very likely. I don’t want to be around when that happens because I will not be emotionally prepared.

I carefully thought about what you said about our friendship and how the positives outweigh the negatives. But that wasn’t the case for me. There were too many times where I felt confused about where I stood in your life and always questioned why I was putting so much effort into someone who isn’t reciprocating the same energy back. I understand that this is your personality, but this is not the type of friendship or relationship I want to be in. 

When I think of someone who is my best friend I think of someone who knows me better than myself, who has my best interest at heart, and someone who I can trust with anything and everything. Someone who I can rely on and pick up where we left off even when we go periods without talking. But I didn’t feel that with you. 

You were a good friend to me in the beginning when I needed a shoulder to cry on. But things eventually changed and I found myself crying over you instead. I miss the (name) I was friends with when we just met. The (name) who would put in the effort and showed that he actually cared.

While you didn’t intend to lead me on, that’s what happened. You knew how I felt about you and you probably knew that you could never return those feelings back. Still, you wanted to keep me around as a friend despite being exclusive with someone else. I enjoyed spending time with you and was okay with doing whatever we did since I was under the impression you weren’t talking to someone else. I was aware you didn’t want a girlfriend. I felt trapped because I was hoping you would come around anyways.

I wish I could be happy with being your friend. When I said I wanted to be friends who make each other happy for a long time, I really meant it. You know that I think it’s stupid to say we can’t be friends now but maybe possibly in the future, but that is the case right now. Things are different because feelings got involved. If I continue to stay in your life and see you date other people, I will always ask myself why I wasn’t enough for you and be miserable.

My anxiety was at its worst with this whole situation and I had my first panic attack because of it. I think it’s best to cut off all contact completely. I will leave my phone number available to you in case you need someone to talk to or if you’re seeking comfort. I know you won’t need it though because you already have a great support system. 

I always knew this is what I had to do but I didn’t want to accept this reality. I will always cherish whatever we had. If we are really good or best friends like you said, maybe we will find our way back to each other.

Hi guys, I (22M) have been seeing this pretty cool girl(23F)I met off of tinder, and we’ve been on three dates so far, all of which seemed to go really well. We went to a zoo, a botanical garden, went kayaking, and then watched a movie at my house. Nothing escalated between us, mainly because i’m very shy and awkward and I haven’t found a way to breach the topic. Anyways, today was a week from our third date, and I asked her out again for the fourth early in the week, around Monday and she said this weekend she’d go to a festival with her friend, but she’d see if she could figure out a day for us to go with her schedule. She got back to me and we decided today, Friday. Earlier today she texted me and she apologized and said she got really sick and would have to cancel, I said that wasn’t an issue and wished for her to feel better. I told my friends about this and they told me that was her politely letting me know she’s no longer interested because I failed to make a move on her the previous times we spent time with one another. My one friend who found his girlfriend through online dating suggested i check her profile on tinder out, because if she switched it up she probably wants to attract more confident guys or something like that. I checked and she added more photos and basically revamped her profile and put her instagram in her bio and said to dm her. I don’t have an instagram account or any social media and we spoke about that on our second date while we walked around this city getting boba tea. We had long quality conversations on all of the dates, or at least it seemed to me. Are my friends right that she lost interest because i’m too awkward and haven’t tried to make a move on her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsl5eb/is_this_girl_letting_me_down_politely/

97,nsls9w,1622860738,How can I get over this girl?,"
Okay so about 2 months ago. I went on a first date with a girl that I matched with. We had spoken a few times via text and Snapchat for a few weeks prior to the initial date. She seemed a little inconsistent and hot and cold but I thought I’d ask her out anyway. When I eventually asked her out she seemed very enthusiastic. When we got on the date she made sure she looked her best. (Hair, nails done, lashes. Etc) which I found quite flattering because i think she’s done this the day of our date to make sure she looks good for me. But anyway she seemed to have very high interest initially. The date went well. We had dinner and some drinks and she ended up staying over at my place and we had sex. The sex was mediocre because I was fairly drunk at that point and a little off my game. Neither of us finished but at that point we were tired so we just went to sleep and she still cuddled up to me afterward. The next morning she seemed a little more distant. I went in for a kiss the next morning (stupid I know) and she seemed a little hesitant. I drove her home and then didn’t contact her for about 3 days. Eventually I initiated contact saying I had a good time with her and I would like to see her again sometime. He replies seemed to be a lot slower then they were before. But she still came off somewhat friendly and as though she hadn’t totally lost interest. I was careful not to over pursue this girl and at this point forward I started only really reaching out to her to plan dates. So the following week I tried to make plans with her but she was busy. Then I tried again the week after and she said something like. “I might be able to after I do this I’ll let you know” so at this point I figured it’s probably over. I gave up. Went no contact and stopped trying to plan dates with her. About 3 weeks of no contact at all goes by and she reaches out to me for the first time ever. And she asks me what I’m doing for the weekend. This got me excited. Because I figured me pulling back had obviously sparked her interest. We ended up going on a date that weekend and the texts leading up to that date she seemed like she was interested in me again. But then when the date came around she was late. (Although her excuse seemed pretty legit) and after we had a few drinks she started talking on the phone and texting a lot. Possibly even to other guys. This pissed me off but I tried to remain calm and not really react. Why would she ask me out on a date (when I was clearly prepared to move on) and then behave in this way when we are on the date? I also noticed she barely ever looked me in the eye. She did this a little bit on the first date but I figured it was due to nerves. But this time it was even less eye contact. She didn’t stay over this time as we both had plans the next day. And I didn’t get any action this time around aside from some kissing at the end. Since this date she has apologised via text because she felt like she got too drunk. We’ve had a couple small conversations back and fourth but I’m not sure what I should do going forward. I really don’t know if she’s interested in me or not. She’s talking to other guys I know that. And I get the feeling I’m not at the top of the list or even if I’m on the list at all anymore. I’m always trying to pursue other girls and keep my options open. But I’m more attracted to this girl than any girl I’ve been with in the last 3-4 years. Any advice on what I should do in this situation would be much appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsls9w/how_can_i_get_over_this_girl/
98,nslwud,1622861188,Dating seems hard.,"I’ve had a good few relationships, and most of them were ended on positive notes with us remaining friends. Ever since my last break up (this one did NOT end well) I can’t really think of dating anymore.  I feel a disconnect on who I am whenever I even try. I want the intimate closeness that comes with being in a relationship, but I don’t want to lose myself as a person?   

It’s entirely my issue, I have expectations of dating and I have fears I’ve yet to conquer no matter how hard I try.  I don’t NEED to date, I genuinely don’t mind being single and never felt like I was incomplete, i just wonder sometimes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nslwud/dating_seems_hard/
99,nslxaz,1622861235,Should I respond to him?,"I just got out of a relationship a couple months ago. I’ve done a lot for myself and I recently started dating again. I went on a dating app where I matched with a really attractive guy that I had seen on campus before and I was excited when he messaged me and we agreed to get some food later that week. 


I had heard some rumors about him from friends about some of his history and I was a bit taken back but wanted to go on a first date with someone I was really attracted to after my breakup. I was looking to test the waters and see how I felt. 

Prior to the date, I bought a really nice dress and I was really excited but last minute he ended up canceling because he was too drunk to drive and “didn’t want to meet me for the first time drunk” I was really upset because I was all ready and I was basically stood up. (He was a senior in college so he was celebrating with his frat and that’s why he was drunk ) I cried that whole afternoon because I felt so defeated that my first attempt to date after my abusive relationship ended had gone so horribly. 


The next day he messaged me and apologized and asked when I was free again. I debated responding but I caved and gave him another chance. Since then we’ve been talking but not seriously more so casual. I definitely am playing it cool and I don’t appear as interested anymore. 

Last night, he posted a video of him out at a baseball game and he recorded the shoes of a girl that he was with. I immediately was turned off and was a bit upset but I wasn’t sure if it was his sister or a friend but I assumed  it was a girl he was talking to. This morning, I woke up to a text from him asking when I was free for a date. I was confused and I have yet to respond. 

He seems like a genuine guy. He’s very smart and funny and nice but I also heard that he cheated on his last girlfriend and he’s also leaving the state in a couple months for grad school whereas I still have a year left to finish my undergrad. 

I want to meet him but I don’t know if it’s worth it. The last thing I want is to get hurt again. Should I even bother?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nslxaz/should_i_respond_to_him/
