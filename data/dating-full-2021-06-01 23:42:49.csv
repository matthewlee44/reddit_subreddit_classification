I don't think I'm a creepy guy tbh.  To my knowledge, a creepy guy is just an unattractive, yet confident guy.  If an attractive guy was unconfident, he would just be considered ""shy"" or ""awkward"", however, if an unattractive guy (I guess me in this case), is either confident or unconfident, he is labeled as a creep.    


What baffles me is I am fully aware of what ""creepy"" behavior is and how to avoid it.  Here are some examples of what most women find ""creepy""; sitting at a table by yourself, excessive smiling, no smiling, blank facial expressions (they don't care if you're ASD or not), not complying when she says stop, no, etc.  

I wasn't doing any of these behaviors.  All I did was approach every girl 3 chairs apart at the bar and ask if she was interested.  This has been my strategy for a few months now since it saves me a lot of money and time from being wasted.  I simply walk up to a girl that I am interested in, and ask if the feelings mutual.  But apparently the fact that my strategy was so simple and cost effective, it triggered somebody.

This has left me traumatized, not feeling enough and being hopeless. 

Here's a brief explanation of those experiences.

First relationship was a guy double timing me. Second one left me for a blonde blue eyed girl (I have dark Mediterranean characteristics). I dyed my hair and occasionally wore lenses cause I felt ugly, I was also bullied and I wished I had different features.

The next one lasted the longest (1 and a half year),  he treated me like crap even though we were kind of compatible. He was obese and his life wasn't at a good point and I was his emotional punching bag until he got bored cause I didn't give him intimacy. Then I was with a guy who later found out he was a pedo, sadly it was my first time with him and he was very crappy.  A few months after that, I had my first one night stand with a guy who fooled me and gave me fake promises to get intimate. He tried to make me compete with other women in his life, he eventually found a very pretty girl to settle with and can't stop rubbing to everyone's face that they are a perfect couple. I got hurt and started sleeping with dozens of guys, one worse than the other. All of them negged me, stringed me along. I couldn't even find a consistent guy to do FWB with. I eventually did but shortly after I got into a relationship. I told FWB that I am in a serious committed relationship so we should cease our thing and he told me to cheat instead, like wtf. 

Meanwhile the serious relationship was as crappy as it could get. A really selfish guy who only wanted intimacy, he got enjoyment out humiliating me and embarrassing me, he was very jealous of me going on family vacation or posting a picture with anything that didn't cover my shoulders (!) In the summer. Fully controlling, shouted at me. Wanted to please him in  every way. He almost beat me and he would push me a lot. A stranger called the police on him after seeing him treating me  badly. 

I also got violated in my early teens, too awful to get into detail.

After 2 months of talking, we kinda stopped talking after I came out to her about how i felt she blew me off since we met and she said we are “really good friends”  and that’s why we didn’t do much together. After that I found she was in a sexual relationship with someone else. After THAT, we really didn’t talk till a month later when the dude humped and dumped her. I helped her through this time and we started dating through this. 

After talking about what happened, turns out she didn’t think I would like her due to her size (she’s a bit thicker than I am). She told me she went out with other men to develop her confidence. Basically saying she didn’t feel comfortable going on a date due me apparently being “out of her league”     With the other guy she had the relationship with, she says she was forced into it but can’t say much because she consented. She only stuck with him for the month because he too her virginity and wanted to fix the situation.

I needed a win because dating during my chemo was out of the question. 

1st time we tried to meet up she cancelled. She is a nurse and was having unexplainable shakes. She has health problems with work. So I told her to take care of herself first. Let me know if there is anything I can do.

2nd time she actually does come over. She is slow to get out of her car. Not sure if she is tired or felt obligated to see me b/c I survived cancer &amp; she was being nice. We hop in my car, get food, I pay, walk on the beach then go back to my place to play Nintendo Switch. 

She wants to nap and asked me to close the blinds. Okay....sounds suggestive. 

I start chatting and testing her out with some touch. She then lets it out that she is seeing someone. 

Dating? No. Just hooked up with some guy.

So I stopped escalating then she said she felt bad....

What am I a charity case now? 

I guess I was so thirsty I didn't kick her out. But she has also been a friend during my cancer process &amp; we had phone sex twice before that process. 

I move from the floor onto my bed. She follows without being invited. 

Okay.... 

She wants to watch a movie. We put it on. She then gets a pillow on me. I put my arm around her. Movie is over. I start to kiss her. Then she starts to cry a bit because she has never been with two guys at once....

Okay....I should've stopped to preserve my own dignity, but ya boi's thirsty. Y'all may not have a clue what its like to be in the hospital for a total of (3) months during COVID during the winter fighting for your life and losing all your hair. The lonliness of not being able to see visitors during COVID and not getting a vaccine until 15 days before my official remission was tough. 

We start making out. We get hot/heavy. She does not want my hands to water below the belt so they don't. I actually get off unbeknowst to her &amp; just stop. I guess it looked like I was considering how she felt. I was. But mostly I lost my desire. 

So we stopped. 

Walked her out, she kept hugging and kissing me, and texted to see if she made it home well. 

I remember back in the old days I would follow Pick Up Artist information. Depending on the situation they would tell you to ""plow through."" But to me this just felt pitiful. I felt like a clear option. 

I know she wants a long term relationship, but also know she is very sexual (when we used to hook up in college and the phone sex last summer).

**What would you have done?**

A Pick Up Artist answer would've been that she is lying about the other guy. Or that they aren't dating exclusively so its fair game. However, I know her. I did not think she was lying to me. She is looking for something long term. It made me feel like I wasn't good enough for that position in her life. 

I know....Hard for you to say b/c my illness is something not everyone can relate to. Losing 45lbs of muscle in a year is akin to being a Prisoner of War. You can relate to the isolation of COVID, but not of COVID &amp; the hospital &amp; a debilitating illnesss (at least I hope you've never had any major health issues). 

However, we all have may have been someone else's option at one point. Maybe you have been the losing one in the competition to another person your prospective lover is hooking up with.

A couple months ago, near the end of my university's school year, I (19M) met this amazing girl (19F) after initiating a conversation with her that lasted over an hour.  Eventually, she asked for my number, and I was shocked as this was the first time a girl has done this to me.

For context, I've had one relationship in the past, but it was full of insecurity on my side.  I learned a lot about self-confidence/focusing on my goals first from it, and have been practicing these things since the end of that relationship.

After giving her my number, we scheduled our first date to dinner and it was great to chat with her again, especially to see her face without a mask on lol.  Definitely haven't met another girl like her.

A couple days later, the weather was amazing, so I asked if she wanted to go on a walk around campus, and she accepted.  After the walk, we sat down and continued to talk, and all I could think about was how a girl as smart, ambitious, beautiful, and thoughtful like her could even exist.  Felt like I was living a fairytale; we talked for way too long, there was just so much in common.  When the conversation slowed, I gathered up the courage to lean in and kiss her cheek, my first (cheek) kiss!!   
 Then I walked her back to her dorm as we held hands.  She said she had a great time, thanked me, told me to let her know when I got back to my dorm (as it was night by this time), and we said our goodbyes.  Once again, I was going crazy, in disbelief at how well the second date went.

&amp;#x200B;

We saw each other a few days later, at a class we shared and I didn't even realize it until I met her.  Following the class, she pulled me aside. She told me she really liked me and wanted more time to heal after a 2-year relationship that ended just a month earlier.  All I know about this previous relationship is that her boyfriend criticized her weight, so my best guess is the relationship was a little abusive.

So thanks to what I learned from my previous relationship, I listened and told her to let me know when she felt better again.  She restated how much she liked me, how she'd never come across someone like me before.  Pretty much everything she said about me, I could also say about her.  She said that she wants to give me her full attention, and getting over the breakup will help her do that.  I told her how I loved her honesty and thanked her for letting me know.  She added how she still wanted to get to know me, maybe get ice cream with her friends or something.

I saw her here and there before school ended, but with finals and projects, I thought it best to put school first and not risk bad grades on a girl I met just a week and a half ago.  We continued to text but didn't get together or go on another date.  Summer break arrived.

Fast forward to now, and we've been texting back and forth.  I'm reading too much into this, but she hasn't been responding as quickly as she did before.  She said she's been busy with family stuff, and then brought up the idea of FaceTime.  I asked her when she's free to FaceTime, and she has yet to reply.  So I figured I should give her some space.  We haven't communicated in nearly 3 weeks.  Not sure if she misses me, but I sure do miss her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR** = met a wonderful girl at university, went on a couple amazing dates.  Girl said she wants time to heal after recently leaving a 2-year relationship but told me how much she likes me and not to take it as her dumping me.  Been texting since summer break started, but communication stopped 3 weeks ago.

So does this girl actually like me, or is she trying to dump me in a nice way?  I want to make sure I emphasize loving myself first, and not to get involved with a girl who is not interested.  I think she's made it abundantly clear how much she likes me, but her radio silence is playing into my insecurities and making me second guess myself.

At least some guys in my situation are at the very least fit, successful in their career and have a good social life. I don’t have any of that. Hell I still live with my parents and am extremely far away from being able to start a high paying career with all the school I’d have to do.

And of course, there’s no guarantees. And that’s not mentioning the things about myself I can’t change. 



Hell, my inexperience alone would be a turnoff if I did get somewhere with a woman, which results in a never ending cycle: can’t get with women because you’re inexperienced, but you can’t gain experience because of this reason.  


I often wish I could destroy the parts of my brain that make me crave love, friendship, and sex. I wish I could be an asexual, aromantic schizoid.

Then I can be happy being alone for the rest of my life instead of suffering from loneliness.

At least this might not be so bad if I at least have friends (I don’t and have never had really close friends in my entire life), but I would imagine it would be tough if I was the constantly the only single guy in a social group.

I went on a first date with a girl that I matched with. We had spoken a few times via text and Snapchat for a few weeks prior to the initial date. She seemed a little inconsistent and hot and cold but I thought I’d ask her out anyway. When I eventually asked her out she seemed very enthusiastic. When we got on the date she made sure she looked her best. (Hair, nails done, lashes. Etc) which I found quite flattering because i think she’s done this the day of our date to make sure she looks good for me. But anyway she seemed to have very high interest initially. The date went well. We had dinner and some drinks and she ended up staying over at my place and we had sex. The sex was mediocre because I was fairly drunk at that point and a little off my game. Neither of us finished but at that point we were tired so we just went to sleep and she still cuddled up to me afterward. The next morning she seemed a little more distant. I went in for a kiss the next morning (stupid I know) and she seemed a little hesitant. I drove her home and then didn’t contact her for about 3 days. Eventually I initiated contact saying I had a good time with her and I would like to see her again sometime. He replies seemed to be a lot slower then they were before. But she still came off somewhat friendly and as though she hadn’t totally lost interest. I was careful not to over pursue this girl and at this point forward I started only really reaching out to her to plan dates. So the following week I tried to make plans with her but she was busy. Then I tried again the week after and she said something like. “I might be able to after I do this I’ll let you know” so at this point I figured it’s probably over. I gave up. Went no contact and stopped trying to plan dates with her. About 3 weeks of no contact at all goes by and she reaches out to me for the first time ever. And she asks me what I’m doing for the weekend. This got me excited. Because I figured me pulling back had obviously sparked her interest. We ended up going on a date that weekend and the texts leading up to that date she seemed like she was interested in me again. But then when the date came around she was late. (Although her excuse seemed pretty legit) and after we had a few drinks she started talking on the phone and texting a lot. Possibly even to other guys. This pissed me off but I tried to remain calm and not really react. I also noticed she barely ever looked me in the eye. She did this a little bit on the first date but I figured it was due to nerves. But this time it was even less eye contact. She didn’t stay over this time as we both had plans the next day. And I didn’t get any action this time around aside from some kissing at the end. Since this date she has apologised via text because she felt like she got too drunk. We’ve had a couple small conversations back and fourth but I’m not sure what I should do going forward. I really don’t know if she’s interested in me or not. She’s talking to other guys I know that. And I get the feeling I’m not at the top of the list or even if I’m on the list at all anymore. I’m always trying to pursue other girls and keep my options open.

So basically here's my situation. I've been dating my girlfriend for around half a year now and everything has been super great and we're both high school seniors. She and I love each other a lot and every minute of time that we spend together is just straight awesome. This is my first relationship ever so I don't really know anything about breakups or exes work yet because I haven't had to worry about it yet. I don't know how long we will stay together but I can't imagine letting her go anytime soon. But anyways, I only have two weekends left with her because I'm leaving for college across the nation and I won't be able to use my phone to even text and call her for at least 2 months. I just don't know what to do because I feel like we still have so much left to do in so little time.

We're going to try to keep a long distance relationship, but speaking realistically, she is really attractive and a lot of guys already hit her up so I don't know if she would want to stay with someone who can't even talk to her for at least two months. So, I've never said goodbye to someone that I'm in a relationship with before, and knowing how long-distance relationships work out, this might be my last ever chance to spend any time with her as my girlfriend. Once I come back, I'm afraid that she might not like me anymore because we've grown and changed too much. What should I do for these last few weeks of time left? How to I make that last goodbye before I leave? How do I handle the fact that she might move on from me while I'm gone? Please help I'm like going through a mini crisis right now.

Sorry for long post 

There's this one person in my college classes [29F] who I [23M] would talk too occasionally and we had to work on some projects together. She seems like a great person and I enjoy talking to her in class but outside of that the only communication we would have would be about school via text. About a week and a half ago though she text and invited me to one of her friends birthday parties and then mentioned we should watch a playoff game together sometime. I couldn't make it to her friends party, but we set up a time to watch a game together. 

We met up and went to a brewery to watch a game then went back to her house to watch another and had dinner over there with her brother. It was a ton of fun but I honestly had no idea whether it was supposed to be a date or just hanging out because she initiated it. During the evening there were times when it felt like it could have been either and it left me confused. Since it was a lot of fun getting to know her, I asked her if she wanted to go hiking and we set a day for it. I love hiking and she mentioned she wanted to start going more so thought it would be a good idea. 

We ended up going hiking and everything went really well. Weather was perfect, trail was perfect, wildlife showed up which was amazing, and just in general had a really great time. However, at least for me, the vibe felt the same as the first time. Couldn't tell if she thought it was a date or a hangout and to be honest I wasn't sure either. It would seem to be going one way then go in the other direction. Ended up being like a 12 hour ordeal with driving included.

 At the end of the day when I was dropping her off I decided to ask what she was looking for cause I was super confused and thought it would be better to just know and then go from there. I basically asked if she was looking for a relationship or something else (not specifically with me) because I wanted to have a clearer path forward. I think it would be cool to try and start a relationship with her cause she seems like a great person, but I would be totally okay with being friends as well. Well cause I'm an idiot and have minimal experience when it comes to these things, I worded it poorly and had to explain my question again and stumbled a bit while talking. She looked caught off guard and basically said she ended a big relationship a year ago and was not sure what she was looking for and then immediately got out of my car. We did day goodbye but that was it. Texted her when I got home saying it was fun and she responded back saying the same. Later in the night she text me sorry for being awkward when I asked that and said it was nice that I wasn't afraid to ask but she never answered my question. Saw her the next day at school and everything seemed as it was before. 

So onto my question, what in the world do I do now? I still have zero idea if she is just looking to be friends or if she is looking for a relationship. Do I just ask her on a date and see how she responds? I don't want to make it awkward again but I just don't know how to approach this. If she just wants to be friends that's great and I would be happy to have a new hiking buddy, but if she is looking for a relationship then of course I would do more then just invite her on hikes.

We hadn’t seen each other in two years and I was nervous. I had a glass and a half of wine before he arrived. Once he got there he wanted to drink too. We got to talking and drinking right away. He didn’t ask many questions, so I sort of kept going on tangents in between asking him questions. 

We walked around town for a bit. Apparently, I was talking about COVID for too long and he told me to stop. After that we went to the bar and I basically browned out shortly after. 
Apparently,I kept mentioning the same things, typical brown out. We went to the beach and had a bonfire. Went back to mine and had sex. He told me he didn’t want to have any more sex for the weekend, didn’t say why.

I woke up feeling really embarrassed. I could have said so many dumb things. He eluded to the fact that I had definitely been repeating myself. We went out around town again and had some lunch. Talked about some things. None of it was very fun or flirtatious. I felt like he was annoyed, although he was being really nice and polite the whole time.

We went back to the house and had more sex, during which he told me the position I was in (same one from last night) wasn’t really doing it for him. I feel bad that we ended up hooking up again at all.

I am so mortified with how it went. If I hadn’t been drunk we could’ve really hit it off again. I feel like I royally fucked it up. At the end of the date he said he’d like to hang out again, since I’m moving about an hour away, although I don’t believe him.

Would a text explaining my embarrassment help at all? Something like, “Thanks again for coming down here! It was good to see you. We’ll have to do it again sometime if I end up around —- soon.

On that note, I know we already talked about it but Im embarrassed for getting too tipsy. I just want to say sorry, because I’m usually a better listener and less discombobulated. Hope you understand.”

Hi everyone - I never thought I would come to Reddit for some ""Relationship/Dating Advice"" but here I am after reverse-engineering my life and having this weird anxiety pop-up in ways that I never had before.

I am going to be as honest and candid as possible just so everyone can get an idea as to what cards I have been dealt with and what tools I am working with.

I am 6'0 - 6'1 and I have a model-like body both in proportion and in physical build, albeit -- more on the athletic/lean side from being active all my life. Furthermore, I have always been complimented by both men and women across all ages that I am good looking and handsome. Once again -- please do not misunderstand by what I am saying here. I am just trying to paint a picture here and IRL I would never admit nor bring any attention to what I adamantly know that I have been blessed with.

I would also note that with what I alluded to above including the manner in which I conduct myself in public alongside the hobbies and interests that I have -- I have always been the one who had no trouble getting interests from girls. The problem is -- I have trouble finding a girl that **I AM** interested in. I must admit -- I know my **""Dating Market Value""** and I would argue that I have things outside my **""Physical Features""** that are as equally valuable, if not more.

To me -- I have always had a tough time with this. I impose a high-standard and expect a girl that has an equal ""**Dating Market Value""** to which only a small % of the broader population has and given that low statistic -- I have trouble finding a girl that **I AM** interested in. That begs the question -- do I settle or do I keep investing time back to myself **\[i.e. Professional Success\]** to penetrate a higher tier dating pool and hoping that at some point I meet **that one**?

To members in this sub-reddit who can understand where I am coming from and have walked this path -- was it a **""putting yourself out there""** type of issue? perhaps **networking**? is there no such thing as a relationship where two partners are equal in **""Dating Market Value""**?

Last thing I want to do is ""settle"" -- I do not think it is either fair to both parties IMO.

I understand that I am 22 -- and as I alluded to in paragraph 3 -- I am just trying achieve the best relationship given the cards that I feel so blessed to be equipped with.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,810625,public,self,Need Some Genuine Advice [22M],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqeqeh/need_some_genuine_advice_22m/,all_ads,6,,,

I didn’t take him seriously first because he was phrasing it quite jokingly but I kept pushing to ask if he was serious and he gave an answer like “if you’re down then sure”. The first week after this, we spoke everyday over message and he was being too intense for my liking. Every time he would say something about spending our life together I’d just ignore that part of the message and keeps he conversation going. I mention I need time but I never mentioned whether I was actually interested. He got the hint that he was being too forward after we went a whole weekend not speaking.

Now, he’s a lot more chilled and we still talk everyday. He still hints majorly that he wants to be with me and I can say that I’ve started to catch feelings. However, this might just be because of exams, but whenever I flirt with him he says something ridiculous like “sorry I have a wife”. Like he’s scared of rejection or misinterpreting. Last night we phoned for hours and every time I’d dig into him about who he likes he would say we can speak about it when finals are over. Just before we got off the phone, we had a bit of an intense flirting sesh where he asked if I want to be his *insert any female half of a TV couple* and I was like hmm perhaps and I ended the call for effect. An hour later I messaged him saying I’ll b his *other half* and he messaged back “I’m gay sorry” . Why is he being difficult when I actually like him back??

Okay so about 2 months ago. I went on a first date with a girl that I matched with. We had spoken a few times via text and Snapchat for a few weeks prior to the initial date. She seemed a little inconsistent and hot and cold but I thought I’d ask her out anyway. When I eventually asked her out she seemed very enthusiastic. When we got on the date she made sure she looked her best. (Hair, nails done, lashes. Etc) which I found quite flattering because i think she’s done this the day of our date to make sure she looks good for me. But anyway she seemed to have very high interest initially. The date went well. We had dinner and some drinks and she ended up staying over at my place and we had sex. The sex was mediocre because I was fairly drunk at that point and a little off my game. Neither of us finished but at that point we were tired so we just went to sleep and she still cuddled up to me afterward. The next morning she seemed a little more distant. I went in for a kiss the next morning (stupid I know) and she seemed a little hesitant. I drove her home and then didn’t contact her for about 3 days. Eventually I initiated contact saying I had a good time with her and I would like to see her again sometime. He replies seemed to be a lot slower then they were before. But she still came off somewhat friendly and as though she hadn’t totally lost interest. I was careful not to over pursue this girl and at this point forward I started only really reaching out to her to plan dates. So the following week I tried to make plans with her but she was busy. Then I tried again the week after and she said something like. “I might be able to after I do this I’ll let you know” so at this point I figured it’s probably over. I gave up. Went no contact and stopped trying to plan dates with her. About 3 weeks of no contact at all goes by and she reaches out to me for the first time ever. And she asks me what I’m doing for the weekend. This got me excited. Because I figured me pulling back had obviously sparked her interest. We ended up going on a date that weekend and the texts leading up to that date she seemed like she was interested in me again. But then when the date came around she was late. (Although her excuse seemed pretty legit) and after we had a few drinks she started talking on the phone and texting a lot. Possibly even to other guys. This pissed me off but I tried to remain calm and not really react. Why would she ask me out on a date (when I was clearly prepared to move on) and then behave in this way when we are on the date? I also noticed she barely ever looked me in the eye. She did this a little bit on the first date but I figured it was due to nerves. But this time it was even less eye contact. She didn’t stay over this time as we both had plans the next day. And I didn’t get any action this time around aside from some kissing at the end. Since this date she has apologised via text because she felt like she got too drunk. We’ve had a couple small conversations back and fourth but I’m not sure what I should do going forward. I really don’t know if she’s interested in me or not. She’s talking to other guys I know that. And I get the feeling I’m not at the top of the list or even if I’m on the list at all anymore. I’m always trying to pursue other girls and keep my options open. But I’m more attracted to this girl than any girl I’ve been with in the last 3-4 years.

I seek advice on how to forget her or kind of a Hail Mary/ turn around thing to get together with this girl- stupid again I know. But the heart wants what it wants.
Little backstory about me: rather shy guy bit more the quiet confident type. I feel confident in the things I really exceed in. Look wise, I am often told that I‘m very good looking and charming. 
More the relationship ,,one girl“kinda guy. Had a 5 year relationship and 2 shorter ones(1and 2 years). Don’t like sleeping around and am generally speaking old fashioned.
So...
We met online around October of last year(we live in the same city). We share the same interests, she seemed really interested and had the hots for me( she said my voice could make her orgasm over the phone/ I don’t believe it but whatever), sometimes had real nice sexy chats and I am crazy about her. stunning woman. 
We chatted a little I politely asked her out over the phone(call). She declined. I took it easy. But she still kind of gave me signs that she somewhat wanted me but never agreed to go out. Turned out she was living with her ex and it would weird to let him now she wants to date me if he’s still living there. There is no sexual attraction between them . according to her the spark has died a long time ago, but they are still really good friends and due to covid he had to stay in their flat because he had a problem with his job. Well Turks- out he still has something with his ex and they Kind of fight because he was lying to her or something. Well fuck me.. I didn’t want to get involved in this. Tried to not get attached to her cause I really liked her and she seemed to like me to. I took it easy. Didn’t contact her too much, kept slight distance as to not seem to needy and she kind of got distant herself too. At some point it felt like she ignored me and she did from time to time didn’t answer my texts or leave them on read. I probably did something wrong a long the way. I’m not sure yet. Well, day come and I told her, Listen, I like you, and I would love to take you out, but I don’t see it happen when you are still somewhat attached to your ex. So if you are single again, , I’d love to take you out. (this was my 20th attempt or so to get her on a date- stupid AGAIN- I know. What can I say, hopeless romantic).
Well this was 4 months ago. I still think about her every fucking day. Absolutely frustrating. I am a busy guy,focused on carreer, have my business, study for exams, workout, play the guitar, paint, read a lot and she still crosses my mind every day. 
It is probably the thought of what could have been.. cause everything felt so right.
Yeah I know time heals everything, sleep with a New hotter girl(quiet hard, she’s close to perfection looks wise at least to me and she said I was perfect to her)
I am still confused. Seeking help and advice. Anyone experienced something similar ? How did it turn out ? Please post failures and also success stories( where you got the girl in the end) (I know that subconsciously this kind of screams of desperation to get back together with this girl) but I, as many are, am  a enslaved to emotions. Everyone is somewhat. You can pretend you are cold as ice.. but you very well know you ain’t. It’s just human, I guess.

We got along great and quickly moved to Instagram where we talked for hours daily for almost two weeks. Out of nowhere she ghosted me and then came back over a week after that saying she’d been busy and had a family emergency so she was spending a ton of time with the fam. 

We had planned to meet up before this sometime and I asked her if she was still interested and she said she was but for the last two weeks I haven’t been able to get her to commit to meeting even though she says she wants to. The first two weeks since we started talking again she was busy studying all day for her finals as a senior in college so I understood. But she finished her finals and we could have met this last weekend but she said she just needed time to relax. 

So ok fine. I let her know when I’m off and that I was free the last couple days but she said she was going to be in a neighboring city but is down to meet up when she gets back and that she would let me know. On top of all this, ever since we started talking again the conversation dried up significantly IMO and isn’t at all like it was the first few weeks. So she said she’d let me know when she’s free, which is presumably this upcoming weekend but at this point I’m just not feeling like it’s ever going to happen.

We work at a supermarket. He's super friendly towards me. However, he is really nice when speaking to everyone, so that is his general personality. We're never flirty towards each other, just friendly and we often have casual conversations whenever were nearby. Even a few months ago he bought me a 3 pack of fabric face masks worth $20 (he said he had plenty of packets laying at home) and when I offered him the cash he wouldn't take it. We once spoke about this particular brand of alcohol and as my birthday was upcoming, he said he was going to get one for me (however he didn't end up getting it for me, for whatever reason). He sometimes texts me about work-related things, and I try to seem keen in my reply and don't dry text him back, but he doesn't usually keep the conversation going (with the very odd exception). Then, just today, I was next to him at one point behind the counter and one of the managers said to us ""I think you two should date"". I was smiling and blushing of course, and his response to her was ""you're going to make me blush, she's too pretty for me"". Then afterwards when she left, we had a short casual conversation but with no mention of what just happened. Would you guys say that's a bad sign? Because I feel like if he was interested he would've used that as an excuse to ask me out, instead he doesn't make reference to it. I've really liked him for so long and I don't know how I will be able to get over him if he doesn't feel the same way :(. Anyway, another scenario - for some time coming up, I’ll only see him once a week. Last week I said to him “I’ll see you next Wednesday” and he says “that’s so long”, I said “I know I’ll miss you” and he replies “same” in a semi-enthusiastic tone. However today when I left I said the same thing, “I’ll see you next Wednesday” and he says “that’s so long” but he didn’t say he’ll miss me. I think that’s a bad sign unless I’m overthinking it.

Usually I start off by asking on their favourite foods. They tell me theirs, maybe I tell them mine. But after that...THEN what??

After this I tried branching out...by talking about places that have these kind of foods or special versions of the food. 

I can ask ""Have you tried this (food) at ____?""

Then what if they answer ""No.""? The convo ends pretty abruptly. 

Even if we share the same food preferences, there isn't much else to talk about. 

""Oh yeah, I've been here too!""
""The food is great""
""Yes!""

If I’m honest, the texting seemed a bit overwhelming at times so I tried pulling back when I could to slow down the pace. By the time we went out for dinner, I loosely knew his entire life story and he had shared all the “potential deal breakers” (significant medical history but doing fine otherwise, vapes nicotine, doesn’t drink/use thc, a month out of a long term relationship but insists he’s emotionally available and ready to date, in his mid-30s doing a PhD program and then wants to go to med school so he won’t be earning a significant income until he’s middle aged, wants to settle down and start a family in the next few years).

Not gonna lie, I wish he hadn’t shared so much so fast. But he honestly was pretty charming, had a lot of great qualities that I look for in a long-term partner (smart, kind, good manners, good relationship with his mom, responsible, wholesome), and I enjoyed the flow of our conversation over dinner up until the exclusivity talk came up.

The day after we matched, he mentioned that he was digging me so much he didn’t intent to keep swiping on tinder anymore because he had a good feeling about us. He asked if I was still swiping. I said I wasn’t, because it’s true — I had already matched with someone and was planning a date, and had just been ghosted by someone else. 

On our date, he reiterated that he was very interested in me and that he didn’t want to see other people and hoped I felt the same way. I told him I was still talking to someone and fumbled over words trying to explain that I take things super slow and want to get to know someone well before getting serious and physically escalating anything and will not be sexually intimate with multiple partners at a time. 

That piece of the conversation was awkward for both of us; he excused himself to the restroom almost immediately and the waitress came up to me and said she overheard that and thought it was a really shitty thing to ask on what she correctly assumed was a first date. We closed our tab, the waitress brought the bill and two shots of tequila on the house (I drank both since he doesn’t drink). Then he asked if we could go to his car so he could grab his vape pen, and we walked around for a bit until I really had to go. It felt like the mood had shifted and I’m aware that I became very closed off at that point. He ended it off by telling me that he knows what he wants and understands if I’m talking to someone else, but hopes he comes out on top because he really likes me. 

I left feeling confused and conflicted. A part of me wants to give him the benefit of the doubt because we are all just coming out a pandemic that forced us to be shut-ins for a really long time, so perhaps his social skills need a bit of refining. But if I add up some of the things he’s said and look at things as a whole, he might be a bit too emotionally impulsive for me (said his mom would love me, prefers dating a POC who can empathize with his struggles as a black man unlike his white ex, sent me links to romantic songs via text before we’d even met, talked about how much he admires people in my profession, said he really loves my look and appreciates a woman that knows how to dress up and be very feminine, assumed I’d be going back to his place when we were planning our date but was at least respectful when I made it clear that was out of my comfort zone). My gut tells me to run for the hills, but I don’t want to hurt his feelings and my friends pointed out that I’m always quick to next and write people off and think I should give it at least another date. What does Reddit think?

\*\*\*I would appreciate if you would read the full story\*\*\*

I didn’t want to come off as “rude” but she keeps telling me about this. I feel like she should actually be able to do this herself instead of complaining to me about it. How can I trust her if she can’t do these things on her own? I just find it hard to understand what would keep a guy hanging around for 2 years?? She has to be flirting. We are both pretty young and are freshmen in collage.

A year ago she said “Some ugly dude is calling me fit and it’s annoying me. He keeps asking for pics :(“ I laughed it off and thought I could trust her. I replied, “Cuss him out,” She said “I’m tempted” I replied, “lol,” she said “not funny”. I said “ok , 🖕 that’s for him.” She said “yes.” I didn’t hear anything else about it for a month or 2.

But, She’s now bringing it up more than ever. She texted me “help some guy is asking me for nudes. What am I supposed to do?” I replied, “idk block him,” She said “It’s fun messing with him he’s such a geek.” and she sent me a screenshot of the people on her Snapchat contacts and circled his name, and said, “His name is Jason.”

last month she said, “Help some horny dude is asking me for nudes.” I got aggravated and said “Deal with it yourself” She replied, “Um I’ll just send him nudes, yeah?” I replied “Do it and I’ll leave.” She said “I won’t really.” This aggravated me and I didn't handle it the way that I should have.

3 weeks ago she brought it up again except it wasn’t about nudes.

She randomly said “help I don’t know how to respond to this person I left them on delivered for 6 days LOL. He was on about how he got a gf” l replied “Tell him no one cares,” She said, “lol but that’s mean.” “But I also don’t want to talk to him. Once you start a conversation with him it never stops.”

I replied “say cool then he should get the hint” She replied “that’s mean and dry. I’ve been so tempted to just block him.” I replied “Jeez” She said “He also put me in a group chat with some random girl like idk her” I said “Who does that” She replied “him” She then said “awkward."" I try to be nice and understanding, but its obvious she wants a different response.

Today, I suggested that she continues to talk to guys who asks for nudes and she said “excuse me? No, I do not”, She said “there’s only one guy that’s asked me for nudes and I’ve left him on delivered for 3 weeks” and she sent me a screenshot of her DMS and underneath his name(“Jason”) it said “new chat 3weeks” meaning that he sent her a message 3 weeks ago and that was the last time she mentioned him.

This guy goes to her school and its the same guy based on what she tells/ shows me. She has known this guy for at least 2 years. I believe she's leading him on, but how do you get led on for 2 years?? This is very immature and I've tried to be nice, but I don't know how much more I can take.
