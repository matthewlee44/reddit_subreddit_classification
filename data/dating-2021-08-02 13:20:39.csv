10,owl2cl,1627930179,Men‚Äôs advice. I‚Äôm too busy = I‚Äôm too busy for you,"Timing is a factor that plays into a woman‚Äôs receptiveness, whether it‚Äôs short term or long term. Sometimes, she is at a point in her life where she truly is busy, and is not proactively looking to get involved with someone. This means her threshold for being open to someone is a little higher, and she might be a little more guarded with her emotions.

But make no mistake, no matter how busy someone is, they will make time for someone they have a high level attraction to, or someone they see a future with. Finding a partner is something that is always prevalent in most people lives, whether they admit it or not.

If a woman tells you she‚Äôs too busy, it means one of two things. Either she is just trying to spare your feelings, and is using being busy as an excuse to phase you out. The reason for her lack of attraction doesn‚Äôt matter at this point. Move on.

The other scenario is that she truly is busy or emotionally distracted. And while she may have a certain level of attraction to you, but under these circumstances, she‚Äôs still not attracted to you enough to pursue something. Maybe under different circumstances she might be more open, but hypotheticals don‚Äôt matter. In the present moment, she does not have a very high level of attraction. Again, there is no point trying to reason with her, or keep pursuing.

Pull back. If she wants to come you once she‚Äôs more open, she will. If you keep being an overbearing presence and push harder, she will associate you as being a needy burden in her life. The ball‚Äôs in her court, you only want to pursue and be with people who value you and make you a priority. Otherwise, you will be chasing and make yourself miserable trying to read hot and cold emotions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owl2cl/mens_advice_im_too_busy_im_too_busy_for_you/

We weren't communicating much from the start, a call at the end of the day or text messages when we arrange dates. We both went on holidays separately, he went to the seaside with his friends and i visited my family back home abroad (i am foreigner and he's local). We agreed before leaving that I'll be sending him pictures but as it would be hard to call with international roaming to meet the day I'm back. I found out from my friends that the seaside he went is popular for hook ups and alcohol. I do trust him but can't help myself making all these scenarios. He did tell me the name of the area he went but as a foreigner i had no clue what's about. He said he trusted me as well (kind of funny he'd think i would do anything since i am all day with friends and family). I did send him pictures on my 3rd day and he replied after few hours to let me know he was okay and drinking and enjoying time with his friends. I told him to have fun and that I'll be happy to hear his stories once we're back because i wanted to detox from my phone and social media. I did open my phone to send him pictures. I get it why he might not have replied to my last message as i told him i needed some space. He is sweet and respecting my needs when we communicate with each other. I can't help feeling insecure cause he's charming and kind and polite so a lot of women flirt with him. Should i give him a call once I'm back to reconnect since i asked for space?

One area I‚Äôve particularly struggled with is relationships with other people: romantic and platonic. One thing I‚Äôve come to realize is I‚Äôm a very ‚Äòintense‚Äô person, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. I would call myself a shy introvert, so making connections doesn‚Äôt exactly come easy. I don‚Äôt lack social skills, but I do find it challenging to ‚Äúact natural‚Äù around people I‚Äôm unfamiliar with. I‚Äôve had the same core group of friends for years, and of course I‚Äôve tried to make new friends, but superficial connections aren‚Äôt satisfying to me. Plainly put, that‚Äôs likely why dating has never been easy for me. I didn‚Äôt luck out and meet my SO at a young age, at school and now at work. I‚Äôve tried dating apps, but years of bad dates and dead end situations have proven to be a nightmare. Everyone in my life has a partner, and as dramatic as this sounds, I‚Äôm genuinely worried that will never happen for me. I‚Äôm a perfectly normal person, who is -at least by societies standards- conventionally attractive, educated and generally well rounded. I‚Äôm aware these qualities do not entitle me to a partner, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt understand what the heck my issue is. Most of my dating experiences have been negative, like literally since HS I haven‚Äôt really caught a break. I‚Äôm not 16 anymore, people my age ARE in serious relationships: travelling together, moving in together; getting engaged, or married; having KIDS, investing in a future together etc. I‚Äôm not interested in anything casual, being breadcrumbed and last but not least, treated poorly. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening to me, dating apps seems to be ripe with unsavoury characters, and it‚Äôs SCARY. My future is uncertain, I‚Äôm damn near an existential crisis if things keep going at the current rate they are :(

She mentioned that it was okay to touch her while we made out, but when things started heating up a bit - she said she wants to take things slow. I told her that I was okay with that and we continued making out for a bit more before I headed out.

Since then, I got a couple short answers on Saturday before she was going to head out to visit her parents. She‚Äôs usually the one to text first but I haven‚Äôt heard from her in a couple days.

We had a coffee first date. It was great! Conversation came easily, we laughed. I hugged him hello and goodbye. About an hour after the date he said he had a great time. I like being honest, so I came out and said I thought he was great and that I would like to get to know him better. He said he felt the same way. I gave him my phone number. We then had short daily texts( like what are you doing? How are you?). 4 days after the 1st date, I asked him if he wanted to go with me to the museum. He said he felt uncomfortable being indoors still, but that he did want to do something. So we arranged to go for dinner outside in a few days. Meantime, we continued our short daily texts, alternating who would reach out first.

 We met for the second date and I think it went better than the first. We talked more, I felt he was getting more comfortable with me. We joked around a lot, he even made little comments that made it seem like he thought this could last. At the end of the night, he said he would have to plan something next time, if there was a next time? And I said that it was a yes from me and we hugged goodbye (I even felt that he hugged me harder than he had the first time). Then he didn't text me until I texted him on Sunday, asking what he was up to. Then nothing again until I texted him Tuesday, asking how he was. He answered me enthusiastically both time. Now I haven't heard from him since that Tuesday, so 6 days ago? 

I didn't want to reach out myself because I had already done so the last 2 times and I don't want to seem desperate. I was going to wait until tomorrow (so it'll be a full week) and say like ""Hey, are you still interested in going out since I haven't heard from you? It's okay if you're not anymore."" Should I? Or should I wait a few more days to do so? It's only been 2 dates, so I know we didn't have anything really established, but I really like him and feel like we could go somewhere. But I don't want to be pushy or seem desperate. Should I just forget it and just chalk it up to him ghosting me? Should I just wait and see if he every reaches out?

25,owmxng,1627935590,"Asking a Server Out - Shared Interest, Possible Age Gap","I wanted to open the dialogue on here and probably get some confirmation on a positive situation that I am going through at the moment.  I am a male, 34 and there's a female that is a server at a place that I go to about once a week, sometimes twice.  It's sort of hard to tell her age, but my best estimate is that she is 24-27. 

I am not dense and do realize that there is some flirting involved with being a server.  I am not some overly hopeless romantic that romanticizes everything.  But since May, this server seems to have made it known that she's interested in me (much to my surprise).

She isn't always assigned to our room/area - but she seems to make a point to at least say 'hi' to me directly when in the hall, passing through other sections, etc.  

I hadn't planned on acting on it until this past weekend.  I was visiting the bar with my friend and looking at what beers they had in an upright case.  The bartender was there, this girl, and another server that was a female.  The second female (not the interested party) was sort of in my line of sight for the beer case but I could still see everything in the case.  I made a joke that was ""Oh, don't worry, I am not staring at you, just looking past you to see all of the beers"".  She laughed and said ""How romantic?!  Here I thought you were interested in me!""  Jokingly I chided ""Ehh, trust me, you could do better than me"".  Which was met with laughter from everyone.  But shortly after saying that and without missing a beat, the potential interested girl said ""Oh, I don't think at all"".

So, paraphrasing, even with an age gap and assuming she would flirt with people for tips - if a server goes out of their way to speak to someone, looks at them, and jokes with them even when they're not their customer over a period of 3 months - should I ask her casually out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owmxng/asking_a_server_out_shared_interest_possible_age/

Usually the answers are go to clubs, walk around downtown, go see live bands, etcs.

I'm 29 years old and I live in a town of around 250,000-300,000 people. It's very much a modern Sunbelt city. By that I mean it's all sprawl and there really isn't a true downtown or any place with foot traffic. Most of the homes are in subdivisions or isolate suburbs. It's mostly just plaza after plaza after plaza after office park after plaza after gas station, etc. You get the picture. 

I really see anyone male or female walking around. Our tiny downtown is a ghosttown by 8pm and even during the day no foot traffic since it's all offices. I've been to the parks but even on weekends it's 90% moms and their kids. Even from Googling to meet places to find girls in small towns most of the usual results say grocery stores, the library, parks, dog parks, etc. But I never see any single 20 somethings there. Just women in their mid 30s and up. I'm a teetotaler, so bars aren't for me. I tried volunteering with a dog rescue a while ago pre-covid. I loved it, I loved playing with the dogs but everyone else was an older woman. None of them had any single daughters or granddaughters to set me up with either.

Even regarding meeting guy friends to hang with, I play in a beer league hockey league but it's 95% male and even all of the other players are 40+. I have a few acquaintances but everyone is in a different stage of life.

I also surf and skateboard but those are both heavily male dominated and lean younger like most a bunch of 16-22 year olds. I'm kind of the old man of the group there. So more acquaintances but no real friends.

Then I recently brought a Ninja 250 but the free ride group I'm part of, leans older with everyone in their 40s and male.

I just walked up and said hey when she was on break and she remembered who I was. We talked for a bit but I left so she can eat and relax a bit before starting her second set.

48,owogdl,1627940059,Dealing with dating and past abuse,"I don‚Äôt really know where to turn for this (except a therapist, which I‚Äôm waiting for) so I thought I‚Äôd ask here. Hopefully this won‚Äôt get deleted, as I just wanna vent about my dating experience as an abuse survivor.

Anyways, a few years ago I realized I was sexually abused as a child, and a couple of years of therapy has done wonders. However, there is still alot to be done. 

Perhaps what bothers me the most now, is when it comes to dating. The abuse I endured was grooming and peeping/mocking/bullying when I was exploring my sexuality by my now (fourtunately) dead stepfather. My problem is that I‚Äôm scared to death to actually pursue girls I find attractive, as my young self was manipulates towards liking older men, or in my abusers words ‚Äúhighly moral people‚Äù. 

Every time a girl hits on me, I almost panic. I avoid social settings with girls, mostly for this reason, as I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll do or say anything not ‚Äòmorally acceptable‚Äô. Now I did stay with a girl for seven years, but the last five years was mostly because I believed it was morally wrong to break up, and I hated myself for not finding her attractive (which was basicly a ‚Äòmortal sin‚Äô the way I thought of it). I know this is wrong, and there is nothing wrong with being attracted to someone, but I can‚Äôt shake this knee-jerk reaction, as it terrifies me. 

What almost makes it worse, is that I‚Äôm a fairly attractive man, and get hit on not too rarely. It just feels like I‚Äôm tearing myself apart here, as it seems like I can‚Äôt have what I want, and subconsciously avoid ornsabotage any ways to meet and get with a girl. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôm genuinely uncomfortable when I see someone is attracted to me. I can flirt and stuff, but only when I know there‚Äôs no chance of success, or if I know I will turn it down before anything could happen. I‚Äôm trying out tinder, but I notice I can only do it right when I aim for basicly marriage (which I know is a bad idea due to my unresolved issues.) 

And, just to vent a little, I feel like my youth was stolen, as all the girls I ever wanted, and who wanted me, I sabotaged/avoided. Every time I try to have sex with a new girl, I panic and everything just dies down because I fear I will be attacked or mocked. I f*cking hate pedophiles, and especially that people assume that since you was abused as a child, they assume you yourself will abuse children (which I‚Äôd rather kill myself than do).

I just wonder if anyone else has experienced the same, and how do you deal with it? How do you accept yourself being a victim? I want to explore my sexuality, but I just don‚Äôt know how.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owogdl/dealing_with_dating_and_past_abuse/

54,owp5w9,1627942187,How Apparently Not to Set Boundaries with a Married Man‚Ä¶,"I met a guy OLD while he was deployed. Seven weeks later after almost daily communication, he returns home and we go on two dates over the course of a week, the second being a concert with some of my friends. 

The next morning, I post a candid photo from the concert that he‚Äôs in to my private Instagram account (I did not tag him in it). He then calls me and asks me to take down the photo because he‚Äôs married (this was the first time I‚Äôve heard about this) and just starting the divorce process with his wife who allegedly ‚Äúcheated on him‚Äù while he was deployed. It seemed like an open conversation; he told me he‚Äôd be willing to ask whatever questions I have in person and that he wants to be ‚Äúfully transparent‚Äù. He even asked for the photo twice and said it was ‚Äúcute AF‚Äù.

I followed up after the phone call and asked him to set a time and place for the in-person chat. In my mind, I figured if he fully intended to pursue this/me, he‚Äôd be jumping at the opportunity to set the record straight, show me that he‚Äôs emotionally available, and assure me that he is on top of the divorce process. 

When he failed to commit to a meet up but continued to watch my Instagram stories while ignoring my follow up text for a day and a half, I told him that he‚Äôs falling below what I deserve from him in the communication and transparency department. I also told him to stop watching my Instagram stories and to stop big brothering me until he communicates that he‚Äôs ready to talk.

Cue the flip switch. He accused me of being ‚Äúaggressive,‚Äù threatened to never talk to me again if I ever speak like this to him again, said he feels ‚Äúviolated and gross‚Äù for having to disclose his marriage to me so soon ‚Äúfor his sake,‚Äù and told me that we should take a step back until he finalizes his divorce.

I responded with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs exactly what I needed to hear. Truly wishing you the best.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs where I may be the asshole: I blocked him on social media, blocked his number, and had my secretary first-class mail him a t-shirt I borrowed from him with a return address from my work (he knows where I work) rather than my home (he doesn‚Äôt know where I live) so that I make it abundantly clear that I want nothing to do with him. I had it mailed so someone at his house will have to sign for it &amp; I will then know what is done is done. I feel very unsafe by his threat coupled with his insane delusion that there is still a chance for us after his divorce.

TL;DR: Is requiring that a married man I‚Äôm seeing give me assurances that he is emotionally available before having further access to my life and my social media aggressive at this stage in the game?

We immediately connected, went out for dates, and started to date for about 1-2 months. Although short, we had great chemistry. I was the one who ended it. Without going into specifics, I was turned off by the way she handled disagreement.

At the time, I thought I made the right choice. But sometimes, I wonder if it was a minor issue that could easily be resolved, or I might have over-reacted because I have a tendency to do that. Rather than working out the issues, I just walk away.

More than a year passed. This July, I ran into her, and we exchanged numbers. I asked her out for coffee. We spent hours chatting, laughing, and talking about how things were misinterpreted. And she mentioned that she was really hurt because we had such great chemistry. In the end, I asked her to give it a try, and she said yes. Things were going well, and I knew that we still had the chemistry. But after a few dates, she ended it and said she no longer felt the chemistry. I respected her decision and moved on.

Yesterday I got a call from her out of the blue. She mentioned that she lied to me about the chemistry and had to end it because she was so afraid of getting hurt again and wanted to protect herself. She asked me for another chance. 

She mentioned that she had not dated anyone after that. Of course, I wanted to trust her and give her the benefit of the doubt, but I would appreciate some objective perspective on this because I feel like I am being her backup.

I don't know much about cocaine use but this is a bit problematic for me. I know people can make bad mistakes in their life and then turn their life around but doesn't cocaine use cause serious health/mental problems long term? He does have sinus issues in the morning so obviously that's a side effect of long term use. 

Having a healthy life style is important to me. He does make sure he eats well and exercises. He said he has always been overweight and has gotten himself in shape in recent years. He's probably gained 30-40 lbs from Covid (as he was a regular gym goer) but seems to have gone back to the gym since things are reopening up here.

There is a girl I‚Äôve talked on/off with for almost 10yrs now. I‚Äôve pretty much fucked it up with my drinking habits every time we were going to give it a shot. Even still, after 10yrs, there‚Äôs just always been something about this girl.

I‚Äôve chilled out much since Summer 2017. Still like to have the occasional good time, but not nearly the drinker I once was.

Saturday I just said screw it and I asked her out. Thinking there was NO way she would say yes‚Ä¶ and to my surprise‚Ä¶ she said yes‚Ä¶ and now we are going out this Saturday. To say I am beyond excited is an understatement, but I honestly can‚Äôt understand why said yes. Again, not the drinker I used to be, but I would still slip into the occasional drunk texting session to her, and I just can‚Äôt understand it.

We finalized our plans last night and she even ended the texting conversation with ‚ÄúYou better not fuck this up‚Äù . 

I guess really I‚Äôm thinking out loud. Where if she really wanted nothing to do with me, she could of blocked my number, and stopped talking to me years ago. Really really really excited to see her and take her out. Like my face hurts after being around her for 10mins because it‚Äôs stuck in this permanent smile.

can be  embarrassing and downright difficult. But,

 if you know what you are doing and have faith in 

your own forces you can get the one you like.

&amp;#x200B;

Impressing a woman is not an easy task, 

especially if you don‚Äôt have a lot of experience 

with females. There are many components that go 

into impressing a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to learn how to impress a girl, then 

you should do your best to be positive. Keep in 

mind that smiles and jokes are great bonding 

mechanisms that you can use to impress a girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a charm and seductive attraction that 

some guys have, so they have all the girls they 

want. This  magnet is called charisma, and it is 

very important if you want to attract the woman 

of your life. But, if this is a problem for you, 

you must try some tricks to pick-up the woman you 

want.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, use your dog to pick-up girls. You 

have a dog? Now its your chance. Take a walk with 

your dog on the place where you know your special 

one passes by every day. Any girl likes dogs. 

Small ones are very cute and the big ones make 

you look hot.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are with your dog out and suddenly 

your girl pass over. Make sure that she sees you. 

If it happens that your dog had a bad behavior 

and starts barking at her you might apologize and 

tell her to not take it personally. So, you can 

discus with her. Show her that your dog know some 

tricks  and while your dog is sitting and rolling 

over you' re getting to know the girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Babies. Every woman love babies.  Your friend is 

married and has a baby? Join your friend when he 

goes out with the baby and show interest by 

playing with the kid when she passes by you. Next 

day you can offer to watch out the baby for your 

friend and take him to a walk to show her you 

like kids. But make sure she has saw you in the 

day before with your friend to not think that the 

baby is yours. If the baby is crying when she 

passes by you, you might be lucky and she might 

offer her help to make the baby stop crying. So, 

you get to talk with her and may ask her for a 

date.

&amp;#x200B;

Use some magic tricks to attract her. You are 

seeing her every day and you don't have the 

courage to talk to her. First of all, relax. One 

of the biggest turnoffs for women is a guy who‚Äôs 

uptight. Just relax and you‚Äôll be fine. After you 

start talking with her use some magic tricks to 

impress her and attract her. You may say that you 

are good at magick and you are offering to guess 

her future by reading her hand. She'll definitely 

laugh but if she's ok with this you may tell her 

that she will have a glorious future.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't forget to make her laugh. Laughter is all 

you need to attract  women easily and quickly. If 

you are able to make her laugh any time and any 

places it will be easier to you to get the woman 

you are  looking after for some long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:

We all know that approaching woman isn't easy. It 

can be  embarrassing and downright difficult. But,

TL;DR: Dated someone for five months, it was headed in a serious direction, however, given circumstances both beyond our control and his priority level, we broke it off. He reached back out and now I'm trying to decide if it's worth giving it a second shot. 

Recently, I (26F) took a hiatus from dating. Coming out of two very toxic, serious relationships, followed by a small period of dating that seemingly felt healthy but just didn't work out, I decided to take some time to reflect inward and address some personal things. It's been going great and I've been doing well on my own; sure it gets lonely, but I'm building a strong community of friends which has proved so helpful. 

In the past few months, however, an ex (30M) reached out to me and it's left me unsure how to move forward. We began dating in October 2020, after I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Still working through things and healing, I was pretty cautious and didn't hold any expectations. Ironically, we started dating and it felt like one of the most healthy relationships I've had: he was caring, thoughtful, respectful; he initiated plans/conversation, and we spent good, quality time together. We really vibed and both expressed a serious interest in each other. One thing that I really appreciated was his honesty. In early discussions about our wants/needs/boundaries, he shared that he didn't really have any experience with serious relationships so far in his life (he focused on his career), but he was doing a lot of self-work in the past year as he wanted finally make time and space for a relationship. He acknowledged that communication wasn't his strong point -- particularly around deeply personal things as he's always handled it on his own --but he was working on it. I clocked this, but considering that we were naming the issue, there was likely room for growth. All said, things felt like they were moving in the right direction.

Around four months in, one of his parents suddenly grew very ill. I didn't know what was going on at first, as our communication also suddenly dropped off for a week. Finally hearing from him, he vaguely told me what was going on, and that he had rushed back home to support his family (understandably). I offered my support, which he was thankful for, but admittedly shared that this was something hard for him to discuss and receive help with (which made sense given the above sentiment). For most of February, things were kinda spotty as he was traveling to see his parents, trying to take care of his own health (which was of concern), and juggling work (he got a promotion). He still made time for me as best as he could, but of course he was exhausted. He was filling me in more about the status of his parents which was great, but he was also becoming more involved with other projects (buying investment property, going out of state to visit friends) and it felt like 'we' were becoming less of a priority. After another small bout of lack of communication, I suggested maybe we take a break not because I wanted to, but mostly out of fear things weren't going to work out. As mentioned, I was still dealing with the trauma from previous relationships and this was in part a trigger response, but also a decent boundary. Soon after, we met and had a deep conversation where I clearly expressed either we work on this or we separate as it's not fair to either of us. He admitted he was having a lot of difficulty balancing things but that he strongly wanted to be together and work through it. I was kind of surprised honestly, but the conversation felt so good. About three weeks later, I get a text that says he has to rethink things because he's just too overwhelmed. It sucked, especially since it felt a bit like a blindside but I knew it was out of my control so I began to move on. I told him if he wanted to talk about it, I'm around. About month later after not hearing from him, I get a text that he wants to meet to catch up. After a ton of back and forth because of his work schedule, I finally go over to his place to talk at midnight on a weekday. He apologized for how he handled things, including the lack of communication, and then explained he just didn't know how to balance things. He wanted a relationship with me -- and acknowledged that we were building something serious together and he never felt like this for someone -- but at this time he couldn't prioritize me with all the other things going on. He then asked what he could do, and where it left us. I expressed my appreciation for his honesty and the conversation, but said I couldn't be the person to tell him how to live (he asked me how to be better at making space in his life for all of this, which was ultimately the big convo we had weeks prior where I told him only he could make the decision for himself what he wants), and respectfully walked out of his apartment. When I left we were both really hurt and emotional (I don't think he thought I was going to leave) but it didn't seem like there was any other option. 

Fast forward a month later, and out of blue he adds me on snapchat. This is the only social, aside from Facebook, he has and we never connected on either. He starts sending me snaps of mundane things, like his work day, where he's traveling, what he's doing. I don't respond because I feel like after everything that transpired, if he wanted to talk the least he could do was send me an actual composed message. This goes on for about two months. Last month he finally reaches out with a drunken text to see how I am, how he wants to see me, and spend time. We talk but I don't really show too much interest, in part because he's drunk but also as I've already started to move on and I'm a bit frustrated this is how we connect again. For the next three weeks he's reaching out via text and snapchat, but now he's also sending me explicit messages, which was something we never really did when we dated.  I also notice that he's posting stories with another girl and they look kinda boo'd up. I go back and forth many times about whether or not I should even engage in messaging him at this point, and he keeps pressing to see me. This weekend I finally gave in and he came over. Needless to say we slept together, but he didn't stay for long as he was actually out with family and then was leaving for an international flight in the morning. It was bit awkward at first: we didn't really know what to say since this was the first time we've seen each other since we broke up and this was kinda a booty call.  He also made some weird comments about being jealous of my new apartment (note that it always kinda felt like we were in competition about who was the breadwinner). Eventually it passed and we talked about life, I asked about his mom (which I think he was taken aback that I remembered/cared). He left shortly after, but said that upon his return from his international trip he wanted to see me and actually talk. 

It's now been a day or so and I'm not really sure what to do. I know what I feel, which is I miss him. I thought he were really going to work out, and I still wish things would. But I'm uncertain if anything has really changed. From the small bits of conversation we had, it didn't feel like he found balance for himself. Also, I'm not sure where he's at with dating this other girl or what he wants as far as commitment. To some degree, it feels like he's lonely and he's just returning to what he knows makes him feel good...

At this point, it feels I want to have a conversation upon his return and just lay it out -- I know what I want (commitment) and what I don't (FWB, situation). This way at least once I know where he stands with this, and our wants don't align, it's not worth pursuing. I guess I'm just wondering if giving him my time and my energy is worth it? Does he show really any interest or am I just playing myself here?

Like a guy in his late twenties who lives a pretty active lifestyle hiking, yoga, gym workouts etc. I also enjoy bar hopping, night out with friends etc and sometimes I feel like I might be coming off like the woman wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up. Despite the fact I definitely enjoy my lazy days napping and watching tv and playing board games. 

How do I find the middle ground of not coming off boring but also not coming off as intimidating for being too active. Also I‚Äôm black üòÖ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owtqqc/ladies_are_you_ever_intimidated_by_certain_mens/

I love Crocs. I wear them all the time in the summer. It acts as a way for my feet to breathe and it also lets me hide my toes, which I do have an insecurity about. Not sure what girls hate about Crocs.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owtuiq/why_do_girls_hate_crocs/
98,owtvi6,1627957679,adult dating - my 18 year old experience + advice needed,"I haven't been in a relationship in 3 years. After that breakup, i decided to take some time to work on myself to be better for me and my next partner. I'm a guy btw. 

I've been using Hinge, because I'm new to my area and I really dont know anyone, nor do I meet people. I matched with this 24 year old, which I'm fine with, because I prefer dating older guys. The thing is, he is so busy doing so many different things: work, school, business, etc. Our communication can get very irregular. When I was a ""kid"", I was so used to talking to people who were never that busy and if they were irregular, I just thought they were not interested. My friends would also say that.

Talking to this guy has shifted my idea of what consistency means. However, I sometimes wonder if these are red flags or just things I just have to become more accustomed to. I can tell he makes the effort to reach out when he can and we do get along really well. Any advice for a kid turned adult, going full force into the adult dating world?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owtvi6/adult_dating_my_18_year_old_experience_advice/
99,owtybm,1627957944,How soon into getting to know someone do you stop checking/updating your dating profile?,"I (F/29) have been getting to know a guy (29/M) for almost 2 months now. I know 2 months isn‚Äôt long, but things have been going really well so far. He talks about how much he likes me and enjoys getting to know me, and he constantly asks to hangout. He talks about activities he wants to do in the future with me. We have a great time and time flies when we‚Äôre together. 

But I noticed he‚Äôs still updating his dating profile pics and bio constantly. Which makes me feel like he‚Äôs obviously still looking for other options. It makes me feel like maybe I‚Äôm really not what he‚Äôs looking for, maybe he‚Äôs just passing time until he meets the person he‚Äôs looking for.  We‚Äôre not exclusive, so he‚Äôs not doing anything wrong. But it just makes me wonder, when do YOU stop updating or checking your dating profile when you‚Äôre getting to know someone? Only once things become official? At a certain point before that? Personally, once I decide I like someone, I tend to focus on that person and see it through. But I don‚Äôt think I want to put all my eggs in one basket if he‚Äôs still considering other options.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owtybm/how_soon_into_getting_to_know_someone_do_you_stop/
