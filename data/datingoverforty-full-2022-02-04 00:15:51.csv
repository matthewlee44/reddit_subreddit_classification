I met a lovely young lady last Saturday night in town and after a good chat I asked for her number so I could take her out for a drink to get to know her better. 

Texted back and forth on Sunday and arranged a date for Friday. I left it at ""Great, see you friday"". 

This morning I texted to check we are still on for tonight. 

After a long time I received a lengthy reply that because she'd not heard from me in a while she wasn't sure she wanted to see me, that she has a lot on at the minute and although I'm charming and stuff that she's got too much on for dating. I'm paraphasing but that's the gist of it.  

The latter part is fine. If too much on that's fair enough. Bit surprised about the ""not heard from me"" part and a bit confused why it went from All go on Sunday to No go on Friday. 

Is the fact I didn't text her in the week a big mistake from me? I didn't as I didn't want to seem needy before a first date. Feels like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't.

I love this sub and have found some great nuggets of advice here.  I am looking to receive some of that wisdom directly now.

&amp;#x200B;

I (47M) have been seeing a wonderful woman (45F) for about 2.5 years.  She has two weekends a month kid free, and these are the weekends we spend time together.  They are precious.  Until recently, this situation has worked well for us.  Despite our limited time together, we have grown very close.

&amp;#x200B;

The pandemic has obviously changed things for everyone.  Without going into details, it has caused her to become overwhelmed in the past six months and it has caused me to fall into a depression of sorts in the same six months.  Despite my depression and my feelings of wanting to be alone, I still made every effort I could to see her on her kid free weekends and be present.  This relationship has been amazing, in so many ways, and I didn't want to diminish it with what I have been struggling with.   I prioritized this over other things in my life because of the value I thought it had.  It's been one of the few things that I find positive.  Despite her feelings of overwhelmedness, she has received me and we continued to see each other and shared more vulnerability, with more TLC.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, she communicated that she is now so overwhelmed, she doesn't feel comfortable in her body.  She has made some remarks that are very uncharacteristic of her.  Before going over for one of our weekends together, she warned me that she was not in a good place.  That didn't bother me, I just wanted to help provide what comfort I could.  However, when I saw her, she was physically distant.  Her body language was very guarded, and she didn't want to snuggle.  OK, I can understand that, I have been there.

&amp;#x200B;

Before deciding to spend another night, I asked her if she was pushing me away.  She didn't answer my question, and shared that she was in a tough spot and needed to figure things out.  I said OK and left her alone.  The next day, she asked if we could talk, and I said yes.  So, we went on a walk in a park and I asked her again if she is pushing me away.  Once again, she didn't answer my question and further explained her situation (which I already know because she has already shared it).  She said that she is juggling a lot of balls.  I asked her if she felt like I was one of those balls and she said no.  I asked her want she wants, and she shared what she needed to do... but not what she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't have a lot of time to herself, and the weekends that she has free, she has chosen to share with me.  I told her that alone time is important, and understand that she needs it.  I told her that we should not see each other for a month, and that I hope that she can figure out what she wants.  She said that she was sorry, and I told her not to apologize for prioritizing herself... but she said that's not what she is sorry for.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that I wasn't mad but bummed.  I told her that I only wish for her to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Further reflection finds me very disappointed and hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to the sub is... after this time apart, if she decides that she wants me in her life, can I really trust that?  Should I trust that?

This amazing lady has given me no reason to distrust her up until the point when she wouldn't answer my direct questions.

I am curious know know if anyone has had a similar experience, or cares to share their perspective.

We are long distance-ish meaning we live about an hour apart. We have a great time when we are together, he’s very sweet and funny, the sexual chemistry has always been good. I genuinely love him and I’d like to think that he loves me too, I mean he says he does. Lately he’s been more distant via text which is difficult because a lot of our relationship is via text. I think he might be losing interest. We don’t flirt or talk like we used during the week via text but the weekends we spend together are great. He has this habit of being weird via text, like completely not answering questions I’ve asked or giving very short answers. Sometimes my gut really feels like he’s lying to me but I don’t have any proof of anything. Part of me feels like he’s seeing other people but I know if I ask he will deny it. I confronted him one before and I ended up hurting his feelings and feeling crazy. I don’t want to ruin something good but I also don’t want to ignore my intuition.

During the argument, I asked her if she could compromise - she said that she 'didn't know how much more she could bend' for me. I said that she never did compromise with me, or accept me for who I am, and she AGREED.

Don’t talk sex/lewd too early unless you’re sure they would be game

Don’t be too familiar too early (good morning beautiful every day etc) let that build up naturally 

Don’t tell lots of tales of your hilarious fuckups/clumsiness/carelessness. This may be funny to friends but a date will be worrying whether they are getting involved with a liability. 

Don’t tell me in-depth details of your family/kid’s lives. I want to know about you at this point, that can come later. 

Make sure your nails are clean and trimmed. We really notice this. (Honourable mentions to ear/nose/eyebrow trimming) 

Ask before going in for a kiss. But also read body language and preferably don’t even ask if it doesn’t seem welcome yet. 

If you get asked a question make sure you send one back. Asking the same one back is ok but make sure you’re coming up with your own too. 

Make them interesting but don’t ask questions that are hard work. Keep them thoughtful but can be answered relatively easily. 

Don’t ask “so tell me about yourself” it’s too broad. Be more specific. 

Stop asking what a day in their life looks like. It always feels like I’m having to justify my existence. 

Be polite when rejected. It says a lot about you and could even result in a change of heart later on (but don’t assume so)

It’s not necessarily meant for dating but more like a place where we can share stories, advice, etc. Well, in October, there was a meetup at a brewery for those of us that live in Chicago. About ten or so of us came and it was really fun. Met some fabulous women that I’ve become friends with now but there was also one guy that caught my eye. I friended everyone from the meetup, because why not, and that  guy DMd me right away.  We didn’t even have a conversation the night of the meetup but I was attracted to him and liked him right away. The DMing continued for a couple months and we started to get to know each other. So fast forward to December….he asks for my number and we start to talk/text…one of those guys that really make me laugh and I can talk to for hours. He eventually asked me out for dinner, which went great, and I invited him back to my place where we watched a movie and then the first kiss….wow. Since that first date we have seen each other at least once a week…just really casual dinners at his place, talking, listening to music, and yes….more intimate time too that I’m totally ok with. The sex is amazing…I like being with him…I get nervous each time I see him because I’m excited! Im trying to live in the moment because I like where things are at but there’s a part of me that feels like I need to know where he stands…my bday passed and he sent a nice text and called to sing happy bday to me but nothing more than that even though I wasn’t really expecting anything more because we’re still so new.  But anyway, should I ask him where he sees us going? I’m feeling like I would like to know because we have been seeing each other for a bit over a month but I don’t want to make him feel pressured either.  I don’t know.

Why do y’all lie to your girlfriends?

Not a live in girlfriend but someone you’ve been with over a year under two and spend significant time with her.

She initiated contact with me, and although on the first dates I was not convinced of her, I called her one night after the 4-5th (she told me that she had doubts after those dates too) and everything started to roll. We speak clearly.

I know that I am going to shorten the story a lot, but Reddit is not a lover of very long stories, which is strange, because in personal relationships it is difficult not to give data, situations, experiences, etc. and that history be seen well for those who are from outside.

But the key point is that what I thought was love was simple attraction and then interest. And that's why she said that she needed time (after 3 months) to be able to tell me (although she did things like give me Christmas gifts, give me craft gifts where she said I love you and things like that, etc.), to tell me that she loved me or whatever. . Yes, we were going to a hotel. We would meet up to have sex, she would cuddle up on the bed, she would intertwine her feet with mine, etc. According to her, she loved sex with me. And not because I asked. She liked her sex with me... but she didn't feel some kind of ""love"" for me?

What was happening?

But she is an ambitious person. Competitive (as a couple and at work, and that was annoying sometimes). And manipulative, perhaps. Because she never told me, for more than 3 months of relationship until she finished, I love you. I like you a lot (or something). I like your mouth. I like to be with you. I like the smell of your neck. Never is never. And I realized, when we finished, that she was never going to tell me.

Add her extreme care and fear that they would see us together at work or during our outings in the city. If we were out of it, she would grab my hand, she would let me grab her waist. But if I said that she had gotten some tickets to a show and used my wits to get something extra by saying that she was coming with my partner, she didn't like it. Or if she came to my house (we live in a small town), she excused herself by saying that she was discreet and wanted to do it hide the most she can (and she told she was a very traditional woman and that she did not like that). At the end of 3 months, I was tired of putting up with this situation

In that discussion, the day we broke up, she became cold and very aggressive. She went to hurt me with personal, sexual things, even remembering shit from the past. I was WTF, and then i started to say bad things about her (but not insulting her, only arguments but being brutally honest). 

I hadn't seen her like this in 3-4 months we were together. Never so cold and mean, that was like an angel to demon, really. We never said anything so harsh to each other, but I did notice that the last week she was very touchy making jokes about my possible flaws and others. And when she left my house, where we get that broke up, she told me that lately she had doubts, that if she needed time, and I told her: time for teenagers, we are adults and we have only been here for 3 months, nothing of time. And she says: well, I'll leave it. And I answered: she was waiting for you to say it. And after that fight, she added that she didn't want me to say hello or something at work (so she can hide it until the end of the earth). After that, we are 2 weeks without any contact, and at work she walked past me and we didn't say hello, nothing, not a view. Amazing cold woman that never seem before on her that behaviour, this people is really shocking. Really shocking.

I know it's not much info and details, but going to my house and doing it half in secret, worried about being seen together, etc., and all those love sayings that she never said, annoyed me, but then she would say: please, let's change the subject, oh well, I'd rather be single, and then I changed the subject, and I don't know how, we ended up normal, as if nothing had happened, and another day downs and the relationship goes on, cause when i was in intimacy with her, not only doing sex, i felt like i love her and she was so nice and affectionate... but not to say nothing about her feelings (that maybe she never felt: 15-20 days ago she said that we were in different emotional levels... but I didnt get the hint, and she added again that she needed time, and i answered: well, we were 3 months and some say that falling in love is around 6 first months, and she said: so i have 3 more... weird?!) . She was a master not answering the critical questions i asked her and she changed the subject and then lets go tomorrow to the beach with my caravan, let's go swimming, lets go to your house to have sex... and i followed her like an idiot, because i was having fun, because i miss a relationship a lot, and i was not taking time to think about what was happening.

What I want to say is that for me that girl gave me different and new, exciting experiences, and I fell in love with her.

But she didn't want a partner. She wanted to have a boy with benefits, the ones she liked, but continue with her life. No extra commitments of any kind, neither she nor she intended to fall in love, or anything. She made me food, gave me things, bought trips for the two of us as a surprise... but always outside the small town where we lived, and yes, a town where everyone knew everyone's life and she, due to her job ambition I think. Keep her image as a single woman and when i met her at work, everybody told me she was single from 3 years ago working there, but she told me she had another men in her life, during months, some during a year, in all these years... 41 years old, me 49, wanting to grow in the company i started worked this last year (from september, our relationship was from october 2021-january 2022), like me, who, by the way, have a much better resume than her, although she knows how to move very well and well, then she's a hottie, beautiful, tall, dark-haired, and she knows how to handle people very well and who she gets close to and who she doesn't, I say it like it is, she told me a lot about her plus what I saw at work and that's the image she wants to give: professional, discreet, etc.

From my point of view, she manipulated me, or something happened that i can't understand (not only that maybe she was tired of the relationship and want another, she told me: i was looking for some guys... that shit hurted me a lot during our break up, she was mean, and added: i know we didn't falling in love with each other, don't worry, you'll find another woman soon...). She was a bitch there. I answered very angry and hurted.

I was a guy to keep me secret, so if the things don't go, or she doesn't want to keep dating me, she can return to his life without nobody notice it.

It was machiavellian. I promise you all that i never see this after the broke up. I'm still shocked.

And since I was surprised by all that behavior and I didn't understand it, in return she pleased me, she prepared things for both of us like dinners, she took me into her life under her rules (that i was not aware of that, i accepted those rules without weigh them correctly because I liked her and felt comforted in many ways, and then she came back to her house. Except for hotel nights or specific days, weekends, the rest of the time each one lived in her house, she had her life like a single woman going to the swimming club with some new friends (that now i understand she never told them about me), she never introduced me to a friend because he said that those who lived there were not friends enough to do so, until I got fed up with those excuses, so many, that that night I caused the breakup. And when I asked her the bottom of the truth, there she was, cold, bitch, hurting me, yelling at me that she didn't want a relationship with a guy from work and I told her what the hell we were doing together for 3-4 months and she kept quiet, and then changing the argument to justify the break. Tremendous.

Not even a month ago she had the idea of ​​going to live together in a rental, with separate rooms, etc. When she left him, she didn't mention it. She just wants someone in her life by her standards. Like the typical man who cheats on a woman, she gives him flowers, she has her cajoled, seduced... but she doesn't want anything serious. She manipulates her.

And what do I do now if I see her at work, at the supermarket, when i see her at gym. Last day, we went out almost together. She turned her face a little, saw me, and then started walking fast, as if i were a stalker. It feels fucking bad and it hurted.

Does she ever loved me? What the fuck what happened? I was manipulated? What to do now? Call her to ask her for an explanation? I don't know what to do now, i'm fucking lost and hurted inside, i was thinking in a future with her and now i'm devastated. I miss her a lot even after all this mess.

Question for the women here..guys with experience, feel free to chime in. 

I (45M) …live in a small city. A lot of social circles intersect here. I’ve been following a woman on Twitter for a year or 2 now. She doesn’t post pics of herself or tweets any personal information but she has an amazing sense of humor, seems smart, and posts some occasional nsfw stuff that excites me. Lol. 

My account is also very vague. No pics or self identifying stuff either. 

My a weird twist of luck and a little subsequent detective work, months ago, I discover who she is. I stumbled across her ig page and she’s gorgeous. 

I continued liking her tweets that I genuinely found funny from my locked twitter account. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, while on a new year twitter break I see a follow request come up from her. At that point my timeline is empty my tweets auto delete after a week. 

I log on to twitter to check a news story and accept her request then send her a dm saying …”I’ve been following you for a while.  Love your sense of humor. I’m on a twitter break and my tweets delete automatically. Don’t want you to think I’m a bot or creep. Thanks for the follow and I’ll see you in a few weeks on the timeline. 

Since being back we’ve been exchanging music on the timeline. She sent me a music suggestion via dm and we’ve been going back and forth the last few days. She’s been putting me on to some great music.

I want to send her a dm saying I’d love to have a virtual coffee or drink date with her. I don’t want to come across as creepy either. 

I’m kinda old school. Social media is really just for jokes, music and nba highlights. I’ve never ‘approached’ a woman out the blue like this before.

So what say you…delete the pics off my phone and move on? Store them somewhere? Is there an app for uploading pics you aren’t ready to get rid of but don’t really want in your face as you try to move on with your life? I am sure I am a picture dummy…I just have like 7 years of pictures on my phone since the phones have so much storage these days. 😂",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67088,public,self,What do you do of photos with ex-partners?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/snnsq4/what_do_you_do_of_photos_with_expartners/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
