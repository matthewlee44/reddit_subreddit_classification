Just wanted to get advice and I guess opinions if I am doing the right thing ending it. 

Ok, so J is 38, lives alone, separated after a sexless marriage. I’m 44. His wife is newly diagnosed with high functioning autism and they have twins, also autistic. He gets along well with her but she gave him an ultimatum after she was seeing a sex therapist - she doesn’t ever want to have sex again. They separated and amicable. 

He is in AA, has been sober for 6 years. We had a coffee catch up a few weeks ago and have been talking for a bit over 2 months. We talk every day, he expressed how much he likes me. I like him. 

So today I went to his place. I need to travel overseas to help my mother recover from a surgery and I will be gone for 6-8 weeks. He knows all about it and we wanted to meet and get intimate before my trip. 

He took himself off the OLD app soon after we started talking and we agreed that we want something exclusive and beyond sex. So we met and the sex could have been good. But…

He went down on me for 10-15 minutes but I would have needed more time to cum. Not sure why, I was very much in the mood. Anyway, I went down on him and then we got into PIV which was good. He hasn’t had  sex in a year and I knew he wouldn’t last long. He did last a good 15 minutes still. I can only cum from oral. I figured since he was amazing at it, I don’t mind if he cums and then we can repeat and I can cum too. The whole experience was nice and sensual. Had better sex but wasn’t a lost cause. The height and body shape difference (he is slim and tall, I’m short and voluptuous) does bother me a bit but we seem attracted to each other. 

Then he had to call his kids at bath time (10 minutes, his kids weren’t chatty) and of course kids come first. Coincidentally my kid is autistic too, so I get it, he should call the kids in the usual time. I figured we could have a second rd after. 

He kept saying he had a wonderful time and sex with his asexual wife was nothing like this and how attractive he finds me. And he is not seeing anyone else and he wants to try to see me before I go or he will wait until I come back. He also can’t believe he came before me. When he said this the second time I said to him well I didn’t cum. He says yeah I noticed.

We chat a good chat, all dressed up. So I indicated we could go back, he says he needs to go do groceries, won’t have time for a second round. 

He saw me to the car, kissed me and we talked about chatting later and trying to meet again. 

I’m unsatisfied and I don’t understand the whole situation. I feel that I should just end it with him asap. He was nice and otherwise very sensual and wanted me to text him when I get home but I feel upset and thinking of just ending this. 

Any thoughts before I pull the trigger? Thanks

P.S. He must have done his groceries in a flash because he is messaging me. Also asked if we can chat while I’m overseas. (Of course we can.)

And now he told me he had a great afternoon and I almost did too…but…I have the equivalent of blue balls now 😔",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,60123,public,nsfw,End or mend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q9w9qa/end_or_mend/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,b50cbf0c-3935-11e9-a609-0e217b8f2048,Seeking Advice,,,,,,,,,,,,

I posted here when we broke up before and then tail between my legs, did not post when we got back together.

I did the shittiest thing because we broke up a month ago (I don’t go for this drama and this is the only relationship I’ve experienced it) and then got back together. Before that, we had broken up and I gave him several, for lack of a better term, ultimatums. 

I can be a bit of an offence collector, it can be hard for me to speak my mind. So I did think it fair to lay out these issues a few months ago, he still wanted to be together and so he knew what it required. 

There has been very little improvement, and very little acceptance about his role in things which I now see as a huge problem with people. His mom recently got very sick and this made two things come to light: he wasn’t handling well and was short with me and picking fights. I can’t live like that. I am also very good to him and his mom (and he has other family in the picture helping him) and would have continued to help but I couldn’t put up with him being angry and then using me as his “safe person” to direct it at. 

With his mother getting sick, I already knew, but it showed me how much he relies on her and how much his dad does and how that would be my lot in life. He wanted to have a bbq last week and he needed all these things to get ready that I had to run around and buy… keep in mind I work fulltime and have custody of my child. I have often said I would give him the money as he’s not working and could get things but he doesn’t like to go in stores 😭. I know this may sound like a petty complaint, but he basically demanded everyone bring food (his sister who has been helping with his mom made 3 salads at his demands) I had to give him money to put gas in his truck, help him slaughter an animal, make something, buy a tote, 8 bags or so of charcoal, ice, plates, napkins, cutlery… in several trips because he’s not very organized either.

He sort of expected me to make his life simpler and while he said thank you he seemed to think he was entitled to that help? 

He was on a benefits program which has run out and only periodically had money coming in, and seemed perfectly content to eat at my house all the time, or ask me for money. There was no plan to change anything, he wanted to live together (no way, wasn’t big on the idea in the first place). 

The night before last he was over and started complaining to me in my room that my son didn’t make him feel welcome. I explained that I would talk to him but that I did not want to fight. I also explained that sometimes I need alone time as well. He was irritated that we used to spend a lot more of our free time together… problem is all his time is free and mine is pretty much spent working my ass off. 

He left in a huff saying he wouldn’t come over when y son was here anymore and if I wanted to let my son run my life, that was fine as long as it didn’t impact him. From my perspective, things were pretty much over and I didn’t hear from him the next day until the evening when he expected to go to a party with me. I had gone by myself, I would have had to anyway as I was so mad at him at this point I couldn’t talk to him. 

He said a lot of hurtful things and accused me of being on a date. It was a party related to my work which he knew but he gets irrational in arguments. 

He had been low key arguing with me for a week, and I think he was sincerely trying to push me away in his depression. Anyway, we broke up. He told me I was a terrible person and I’m doing this because his mother is sick and I don’t want to deal with it (I’ve actually been visiting her a lot and took her for the day recently, so doesn’t make sense) and because our sex life took a dive (it had before this and I do understand when someone is stressed it can and we had talked about it). 

He did not, at all, agree with my theory that: we have never been that solid and have broken up a lot, most recently a month ago, but at least 4 times during the relationship, I want to help but I don’t want to be taken advantage of for my time, money, etc. I want to be able to go to his home (huge issue, didn’t realize he cleaned it before we met to impress me, that was short lived and it’s scary now, sidenote, he also won’t clean it for his son or to have his mom sometimes so I will never win there), and that he needs some sort of income. And finally I don’t want to be fighting, and giving me the silent treatment, or have him picking apart how my son acts, he’s on the spectrum and doing his best and actually likes the bf.

If you’ve read this far, sorry for the book. You may wonder how this happened and it was gradual. He cleaned his house before we met. He shoved a lot in his child’s room and the basement, places I didn’t go. As time went on the house filled up with more junk. I thought he owned his house and truck, later found his parents owned them. Later found he doesn’t pay them anything for it and so they totally pay those expenses. 

I thought he worked with his father, and with his farm. Later found out the farm costs a mint to run, and he only works with his father once in awhile, when he feels like it, and not often as they don’t get along. 

I was pretty far in at the point these things came to light, and he paid lip service to improving, but it never really happened.

I am now taking a break from dating until at least January. I had a fwb in the past that I can see to keep me from hitting the apps. I’m going to quit smoking and lose some weight (he smoked and didn’t eat well which I can’t blame him for me picking it up, but regardless I feel gross). I’m going to catch up on work, hang out with friends, and enjoy my alone time. And really think about why I let this relationship go on.

I do know our family backgrounds were very traumatic and there was the thought, probably, that I could fix him. I pitied him I guess. I also like to help people to the point I will exhaust myself and I have to put a stop to that. 

It’s also furthered my reserve that I never want to live with someone. I can very easily get codependent which is not healthy. And yes, he’s basically a hobosexual. 

So again I guess my question is if I’m the asshole for my timing… I don’t feel I really chose it as he’s the one that fought with me and didn’t communicate and then got aggressive. 

I feel very sad it ended this way as I am in communication with most of my exes, and I know he needs support right now.

I’m 49 and have been divorced 7 years, and I’ve dated extensively in that time, ranging from wild hookups to a couple of long term (2-2.5 year) relationships. Most of the time I’d say I have pretty good game, I don’t get clingy or overly attached, and I’m pretty fine with dating multiple people until something becomes serious.

But then every now and then I just “fall” for someone hard and get washed up in a sea of infatuation. It’s happened 3 times in the past, and it’s happening again now. So in terms of my dating ratios it’s not “often” but it happens from time to time.  And in all the previous times it’s ended badly, because I get obsessed with that person and become way too clingy, and/or they just weren’t feeling the same way or weren’t looking for a deeper commitment than the more casual dating we had leading up to it.

My question is how do I temper these feelings when they’re occurring? I know 100% that if any of these women had let things grow to a relationship, eventually these feelings would have subsided and then it would be normal relationship challenges. In the previous instances, no contact has always worked for me, and indeed I’ve been able to reconnect with 2 of them, and 1 of them I’ve formed a genuinely strong platonic friendship with. So I know I can do this, but this time I want to try and manage it while keeping the relationship going.

I’m also going to admit in all of these cases it’s been when I’m dating someone who I feel is out of my league looks wise. Well except one. But right now for sure that is the case, she’s genuinely dating down a few notches lol. It’s not that there isn’t anything else, we get along really well.

I wasn't sure if he would want to find someone else after a certain point in time but I always thought it was likely as he isn't very good at being alone. 

We have always gotten along but never really communicated about deep things. First time i saw him cry in 30 years was when mum passed. 

About 8 months ago (1.5 years after her death) he asked me how to send gift cards online. Instantly this was a red flag and after asking him about it he told me that it was to help out a woman who he had met online. After digging deeper it turns out someone added him on Instagram (he is very slow with technology and only really started learning after mum passed).

I tried to explain to him how scams work and never to send gift cards but he didn't wanna hear it insisting she was real. My sister got involved and her approach was a lot more direct and harsher than mine. 

After a while my sister managed to get a picture of her and reverse googled it to find it was someone from porn. Rather than believing he was scammed he believes she is that person and stopped talking to her because she didn't tell him she did porn.

He is on his fifth or sixth person/ scammer now, all with similar results. He sends them money, sister finds out they're fake images, he doesn't wanna believe it. Comes up with some story and blocks them before moving to the next one. 

I'm desperately trying to get him to stop adding random people and to try and find someone through a dating app or in person (hard with covid) but he just seems to brush me off every time. 

He also seems to want to find younger women. I'm not sure if this is because he is scared of potentially losing another companion and believes that he will outlive someone younger or if there is another reason for it but either way he won't open up enough to give me a reason. 

Does anyone have any sort of experience either from being the widow or knowing a widow going through something similar and have any advice on how to help him find someone and what to do if he doesn't want to find someone his age?

Flash forward to the wedding, and my aunts and some other family members could not stop talking about finding someone for me at the wedding. If any man was standing alone, one of my aunts would tell me to dance with him or talk to him - lots of these guys were there with dates. Even when the servers and busboys came to the table, my aunt would say something to them which was humiliating for me. Some of the servers were 19, 20. 

The dreaded bouquet toss, too...ugh. I was dragged onto the floor, despite saying I would not participate. 

Probably the worst moment was my dad saying he would be old and in a wheelchair by the time I get married. A joke, but one that stung.

And out of compassion to me?!I felt I don’t need pity from him, I want a real relationship but he said he’s not looking/ready for that because he’s still been working on himself…Still?!
Anyways, do you all think this hot and cold friendship needs to continue as I told my feeling towards him a couple month ago when we left his family home, I got emotional and cried.

I (41y) met an incredible woman (48y) who appeared to be the lady of my dreams.  No kids but ready to start a family.  Successful, beautiful, and musical.  

We spent the better part of this year learning about each other online, then finally met for an unforgettable week in Italy in September.  She even extended her visit by 2 days to spend more time with me.  After waiting so long, things had become official - we were an item.

So I thought. 

Not more than a week afterwards, when I ask to see her again, she accuses me of cheating and breaks up with me.  This hurts me deeply because I was entirely faithful and never deceived her.  

She claimed my behavior was suspicious during our trip, citing the fact I used her much nicer and newer iPhone to take photos of us.  I chose to not dare use my phone to take her photo because she is so private, has a “no photos” policy.     

I am still shocked.  I did everything right. We’ve had countless hours of talks and Zoom calls.  It was so easy to talk with her and be honest.  I thought we had built (at minimum) a friendship based on complete trust.

But in the end, I think she lied about trusting me.

I’ve (29F) been seeing a man (43y) for 3 months. He had literally just come out of a relationship when we met, so the timing wasn’t great (we met in real life, not online, so he wasn’t actively seeking a new relationship).

We really enjoy each other’s company, we have fun, we can talk openly and honestly to one another. It feels easy. The sexual chemistry is very much there too, which is important for both of us. 

It’s worth saying at this point that I was with my ex for 8 years and we met when I was 19. And although I’ve been dating since I split up with my ex, I have not met anyone I genuinely liked until I met this man. So, this is essentially the first time I’ve met someone I am interested in pursuing a relationship with, since I was a teenager. I don’t know how to manage my expectations, or what my expectations even are. 

When we were together this weekend he wanted to speak about us. He said he really likes me, we are “very compatible”, he loves being with me and wants to continue seeing me, but said his friends had expressed concerns about him meeting someone so soon after coming out of that relationship. They are extremely valid concerns and I had already expressed those concerns myself when we first met, so I am in no way surprised or offended by these comments. He was struggling to find the words to say what he wanted to say so I helped him “you want to carry on seeing me but with no commitment?” and he agreed, he “doesn’t want to answer to anyone.” He referred to a question I’d asked him recently, which was whether he had slept with any other women / would do so since he has met me. He said that he hasn’t and he doesn’t plan to, but he doesn’t want to feel as if he couldn’t, or have to answer to anyone if he was to do so. He also said it would hurt him if I slept with another man or went on a date with another man. He said let’s just see what happens over the next couple of months. 

I’m left feeling, if I’m honest, pretty upset. Although we’re not in a committed relationship I haven’t seen any other men since I met him and I certainly wouldn’t sleep with anyone else. I couldn’t continue to see him if he had been with another woman. My feelings are that if what you feel for someone is genuine, you wouldn’t be looking elsewhere. When I said that to him he said it really isn’t like that for men (can some men chime in on this?!) 

The conversation has left a bad taste in my mouth and I feel conflicted. I can’t help but feel like he couldn’t genuinely like me if that’s what he thinks. Part of me wants to protect myself and call it quits before I get hurt. The other part of me wants to take it as it comes and just enjoy it, because I do really like him.

Woke up with a sore throat today, got tested for covid. 
I’ll keep you posted as soon as I get my result back ok? X”

Yesterday I poured my frustration into words here and I didn’t say anything to him because I couldn’t find the right words. I’m very careful with my words and take my time to say/write things so I don’t inadvertently offend anyone. Btw Both him and I have ADD. 

I think this morning when I did respond to his morning text I might have been a bit colder than usual as I do feel unhappy. I guess I won’t break up with him after this msg, I need to focus on helping my mum recover in the next two months and maybe better “sexy time” can happen if he waits for me to return in December. I have no issues finding men, but I really need to like someone to get to even the coffee date level, that’s why it took me two months to meet him in person.

One thing I know, coming out of dead bedroom and a marriage with an unaffectionate ex, I won’t stay in a relationship with bad sex ever again. I love sex, I love spoiling my partner and I’m very open to experimenting as long as it’s consensual and legal. 

His text shows he knows there was something wrong, he came to the conclusion himself. 

And as for the responses, there was a lot of bitterness here. Obviously some people are very frustrated with dating (it’s not easy!) and behind the faceless profiles act like the Birds in the Hitchcock movie.

You get along great over text/OLD, have a lot in common, like each other's pics, then in person it's not the same.  Was there something you could put your finger on, or was it an overall feeling, or lack of feeling?

I had a date last weekend, we met on OLD.  All of the above, had a lot in common, had great conversations, etc.  He said he thought I was very attractive and loved my personality even more.  We talked every single day.  On the day of our meeting, he said he was nervous.  That evening, he picks me up and he was super quiet and things were kind of awkward.  I was very nervous too.  I can be shy, but with an outgoing person I feel fine, but with another quiet/shy person, then my shyness comes out more.  

When things were good and the conversation was good, I liked him, very nice, very polite.  But there were a lot of uncomfortable silences.  I also spent the majority of the date having no clue if he liked me or not.  Wasn't flirty at all and didn't touch me...not even like touching my arm when he talked like some people do.  It wasn't until literally in the last 5 minutes of the movie that he held my hand, and again on the way out to the car.  He did also ask during the movie if I wanted to do something the next day and I said yes.

We went back to my place and just watched tv/talked, but again, lots of uncomfortable silences.  He did eventually kiss me, but only when he thought I was sleeping because we both dozed off since it was getting late.

So after the first kiss, it led to more and we ended up having sex.  Please don't judge, I'm in my 40's, I never plan to have sex on the first date but if it happens it happens.  I've always thought the third date rule was dumb.  So anyway, afterward he finally goes home, it's really late.  I have a history lately of getting ghosted, so I asked him a few days prior to please just tell me if he wasn't feeling it.  

So the next day he texts me and says that he had fun the night before, but he wanted to be honest because I asked for that, and said he wasn't sure I was the one for him.   I wasn't too broken up by this, as I was having doubts that morning too.  I am over my ex enough to date, but being that this was my first date since him, I was feeling kind of blah and comparing everything to him.  How my first date with him was so easy, and how comfortable I was with him, etc.  So I kind of felt like things were pretty mutual about our feelings.

Then he asked if I would consider having sex again.  Before I met him, I was open to a FWB, and the sex was good so I figured why not.  So we hung out that day, and will again next weekend.  But in the days since, I've found myself confused again.  I am not sure what it is, maybe the fact that he doesn't want to date me has now made me want him...wanting what I can't have?  Or maybe I am just curious where a second date could have gone if we were more relaxed and not so nervous.  And I'm really confused how he could seem to like me so much all week over text, and then not be sure about me in person.  I mean, I guess it could just be a feeling....but I personally always have a pretty good idea if things will translate to in-person.  I'd say I've never been surprised, if I didn't really vibe online/over text, then it's the same in person.  And if we do hit it off online, it's always been a hit in person.  

I'm good with either, if he's just a FWB, or if down the road we end up dating.

And we formed somewhat of a friendship and I started to kind of like her and I thought since we’re both single I’d ask her out. I thought I’d test the waters first so I asked her if she’d be open to date someone a few years younger than her (she’s 9 years older than me) and she said age doesn’t matter as long as he’s 40+. So I took that as a green light and I asked her out. At first she gave me the “I’m flattered” and “surprised” but a few minutes later she told me she “doesn’t want to be in a relationship. Ever”. 
Instead of moving on I made the stupid decision to ask her why she isn’t interested, and she stopped replying. 
Yesterday on her podcast she briefly talked about “creepy men” and her wanting to be single and child-free for the rest of her life.

As a divorced mom for 20 years who dated rarely, and now for the last 7 as a ""single adult"" occasionally having first dates, I'm still not sure what I would want in a guy. I \_do\_ know that in an LTR, I want to build a life and grow a relationship. That means working through my weirdnesses and his quirks. The relationship I am in now ticks about 3 boxes that I though I had, but on paper is a hard pass on about 6 boxes, yet IRL is developing wonderfully as we work through issues and discoveries as they arise. THAT (as suggested in the other post) is more like an arranged marriage.

""Not My EX"" is a terrible, terrible metric... especially as there were naturally things about the EXes which attracted me. ""Into my hobbies"" -- this could be great, this could mean he takes over every space in my life. ""Has his own life"" -- do we get time together? It seems that I want a ton of initial attention and contact, but once I know that he is genuinely serious about developing a relationship with me, we can take a step back because I feel secure. Unfortunately, cultivating that barrage of intensity and then wanting to setting into a more livable pace seems to indicate that I have stopped liking him -- when in actuality, I like him and trust him more.

We are very compatible, and I see real long term potential. Our adult children all approve, and it's been a very easy relationship for the past year. It was a casual friendship for two years while we both finished raising our youngest children. 
In the past year, it has evolved to an understanding that I stay every weekend at his home, which he shares with a 19 year old daughter. 
I really love her and she has been welcoming and kind, and she is genuinely a great person.  Her and her father are two of the kindest people I've ever known. 
Here's where I turn into a potential asshole. I'm done raising kids. Two of my kids have finished college and my youngest is working and self supporting, although she's a year younger than my boyfriend's daughter. 
His daughter assumes she is invited on every trip or outing we take. We have altered plans to wait for her to get home from work, to ""not hurt her feelings"". She has few friends and works very part time and most of her classes are online. She has recently begun giving her opinion on what ""we"" should all do instead. She never leaves me out, and he's aware it's getting weird. 
I don't really want to deal with this at all. I don't want to be patient for the process of ""weaning"" her. I told him that she seems to be very needy again, and that he's going to have to be understanding that I am going to do the things we plan by myself if I have to.  I'm not in a position where I am willing to spend my precious days off waiting for a young adult to decide if she's joining us on our outings when she gets home from work. 
We don't live together, live an hour apart, and are both available to our adult children all week long. 
If she is not explicitly invited, she will pout and then in private sob about how lonely she is. I sympathize with them both, but I also spent my entire adult life up to this point raising children. I'm considering ending things because I'm not going to decide what is right for another person and their child. He's going to be really sad. He's been very good to me, and So will I. I'm just afraid my resentment will grow if I spend even a couple more years planning around a young adult and feeling guilty for reducing her access to her father.

First time posting here. 39F, soon to be 40 so maybe I qualify here? 

I was finally able to start dating after painful divorce... After being with same person for all of my life, it was very difficult to put myself in a dating scene with another person, but that's another story.. I've met 2 men around the same time, let's call them A and B. A wasn't quite the person I dreamed of being with.. very outgoing, loud-spoken, little goofy and little rude (he'll speak whatever that's in his mind). B is little more in line with what I thought was an ideal person.. more attractive appearance, articulate, polite/kind, etc.

When we first started dating, A made it clear that he wanted a 'casual' relationship. I asked what that means and he said we may date another person while seeing each other. He didn't want a committed relationship. With B, he was looking for more serious, long term relationship. They don't know about each other, and if I wanted to get more serious with B, I was going to stop seeing A. A lives closer to me than B, so naturally I got to meet A more.. But things were going ok with B as well.

Few weeks ago I moved to a new place. They both knew I was going to move. A asked me if I needed help but B never asked anything. I was using a mover so I told A I didn't need help. But he wanted to help anyway.. He came over and he helped A LOT. From cleaning the old apt to filling holes on the wall with putty.. to position furnitures at new place. It would have been very difficult by myself. Last week, he helped me assemble some stuff I bought from Ikea. After seeing him help me so much, now I'm getting emotionally drawn to him. B never asked to help. Also I found A to be more responsive with texts and messages.

I am not sure if I should tell A my feelings towards him. Or should I let go and continue with our current relationship and see what happens with B. Another thing to consider is that A is great in bed and after this emotional connection towards him, things got better.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,60245,public,self,Getting feelings towards 'casual' relationship partner.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qblq0x/getting_feelings_towards_casual_relationship/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tldr; Met a guy, who was so great but going through a divorce. He processed on me too much, so I broke up with him.  It sucked and then I cried (and posted).

SO...like a week after breaking up with Surfer Boy, and us both trying not to text each other but still doing it...  I finally just facetimed him (he lives 1.5 hrs away) and laid it all out. He listened to me ramble about all my worries and a fair amount of the things you guys brought up actually.  Then he goes, "".... can I tell you my interpretation now?""

He said he was not surprised I broke up with him because he processed on me too much. Actually, he was expecting it bc ""something had to give"" he said. ""Obviously we like each other a lot, what if we try just practicing better boundaries?"" We've always had these, from the very beginning, but they are relatively new-ish to both of us.  So we came up with a sort of processing / talking safe word. We started with ""I need to tap out"" as a way to say hey, I need a subject change, I can't hear what you're talking about anymore. It works great I think bc there's a balance. Sometimes I don't mind processing with him. Often, actually. But sometimes I'm just done hearing about her - or whatever.  So I tap out and he texts one of his lovely, supportive friends instead. Its SO GREAT.  We practice, we're not perfect, we talk about it and whatever other things come up that we need to as well. 

(Side note: It's morphed into ""uhh ok NEXT SONG"", which just makes me giggle. This is a nod to Tenacious D and ""One Note Song"" on their self titled album.  On our second date we ended up cuddling on the couch, that album came on and we both sang ""Fuck Her Gently"" in unison laughing our asses off the whole time, in part because we both knew all the lyrics. Adorable rom-com magic moment ensued... now we use it as a loving communication of boundaries. Neat.)

SO! Mostly the update is, we're back together, its still hard but also SO. FUCKING. AWESOME. He's stopped saying he's a bachelor, and now says things like ""my girlfriend"" and ""wow I got so fucking lucky, even though the timing was weird.""  He bought me a wetsuit as an early birthday present, and is teaching me how to surf. We have friends over for dinners, I met his men's - and intermural - softball team (yes he's on two lol).   Have I mentioned he's a hyper active husky surfer ball of energy?  We've gone to sports ball games as he's big on sports ball.  I'm not as much, but I love me a good day in the sun with beer, garlic fries, and yelling.  He's met my mom, sister and step dad - and LOVES them lol. Shit's aDORable.  

Meanwhile, my parents are taking bets on how long it will be until I move to his town. smh. 'Rents I tell you.

We far as the serious stuff, we're trying to take it slow and enjoy each other. We don't have any plans to move in together any time soon. He's still a bit of a mess. Honestly, I am too, for things in my own life.  He jokes ""you met me at a very interesting time in my life, Marla.""  lol I mean... Same.  He has to sell his condo, is a mess about it, is still in the middle (hopefully towards the end? Who knows) of his divorce. He also lost his job, which is stressful af. He's financially fine for a while, fortunately.  Is actively looking for a place and a new job. So I just... live my life, work on my own things, give him lots of hugs and the amount of support I can give without over doing it. We see each other about every weekend, switching off who goes where. One day at a time, but its.... a relationship. And its ours. And so far, its just so damn good.  I may be dating his potential, but it honestly?  It feels like potential that has an expiry date. Unknown maybe, but still HAS ONE. 

I hope that's enough real but also positive. Like I said, its not perfect. I try really hard to not stick too many expectations on it. Fantasies? Sure. Hopes and desires? Of course. But if it all actually falls to shit tomorrow, I say what I've continued to say: I've been through the fire a few times now, and I'm still not burned. So fuck it. Life is for living.

A few months ago the cleaning lady starts asking me if I’m single, and tells me she has another customer who is like me and that we need to meet. I’m thinking what do I have to lose! 

A few weeks later she introduced us via text, and we met for dinner. It went great! It’s been a few months now, lots of dates and is going well. 

The best part was when my daughter came home to visit and I told her I had been on a few dates. 

She asked me who it was and I said,”the cleaning lady” and paused. You can only imagine the look on her face and the relief after I finished “introduced me to someone really nice!” She started breathing again.

So after all the meaningless chats on OLD platforms, seems like on dating sites, people are only looking for pen pals, and most of em doesn't even know how to carry a conversation. 
 I matched with one particular younger women then me.13yrs difference. 45/32. At first I was off with the age for I never dated younger. But this is online and most likely,  she will fall under the category of pen pals or scam . Why not ..
We texted for a bit. Off n on. Found out she has a crazy working schedule.  Ok, I can dig it. It's life. We exchanged #s. She called me the next morning while she was on route to work.  Thought holy shit.. an actual call??!?! Things can be looking up. We talked about us... likes, future, what we wanted...
But after this first call, she keeps calling which I'm thrilled.  ( I'm I her thoughts!!!) 
But she only talks to me complaining about her job and certain employees. Once again,  maybe she has no one to Talk To.  I can be that guy.  That's what relationships are for.  But then our phone calls are mostly when she working, and I'm constantly just listening to her talk to her employees,  then back to me for a sec then back to her job. Thought it was weird just to call me just to have me basically on hold? 
I feel like I'm the only one expressing myself.. asked her to see her she said yes then last minute she said she was still stuck at work. Which that night she calls me while still working.  So ok not lying.
Just actually stuck If she just wants me to vent and saying whatever to keep my ears. Or if she is genuinely interested with the hectic schedule.

Hello my Dating friends! I'm in need of some ""test subjects"" for a project I'm currently working on - Life Coaching! I'm a 40-something formerly single mom with two teen daughters and I'm in the process of taking a certification course to become a transformational life coach. This type of coach is a trained professional who helps guide people into their ideal life and most authentic self, particularly when navigating moments of change. I'm especially interested in helping people navigate the choppy waters of dating as I was successful at my attempt and learned a lot throughout the process 🙂

Coaching isn't offering advice, it's partnering to help you make progress in your life, helping you breakthrough to realize your own inner potentials. It would be a weekly discussion first to get to know each other and then to work on some goals you may have around dating.

I'm offering to talk with you, for free, for as long as we need to reach a goal that you might have (or need to discover you have). If we develop the connection I would only ask that you be a reference for future opportunities. I sincerely want to help others and strongly believe in my capacity to do so. I can speak with you on the phone, via video chat or in person if you are in the vicinity of Brampton Ontario Canada.

If you are interested in helping me out, please send me a DM/PM and we'll figure out a time to discuss more and if it would be something right for us 🙂",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,60296,public,self,Free Dating Coaching - Help Me and Help You!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qc4p7j/free_dating_coaching_help_me_and_help_you/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,4e9677be-26b0-11e9-906a-0e545a99bb52,dark,,,,

First and foremost I'm a very happy and secure guy and have a great life with a lot of interests. I was however married to a woman who was very controlling and shared NO interests with me whatsoever, and would actually belittle my interests as not worthy. I will never ever be in that situation again. I've done too much work, and now love myself too much to ever put up with shit again.

We got talking about interests and bucket lists, and when I mentioned mine I could tell she was less than enthused. 
I own and am restoring a classic Japanese sports car, and told her I was a JDM enthusiast, and she said ""cars are a waste of time, and money and would have problems with her guy spending money on a car"" I also told her I collect vintage horror comic books from the 60s and 70s, and am a horror movies buff. She said "" comics are for kids"" and she doesnt like horror movies at all. 
I find her attractive, and shes smart, but I'm not sure I can be with someone who is already laying down the ""interest laws and permissions""

Anyway I thought it gone be right move if I pretended that I asked her this way I can figure out if he really like her , so I did it I told him that I asked her and she said no bc she have crush on someone else. Forget to mention he asked for her Instagram and Snapchat before I told him that she doesn’t want have 3some with us . So he start talking with her and she called me in the same exact min telling me that he start texting her. 4 months later she texted me : she said I should be honest with her and if I want smth from her to tell her in the face not to tell someone else. 
I was shocked I didn’t know what she’s talking about so I asked her and she said that my bf was talking with her for the last 5 months asking her for 3some with us and telling her that I’m shy to ask her . 
At this point I was a bit mad , I was about to talk with him when she said no stop let me talk with him first and she told him that she agreed about the 3some shit . they start talking and she asked him wdu like about me he said I’m wondering how your butt looks like?!!! That’s what she told me so I got so mad I start talking with him and he was acting like he doesn’t know shit and he just ask her once 5monthes ago and she agreed today he called me dramatic and he texted her : i see you’re starting the drama . 
2 days after everything was okay we opened a new page he didn’t admit anything but I thought that everyone deserve second chance. Everything was perfect until I met her yesterday and she told me that he texted her agin : are you mad at my gf? And after that he told her : I want tell  smth when i see you next time.

I was mad and I asked him to stop talking to her bc it’s so weird. His reaction was wtf ? What are you talking about.(I ignored him)
And after 2h he replied to an old text it was 3days ago .
I was so mad so I told him that we should talk. We start talking and he told me that my friend is jealous and she just want ruin our relationship and I should choose him or her.

We don't live together, her ex husband and father of her 2 kids passed away a decade ago. Her mom passed about the same time so she has little family support. I have have one daughter who's 12. We live about 45 minutes apart and work stressful professional jobs (but I have way more flexibility on when and where I am) so don't see each other a lot but she's also really bad at planning and putting forth effort to get together and has high anxiety (she'll avoid taking action on something) so we don't see each other very often anymore. Pre-COVID we saw each other 2-3x a week and we've traveled extensively together domestically/internationally but not been anywhere together in more than 2 years or actually even spent the night together in that time - her youngest is young enough that she needs a babysitter and COVID has been a challenge here. We have a 3 day road trip planned next month that I'm already anticipating will get cancelled by her because she didn't make arrangements in advance and she also just accepted a new role within her company.

If we didn't have to work/pay bills and could spend our time how we like it, she would be my person (I adore everything about her) but in our current situation the relationship brings me down. I've talked to her about it and she said its not personal. It's not as if she's out with friends or other people often and is shunning me specifically. We both agreed early on that we'd never get married/live together and subject our children to step-parents. When the kids move away we've talked about sharing a place but that's 8-10 years away probably.

I kind of feel like we're nearing the end of our relationship because I feel like a hassle to her - being the one to initiate seeing each other kind of breaks my heart a little and its one more thing she has to manage in her life. Also getting together about once a month makes me sadder than being alone. I think I've leaned into her more since the pandemic and she's just doing what she can to keep her head above water with her work, kids, life. She's talked about getting therapy but hasn't pulled the trigger except for her youngest who has some behavioral issues. 

**Am I being unrealistic in my expectations? Anyone else feel like with all the responsibilities in our 40s that this is as good as it gets and I should be happy with what I have?** I don't want to break off a great connection because I am pining for the good old days that have yet to return. 

Any advice/thoughts are appreciated. Note: I posted here because I think there are unique circumstances specifically to being in our 40s that u/Relationships and u/Relationshipadvice don't really take into consideration.

Not that long ago, I met someone through a mutual friend who lives rather far away. We were all traveling at the time and met on that trip. I live in Vermont and she lives in North Carolina, so it's a plane ride to get to each other. 

We sort of hit it off when we met and we exchanged numbers. Lots of texting ensued and she asked if I would have any interest in coming down to see her. I said that I definitely would. I am not overflowing with money to burn, but I do OK and can afford to travel if there is value added to the experience. Based on our conversations, we had a lot in common and were really getting along well so I definitely felt like this was worth it even though it was difficult to find the time to get away from work but I made the time to go down for two days. 

So, I bought the ticket, got the hotel, rental car, etc. and went down to see her. The first day, everything went great. We got along really well, had a wonderful day together, and went back to our respective sleeping arrangements. She had some things to do with her family the next morning, but we had plans to meet up in the afternoon. We went on a hike, took a long scenic drive, everything was still great. We went to dinner together and right in the middle of our first drink she got a text from someone she used to work with. (I know this wasn't made up as any excuse to leave as she wasn't hiding her phone and I could see that the conversation was actually happening.) 

She very abruptly said she needed to go pick this person up at the airport and needed to leave. I asked why and she said that the person who was supposed to pick up her former coworker had been drinking and couldn't drive to get them anymore. I asked why this person couldn't get a cab or an Uber/Lyft and she said that there was a shortage of them and there was often a long wait. So, she said she had to go to pick up this person.

At this point, I was visibly disappointed and she got very angry with me. While I will communicate my feelings, I don't really like outright confrontation and I tend to shut down a little when someone gets angry with me. I asked her to drive me back to my hotel. I told her that if she had gone through the effort to come fly to see me and we only had two days together that the only thing that would get me to cut our dinner together short would be either if my kids needed me (she also has kids and I would have had zero issue if it was one of her kids calling) or it was an absolute emergency. I didn't consider a friend needing a ride from the airport when we live in the age of rental cars, cabs, and Ubers to be an emergency and I felt suddenly very undervalued. I expressed this in a calm but disappointed tone. She again got very angry and went on a rant about, ""what did you expect? Did you come down here expecting I'd just jump in bed with you?"" I replied that my disappointment had nothing to do with sex, that I didn't need to fly to NC to find someone to have sex with, and that I had zero expectations or assumptions about where the night was heading and didn't assume in any way that we would be having sex and that I was completely fine with us not (which was all 100 percent true; I had completely assumed we would *not* be having sext that night). I said that the only thing I expected from her that night was her time and attention and I was really disappointed to not be able to continue to spend the time we had expected together to continue to get to know her. 

I won't get into the details of her behavior after this as my point in this isn't to criticize this anonymous woman but to get some sense of a reality check from others out there. How would you have responded in a similar situation? Was I being overly demanding? Is a friend asking for a ride from the airport a reasonable reason to break off a date that someone has traveled a thousand miles for?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,60375,public,self,Need a Reality Check,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qd1lvo/need_a_reality_check/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
