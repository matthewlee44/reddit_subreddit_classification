I wanted some advice from Chinese males and female. 

Background: I met this amazing girl on a dating app called Hinge. She is aged 31, we live fairly close to each other and we have been on 8 dates over the course of 6 weeks. 

Our dates have been going to dinner, meeting some of my friends, playing couples badminton, KTV. We have. It been to each others houses and we have not kissed yet. We have hugged and I was holding her/her resting in my arms during KTV. 

Indicators of interest: she is a very kind hearted and thoughtful girl. She messages to check I get home ok, asks me to confirm when I get home and she bought me a cake after she went out with some friends (I didn‚Äôt ask or suggest this, did it on her own accord) after KTV I booked us a cab home and she voluntarily hugged me as we parted ways and thanked me for a great night out. 

We don‚Äôt text everyday, she is very busy at work and I think texting too much is a bit annoying for me. We mainly use texting for arranging dates with some chit chat but nothing extensive like what have you eaten etc. I have sometimes used some hidden flirting and jokes which I think get lost in translation. She came to the Uk when she was about 16 and by the messages she sends. I can tell she is not as well versed in British sarcasm/wit as me (I am a British Chinese, she is from mainland China but has been here since 16. 

I would say that she is very sweet, conservative and dresses very feminine ie not showing basically all her skin. 

Advice sought: I‚Äôve not included all details so feel free to asl anything that I may have missed - Since we have not held hands yet or kissed yet I wanted you guys to assess whether I am in a good position to ask her to be my girlfriend. Is it normal for early stage dating in China to be slower. I am at an age where I am looking to settle down and I think she may be the one ‚òùüèª. 

It would also be useful on what people from/experience of dating in China see as an average dating timeline from date 1 to marriage. I am personally comfortable with her level of interest and happy to take out time. I am 33 and she is 31. 

It sounds silly but I have also looked at out love compatibility (dragon and horse) and it looks promising. 

I am also not sure how to bring up the topic of asking her to be my girlfriend. I don‚Äôt believe in this: let‚Äôs go exclusive thing, after date 2 I basically stopped going out on dates to focus on her and cut off all other contact with other girls. 

Also feel free to ask me questions on how I feel and anything she may factor in for considering me as a husband.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128038,public,self,Dating Chinese girl 30+,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy4dl2/dating_chinese_girl_30/,no_ads,0,

We both weren't aware of that. I was mortified that that happened, especially since I liked the guy I was dating.

He reached out a few days later with a passive aggresive text to let me know he knows everything. I apologized and he acted like everything is fine and like he isn't hurt at all. I was a mess after that for a whole month but decided that its best to just let it go and move on from that messy situation.

At first he was kinda mad about everything but eventually accepted my apology and said he doesn't want ti listen about it anymore. An hour later we started kissing and said we missed eachother.

I recently matched with this tattooed up fitness model, she was pretty hot and was looking for a relationship.

She started telling me she usually hooks up pretty quickly but she was over it so I told her that I wasn't expecting anything from the first date. 

Anyway, a few days later she said she had a long day and could use some company. I told her I could come over and she told me to hurry up but she just wanted to hang out. I got to her place and she looked exactly like her pics. We were talking for a while and then she teased me about how shy I was and told me she usually dates guy's that are more up front and possessive etc... so eventually she tells me if I wanted something to happen I had to make a move. So I go in to kiss her and we make out for a bit. After a while she looks at me and says, I don't want to be that girl again so I'm not going to have sex with you tonight. No problem for me, I wasn't expecting it anyway. So we make out some more, she keeps telling me how she wants a guy to just take her, choke her and fuck her and next time we meet up she wants me to do that. 

It's getting late and I'm about to leave, she grabbed my dick as we're saying goodbye and I'm pretty hard. She smiles and tells me she wants to at least have a look before next time. She unzips my pants pulls out my dick and strokes it, she smiles again and just says ""nice"". Then I head home. We message each other and she said she had a good night and was looking forward to dinner later in the week.

There‚Äôs a girl I‚Äôm talking with; we‚Äôve been talking for a couple weeks and went on a date. 

Honestly the date was a blast and she told me she‚Äôs never had that much fun on a date. She also mentioned that she wants to see where things go between us , she even asked me if we can go on a second date soon and even told me I‚Äôm the only guy she‚Äôs talking to (which was nice to know even tho I didn‚Äôt ask)

The only issue is that she‚Äôs an awful texter and most days I‚Äôll barely hear from her. 

Example: you can send a good morning messages and she‚Äôll replied for a couple minutes then you maybe will hear back from her that night. Which then she‚Äôll text dry (short answers, one word replies) But she‚Äôll love to FaceTime and when we do then she‚Äôll be super communicative and we‚Äôll be FaceTiming for house. Which confused me 

I totally get that we all have our own lives, which is totally fine and I don‚Äôt need constant contact (we‚Äôre all adults) but when you ask her about her day she‚Äôll tell you that she didn‚Äôt have anything to do or wasn‚Äôt busy at all or just got bored so she hung out with a friend‚Ä¶.so if you openly say you‚Äôr bored and not busy then maybe saying hi would be nice just to hear that you‚Äôre doing well or I‚Äôm on your mind  lol

If I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs constantly approaching or trying to talk to you then It makes me feel like you‚Äôre not interested (so I‚Äôm considering just not texting anymore)‚Ä¶.but she loves to FaceTime so then if we FaceTime or meet in person then she‚Äôs super attentive and wants to talk for hours 

I don‚Äôt wanna say anything bc I also don‚Äôt wanna look like I‚Äôm being needy. I don‚Äôt require constant contact bc I run 2 business but I‚Äôm also under the general belief that if you‚Äôre interested in someone or say that you are then you‚Äôd want to talk to them often to connect 

Any constructive or positive advice ?

So after a pretty awesome date, I was a bit baffled when he was way less responsive to texts afterwards, which a friend of mine agreed with when I showed her some screenshots. We'd agreed before the date that we had good enough chemistry that if the date didn't work out, we would say so honestly and would probably stay friends, but it was clear that the date did go well. Since we had to cancel the original second date (that he suggested) because someone at his workplace got COVID and he had to wait for his PCR test results, I thought that maybe in hindsight he just wasn't interested anymore and didn't want to tell me. I'd worked myself up talking to people about it, and decided to treat the date as a fluke and assume I won't hear from him again for my own sanity, though it was hard to make the mental shift. After all ""if he wanted to, he would"" is like the go-to mantra for modern dating, in a sense (not that I didn't message him or initiate, mind you, he just became more passive and replied way slower). 

So the date was on Sunday, and on Wednesday he texts me that he got his negative test results back. However, despite me jokingly implying before that I'd like for him to ask me out on the second date (considering he's the one who had to cancel the original second date), he didn't actually ask. So I again just took a step back and waited to see what he does, deciding that if I don't hear from him by Friday I would say something and express my confusion at the change in his behavior directly. 

The next day (two days ago), he texted me asking when we're meeting again. So I asked when he was free (since I realized it was possible he'd just been busy the past week), and told him I'd been waiting for him to say something. He apologized and said that he knew his week would be busy and wasn't sure about asking, but he suggested a different date the next week, which worked out. So once that was settled, I asked if I could be honest with him. He said sure, and I told him pretty directly how I felt, but not in a confrontational way - just that I was confused by the lack of communication and wasn't sure if he was still interested, and that I would appreciate more regular check-ins - even a ""good morning"" or something of that nature would work if that's all he has time for. He said he understood why I could feel this way and said that was fine with him. I asked him if he'd also like me to do that on my end, and he said he's okay with sporadic texting. So we agreed we have slightly different communication styles, but nothing we can't work around. I told him I appreciated him taking it well, and he said that's the least he could do. 

We talked more on Thursday and less yesterday, but I still heard from him, and when I texted the night before that I was going to a party and was pretty drunk, he texted today saying he hoped I'd gotten home safe. He's been slow to reply again today, but I think overall, considering I've only known him for two weeks, this isn't too bad in terms of progress. I think I'll be able to tell in person if anything has changed on his end, or if it was honestly just a busy week, but I'm just proud of myself for being direct early on. I don't want to play games or waste either of our times. Hopefully the second date goes well - the current plan is sex, food, board games and maybe some weed.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128078,public,self,Communication is pretty good - even early on,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy8eq9/communication_is_pretty_good_even_early_on/,no_ads,0,

In the days leading up to the walk we did not exchange a lot of messages, because we're both pretty straight forward to get to know people in real life.

Yesterday went well in my opinion, we are quite similar in our views, and have the same sense of humor. There was one situation where we talked about a certain topic, and I told her I had to look up a fact and tell her next time (subconsciously implying there will be second date), which she happily agreed to.

We are from different cities, about a two hour drive apart.

I was in her city by chance because of a familiy meeting, hence the walk yesterday. She is currently finishing her master's thesis, which is due next Wednesday. Additionally, from Monday on there is a 10 day COVID lockdown again, an information that reached us just before the date.

She was planning on going to my city with two friends after her thesis submission, and suggested that we can meet there. This was before we knew about the lockdown. At the end of the walk she told me that, with the lockdown, she is not sure if her friends are actually going now.

Therefore we agreed to stay in contact and see how things play out. Earlier, when we talked about the pandemic in general, she explained that she has taken the previous lockdowns very seriously, only meeting two defined people, and not even her friends.

Now, I am not sure if this is the end already, or if it is just a matter of waiting out the lockdown (and her finishing the thesis). I know from experience that the last days before a submission date are critical and important, so I don't want to take her focus off her thesis.

Essentially, they progress through stages:   
\- Meet-Cute  
\- Evaluating each other/building mutual interest  
\- One-one date    
\- Evaluate the date  
\- Escalation to the type of relationship you will have   
So, from the Mute-Cute stage to the Escalation of relationship, is what I would consider the ""cautionary phase"". During this phase is where most people mess up or disqualify themselves from their potential partner. It is also during this phrase where both parties need to be hyper vigilant of red flags and try and avoid a miserable break up in 6 months. Or, god forbid, a messy divorce in 7 years. Here are some common mistakes people make...I am coming up with this list from personal experience...  
**Common Mistakes During the Cautionary Phase:**   
\- Oversharing information  
\- Inappropriate communication levels  
\- Not paying attention to the other person  
\- Moving too fast/too slow  
**Oversharing Information:**   
I have a theory that I like to call ""The Relationship Equity Theory"" (fancy title, I know). Essentially, the person needs to like you enough to where you're gross, ugly or bad habits are less important than the value you bring to the relationship BEFORE you tell the other person about them.   
\*\*Disclaimer, I do not mean abusive behaviors or generally ""red flags""\*\*  
For example, I have been trying for years to get my feet to stop smelling. I work in an industry where I am always walking around and outside so my feet get wet, and to be frank, sometimes they stink something awful. So, I really want to make sure a woman likes me before she realizes that sometimes my feet smell HORRIBLE. So, before we meet for the first time, I like to take a shower, spray my shoes with odorizer or whatever. Hopefully we get to date 3 or 4 before I have a really stinky foot day...  
Anyway, the general idea here is that you need to have a good presentation and build some relationship equity before you introduce the potential negative things and quirks about you. When you are in the cautionary phase of the relationship the person is still getting to know you. Maybe on the first date you are super nervous and sweaty...and take off your shoe for a second to tie them and the whole room smells it...Why would she want to date you? You're nervous AND your feet smell.   
**Inappropriate Communication:**   
People have a tendency to over communicate in the beginning. People also have a tendency to under communicate in the beginning.   
In my experience the amount and level of communication depends on the person and the situation. I have had relationships where we text/message all day and I have had relationships where we just don't talk during the day. Both situations where fine by me. The important thing here is communicate like you would in a relationship. For example don't go from never using your phone to communicating 10 hours a day on it. Communicate in a way that is natural feeling for you and that keeps the conversation going without it becoming one sided.   
**Not Paying Attention to the Other Person**  
People will tell you what they want and what they are thinking, and you really need to be paying attention to the other person when starting a relationship. They will express what they are comfortable with and what they are not comfortable with. During the cautionary period you should behave like a professor. Study the person, watch their body language and learn about them and evaluate them as a partner. Not only will this help you develop a better bond with them, it'll also allow you to figure out if this is the type of person you want to spend time with.   
Watch for things like personality quirks (like outgoing vs not outgoing), are they clean and tidy, etc. Basically figure out if you could bear spending extending periods of time with them. Someone can be hot and that is fine, but if they are a terrible person to be around avoid that one if you are looking for a relationship.   
**Moving Too Fast or Too Slow**  
Everyone has different comfort levels and figuring out when to move to the next step with the person will depend on how well you pay attention to them. If the person is dropping hints they want to go on a date, you need to initiate immediately. If you wait too long the iron can cool off and you'll lose the opportunity. On the flip side, if you ask for a date too quickly before they are comfortable, you'll get shot down and lose the opportunity.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128100,public,self,Tips for dating for personal experience,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyawbl/tips_for_dating_for_personal_experience/,no_ads,0,

He‚Äôs a couple years younger than me, and we had been friends prior to dating. 
He started a rigorous athletic schedule (2 practices a day, lift once a day, study hall, and his classes). Granted, I also have an insanely busy life in grad school and being a manager of my building.

However, I felt like he was starting to ghost me little by little, and I missed how things used to be in the beginning. He pursued me first, admitting he‚Äôs liked me for 5+ years. We used to hang out and go on dates every single day over the summer. He assured me everything would be back to normal once we were together in-person again, and that he was ‚Äújust busy‚Äù and not ghosting me.

I held off breaking up with him, because of these words of assurance, but he kept not answering me, but still viewed my snapchat story and would update his own‚Ä¶ which I called him out for, and I received no clear explanation for this. My breaking point was, one day, I texted him ‚Äúgood morning,‚Äù and he wouldn‚Äôt respond and kept updating his story about fixing his beloved cars. When I questioned this, he disrespected me over text saying, ‚Äúyou knew i was fucking working on my cars today..‚Äù

I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit this, but then I broke things off over text, and removed him from everything except text/call. I did assure him he could always call/text if he really needed me, to which I haven‚Äôt heard from him. Lately, I‚Äôve been missing him a lot and going through a tough time, and I miss our friendship, and I want to know how he‚Äôs doing and if he‚Äôs okay, because I know he was going through a lot adjusting to his new life at school. Is it toxic of me if I called/texted him, and said I wanted to be friends again? I know I broke things off, but I felt it was the only way at the time. I tried to make things work so many times, and he would change for a week and then go back to his weird behavior.

So I get to her house and when she opened the door I was surprised because she was honestly hotter in person than she was in her pictures. I tried to give her a hug to show her I was attracted to her but I don‚Äôt think she noticed and walked me towards her room. 

When I got to her room she started talking to me about all the stuff she collects but I was genuinely interested. There was definitely a connection because I was making her laugh a lot. There were a few times where she put her hand on my leg and I‚Äôm pretty sure she bent over deliberately while she was turning on her computer under her desk so that her butt touched my foot but I didn‚Äôt really know how to react. I was really attracted to her but I didn‚Äôt want to ask if she wanted to hook up because I liked talking to her too. 

At one point, she was clearly snap chatting one of her girl friends about how it was going who asked ‚Äúare you having fun and drinking tequila?‚Äù and Im pretty she turned her back in her chair so that I could she‚Äôs what she was typing, and I saw ‚Äú no fun, ‚Äú but I couldn‚Äôt tell whether she said ‚Äúfortunately‚Äù or ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äù.

At about 1:30am she asked me if I wanted to hang out the next day (today) because she wanted to go to bed. I said okay and I ended up hugging her in the way out but really wanted to kiss her.

Trust me, it's insane.

My ex (20F) and I (21M) had a fun 2 year relationship. We were extremely close and I was always good to her. On my 20th, she threw me a romantic date for us and told me that she couldn't wait for me us to hit the bars next year. Every weekend, we'd hit up every party together counting down the days. But over time, she lost my trust because she'd start comparing me with other guys.

Right before my 21st birthday (late Oct), all of our friends (including her and I) had bought sexy couple Halloween costumes for this huge party. She looks at me and suddenly says that she wants to be on break because she had a thought about another guy. I told her that jumping ship over a guy you don't know was so stupid. I didn't want to, but I dumped her stating that those guys wouldn't treat her as well.

I ended going to the party by myself since my friends were out on dates with their girlfriends. Every person at the party had sang Happy Birthday to me but I felt incomplete because I never got to see her in the outfit. I was in a Hugh Hefner costume that night and everyone kept asking me where my  playboy bunny was. The only thing that was on my mind was the thought that she was probably getting railed by another guy in that outfit. I just lost it and apparently blacked out at the party.

A month later, her and I ran into each other at a mutual friend's party. Once everyone left, she said that a part of her wanted to get back together when we were on a break and that she was sorry for pushing me away.

She starts crying loudly, saying that guys rarely approach her or just use her for sex and that she missed being intimate with someone. I secretly wanted that back too because Tinder sucks. The old me came out and ended up comforting her. I regret doing that. Idk why I did.

Once the party was over, she asked to come sleep over to my dorm. I paused, but then I agreed to it because it had been awhile since I had slept with her. When she got in the bed with me, we cuddled  but didn't she initiate anything sexual. I was going to try to seduce her, but I realised that If she wanted sex, she would've made it obvious. This made all of those repressed feeling come back and she then said that she was sorry for leading me on. I was confused.

She invites me to her apartment and suggests we cook dinner together. But, after dinner, something in me clicked. I realised  that after this encounter, we'd be distant from each other. So, what was the point of all that? My emotions just began to leak out all of the sudden and I confronted her.

My buddy stops by and I just broke down telling them that I felt sad &amp; angry at myself for not doing enough/changing in the relationship and that perhaps she would've stayed longer. He tells me that it was on her but I felt  dumb for pushing her away.

Third date: I walked her to her door, and her neighbors were out. She said ""Do you have to use the bathroom,"" and me being an idiot, the sign went right over my head. I said 'no I don't.' She then just rolled her eyes and pecked quickly.

Forth date: There was a lot of excitement going into this date with a shit ton of texting. We went on this walk, and I kissed her for 5 seconds (we used tongue), but then my body pulled back on it's own). We later had dinner, and I wanted to make out when I dropped her off at her car, but she just pecked and told me ""She's having fun, and will meet up again next week.""

Next week comes around, and then she breaks it off.

We otherwise got along great. You know the type of person who you immediately click and laugh with. I think me not escalting things physically is what made her feel like it wasn't going anywhere. I essentially friendzoned my self since I didn't make moves.

I have erectile dysfunction since I was younger, and I think that screwed up my sexual confidence with making moves.

Hopefully, someone can relate or have some type of insight on the situation and a solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I am prone to attracting broken men, or broken people in general to be honest. I'm a female and I've dated enough people to realize a pattern, most of them are ""broken"" and need some kind of ""fixing"". Unfortunately, I naturally have a fixer complex, so when these people would come into my life, I would jump at the opportunity to ""heal"" them in any way, shape, or form. As I'm growing, I'm growing to be tired of this. It's not that I don't like helping people, but I just want for once in my life to have some kind of connection with somewhat has their life together. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to relationships, they're not really a need for me. I'm quite independent in nature. I'm not a serial dater; I'm not opposed to relationships, but I don't actively go and look for them in most instances. When I'm not in a relationship, I've realized the dudes that I'm naturally attracted to tend to match my ""physical type"", they tend to be intelligent, ambitious, more on the realistic side, **masculine (Usually bordering toxic masculinity, having some type of emotional problems).** Usually, these men have anger issues, are emotionally unavailable, non-commital, just every red flag in the book, and yet I'm still attracted to them. I never pursue them for the sake of my health and sanity, but I'm naturally attracted to them and I don't know why. I try not to go for what I want, but what I might need. The men that I usually attract and end up with (because I really do try to keep an open mind) **usually don't match my ""physical type"" at all, have an inferiority complex, not as realistic when it comes to ambitions and life in general, so they typically tend to be the opposite of what society deems as acceptable for a masculine male.** They're usually more tapped into their feminine side. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my problem comes in when I don't really how to reconcile with my reality. I'm very self-aware most of the time. I know it's unhealthy to have these thoughts, but I'm not really sure how I can fix them or cope with them. It comes from my childhood where I had to be a caregiver to many people at a young age and mainly cared for myself in a lot of ways. I do lean towards my masculine energy naturally as society would deem, and I go after more ""masculine"" males because they tend to be able to take care of themselves. I don't need anyone to take care of me, I just don't want to be in a relationship where I constantly have to take care of them and teach them, which I guess maybe the whole point of a relationship? I just prefer an interdependent relationship rather than a co-dependent one, and the men that I usually attract tend to be co-dependent. 

&amp;#x200B;

This topic serves as important to me because I'm currently in a relationship with a guy who's less masculine than usual and is very dependent upon me emotionally. We've been together for 7 months, and I've stayed with him so long because he gets better and works on his faults as do I. He does have a lot of positive traits. He's very emotionally available, he's very attentive, he listens, he's family-oriented, very loyal. Drawbacks as I've mentioned: he's usually very dependent, not confident at all. lack ambition most of the time. We're on a break right now as I needed time away to come back to myself and heal any of my personal problems that need to be fixed, and it's given me time to really think about myself, and then our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I want to be, sometimes I'm just not that attracted to him and I think that's because of his characteristics. I know he's not the problem in most cases. I know that there's something wrong with me and I'm the problem. I'm not super future-oriented, especially when it comes to love, but when I'm really into it, there are times that I could picture him in my future. He's not a bad person, I just see him as rather a bit immature I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm wasting his time, I don't know if there's something I can do to fix myself and stop these feelings and thoughts. I'm hoping someone has some type of insight.

What is more, this post is not going to be full of hate or resent towarss women. It's more like a venting or rant. Since I don't know any other places, which I could post this stuff on. 

The reason why I'm writing this post is literally my dating situation. And before we properly start, I just want you to briefly understand my situation. 24 years old athlete here (yes, I do play sports for living right now), been told that I'm good looking and all that stuff. What is more, I actually do believe that I'm not bad looking at all. It's my attitude that it's killing me.

Whenever I start talking to a girl, I never rush/act desperate and get sexual quickly. I would even say that I tend to be very humble with people around me. Why? Because I want them to be happy and feel comfortable aeound me. However, it just seems to kill my all chances with ladies.

Yes, I do get good ammount of matches on OLD and I do receive attention from opposite sex in daily life. However, because of my comnunication style, I never seem to actually get close to the girl. What is more, what always tends to happen, the girl would always end up with a typical ""alpha"" guy or jus a ""bad boy type"" of dude. And the issue is that the dude would effortlessly attract her, while I would need to work super hard, while talking and courting her. And I just don't seem to understan that. 

It seems super crazy that someone who doesn't care about the girl, can attract her so easily. While I never have any of that ""easy life"" happening to me. Listen, Im not trying to judge girls for preffering someone else. It's their life and their choices. However, it just kills me that I always need to put A LOT OF EFFORT into courting the girl, while some random douche can just get her effortleslly. That's literally the reason why Im sooo frustrated.

I have some female friends that I met through mutuals, classes, and my ex gf.

It slowed down around Covid but has been picking up again. Mostly Europe and Asia. I had no intention at all of dating but it happened so easily and naturally, it was a culture shock of sorts! 

I always felt there was something wrong with me, something I needed to improve but I had no idea what.  I'm tall, fairly good looking, fit and dress professionally, I'm not a player and I treat women respectfully. I like to do fun &amp; spontaneous things on dates. Still.. I always felt invisible or undesirable. Dates felt like job interviews, like I was being grilled to pass some sort of criteria and I have been ghosted many times for no apparent reason. I tried online dating and it's the horror show everyone says it is. 

So I started traveling and had no intention to date at all. It just easily and organically happened! I had this ""A-Ha moment"" like when something you were struggling with suddenly becomes easy and you feel competent at it. It is what I imagined dating would be like when I was teenager and you are contemplating it for the first time. 

It is not just dating. I made some new friends, both male &amp; female, including a lovely couple that invited me to their home for dinner when we were discussing the local food scene at an outdoor market! 

So, it really only makes things more frustrating because I live in the states and not interested in a long distance relationship. It's hard to get motivated to keep trying here when you experience how natural and easy it can be there.
