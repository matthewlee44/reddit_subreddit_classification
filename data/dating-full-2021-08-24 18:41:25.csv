I've been talking to this girl for a month. We've been on two dates. Whenever we talk on the phone or interact in person, my brain feels certain this is someone that actually likes me.  She would project into the future, remember things that we talked about, hint she wants more investment, complain about things I did or didn’t do etc.  

However, the moments in between calling and dates, when we have to text, everything points to her being barely interested. This is because she often takes 24 - 48 hrs to respond to messages. To be fair, whenever she does reply, the reply is never half-arsed.

It's hard for me to believe she is as interested as she seems when calling and on dates when she leaves me hanging for a long time. This is especially since I don't even text to have conversations, I just text to ask if shes free to call or hang, so its mostly just yes/no answers I'm looking for. If anything, she's the one that actually sometimes initiates texting to 'share thoughts' like you would in a conversation. Even then, she would also take 24 - 48 hrs to reply after I reply to her initial message.

I’m 29 and used dating apps seriously for about 2 years. While yes I was able to have a couple dates, 90% of that time was an absolute colossal waste of time. 

Besides the all the obvious ghostings, people never responding in a timely manner or ever following through, what hurt me the most was the loss of confidence. Knowing that it was this hard to meet just one woman was mentally destroying. 

Once I deleted the apps I noticed my confidence coming back. I would smile when I looked at the mirror and said, “damn that’s a handsome looking guy” if I can feel myself for a moment. 

With my confidence back I noticed when I went out, it was easier to talk to people and strike up conversation. When you feel good about yourself people notice.

Most of my life has been spent on academics and running my own small business, along with doing freelance website design. I roughly speak five languages but am only truly fluent in two.

I met a guy(27M) that works in a sound studio and often travels as a fill in musician for different bands. He’s very talented at what he does, but has little interest outside of it. He  does however share several of my social-political views which is nice, but I’m yet to get deeper into it to understand why exactly he has those views. Aside from this he’s also incredibly attractive and responsible with his time. He never drinks because he doesn’t like feeling as though he’s out of control of himself, but isn’t at all controlling of other people. He’s very caring, gentle, and careful which are things that I’m very much attracted to. He also will simply say how he feels without trying to elaborate too much on it. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me and why he does.

I have noticed however that he doesn’t navigate the world in the same way that I do. I tend to think deeply about the things around me and make connections between things that aren’t apparent to everyone. While he just sees things for what they are on the surface(I find this relaxing to be around in a way since most of my ideas are constantly critiqued in my social circle. It’s a nice break, and he seems to enjoy life and be more peace of a person than I am).

It may be because I’m young and that it’s a rarity to find somebody with emotional intelligence in their 20’s, which is also a concern of mine.

Personally I think that in this situation it could work well, but I’m also scared that it might hold me back in that I prefer to be with somebody that encourages me and challenges me in a healthy way, which I don’t see happening with him but I could be surprised. I also don’t feel the kind of “intellectual” connection that I have with relationships in the past, but again I’m not necessarily counting it as a bad thing.

I was about to head back to my apartment after a night of walking through the nearby campus college bars one more time before I headed back home for the summer. However, I decided to buy a local hot dog because I was feeling a little hungry. 

It was then that further up the line, I saw the girl I knew for a while. In the past, she was a bit handsy with me at the bars and events we met up at, but I knew that it was just probably her being drunk.

In the past, she was always friendly with me. During the times I saw her at the bars, she was a bit handsy with me. However, because I only ever got to see her at the bars or events, I only got to see one side of her. 

As soon as she saw me in the line that night last May, she screamed my name and clung onto me like some kind of monkey. I assumed she was drunk. Of course, I didn’t want to say no because I never got any sort of action with girls, so that was completely new to me. She clung onto me for a bit until she stood back to where I was and started holding my hands for a little while. 

Where I have my doubts about her though, is that she was apparently wanting to make out with as many people as possible that night. Gender didn’t really matter. Probably as some sort of late night fun. I saw her making out with some other guy a few minutes after clinging onto me while talking to one of her girl friends. I didn’t mind at the time, because I was feeling drunk myself. (I had a ride home).

Eventually though, I was kinda fed up enough to where I held her hand and gently pulled her back into the hot dog line and away from the other dude. We then continued to hold hands for a bit and she talked about how her semester went and what fun things we had planned for the summer. 

Later, in my loosened half drunken state, I told her that I had never made out with anyone before. She asked if I wanted to kiss her and of course I said yes. As a result, she kissed me square on my lips. I told her that I wanted to continue it for a bit and she agreed. We kissed for a little more before stopping. She also gave me a bit of feedback based on my kissing technique but I don’t remember much from that part.

We then talked with her friends for a bit longer while holding hands for most of the time waiting in the line. Before we were about to get our food, she told me that there were girls much better than her out there for me. She told me that she’s not the best one for me in terms of having a relationship. However, I remember telling her, right before she left the food place, that she was still special to me. 

I never saw her again for the entire summer, didn’t keep in touch with her either because I was too scared to say anything, until I got back to college this fall for my final semester. I saw her in the bars again with her fellow sorority sisters on their “senior bar crawl.” We didn’t talk much then, but I was happy to see her again. She acted like nothing happened though and left without talking much because she was with her sorority friends at the time. 

A week passed and I went out to the bars again, hoping to find her once more. Sure enough, I did, and made my move by sitting next to her against a wall outside a bar. 

We had a good conversation and she seemed fairly comfortable around me, despite the three hard cocktails I drank that night. (I know my limit, so I was still sensible enough to know what I still doing, seeing, and hearing.) When the time felt right, I asked her “remember when you kissed me?” She said yes, but before I could ask her to elaborate, her ride came and picked her up. I was wanting to go ride with her, but one of her guy friends I didn’t know riding with her didn’t want me to go with them. I don’t know why. 

I ended up going back the same way I normally come to the bars. Walking back to my apartment, this time in defeat.

I’m still wondering what to do now. I have her number and snap, so what should I do? Should I call or text her and plan a date? Should I talk to her through Snapchat? Should I wait until I run into her at the bars again? Or should I just move on and find someone else? Regardless of which option I choose, I don’t want her to feel like she hates me or is weirded out by me. At the same time though, I don’t want that kiss to mean nothing even though it probably might. 

That’s why I need some outside advice here. Hope this helps. 

TL;DR: A girl who was (probably drunkenly) affectionate with me for months gave me my first kiss on the final week of school last May. I tried talking with her twice about it after I came back to school last Saturday, but I could never find the right time due to other circumstances getting in the way.

My appearance is not an issue I'm pretty, take care of myself,  and I have a nice/decent personality. I do love myself. I tried tons of dating apps and got nowhere even with the filters. I'm starting to believe that I'm not suppose to find anyone let alone love. I keep myself mostly busy school, work, and now I'm starting to make my own products to sell later on. I do have tons of hobbies as well. I do know that I struggle making friends, I have been isolated socially for almost 3 years and been outside for 2ish years now. I do talk to my co-workers, I just don't see them as friends just mostly acquaintances. I do try to be more social when talking to customers since that's apart of my job. I do have two friends kind of, but we barely talk and hardly hangout. I am also at school and haven't made any friends there either, mainly everyone is busy with life and all. I been at school for awhile and just can't connect to anyone.  I just want someone to share my life with and it's starting or has felt like I was meant for no one and that I'm suppose to be a decent hermit with no one to share.

I don't know anymore I just want to love someone and share my life with someone, but it feels like nothing is ever going to happen and that I should accept my hermit life.

Edit: I appreciate the answers, I just wanted to add that I no longer have any dating apps anymore, since it's just not happening for me. I don't how people do it, I've been catfish and met trash people on those apps. I just feel that dating apps are a waste of time and I don't like being deceived or being trick into talking to someone who wasn't even the person I was talking too. I do feel hopeless in finding someone even though I am young. Mainly I've never been in love and don't know what that would even feel like.

That was last Friday. Date went great, he even suggested we walk back together rather than taking the public transport.

I (43F) only really started dating a year ago. I was a virgin (Ex-Mormon). The first two men I went on dates with were both Nigerian. The second man is the one I ended up having sex with the first time.

Since then I've been mostly doing the casual sex thing, but also been on some legit dates too. 

I've been with/on dates with probably 8-10 Nigerian men. I had no preconceived notions or judgements about Nigetian men, and had no problem dating them.

However, I've had bad experiences with every one of them. And it's the same pattern over and over.

-misogyny
-pushing gender conformity and traditional gender roles
-not respecting boundaries (especially in the bedroom)
-being very pushy about me having kids, and not understanding why I want to remain child-free at 43 yo
-being condescending
-talking over me/not listening to my opinion or disregarding my feelings

This is proving to be very difficult and I can’t tell if it’s me or if online dating is just THAT difficult? 

I’m usually a pretty confident person and I don’t really pay too much mind into what I say a whole whole lot bc I feel like as long as I’m consistent with messaging and trying to be interesting, like it should carry itself right? But man, online dating (tinder) really has me second guessing everything I do and makes me think that I’m actually pretty boring at conversation lol. And a thought that’s been creeping in the back of my head is that I’ve never really had to be interesting in a looong time bc I’ve always had the same friends since middle school and always met people through my friends and met girls that way. 

Issue with that is that my friends are now grown up and in different stages of life so I’m really having to really stick my neck out there, which I haven’t had to do much at all. So I feel like I’m having trouble finding a new set of friends and I don’t really know how to do it?

Okay with that said, insert a new issue:

I started snap chatting an old friend who seems interested in me. She did try to flirt with me once but I rejected her bc I think I was talking to somebody else already? Anyways, since then she’s moved very far out of state and we haven’t talked in a long time until now but she still seems very interested in me. So while I’ve been trying to talk to people on tinder, I’ve also been talking to her and playing around with the idea of visiting her in a few months. 

So I guess the bigger issue is, if I do end up visiting her and we start something A. Long distance fucking sucks and one of us would have to move and it would be complicated. Also bc like I know her but idk her enough to know if I want to move out there. And B. Idk if starting something with her would be scapegoating my other issue of avoiding meeting new people, if that makes any sense? Also C. If I end up meeting someone else here before that even happens, I’m gonna feel really bad for stringing her along. Not that I’ve directly made any moves yet but still..

Multi-dimensional problem for me I guess.

But if either one of us moved, I would have to guess me tho bc she’s in a nicer state now and I wouldn’t mind starting a new life that way.

So there’s a co worker I think likes me and I like her too. We’re both 17 and here’s the story so far. I originally didn’t like her because she trash talked me to another co worker about me taking all the customers at the registers (not on purpose but I just made eye contact first). Anyway a few weeks after that I had to help her at registers and she was super friendly, I remember thinking “man she’s talking a lot for not knowing me”. But I was super dry and blunt because I was mad at her remark she made at the time. She did things like ask what time I got off and then acted disappointed when I got off before her. Before I left I had to buy something and I went to her register. When I did she said “oh hey, it’s been awhile) and smiled and had a flirty look on her. She also was messing around with me and being mean in a playful way. Like messing with me when my card didn’t work and said “well we close in 30 minutes so if you don’t get it by then idk what to tell you” but it was flirty like I said. Fast forward a few weeks later and I see her one day and I decide to put what she said behind me and kinda have a “fresh start”. I started taking to her and it went so well. I made her smile and laugh a lot and she was playing with her hair a lot. I was looking to see if she played with her hair when I wasn’t talking to her and she was but not as much. It went so well that day. The next day I worked tho she was busy and around other co workers so it was hard to talk with her. I finally wanted to at least say hi. When I did I went full blown stupid and froze and just wave. I said nothing but she did the same, waved and said nothing. For some reason I looked away and then looked back. I have no clue why. When she left I told her bye and she said it back but she didn’t seem flirty or interested at all. I thought I ruined it until today and yesterday. Yesterday she was there and I noticed she had her hair dyed. I wanted to compliment but decided not to because after last time I didn’t wanna make it worse. So I just told her good bye and she said “bye, hey did you get your hair cut?” I did so I said yeah. She said “it looks really nice”. I said “thank you!” And went on. She asked “do you work tomorrow?” I said “yeah wby?” She said “not until Thursday”. I said “I work tomorrow and Wednesday but not again until Sunday” she replied “I think I work Sunday!” I said “ok nice, see you!” And left. Today is when it gets amazing. Today she came in as a customer and checked out at my register. When she came up she was playfully being mean and stuff. I got to the screen where I couldn’t scan her discount and she said “wow do I need to do your job? I think I do, cause I will if you can’t” we both made each other smile and laugh a lot and it didn’t feel like a normal conversation, but like she was flirting the whole time. I asked her “do you need a bag?” She said “if it makes your life harder I totally need a bag”. When she went to leave she asked “you work Sunday right?” I said “yeah, you do right?” She said “yeah!” I said “nice I’ll see you then, btw I like your hair!”. So I finally complimented her new hair

Her and I both go to the same college, but at that point, we weren’t yet in school. She seemed pretty interested, so she asked for my Snapchat and then my number. Then we started and continued talking to each other for about three weeks, really getting to know each other and discussed going on a date when we get back to college. 

So I moved into school on Sunday, and tried making plans with her for Monday. I first suggested taking her to this place that has a nice view of the city, but she wasn’t a fan of a first date being in a secluded area. That’s totally fair. So I instead offer taking her to an ice cream shop, to which she accepted under the conditions of her driving instead of me. She seemed pretty cautious which I thought was understandable. I set the date to 7:00 originally, then she asked if she could push it back to 6:00. 

She picked me up, and I was for sure nervous. My mouth was SO dry and I think my voice was shaky. This was my first date from OLD in almost two years (I’m very on/off on these apps), and I was excited to meet her as I thought she was a good fit. We went to the place, ordered our desserts separately, and then ate in her car bc it was very hot. 

It seemed like we were hitting it off. She seemed interested in things I had to say, and we both made good eye contact. I think I was a little too much in my head tho, as she had to initiate conversation way more. I literally made zero physical contact with her which I regretted right away. I’m a pretty shy guy, but I also think I’m charismatic when I break out of my comfort zone. An hour later and we end the date bc we both already had other plans. 

I text her today trying to set up plans for a second date and she replies saying she enjoyed yesterday, but only saw us as being friends. This really hurt, and I was kinda shocked.

How could I prevent this in the future? I know my nervousness probably hurt me, as well as not touching her at all. But it also makes me wonder if I’m not as attractive as I was in my profile. I felt like I had good pics that represented me well, but Idk. I’m a taller than average guy with a very athletic build.

I go to my library once a week and there's a libarian there who's pretty cute. We're about the same age. She usually manages the check out desk, the place is generally empty so there's more time to make small talk with her. I haven't talked much to her, i smile and say thank you but i haven't done much to ask her out.

Any advice?

Misaligned maturity, mismatched jobs/aspirations/lifestyle, etc. I’ve been feeling really awful though because as much as I tell myself those were the reasons, it was really that we weren’t sexually compatible. At all. Physically our bodies didn’t match up at all, not really even while cuddling. He was rather small but we tried a lot of different positions and I think we gave it a valiant effort. I’d begin to feel so weirded out while he watching him stick out his concentration tongue while trying to figure out how to get it inside of me and it just totally ruined the mood 😣 eventually I never wanted to be sexual in any way and I knew I had to end it. 

I’ve never had this be such an issue before and certainly not one I’d break up with someone over. I guess I just need to hear that sexual compatibility is enough of a reason to end things. It makes me feel so shallow and vapid.
