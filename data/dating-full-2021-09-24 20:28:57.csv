“Robert has sent you a new message” on tinder.

I flipped out. Lost my cool. I spend a lot of money on her and treat her right it’s been two years. We have never had any problems or issues. We sleep together on a regular basis. Everything’s been perfect.

I waited a couple of hours until we got back home to talk to her.

So I asked her straight up was she wanting a threesome or to get dicked down? Was she trying to go out with someone behind my back?

She started crying and said she doesn’t feel pretty.. Common thing she always says she’s fat and not pretty and ugly. I always compliment her and give her roses and treat her right.

So she said getting matches and a ton of compliments boosted her self esteem. I told her it’s really immature and not cool and I consider that to be cheating. It’s a dating and hook up app.

She said okay you can go through my phone I have nothing to hide. You can read the messages and see my bio whatever you want. She handed me her phone and I declined to look through it. So she said okay here I’ll deactivate in front of you I apologize it was stupid. She told me she’s never given her # out or personal info.

I confronted her again and she told me she literally doesn’t feel attractive or pretty and she said she just wanted a confidence boost and she realizes that was the wrong way to go about it.

She’s 21 turning 22. I am 25. I am with her 24/7. So I know she’s not meeting up with anyone..

If she was I would definitely know considering she’s in my bed every night and we are together throughout the day.

Obviously I am annoyed/mad over it. Her brother is 20 and he said I was being a dick to her. He said you’re mad over a stupid app she wasn’t feeling pretty and wanted a confidence boost..

I said it’s literally a dating/sex hook up app. Not cool whatsoever and disrespectful to me.

My account on tinder was banned years ago lmao so I have no way of getting on tinder to see if I can find her or if she makes any new accounts.

I know a lot of people would say just dump her blah blah..

And this was all during summer and she works as a waitress and she showed signs of liking me back and in monday (3 days from now) her caffe is closing and im also leaving in a few days and yesterday i asked her out and she said yes 

We immediately went on a date a few hours after i asked her out we walked around town for a bit and we sat at a caffe for 2 hours and the chemistry was great she told me things she never told anyone before she also said that she kept all the things i gave to her in the past and she said she's gonna remember me forever which was cool we kept talking there was never a moment of awkward silence we just kept talking i made her laugh a few times i made a few moves in terms of being physical like hugging her and things like that we even took a picture together that i would share here but i cant so anyways 

I wanted to ask her out again tomorrow i wanted to wait for a day to go by so i don't seem needy and i have an idea on what to do but im not sure if its too much or something like that i just need an opinion and advice really 

So my idea is to take her to a place thats 20 minutes away from the center of the city but we can still see the city lights and all of that its basically a beautiful view and theres a bunch of big rocks around and a path and i found a rock thats completely flat and big enough for 3 people and also the sea is right in front of you as well as the city lights and theres an open sky with a bunch of stars so i wanted to take her there take a big warm blanket in case it gets cold buy her favourite snack which i know what it is and i thought that maybe we could kind of cover ourselves with the blanket while we eat her favourite snacks and talk

I kinda new from the get go that she liked me but I wasn’t sure. She then grew on me and we started hanging out. I admitted I had feelings for her and she said she didn’t feel the same (which I was shocked given how much she was flirting) from that point on the flirting from her end just intensified more. 

She introduced me to her friends then wanted meet my friends. I told her I feel like she’s going pretty fast for someone who doesn’t like me and asked again if she liked me or not and she said no we’re just friends. 

Fast forward a few more weeks and this girl is flirting with me nonstop and asking me to hangout with her everyday for hours at a time. So I tell her like what’s wrong with you, why do you keep saying one thing and acting another way. Do you want something more than friendship because if not I’m done with these games. She then talks to me and says that she’s thinking about it. Then that night she texts me she’s like we need to stop hanging out so much if we are gonna be just friends then she blocks my number ( i didn’t even figure this out til much later)

She then unblocks my number a week later (I didn’t even know I was blocked cause I didn’t text her) and she asks me if I wanna study with her and I was like yeah sure. This time this girl is all over me flirting. Forget studying she’s dropping compliments, feeling my arms, etc. then I text her today asking what’s the assignment the next day and she’s gone and blocked me again…

So the reason I knew she blocked me the first time was because yesterday she mentioned that she had blocked me “I needed to block you for a week because I needed to clear mh head and resist the urge to text you” is what she said and I was like ya I didn’t even know you texted me.

I'm definitely guilty of ghosting in the past. And I've absolutely told people that they're great but I don't feel any chemistry, which was true but there were sometimes more specific reasons that I felt too awkward to say. 

But I also have realised that I tend to want to avoid someone's reaction. Unfortunately it can be really damaging to someone's psyche when actions and intent don't seem to match up and you're left with no discernible reasons.
It seems like many men on here are unsure why they're striking out and are having trouble receiving specific feedback.

Not sure if these will help but here are some specific reasons for why I've dumped a person:

- He made disparaging comments about his exes/other women.
- He couldn't get over the fact that a friend of a friend didn't like him or find him charming (like really bothered by it) even though there was a good reason (he kinda stole this dudes gf).
- Obvious religious/culture differences like conservatism and perceived gender roles and how a ltr would look day to day.
- Made fun of strangers.
- Naff sex that wasn't just because we were still learning each other's bodies.
- Agreed with everything I said.
- Over-complimented me with inane adoration for my looks.
- Kissed me with tongue in the middle of the first date.
- Was cynical and pessimistic about any activities we did, and the world in general (whiny more than philosophical).
- Littered.
- Told white lies to his friends and family all the time.
- Had never travelled outside of his hometown.
- His place was messy and disorganised.
- Didn't have a rich inner life/wanted me to be the focus of his life.
- He told his friends too many details of our sex life.
- He was very very frugal.
- He didn't know how to budget or save.
- He didn't know how to use a washing machine.
- He let his friends down on multiple occasions.
- He didn't express his needs or boundaries well or at all (either deferring to me and wanting me to set everything under the guise of worship, or being 'too stoic' to talk about his feelings and expectations for the relationship).
- He wanted to spend all his time with me.
- He didn't put thought and effort into celebrations or gifts/birthdays for me, his friends or family.
- He was conservative/immature sexually.
- He was very against trying anything new.
- He didn't put any care or thought into his appearance or have a sense of style.

Some of these are based on my own wants and bias so this isn't meant to apply for anyone else - this just hopefully gives you an idea of what women sometimes look out for in potential partners!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1024585,public,self,You're great but...

I dated guy for 2 months earlier this year. The thing is I met him and we started dating when I moved to the city that we both live in. It was a big move. I really started to develop feelings but I was overwhelmed and wasn't ready. We had this great connection we both agreed, seeing each other 3-4 times a week, but it was too much for me. I was overwhelmed with my move still, let alone jumping into dating. So we split, very peacefully and civil. I could tell he was really hurt by it. 

The thing is I thought of him every day and really missed him. I just wasn't ready. It's a lot moving across the country in a new city where you don't know people and start dating right away. 

We didn't talk for three months. After three months of not speaking I sent him a happy birthday text which he quickly responded to. A few weeks later he started commenting on my Instagram posts. So I reached out to see if he wanted to meet up to grab a bite to eat. he responded fairly quickly and told me that it would be great to do so. His messages have been short but friendly. I think he was really hurt by the break up so he's being careful. 

So on Monday I texted him to see what days and times work for him. I gave him my availability, the soonest being Tuesday I could meet. He said ""What about tonight?"" I told him I couldn't because I had plans, so we agreed on Tuesday. I confirmed a time and said ""perfect will see you tomorrow."" And then he texted me ""So what's new in your life? Anything new?"" I found it so odd because we were meeting up the next day to catch up, so why as me that before our meet up? Methinks it was to see if I was dating anybody. 

We met for the date and went to dinner. It was great. We caught up and did not talk about the past at all. We really enjoyed each other's company. The place he picked was a place where they take photos of every table and then give you the photo at the end. When we got it, he got excited, smiled and asked me if he could keep it. I told him sure. 

We then went for a walk and he started asking me if I was on any of the dating/hookup apps. Which I told him the truth which is no, not really. He also then told me that he noticed I haven't been posting much on Instagram. We got to his place outside and he told me that he had a great night. We then both went in for a kiss on the lips. Very light quick kiss, nothing super romantic, but kiss on the lips nonetheless. He then told me he would like to see me again this weekend. He looked at the picture from dinner again smiled and told me he was going to put it up on his fridge. He was really excited about the picture and told me he was happy about our night. 

I texted him the following day and told him that it made me really happy to see him. I also told him my availability this weekend. He hasn't responded back yet but that's okay for now. I have noticed his texts prior to this date were friendly but short, and he didn't always respond to every text. II have noticed he's being careful with texts and is letting me take the lead. So I am going to follow up and solidify plans for Sunday tomorrow.

I did this by becoming more social (for instance by volunteering different places, by going out with colleagues and meeting new people in general) and by getting my dream job in a tier 1 law firm which I never thought would happen.

But now that I proved all this to myself, I miss something; someone to share my life with. Due to my depression, I have never tried or been very interested in finding a girlfriend, but today I miss this in my life. It's the only thing I have in my head all day long and it makes me sad.

I'm 24M and I have given Tinder a chance for 3 months, but I don't get any matches unless I use boosts, and the few matches I get don't respond (not just the bots). I have followed peoples advice by using good pictures where I smile and having a good bio, but it has not changed anything. It hurts my self esteem, and I feel that I will never find someone in real life, since nobody are interested in me on Tinder. I would say I am average looking, good style and good social skills (by becoming more social, I realized that people actually like my personality).

It's so hard for me to navigate in the dating world without experience and I am losing hope. I would like to hear from you guys if you any wisdom or experiences to share that can make my life easier.

After she left, I texted her if she was okey at home, you know, usual. Alright, seems fine.

Great...

I have friends who put far less effort into their profiles and get matches on the daily.

I also don't really want to go to parties (not really my crowd or thing, especially with covid), which doesn't help.

We slept in the same bed and she said we would need to sleep with a pillow in between us, I jokingly said go sleep on the couch then, she laughed and I threw the pillow away between us and she cuddled me and slept on  my chest the first night.

Throughout the second day, shes on her phone most of the day and tells me about her problems with her ex and how she still likes him but he isnt acting right. So I act distant from her because of this and dont cuddle her the second night, she then wakes me up at 2am while im sleeping and basically hints at me to make advances.

But since we started studying there(almost 2 years), he always was the loner, no one would talk to him, completely alone. Since April of the last year till last week the classes were online, but he was quite “known” because the teachers often complimented him, but very rarely people would contact him ask for help a subject.

Now the classes are back, suddenly 5 or 6 girls started talking to him, asking for his help and engaging in unrelated conversations, but mostly asking for help. I know that have some factors that i must have considerate like:

•He is very intelligent and good in teaching, and almost every teacher when making questions in class look directly at him knowing that much probably he knows the answer(and he knows).

•The majority of the students are girls, so if a person would talk to him is much probable that that person would be a girl.

•The National Entrance Exam (the exam that most of us are studying) is very close and he is one of the most qualified persons to help in hard subjects.

•Although his look is a bit above average, he is far (objectively speaking, although in my heart he is better than Chris Hemsworth,Jason momoa and henry cavil all together) from being the most handsome dude in class. And his look is not his most noticeable trait and he didn’t changed to much from last year. so i think that can be a bit improbable that girls are approaching him because of it.

But for me, even considering this things, still strange for me how much attention he’ve been getting. And some girls are even trying to be touchy with him, he is even taking some distance when talking to them (he dislike strangers touching him). And the other thing that is bothering me is that i pulled this strategy to know him better (asking for helping and using it as a way to engage in unrelated conversations to know him better e.e).

I don’t think that I’m insecure with it, nor mad with him nor the girls(maybe a bit annoyed with their touching) and i trust him a lot and very confident about our relationship, but I can’t help feel a bit strange with this situation. I will not ask him to stopping talking with them, actually i’m a bit happy that he is making friends since aside from me he doesn’t have a single one.

We would drift on and off but he would always try to text me throughout the years.

He texted me after not texting me in a few years. He would text me good morning, compliment me, and ask me how my day was. A few months later, we met up. He came to visit my state and see his friend and we figured we’d meet up. We went out to dinner. I didn’t expect them to be dates but he paid for the dinner and he kissed me towards the end. We then went on another date and went for a walk. He was dancing with me and we started to open up. He then drove back to his state to go back home. 

After the dates, he would always invite me to see him but due to Covid (this is when it first started), I didn’t feel comfortable. I was terrified. He said he understood but would continue to invite me. I would say I would go but then don’t follow through with the plans because of my fear. 

He then drops the news that he’s moving to a state that is further away. I immediately thought there is no way this is going to work. But he continues to invite me. 

Someone in his family passed away and he goes back to my state for the services. He invited me to go to one of the services he also invited me to meet his friends and family. Also invited me to Thanksgiving. But again, I said no because of Covid. I felt so guilty. He said he understood and said he would make me feel comfortable during my stay. He said he could treat me good and appreciate me. He also mentioned that he hasn’t found the one, but has liked me for a really long time.

Eventually we went out separate ways (don’t blame him) and he got a girlfriend. They only lasted a couple of months (super curious as to why they broke up). After a few months of breaking up, he reached out to me again. Now we are talking again and he mentioned that he’s coming back up to my state and would like to meet. I asked him if he’s looking for a hook up or is genuinely interested in me and he said that he’s genuinely interested in me but likes hooking up…whatever that means lol.

She has 1 other friend not including me , I'm pretty sure she talks to me the most , we even walk to the bus together

She's a extremely nice and adorable person and very fun to talk to  and she seems to be enjoying my company.

I’m not the type to have friends with the opposite sex usually (I’m just more of a girls girl) but we really hit it off! When we first met we were both single but worked together so it was always kept professional. And he’s 7 years younger… so definitely friendship right? I never even had feelings for him until recently due to his age and other factors. 

Well anyway, we hung out after work all the time and we have always kept in touch on social media and chatted quite a bit… for 10 years but it was always kept clean. No flirting ever or nude pics or anything like that.  Just talking about … everything! Dating, the universe, politics, etc etc etc and we have everything in common.

 At some point I had changed jobs and moved a couple hours away and began dating someone (got married and divorced btw). But he stayed my friend throughout the course of this relationship because he was respectful of our relationship and so the three of us even hung out sometimes. 

My divorce just became finalized. We have been separated for a year.  As soon as I separated my crush suddenly started talking to me a lot more via text and social media. Like… a lot lol. I am now planning to move back to the same city again closer to him and suddenly for the first time in 10 years I have feelings. I am moving for a job, not for him, by the way. But I am now worried that my feelings may not be unreciprocated. He talks to me a lot but it is always kept friends. But then why does he talk to me so much? Does he like me in a romantic sense and is just waiting for the right time or does he just really like my friendship because I’m older?

for some context - my dad left when i was 7 and i never saw/heard from him again. my grandpa (moms dad) was known for being a cheater and i had no relationship w him. my dads dad i only met once and he died when i was 6 but he had children with multiple girlfriends while married to my grandma so i know that somehow affected me too. i never had any type of male role model or even relationship in my life, ever.

as a kid i was teased a lot by boys for my weight. i was always scared of them. when i turned 16, i was no longer the “chubby girl with acne” - i was gorgeous with glowing skin and curvy. all the guys who made fun of me suddenly wanted to f\*ck me.

which has led to... over 100 sexual partners and not one boyfriend. it’s so hard for me to connect with men. i can’t help it, i always immediately assume the worst to the point that it’s just impossible to connect with me. i know i put my walls up high and i overcompensate by offering sex. which never gets me anywhere with someone.

on top of what’s happened to me in the past year .. i attracted the absolute worst person to come into my life. around this time last year (i was 27) i met a guy (44) on bumble. he was rich, amazing in bed, everything i could want in a guy. after years of feeling like i could never connect with someone romantically i thought i truly met someone i could seee myself with. he constantly complimented me took me on nice dinners and just seemed perfect.

he ghosted me after 4 months and after a little research i found out he had a gf the whole time, was a rapist, had several domestic violence charges against him from several women, and in fact wasn’t rich at all - he was charged with fraud, and was basically running a ponzi scheme.

im rereading that paragraph and i know how insane that sounds but yes that just happened to me. but i fell for him so hard (expert love bomber). the connection was the false intimacy he created. the ghosting sucked so bad, i just felt so rejected and constantly replayed everything in my head for months wondering what i did that he didn’t like. i’ve never been so heartbroken by someone. i even was suicidal at one point (i’m aware this isn’t normal)

it’s been 6 months since i last saw him. he tried coming back after 3 months and i didn’t respond .

anyways, where do i go from here? i feel so hopeless. i have plenty of guys in my DMs but i just can’t motivate myself to go on one date. what’s the point?

i hate to say this without sounding narcissistic but i think i’m too pretty. guys are either scared of me or see me as no more than an object. and me with not being able to put my walls down.

i’m getting older, i’ve already lived alone for 5 years. this shit is lonely. i can’t go on the rest of my life like this. i’m getting nervous that the more that i grow into this loner hyper independent person the more difficult it will become to connect...

Apologies if this is the wrong sub. I’m feeling kind of anxious, don’t know where to put this. I don’t know what happened or why I feel so bad, maybe I want a sanity check or someone to tell me Wtf happened. But in it anyway, I hope there can be a lesson for other women in my position and also other men to gain some insight on how things feel for some women vs. how they portray they feel as a result of fear/shock/not wanting to be rude, etc. 

This is slightly me venting. I don’t really know who is to blame here, but I feel like it’s my fault for not having stronger boundaries. Met a guy on Hinge, messaged him and said I’m not really looking for something too emotionally intensive right now, and said exactly that I’m looking for “friendship/casual connection”. He didn’t ask me to elaborate and I feel like because it was so vague, it was my fault I ended up getting more than I bargained for. 

Immediately when he sees me, he gives me a very strange hug that lingered. Something felt very, very wrong from the start. I was wearing a cropped black off the shoulder sweater with a black skirt and something told me to bring a jacket with me. So I had my oversized denim jacket on my arm. He knew I was at the park earlier and immediately pulled at my skirt and asked me if I usually wear skirts “that short” to parks. I’m usually a bubbly person, very talkative and confidently spoken. But with this guy I turned into a quiet stuttering baby. I was so shocked I felt like an insecure teenager again. He put his arm around me immediately and he would keep pulling me close like that. I put on my jacket not even 5 minutes into our walk and he got pissed. I apologized and said I was cold. He would stop the walk and ask me if I wanted a hug every five seconds and when I’d be like “errr??” he’d be like “oh cmon Wtf it’s just a hug” so I’d think to myself yeah it’s just a hug. Every time he would hug me his hands would linger down my body when he was getting out of the hug and it really rubbed me the wrong way. He would say he hates girls that waste his time snd say they want something casual but can’t follow through and I was just lost for words. One time we passed by an alley and I was just like “oh that looks interesting” (I know, dumbass) and he said let’s go in. I said no I don’t want to, he asked why? He said all I’m going to do is take you into the alley where no one can see and “befriend” you. I think he made a killing joke after but I was gone at this point. He was referring to the fact that I said I was looking for friendship in my earlier text. At one point when he asked for one of his hugs he slipped his hands under my jacket and started running his hands over my back and pushing my top down a little so that his hands were on my skin. It happened so fast and with such purpose and intent I literally just shut down. I just let him do it telling myself it was nothing. He kept doing it and saying no wonder I was cold if this is what I was wearing. I really don’t think that’s normal? Like in all my years of hugging people no one has ever put their hands under my clothes during a hug. Then he wanted to warm my nose because it was cold so he said let me rub my nose on yours it’ll be cute, idk why I said okay... but he did that and then he kissed my nose. So fucking weird. Then we commented on each others smell and I said he smelled good (again, idiot... I was trying to make conversation and be nice and I guess I felt bad... and that makes me feel horrible because it feels as though it was my fault for not establishing with words (but my body language definitely spoke for itself) that I didn’t want this). So he started rubbing his face all over my neck and chest snd said he wants me to smell like him so I can “remember this”. I told him I needed to leave early several times and he would make me feel bad about it.  I told him that I am originally from Arab roots and he said that I’m a horrible Arab to be here with him and he like said I’m “bad” and slapped my butt. What the fuck. My hand actually instinctively went to stop his but it was too late. Then we passed by a food place snd he said he had a food baby snd asked me if I did and then started rubbing his hands all over my stomach/torso. I hate being touched there and told him. He wouldn’t stop and his grip was so strong snd I kept being like “please I really don’t like being touched there”. I was saying that while actually trying to get his hands off until I guess he woke up and stopped. Before it was time to go he kept saying I need to give him a goodbye kiss or a “good goodbye greeting” and I was like I don’t know I don’t think so, etc. before we left he asked for a last hug and I finally managed to say “I don’t want one right now” and he got really pissed and said “oh so I did something wrong?” And said he’ll leave now because he must have. So I said no etc then when it was time to go I myself stupidly said “can I have a goodbye hug now?” In an attempt to make peace/be nice and he actually gave some a normal one. I feel like I set myself up for this by not explicitly verbally saying I didn’t want any of it and only have myself to blame. He hasn’t stopped texting me after I removed him from hinge and it’s been a few days and I’m still just as anxious and I don’t know what happened really.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1025147,public,self,A guy was too touchy on a first “date” and it made me feel really bad,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pv0r2p/a_guy_was_too_touchy_on_a_first_date_and_it_made/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I finally got the go-ahead from a girl I’ve been flirting with since July. 

She thinks I’m funny, that much is obvious. After another backyard party (after about 4 other nights out at the bar amongst friends, during which I got strong positive vibes), she said she’s free tomorrow night. 

Here’s what I’m thinking, and what I’m worried about. I think: considering we’ve known each other for a while and have a connection, I skip the bullshit bar/brewery/coffee shop move and just suggest dinner and a movie at my place. 

Obviously, this is kinda aggressive. But also why fuck around with the implication when I can force the truth?

I understand some parts of my personality that appear closed off, I generally find it difficult to open up to people mostly because of my past in abusive relationships, I didn’t want to unload my traumas to this specific person. Also, I really really liked him and the closer we got the more timid and nervous I became which I guess built a wall between us. On the other side of the coin, he’s always breadcrumbing me, last minute planning with me and giving me sweet attention when it’s convenient for him. We’ve been dating for 11 months and he always told me how he wanted to take it slow and and was quite adverse to “relationships”. I myself mentioned that I’m not sure if I have the mental capacity to be in one but I told him I liked him, I wanted to be with him, and I couldn’t take the concept of him talking to other people. This went in limbo for a long time where he stated it was not fair that “I didn’t want to be with him but I didn’t want him to be with anyone else” when he had already put that boundary between us. I’ve been so honest with my feelings for him but he just pushes me away everytime, I know he has trust issues but he deflects it on to me (I do too). He dumped me because of our “lack of chemistry” when to me it was good until he started distancing himself from me. I don’t really know what to do, we’ve broken up and it hurts. We haven’t spoken in 2 weeks and I texted him but he didn’t respond to me. He said he hated how much he failed in our connection so I want to give him time. And now I’m overthinking that there’s someone else in the picture, because there used to be random girls popping up in his IG. I don’t think he ever really liked me and was just using me for a year.
