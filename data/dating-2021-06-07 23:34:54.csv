0,nuwflx,1623127035,Failed talking stage and other people’s successful relationship,"I was just in a 2 month long talking stage which ended bc of distance about a week ago. I went out with some friends today and most of the people in this group are in great long term relationships longer than any relationship I’ve been in and I feel shitty. This girl I was in this talking stage with sounded like she really liked me but couldn’t do the distance but I know other friends that have made distance work well. Although I’m happy for my friends that are in great long term reltionships, seeing so many people that I know be more successful than me in the relationship department makes me feel crappy. I just want to be in a loving long term relationship and every one I’ve been in in the past has seemed to last only a short while before some small detail or inconvenience messes it up for me.

Sorry for the rant, I dont know if this is the right place for this but I’m a little tipsy and I feel shitty",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuwflx/failed_talking_stage_and_other_peoples_successful/
1,nuwhol,1623127248,Someone please share their love stories,"There HAS to be people in relationships out there in which they made all their issues and what not workout.  That they made it past all the hurdles because the love/respect was always on the table. That the love never died because it was something continuously worked for. I just got out of a relationship in which hurt me a lot. and as a person who loves too much, it makes me sad that I’m losing hope because I’m taken for granted.

2,nuwv20,1623128601,Should my friend tell her to go out with me instead?,"I asked out this one girl that I know and she told me that she has to think about it. A week later we get on a call and she tells me that even though she was planning to say yes, she felt like it was wrong because she still has feelings for another guy. Mind you she’s fairly traditional and conservative when it comes to dating.

Well as it turns out, this other guy is a friend of mine. I talked to him last night and he said that him and that girl went out once, but he stopped pursuing her because he still has feelings for someone else.

Anyways.. he was kind of bummed that she didn’t say yes to me. He also suggested that he could maybe talk to her and try to clear things up (I.e. tell her that he doesn’t like her and suggest to her that she should go out with me instead), but I said I’d think about it. 

So I guess that’s my question now.. Would it be a bad idea for him to talk to her and try to get her to go out with me? Or should I just let this whole thing go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuwv20/should_my_friend_tell_her_to_go_out_with_me/
3,nuwvjn,1623128651,"I’m not a pass time or second option, tired of being treated like a seat filler!","In the span of three years, I’ve gotten no where CLOSE to a legitimate relationship. Every four to six months, the same cycle repeats itself: I meet someone, we get to know each other; over time they are consistent in their actions, except no natural escalation occurs; one way or another the ‘talk’ gets brought up, the idea of a relationship seems like a joke to them; I’m lowkey embarrassed for even THINKING that was a possibility, then I wonder if I’m delusional or something.

Of course they all had their reasons, the most popular: I’m too busy for a relationship, like OK we ALL have stuff on our plate!! Obviously that was there lame attempt at sparing my feelings. After all, defining a relationship by formally acknowledging it as such, takes zero time or additional effort! Nothing would change, I wasn’t expecting them to ask for my hand in marriage overnight nor was I desperate to start a family and get uber serious. I JUST wanted them to acknowledge me as their current partner, but apparently thats  ludicrous!Each time, they pursued me, they set the tone and I merely reciprocated, by matching their energy. How the hell could my perception of the ‘situation’ be SO drastically different from from theirs.

So everything is kinda like a phase of Talking, then not being sure at what stage were at and then kinda letting it slide.
Then this one time I got asked out by a girl but all just happened so fast, so I kinda distanced myself.
And then the other time some cold heartless girl, just wanted me to have sex with her, but I didn’t really feel like it was right.

So I guess I’m just trying to be in a romantic, loving and carefree relationship but it just didn’t come to that and I feel so bad about it, cause right now it feels like I’m the only one in my area who wants something serious, where I can rely on my SO.

Here's the insight about her , she's told me she never had a bf before , she met only 2 men prior to me , which was also long time ago and they were both only casual . She didn't click with them . Also she said she wants something serious but she's scared of commitment.
On my part I've been liking her a lot so far , and want things to go further .
We meet once a week normally on dates and she has stayed over at mine a couple of times already.
We click sexually amazing too.
But I'm too worried about pushing something like exclusivity to her yet and ruin what we have now , should I pursue that anytime soon or just go with the flow now , and wait till we're going atleast 3 months.
I'm a confident guy myself , but it's normal or not I don't know , as long as we're not exclusive and stuff I'm just a tad worried about her talking or seeing other people alongside , which she told me she doesn't do btw.

9,nuxdqq,1623130575,"I don’t think I’m a good enough person for him, should I break things off?","So I (19F) have been seeing this guy (21M), let’s call him Michael, for almost two months and now that things are becoming more  serious I’m having doubts on whether or not I should end things with him. 

I want to start off by saying Michael is an amazing guy, and the only reason I’m thinking of ending things is because of my own inhibitions. We met through a mutual friend at a party and started going out soon after. Things between us moved incredibly quickly, more than I would of liked. I lost my virginity to him on the 3rd date and he’s told me he “loves me” multiple times. The “I love yous” do bother me as I don’t think he knows me well enough to say such a thing. We see each other pretty often, at least 3-4 times a week even though our work schedules conflict. Every problem that has arose between us so far is due to my lack of communication and I’m not sure how to improve that, or if I even can.

For contextual purposes, I’ll let it be known that I have BPD (Borderline) as well as pretty severe anxiety and depression. I’ve been single for a long time in order to work on myself, and I honestly though I was in a stable enough headspace. But lately things have been rougher than usual for me, and I’ve been falling into cycles of extreme depression for 2-6 days where I don’t open texts/answer calls and I often make impulsive decisions during this time. I relapsed and SH after being clean for over 2 years which goes to show how badly I’ve been coping. 

I ended up not responding to Michael for 2 days a couple of weeks ago because I was feeling so shitty, and he showed up on my door with a gift, incredibly sweet, right? I apologized and tried to reassure him that I wasn’t “ghosting”, I’m just someone who needs space during a low. But two nights ago I left his house at 3 AM after he fell asleep because I had a nightmare and  became extremely anxious and depressed. I meant to send him a text in the morning apologizing and giving an explanation, but I overslept and again hurt Michael and made him think he “did something wrong”. Although I apologized again, I feel like an absolute piece of shit, and it’s put me in another slump of depression where I again stopped responding to him. There’s just honestly no excuse for it, and I hate that I let myself sabotage a potential relationship with someone I really care for/possibly see a future with. I just feel that if we were to enter something long term, he’ll see the devastation I let my illnesses take on my life and he’ll leave or realize he deserves a mentally stable partner that doesn’t take him and his time for granted, which I feel like I’m doing. I want to have an in depth talk with him, but I find I shut down talking to anyone about my feelings and he is no exception. I’ve tried 3 times to open up to him about my issues, but I physically clam up and say “Nevermind” or “I’m fine”. I just wish I could snap myself out of it and be the best person I can for him, but instead I’m the worst version of myself right now. I’d like to think I’m pretty self-aware, and I know I’m self-sabotaging a good thing, but I still can’t stop myself.

Thank you if you read this ramble, I’m at a loss right now on what to do. I want to just drive over to his house and hug him and kiss him and tell him I’m sorry, but I won’t. I honestly think I’m being characteristically selfish in prolonging a relationship with Michael when he could do so much better. Although I do care for him deeply and the selfish side of me wants a relationship with him, I think it’s best if I cut things off now before we’re both in too deep.

14,nuxs51,1623132127,Should I Give Myself a Chance or Give Up?,"To give hindsight I am 19 and F. In high school I never got much attention from guys. I only recall one guy saying he thought I looked pretty but that I was too quiet and so that's why his crush on me didn't last long. At maybe 17 I would talk to guys online and end up showing nudes. It didn't matter where I started talking to them I would just send because I liked their attention. Then on Instagram in my Junior year, I met this girl and it was the first time I felt feelings for a girl before, but I didn't question why I had those feelings. So we flirted and had an online relationship for 6-7 months. Until my parents found out about it. They were more so upset on though she was a 40 year old when I face-timed her and saw pictures of her. My dad talked to me and pretty much said what I felt was a phase and for some reason, I got insecure about why I was in a relationship with her in the first place. When at the time it shouldn't have mattered what he said. But after that, I broke up with her and I really hurt her. I tried to take it back but the damage was done and after we never really talked again. I feel me changing up definitely hurt her more for me being selfish. So I stopped messaging her. After a while, I talked to random guys again on Twitter. Mainly sending nudes and having very short-term online ""relationships"". I look back and think they would say to be together just so they can get nudes from someone. When I turned 19 I went to tinder and eventually met a guy there and we hooked up. I more so did it to get rid of my virginity without thinking. But in doing so the hookup felt good at the moment but I felt horrible after rushing into it doing it with a stranger. In a way, I lost trust in men and most of all trust in myself for not thinking more cautiously. Up until that point, I only had online interactions that felt not enough but also felt more safe being behind a screen. So the first time I slept with someone felt very emotional and I didn't comprehend how it would feel before I did it. But after a While, I went back to tinder to maybe try again but I would chicken out of fear. So eventually I went on an actual date with a guy, we talked for hours and we seem to hit it off. But eventually, it got into the topic of kids and he mentioned how he wanted kids and I said I never want kids. At that point whatever chemistry we had was gone. He looked up and said it looks like it's going to rain when it was sunny and that's where the date ended. When I got home I felt so sick to my stomach from sadness knowing there wasn't going to be another date. Although it was better to know each other's expectations in a relationship I still felt so sad and we never talked again. So at this point, I kinda wonder if eventually should I get back into dating? I don't want to be alone I feel so lonely. But then again I feel I am a terrible person for my past with the girl and I feel like I suck at dating already.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuxs51/should_i_give_myself_a_chance_or_give_up/

26,nuz918,1623138156,Suddenly she hates giving me oral sex,"tl:dr - My ex girlfriend suddenly decided to stop give me oral sex, even when I return the favor.

It was a while ago when I dated this girl, we broke up a long time ago but every now and then I find myself thinking about our relationship, and wondering what could have lead her to this ""decision"", we had a serious relationship (at that point in time we already been dating for almost 2 years) and we loved each other very much, had great chemistry, until one day she told me she doesn't like to go down on me ""everytime we have sex""
From then it turned to no oral sex at all, when I asked her about it she used to say she never actually liked doing it which was a lie, because I KNOW she enjoyed doing it, she was SUPER passionate about it for most of our relationship.
I always kept myself clean, showered before having sex, and also well shaved, I always went down on her, even when the smell wasn't perfect, I still did and never ever thought about removing it from the ""list"", safe to say she expected oral sex but won't return the favor.
But again, she suddenly dropped this bomb which made me feel disgusting about myself, I considered this a deal breaker, we broke up a while ago.
I would not expect too much oral sex if it's just a fling, but in a serious relationship I would take that as if the girl is not attracted to me enough.

30,nuzppj,1623140050,"Looks Matter a Lot, Tired of seeing people who say that Looks Don't Matter.","I have seen how stupid Dating Coaches say that ""Looks Don't Matter"", it's the confidence and personality that matters. But in reality it's one of the most important things.

I literally feel sad when Guys explain how they're NOT getting any dates, even when they claim ""They have better personalities"". But hear me carefully, I'm not saying that you gotta look like a Supermodel to get Girls around you, or neither am I saying you have to be ripped like a Greek God.

It's just that Women too expect something better out of it. Just imagine if a Girl's maintaining her figure and body and her appearance and the guy literally does nothing and then gets disappointed when he doesn't get to date her, 🤷🤷🤷🤷. 

She might have gone out with you if you had taken care on your appearance. Most Women who reject guys atleast (30-40%) of them have rejected guys on the basis of looks, or else they'd have gone out with them on a date. (I'm not a Blackpiller) But you can stay a Fat Guy/ Girl and then expect a Fit/ Hot sexy Woman, that would be so unfair for those people who have maintained their bodies.

See improvement is the key, people gotta agree on that, Looks Matter. Now I'm NOT saying that ONLY your looks can get you everything in a relationship, but it's NOT, you need to have ""Good Looks and Personality"". That's the best Win-Win situation for you.

I have seen how guys feel low in themselves when they get rejected, instead of they have good looks they'll get more choices in Women, and they can get some better dates and relationships. ONLY having a Good Personality wouldn't get you a relationship. 

I have seen how your crush might like you for the way you treat them, but when it comes to Relationships and Dating they just back off, they obviously like your personality but wouldn't date you because of your looks, (sometimes) had you been good looking they might have been dating you.

This is just an advice, alright? I'm NOT forcing you, but if you take care of your appearance then it's gonna be a good thing for you when it comes to successes in dating and Relationships.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuzppj/looks_matter_a_lot_tired_of_seeing_people_who_say/

But, said he wanted to be just friends","Today I (F21) was at the drug store and they were closing. The door was locked, and I had to get an employee to help let me out. I was the last one in the store. This employee, instead of opening the door, stopped me and asked if I live nearby, and where nearby I live. I said I did, and lived a few minutes away. I felt a little bit tired, and wanted to go home so I was pretty short with my answers.

Then he asked if rent was high here, because he was thinking of moving here. I told him that the rent was really high, and I probably wouldn’t be staying for long because of it.

Then he began to ask for my age, what I did, and seemed to start smiling a lot. I noticed he took off his mask to talk to me. I’m really bad at picking up if a guy is hitting on me or not, so I couldn’t quite tell. He then asked me for my snapchat and said that he wanted to see if I would like to go to a restaurant with him or meet up with him sometime if he is in the area (outside of work).

I told him I don’t have social media (which is true since I’m taking a break from using it). He seemed to feel bad, and said sorry if that was a weird thing to ask.

He then asked for my number, and that’s when I realized he probably was hitting on me? I told him I am in a relationship, and have a boyfriend. But, then he said he was looking for friends in the area and it wasn’t meant to be romantic, and a more casual friendship.

I felt bad and embarrassed like I was being conceited by assuming he was hitting on me. I just always feel so clueless with these things. I gave him my number, but felt so confused after.

43,nv0z7r,1623145279,I repeatedly get guys who want sex and no commitment,"Whether I (24F) meet guys through work, mutual friends, or from online dating, every guy has shown an interest in having sex.

I would never date a colleague but there’s two guys in another department (one is a manager) who has shown interest and asked to take me out. When I decline (because we work together) they keep asking on different occasions. The guys I meet through mutual friends and online dating have been more blunt and will say they want to have sex with me and they would if I let them. I’m not a human sex doll (I’ve been sexually ass@ult3d multiple times before). 

I just don’t understand why I can get sex but not commitment (bf). I have made it known that I want a relationship and I won’t have sex unless I am in one since I’m demisexual but guys will then lie saying “well I’m willing to be in a relationship to get laid” which is like saying I’ll tell you what you want to hear as long as I still get what I want. I had a guy friend ask me out of a date in front of his friends since he thought I wouldn’t say no but I politely declined and told him I’d hang out with him with a group of friends but I’m not interest in going on a date (with him specifically). He bluntly told me he wanted to sleep with me so I know he’s not genuinely interested in a relationship. Guys keep trying to invite themselves over my house and I’ll opt for a public outing if they want to hang out then they’ll say “you always want things to be on your terms and things to go your way”. 

I’ve distanced myself from guys and guy friends who bluntly keep pressuring me to have sex (in front of their friends) and when I call them out for only talking to me for sex they’ll get upset saying they’re not just talking to me for sex because they like my personality first but after they actually realize I’m not joking about sex they stop talking to me (after calling me out for not talking to them because I keep getting pressured for sex). The guy friend also bribed me saying he’d pay for our date if I go out with him but I don’t like bribery and I have my own money and don’t go out with guys I’m not interested in for free food. 

I’m a sexual being too and I like sex but I don’t like casual sex. Those days are over and I want something more serious but it seems like guys of different age ranges (22-33) are all on games. 

I’m genuinely tired so any guys I’ve encountered despite the environment I’ve kept strictly platonic which had led to guys lying about wanting a relationship, me getting comments about being a lesbian, or hating sex. I don’t think I have a bad personality and people have told me I’m cool to be around. I’ve taken the time to appraise the root cause and I’ve worked on my self over the years but the more I focus on myself and less on romantic relationships since I’ve had bad luck with that, guys seem to want my attention more and will lie to get it. Will this ever get better? I want to find love.

We haven't had our first kiss yet but we have been pretty open about our dating history. He also said although he continues being on tinder, he hasn't had any other dates and stresses that he is super busy with work. Under different circumstances, I would be wary to believe that statement, but considering how honest he has been on some very other not-so-great aspects about himself, I feel like he can be trusted on that.  He is kind of an artsy/free type of guy and in the past he has usually been in situations where he couldn't deliver the amount of commitment his partner would have required him to, so THAT'S a massive red flag of course. However, I'm still interested. My only issue is the texting. Every time we have met so far, It was fantastic, but after that we barely text and if we do, it's only very late in the evening. This annoys me so much that I'm ready to risk it all and address the issue. I'm aware he might be turned off and that it could be the end of it, but that's alright. I'd rather end it by me stating my needs and him running away than continuing this confusing situation where I feel like I'm the last priority. Mind you, he IS in fact online during the day, he simply doesn't respond to me during the day. Now my question is, how would you address this issue?

Anyway, I’ve been using dating apps. I get (surprisingly) a lot of matches and lots of conversations. I’ve been able to go from the app to texting and then to a date, but after the first or second date, we either decide to just be friends (which I’m okay with. Made tons of queer friends which I need) or (this is the case I’m more concerned about) we just stop talking after the first or second date. I just don’t really know how to bridge the gap from the first or second date to more dates/getting more serious. I’ve never really done dating before, honestly. I’ve always just became interested in classmates and then ask if they wanted to be my girlfriend, so this is a whole new world and I’m having trouble navigating.

Also, I never know when or if it is right to tell them I’m a widow? I feel like it’s something important to say because I hear that you should tell this to future partners but also, it never seems like a good time to bring it up and I just never really want to.

Last time we met, I asked her whether she likes me or not. She didn’t want to answer. After asking like 5 times, she said, “well you’re still here, sooooo..” implicating that she does like me. But I just don’t get why she doesn’t want to be honest about it and say it out loud. 
When we talk on social media she comes across like she doesn’t really care about me, though. But I’m giving her the same vibe as well, she told me. That might be the reason why.

After a little fight we decided that we needed to communicate more, and we asked each other what we were looking for in a relationship. She answered with “anything really, i just don’t think I’m good at relationships”. I really don’t know what to do with this information, and since I won’t see her all summer I’m not sure if this means the will stay loyal to me.


So, my questions are:
Why is it that she doesn’t want to be honest and tell me she likes me out loud? And what does it mean that she said she’s looking for “anything really” in a relationship, and that she told me she’s not good at relationships?

Stop trying to gaslight young men into feeling better with sugarcoated niceties.,"People need to stop trying to gaslight guys on this sub into feeling better. It’s not helpful in the slightest. In fact it makes us feel worse. I’m 20 and I have posted here asking few times asking for advice and I always get a sugarcoated answer that means nothing in an attempt to make me feel better.

Like yesterday I saw some guy make a post about how he felt expendable because so many women date multiple guys at once and someone gave him the advice that he should start his own business. Like what the fuck kind of advice is that.

Like I get that it’ll hurt, but give us the hard truths so that we might be able to find a solution. We all know that as an average looking guy, we will have a SIGNIFICANTLY harder time dating than a good looking guy or any woman, stop trying to tell us that we aren’t going to have to struggle more. We are all aware that looks are more important than personality. Stop trying to tell is it isn’t. We are aware that women chase after super attractive guys and that we will have to fight an uphill battle. Stop trying to tell us we don’t. We are all clearly aware that most average guys are going to have to settle, deal with getting cheated on, or die alone. Stop telling us lies.

This “advice” does nothing but make you feel good about yourself because you tried to make someone feel good. It’s just lies and we’d all appreciate it if we could have the truth.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv4y1h/the_toxic_positivity_on_this_sub_needs_to_stop/

66,nv5gwj,1623162941,My Co-worker (18F) is infatuated with me (28M) and I think I'm the problem,"Was going to post this on the advice board but its private for some reason. I think this girl is literally infatuated with me because she seems to ignore the fact I find talking to her about certain things inappropriate. Left off the first night with her wanting to get stronger than me so she can win an arm wresting match against me and I told her I wasn't the prize if she actually won so she understands I'm not interested. I thought she took the hint but she obviously makes her own reality.

Yesterday she texts me that she's out drinking after getting her bloods taken to see if she can go on birth control/the pill. Yeah nothing suspicious going on there. The says there's ""another male"" annoying her, I said to ""get your mates to keep unwanted advances away"" and she said ""it's a long story flip sake he's a dick"" but didn't want to be rude to him but told him she ""was on her period sorry"" and how he wanted to have sex while on her period or something I couldn't make heads or tails about what she was actually trying to say. Then talks about ""that's when the hormones are the best"" complete with a love heart emoji, how she broke up with her boyfriend, (FWB or actual boyfriend? does she even know the difference?) played UNO in his car before he got angry/horrible and she left.

I literally told her I really shouldn't be talking about sex with her as it wasn't appropriate. Her reply:

Lmao wise up it's fine  
But it's yolo  
YOLO

She doesn't understand that ""YOLO"" doesn't mean sleeping around which I told her. Then goes off about hating men but ""I'm not included"", sends me a drunken selfie and how she's ""absolutely steaming""! Wishes that she was working since I was there and how I ""make the shifts okay"" with a smiley face and a love heart.

To be honest I'm starting to think I'm the actual problem here. I know I'm a fun guy to be around but all this unwanted attention is starting to get on my nerves. Just because I'm nice and fun doesn't mean I want to sleep with you, I'm not playing hard to get! Nor am I some kind of player because I haven't slept with anyone in almost a year! I'm almost non-existent on social media for a reason!

I haven't made posts about everything that happens in my workplace but I have made a few the past year since it's rather bothersome. A temp literally asked me to come back to her place in an entrapment ploy to get me alone like wtf. Before that there was a co-worker who I was genuinely interested and it seemed like the feeling was mutual but there was obviously something wrong about her. Pretended (I later found this out) to be dating her neighbour after telling me that her mother was looking forward to meeting me and wanted me to come with her to visit her family. Probably though it would make me want her more but it backfired because I ended up blocking her then she interrogated me about who I was dating (at the time) and wanted to see pictures of her. She quit not long after. Like wtf creepy.

Recently as well there was another co worker (20F) who tried to wrap her legs (jumping hug) around me when she gave me a farewell hug after I gave her a present (she deserved it), we won't see each other for 4 months and are genuinely friends and probably will be even a decade from now. But now I've got this teenager being infatuated with me! I've said it before and it feels like my life's a fucking sitcom without the laugh track!

68,nv5x94,1623164162,"Fear, simping and a love triangle","I had known her for the better part of the winter. Texting back and forth talking on the phone etc. And now it was finnaly time to meet.

I didn't want to go on a friday, because it was after my last night shift. But no matter what I said, she keept pressuring that date forward. Her kids will be with her dad, we get an extra day to spend together bla bla etc etc. Until I gave inn sure il come on friday.

Getting off work in the morning 05:45, I drive to the airport. Wait for my plane, fly down to the city. I call her up, where are you? Oh something come up, but if I take the train down to the central station she will meet me there *Omnius forshadowing*

Mkay, I take the train. At centreal station I call her back, nope she cant meet me here either. But I need to take the buss to city north. Oh come on! I thought, this is not what we agreed upon, I could be home sleeping right now.

At city north, I call her back. Supprise supprise, can't meet me here either. I need to take another buss. From past experience I realy don't like using overlapping buss station's. But I'm a grown up now I can't let stuff like this fase me.

Finnaly im in her small little town, finnaly I can se her in her car. With her two daughters, all 3 of them in sports suits. The two girls are 14 and 16, so they know what is going on here...

They are having a game at the local stadion, she is allso the handball coach for their team. 'Mama mia' I think for myself. At the stadion, I get to meet all of the other parents for the kids that are playing. Handshakes all around, I try to put on my best smile. And she introduces me as her boyfriend... Even though I have never seen her before in the flesh and that topic has never been discussed.

I cheer the girls on, and after the match we drive home. To the biggest house I have EVER seen. We pack the things the girls need for their stay with their dad. 

I probably should mention he is an architect and runs his own company. And she is a stay at home mom.

 Wearing the clothes I put on yesterday before work, her not yet divorced husband drives into their grandiose drive way in a BMW X6. Wearing a suit and tie, she introduces me agian as her boyfriend... I handshake him 'Nice to meet you sir' (I have never been pressured into a more ackward situation before) She told me we would meet alone.

Back in the house, she promises me that I can have a nap after dinner. She cookes up some sausages, but im too blown away by all thats happend, and too tired from working all night. That I can't put on my usual charm, I'm usualy the one that carries the conversation. Making her laugh, cheering her up etc. But now I just feelt like a flat tire.

Dinners done she sits on the coach and has a mental break down. 'Aaaaaaaaaaaa!!!' Her scream cuts thru my ears like a plank of wood on a table saw. 'I want my mommy' she cries. Not knowing what to do I try to comfort her. 'Don't fing toche me! Don't touch me!' She screams. I stand up, she calls her mom. 15 mins of hysterics later her mom pulls in the drive way with a tiny fiat.

Now they drive away, and I think. So it's some kind of love triangle this. And Im just a pawn. Now im alone in this huge mansion, I call my best freind. I started to tell him everything, and he just can't stop laughing at my sorry ass. He even has a problem catching his breath hes laughing so hard. I just hang, he calls me back. I turn off my phone, and goes to sleep on the couch.

Next day, she wakes me up. 'Oh you are still here?' She says. 'Well I want you gone NOW!' I said sure, just please show me the buss station. 'No! Because I don't want to be seen around with YOU' Wth I say you have introduced me to half of the township as your boyfriend all ready, atleast help me get back home!

In the end I had to order an taxi 'Don't use the local taxi company I know the drivers personally' she says. Yeah right I thought, ordering a taxi from out of town is gona cost extra. Ofc im using the local taxi company.

I get in the car, and the driver knows her well. I feelt like I had to tell someone about this crazy day so I tell him everything. And here comes that familiar laugh, hes cracking up into tears.

His bio had a lot of similar interests and hobbies that I love. I was actually excited to start talking to him. But it was late last night.. and I was not feeling very well (mentally). I was having a lot of anxiety about events happening today so I got into bed early and just kinda wanted to zone out with some videos and try to fall asleep early. But I saw this fellow messaged me and I figured I’d give a quick response to his message so he knows I’ve seen it and acknowledged it. I got a notification that he responded but ignored it and figured I’d respond in the morning when I had more energy. He responded instantly. Then barely 30 minutes go by... and he responds again... then 30 more minutes to by and I see another notification... I finally take a look and it was all questions marks! “?” and then “???” 

It made me not wanna respond at all honestly, and I kinda wanna unmatch now. Barely 30 minutes to by and you’re question marking someone as if they don’t have anything else to do but to respond to someone they had JUST matched with. It was late on a Monday night... maybe I was sleeping? Maybe I have my phone on do not disturb? Maybe I was busy? It was barely a half hour. 

Please don’t send question marks or double texts to people if you actually want them to respond to you. Especially if it hasn’t even been a long time.

Last week we agreed to be exclusively talking, and seeing each other, neither of us want to label things yet because it's pretty early.

Anyway,
He knows about my issues with adhd, sensory processing, C-PTSD, anxiety and attachment issues and he continues to be the most supportive man I've met for years.

I gave him a rock on our second date (my love language is, this rock is neat so i want you to have it) and he put it on his desk next to all his sentimental items (he explained each items sentimental value) 

He texts me every day despite having a concussion and a deadline to finish his degree on Tuesday, which he's behind on, despite me saying he doesn't need to because I'm not anxious about the situation anymore and i feel more comfortable, and that he shouldn't text me with a concussion.

It takes him a few hours but he ALWAYS responds.

I had to rehome my pigeon, that I'd fostered since it was a chick, and despite his busy schedule and injury he is supporting me through it.

We've only been on 3 dates, but i stayed over and we were able to do our work side by side without it being weird.

He is insanely affectionate, he compliments me, he even showed me his bachelor project and explained to me what he was doing in detail, and sharing concerns about an interview he has to analyse.

He told me he wont be able to text or use his laptop because his doctor said he absolutely shouldn'(he was not obligated to tell me this at all, i hadn't asked, he just decided to tell me) 

Yet he still makes an effort to text me, and told me if i EVER need to talk, or even if i just need to hear his voice, not to hesitate calling him.

He also said multiple times that if i need to get out of my house (ableist parents) i can just show up without warning and if i ever just wanna visit, that as long as i text him before so he can tidy, his door is always open.

This is the first time i feel fully accepted by another person, with all my flaws.

I talked to him two days ago asking where this is going and we both mutually agreed that we aren’t compatible long term after he came and visited me last week in my town. Even though it’s mutual, I am very confused as to why I’m still extremely sad. I guess I also can’t help but feel like I’m not worthy for relationship and never will be relationship material given this is farthest I’ve ever gone with a relationship. I’ve only been in the hookup/casual dating world prior to this. 

I guess I’m especially confused because I told my dad about it yesterday and he actually didn’t have my back. He was saying that it’s my fault and that I shouldn’t have pushed for a final answer on if we’d become exclusive or not and where that guy sees this going. Which made me feel worse because I’ve been told and seen that a guy KNOWS by 3 months of talking if he sees potential or not. And the reason I wanted a final answer is because I start my new full time job soon and I can’t let this bother me. 

He also said were better off as friends given that we weren’t toxic to each other. But I’ve always heard stories of where people who started off non-platonic and tried to become platonic, and it NEVER works out. I strongly believe that it’s an excuse to ease the break up process where we slowly drift away from each other. (Given that we’ve already had sex and all too) Like he sent me 3 snaps yesterday.

I’m a coloured man and I grew up in Canada; I’ve lived in mostly diverse areas and larger cities.

In one instance, this girl said she’d be okay settling for a coloured man, but would ideally prefer a white guy. I’m another instance, the girl said she would only marry men for her own race or white. And in all the interracial relationships I see around me, it’s a white male with a non-white female. What is going on here? After white guys, I know that black men get a lot of attention, but black men seem to be heavily fetishized.

Have you guys had this experience? I can understand white women preferring white men, but it’s really sad when women from my own race see me as inferior.

I believe in God and that He has a plan for me but it also feels like will I ever get what I want in life as in a partner, marriage and children? Does He hear me? As I get older I wonder should I stop hoping that I get marriage and kids or do I believe and continue to have hope that I will get that since that is what I truly want? 

I am conflicted on what to do. I want a relationship and I love myself completely. I am okay being alone and do things I love but I am ready for a man to come into my life and be with me long term.

Can anyone give me their thoughts on my situation..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv8ezf/at_27f_should_i_worry_about_finding_a_partner_or/

89,nv8n40,1623171010,Trying to determine if she’s into me or if I should ask for another date.,"Brief history; myself (24M) her (23F) met this girl on a dating app, she’s very recently divorced from an abusive and toxically controlling marriage (ex wouldn’t allow use of social media and monitored her texts. We didn’t talk more than a couple times every 2-3 days starting about three weeks ago when I just decided to send it because she’s not incredibly responsive. Last Saturday we hung out and had a great time together, went back to her place after, conversation flowed continuously with any awkwardness or indiscretion. Everything just felt right and we made out for a while until she insinuated she was tired and I took that as a single for me to politely rap it up. I probably miss-read an indication to take it further considering my hand was on her upper fucking thigh and my other hang weaving through her hair without any comment to cease or slow down, but yknow she was open about her recent destructive relationship and I was attempting to show restraint and be a gentleman yknow. Regardless, I got home and sent her a text about how much I enjoyed the date… to no response. We spoke a bit on Sunday about arbitrary things, she snapped me Monday with no message involved and I snapped back attempting to start a conversation only to be left on open. Sent her another snap about 14 hours ago asking her out again and she hasn’t opened it yet. This is typically from the frequency of her responses before the date but I was hoping after a night well spent together that she would be more inclined to snapping or texting me more often, thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv8n40/trying_to_determine_if_shes_into_me_or_if_i/

95,nv902h,1623171959,Fear of ending up alone,"Hey guys, hope y’all are doing well. Just wanted to share somethings with y’all. 

Sooo I’ve been single for a very long time, 4-5 years. Around this period, I’ve tried to date around and meet people but nothing really progressed to a relationship stage. I don’t know what goes wrong where but I meet people who do not value me or think I’m easy just because I’m friendly?? And because of that things just end. I have yet to meet a nice guy who is kind and respects me. A guy who is driven by his goals. Too much to ask for? High expectations? I really don’t know… 

As the years pass, I get increasingly afraid of ending up alone. Everyone dying around me and I have literally no one to spend my life with. It seems so scary to be alone. Even right now in life, I don’t see myself progressing anywhere. My friends are settling down, buying houses, planning for family and children. And then there’s me who is alone and whiny. Well that’s all I wanted to share. Let me know ur thoughts, thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv902h/fear_of_ending_up_alone/

97,nv94hz,1623172275,"My [F30] first string of dates back in over a year, and grateful they've been a success. I needed that break to appreciate what I have now (and also, the sex!)","Like many people out there, I was burnt out on dating before 2020. When the pandemic hit, I tried to do virtual dates and make the most of it, but it just wasn't the same and I myself wasn't too eager to meet anyone while trying to stay safe for myself and others, so I took a break for several months from dating. In the meantime, I got back in touch with some hobbies I'd been neglecting and thought more about what I wanted in a partner. Something I realized is that when I began dating again, I wanted to meet someone who wasn't just going to act like the past year didn't happen at all. I wanted to meet someone who did some growing on their end, too.

I rejoined Hinge and Bumble in late April after I became fully vaccinated. I'm glad I took the time to reflect on what I want right now (which is something of substance and monogamous, but also with no hard goals in mind like rushing to get married or any of that moving too fast stuff...) Along the way, I ended up going on a few dates with a couple of guys, but one in particular stood out. He, too, was just reentering the dating picture and was also moving at a comfortable pace of not rushing back into normal life. We went for a coffee walk on our first date, and then we did a workout at his gym together on our second date. By the third date, it was the weekend, and making tacos and watching a movie with wine and cuddling, and that was right up my alley. 

What's different between dating now and dating before is that I think I appreciate it again, am more aware of my expectations, and have thankfully met someone who is similar in lifestyle and I'm physically attracted to (he's taller, very fit, but also well read and likes low key hobbies.) By date four, TMI, but I don't think I was ever so enthusiastic about sucking a guy's dick in my entire life. Even the sensation of that felt so much more appreciative, as weird as it sounds, and the sex has been a huge plus.

With a little centering and grounding myself away from the old tired hustle of dating, I think I found a happy place in it, and hope you all do, too!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv94hz/my_f30_first_string_of_dates_back_in_over_a_year/
98,nv95fj,1623172340,I think about my ex girlfriend occasionally,"She broke up with me spring of 2019 on my birthday out of all the days. She is my first love. She is the first girl to meet my parents and the the only girl I ever saw a future with. I’m not fully over her and I don’t think I’ll ever be but at the same time I have so much disdain for her. 

I don’t think that I will ever feel what I felt when I was with her. The rare times that a girl does show some interest the conversation quickly fizzles also it just doesn’t feel the same when I’m having a conversation with someone. Even before I met my ex girlfriend, I was so excited to get to know someone. I can’t seem to find that same excitement. I don’t want to open up to someone and after a few months they screw me over and leave. Occasionally, I think about the good times with my ex girlfriend and how happy I felt and I wish I could have that same feeling with someone else.
