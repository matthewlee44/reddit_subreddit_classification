I (35, male) live in Seattle and matched with a woman (34, female) who lives in Washington DC. We matched and chatted on the apps for a week or so before exchanging numbers and moving over to text. After a couple of days, we finally FaceTimed over this past weekend. 

I think it went well. It lasted a little over 3 hours or so. The tone of the conversation was more casual and getting to know one another, like what we do, favorite types of foods, what we do in our spare time, past travels, and any future plans. So, nothing really flirty or anything, but I think overall a nice conversation. In the end, she had to hang up because it was getting pretty late there, almost midnight. We ended the convo saying she'll text me and we can facetime again etc.

So few things:

- aware of the distance, however, in general, I'm not tied down to settling in Seattle since the majority of my family is more between the midwest and east coast. 
- I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've matched with other women as well, even ones that are local, but I for some reason enjoyed my FT conversation than I have some first/second dates.


A couple of questions:

- No one really sitting on an FT for 3 hours if there isn't at least a hint of interest right?

- I'm at the age where I'm kind of over all these texting games, should I just text her or wait? Is it any different with FT and actually meeting in person?

- Due to a couple of upcoming weddings, a trip, and some family obligations, I can't really make it out there until the first or second week of August... If we continue to chat over the next couple of weeks, when should I bring up the possibility of one of us flying out to meet one another if we both comfortable with it, etc? The last thing I want to do is waste each other's time!

Please be as gentle as possible with me. 

I like this guy I coached with. I admitted feelings and told him whatever girl ends up with him will be lucky since he was by far the most amazing person I’ve ever met. And he said “Thank you I appreciate that. And you’ll find someone.” 

And this was after months of talking, getting to know him and getting along with him. 

I figured that was a rejection and went three weeks without seeing him. I had to see him for the first time today &amp; expected awkwardness. Instead, he smiled at me and said “Hey, how’s it going?” And gave me his keys because I needed them. 

There were a bunch of people in his office, and I quietly mentioned to them that I had an interview today. I definitely didn’t think he heard that. 

We didn’t talk all that much, but when he got up to leave, he smiled at me again and said “Good luck on your interview.” Before walking out. 

It took me by surprise because I thought our interaction and me spilling feelings was going to create awkward tension. 

Why is he being so nice to me? This has been a common pattern since I’ve opened up to him over the course of the last few months. It hasn’t deterred him. 

He even wrapped me up into a huge hug a few weeks after I told him that I thought he was good looking when I asked him for one. 

He’s still kept me on social media, but has kept talking to me more the more I open up to him.

Went on 3 dates with a girl, slept with her once, over the course of 2 weeks. I mentioned to her on the first date, that I'd have to go on a trip for work (3 weeks long) in about a month. I found out the trip the morning after I slept with her and spent the night over at her house. I text her this and apologize, and she texts me that she wants to see me before I leave.

I'm leaving in 2 days after I received notice my trip was moved up. About 5 minutes before I was going to leave to see her for the last time, she texts me that she has to take care of an emergency at the place she was moving from and that she can't see me until later (not necessarily an excuse, as I know she's moving). Doesn't text back until 11 that night saying she was sorry but whatever she had to take care of took way longer than she thought. I don't respond, thinking I've been blown off. She then texts me the next day saying she was really sorry about last night really likes spending time with me so she doesn't want me to hate her. I then text back saying that I like spending time with her too, and that she should keep in touch and I'll see her when I'm back.

I live with my mom in a house in a typical neighborhood. It was me and about 7 of my friends. Only 1 girl. We’re newish to the neighboorhood and saw some girls in the house across the street so we went over and asked if they wanted to play beer pong. Throughout the night I had my eye on one of the girls (20F) and we flirted throughout the night and I got her number. Her and her friend stayed till about 4:30 am with me and my other friend just talking, drinking, and listening to music in the garage. Turned out she is the one living across the street. That was Saturday. Sunday comes and I was crazy hungover. She ended texting me first at about 8pm ish asking if I was coming over for a “house tour” which we joked about the night before and her parents were out of town this weekend. When The girls were at my house she seemed very adamant about her parents not finding out they came over, not sure if that’s because me and my friends are all 22 and the girls ranged from 18-20 and there was alcohol involved or she wanted to keep this to a one weekend memory. When she asked me to come over I was just feeling like death so I told her sometime this week in a flirty way. She texted back and I never responded.  FYI she literally lives right across the street. 

The questions I have are:

Is this a terrible idea to start hanging out and possibly take her on a date?

Did I screw things up/miss my chance by not going over there last night?

Did she possibly just want this to be a fun weekend and never speak to me again?

It went well minus a failed attempt at a hug, she didn’t feel comfortable and revealed later that she didn’t really enjoy being touched by anyone but the closest people. Fine with it, understand. She agreed to a second but had some mental health problems she had to deal with. I saw her on tinder in 2020 and decided to follow her Instagram. Learned she had borderline and bipolar disorder. She told me texting can be mentally draining sometimes and I usually got answers back after a day or so. I tried playing it cool and just messaged her every other day.

We talked and hit it off pretty well. Sharing common questions, chatting about a variety of things and sorta just getting to know her. She told me she was gonna be moving up north for a bit but would be back in the fall.

We met at a park and had a small outing before she had to go home to pack. It was wonderful and we lost track of time noticing she had 5 minutes to get home but lives further out than that. She gets excited and says she wants to see me when she gets back down for a visit.

Conversation inbetween the next time we saw eachother was limited and mostly through Instagram. I caught Covid and was possibly not going to make it. I said “fuck it” and messaged her that I had a huge crush on her and she asked me to call her. I couldn’t because I was rushed to hospital.  But I updated her and she got really happy that I was updating her and that she wanted to see me even more.

Some awkward small talk on Instagram for a month &amp; texts. Kinda hard to do long conversations with someone who gets burnt pretty fast, and someone who is 3 hours away.

But I really like them. She makes me happy. I asked her this past Friday if she was coming down so I could see her. She said she was actually coming down and would love to see me 8:30-9:30.

We meet at the same small park and go on a walk around it’s teeny perimeter. The first 5 minutes are a smooth conversation and catch-up. We talk lots. Conversation is kinda awkward with pausing in between but it’s fine in my opinion. We go to a waterfall and I try a silly and not gross pickup line.

“My hands are cold even in the summer, would you help warm them up?” 
Every girl from my past? It worked. Her reaction was confusion for a moment and then 
“No, sorry”

I say “can’t blame me for trying”
Awkwardness. 

A few minutes later she said she had to be home to see her sister before she goes to stay with her boyfriend a few cities away. I say “no problem”

Look down at my watched. 8:55. 

She left really early and asked that i text her when I get home. Okay. I got a little buzzed that night and texted her:

“Hey, thanks for a great time, sorry I made it weird for trying to hold your hand. Hyped to see you again.” 

No reply. Not uncommon. Sometimes she doesn’t reply cuz she can’t handle much conversation as mentioned. But man do I regret sending that text.

She’s viewing my stories on social media. Orbiting.

Was I just boring / there was no chemistry? Does she just want to be friends, or was she just not down to hold hands?
Is it over?
Is it redeemable?
Am I just overthinking?
Do I message her or was a hint given she was not interested?

So many questions on my mind. Did I fuck up? Where do I go from here.

Over analyzing a lot, but this is important to me. Never stopped thinking about her and what could have been. Really want this to work out.

We've been messaging heaps, and really seemed to be clicking. However, he's very nervous about dating because he took some emotional damage from his previous relationship ending, two years ago. I took some hailstones myself, when mine ended one year ago. I held his hand for a sec today, and he pulled away, saying sorry, but he wasnt feeling sure about what this is. So either he's terrified of getting into something new, or he's just not that into me. I'm a pretty ""speak my mind"" kind of person, and because I am a plus size woman, I really needed to know if it was one of those ""You're really awesome but..."" (you're fat) situations. So I just asked him if there was any attraction, at end of the date. He said something nice about my personality, and I told him that wasnt what I meant. He then said ""There is, to a degree"".

I sent him a meme on my way home poking fun at my inner shock at that moment, and his response was embarrassment, I think -  ""Oh God, I cant deal! I had a few drinks. I should go back into my shell  now"".

We've since been texting playfully, exchanging memes etc, but not gonna lie, I've been trying to get him to explain the whole ""to a degree thing"", less and less subtly as the night went on.  I am now VERY unsatisfied with the amount of prodding I've done, and am starting to feel like Ive made myself look like a nutter.

I just came home from choosing to miss out on good days together, and more nights when I would put my head on his shoulder and he would kiss me good night. 

I just wanted to say I have never let someone go, knowing very well it’s not what I want but it’s the right thing to do. Because he was not for me. He would probably never end up really loving me like a partner. He is 5 years younger than me, with a lot more to learn about what is really important in life and different goals than mine. 

We started with friends with benefits. But he ended up being my best friend with benefits.
And as my best friend we shared everything, including our thoughts. I know his priority is work, he has big goals with his career and life. And I don’t want to hold him back with plans for dates or make him feel guilty that he wants to work instead of fulfilling his goals. And in his own words, he didn’t want to hurt me. I believe him. I know he cares about me a lot. 

So I made the choice for him to remain just friends. And let me tell you, it sucks. It sucks so bad you can’t even imagine. 

He told me that as long as I am around him he can never find a wife because “nobody else has your values”.  Then that’s another reason to let him go. He should be out there finding the ideal wife for himself when he is ready to do it. 

I guess this post is just to make myself feel better about my decision of stopping it. 
Even with all the amazing things he did with me and for me, I know he was just not that into me.

We had our first date the weekend before last, it went amazingly, awesome chemistry etc. We shared a kiss (or two) and I truly didn’t want to say goodbye. We ended up sitting in his car and just talking until about 1am. 

The following week we talked every day, we had agreed to meet on Sunday because we didn’t want to rush stuff. He was really sweet all week, super attentive and everything. I’m not much of a texter but I found myself texting him a lot! We would send the odd picture and stuff (all on insta which is basically all I’m on). Fast forward to Friday I’m at a party, I was drinking and I really wanted to see him. We arranged that we would spend the whole weekend together, as I came back from my party early as I just wasn’t feeling it. I went down to see him on Saturday, we had an amazing time and it felt really natural. We watched the football together, he didn’t jump my bones the second we were alone. He just seemed so pleased to see me.

Inevitably we slept together, he waited till I took my makeup off which made me feel really seen, as I struggle with scarring from acne and am a little self conscious about it at times. The sex was incredible, we went 2 rounds and then in the morning too. In the morning he was very sweet, everything was fine. I suggested as I had brought a toothbrush that I would leave it with him as I didn’t want to take a wet toothbrush back in my old bag, suggesting I might be able to use it next week. We went on the date we had previously planned, he seemed at little distant though. He had to do quite a bit of driving and I assumed he must be tired. I brought up next weekend at dinner just to let him know about my work and he checked and said it should be fine, but he was definitely bugged by something on his phone etc. 

Anyway, he drives me back home at around 5 and we part ways. His mate had tried to call several times while we were in the car, I asked if I could have a kiss and he obliged although he still seemed bugged by something and thanked me for coming to see him. I text him when I got in saying I really enjoyed myself and to text me that he got home safe. He sent me a fairly short text saying he got back, which I just liked as I’m used to doing that with mates as I didn’t feel I needed to say anything. A couple of hours later he text me ‘have I done something wrong?’. I said no and he explained that I hadn’t replied, which made me think he must want to keep in touch. 

However, since then I feel like the communication is just different. Before he was super expressive and saying sweet things, now I feel like he’s dodging my attempts at flirting or whatever. He’s in the military so works regular hours and I know he was busy today. This isn’t an issue for me usually because I don’t like texting, but because we’ve developed this regular pattern of texts that’s tbf he’s set, I’m more stressed out. I spoke to my Dad who suggested I just set a date in stone with him and explain that I’m busy for the rest of the week, but look forward to seeing him then (which is true, I’m swamped at work this week and like making my plans in advance).

I'm a really good-looking boy but i'm quite shy to do anything if the other part doesn't make it clear, whereas the girl maybe expect me to be more aggressive. I noticed that it's not only because i'm shy but i lack the esperience to act in a way that allows to get more, so i'm here to ask for how i can surpass my shyness and be more humble because both times when i went home i realized that the girl was waiting my move and i was hoping she would make the first move.

Long story short, I met a girl, we became friends, friendship developed into attraction, I told her I liked her, she told me she liked me back, and a month later I got a text from her saying that she was no longer interested. As you can imagine, the long story is a lot more complicated. I won’t get into all of that. What I will do, however, is explain why things went wrong: 

**Lack of courage.** It took me about 7 months to tell her that I liked her. I did not strike while the iron was hot. The ability to be courageous and to go for what we want despite the fear that others will think of us negatively and despite the understanding that there is a possibility that we will get rejected is crucial when it comes to dating and attraction. 

**Lack of understanding of male-female dynamics.** This girl was feminine, and I am someone who is masculine at my core. During the 7 months when neither me nor her made a move, I sometimes asked myself “why doesn’t she make a move? Why does it have to be me?” Women will give us hints, but as men, it is our responsibility to be the ones to take the lead and to make the first move. 

**Being overcome by infatuation.** As my attraction for her grew stronger, so did my level of infatuation. I started dreaming about her, and I found myself constantly thinking about her. The confident, interesting, and funny guy that she fell for had turned into a nervous wreck who was no longer able to be himself around her. One of the ways to overcome infatuation is to be outcome independent.  

After I got my heart broken, I cut all contact with her, and I pretty much haven’t spoken to her since. I understood that the only way to get over her was to grow as a person, to focus on bettering myself and to gain new experiences.  The months following the heart break were difficult; I did a lot of soul searching and spent a lot of time reading about dating and attraction. Over the last three years, I’ve learned great deal about this topic. Here are 12 dating principles for young men. 

**1)** **Treat dating as a skill set.** 

Dating it not an esoteric practice, it’s a skill set. Anybody can become good at it. All it takes is practice. Successfully honing a skill requires consistency. If you want to get better at dating and if you want to gain more experience with women, put yourself in positions to succeed. Go out, join clubs, make friends, talk to people who are in your surroundings, and go on dates. Learn to consistently approach women you find interesting and attractive.  

**2)** **Understand that you are enough.** 

A lot of men have the unfortunate mindset that some women are “above” them. This is wrong, and it leads to desperate guys putting women on pedestals. Even the hottest women are human and have problems. No woman is special. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don’t fall into infatuation. Have some self-respect and don’t treat her differently than you treat other people. Don’t try too hard to entertain her; you are not a clown. Understand that we are all intrinsically equal. Sure, some people might be more attractive than you, but attraction is somewhat subjective. Women are not into looks as much as guys are. With that being said, working on becoming more attractive is a good goal.    

**3)** **Be courageous.** 

Be confident and courageous. If you see a girl you find attractive, go up and strike a conversation with her. The key is to be outcome independent. Too many guys approach with the mentality ""I'm going to get her number"" or ""I'm going to ask her out on a date"". That's the wrong way to go about things. Simply go up to another human being, compliment them on something genuine like their outfit, or talk about your surroundings or something, and have a conversation. If there is a vibe, awesome. If not, that's okay too. Once you get to know someone and there is mutual attraction, strike while the iron is hot. Don’t be afraid to escalate sexually, as long as it’s done in a socially calibrated manner. 

**4)** **Have a life outside of dating.** 

Women should never be the definite chief aim of your life. As mentioned in my article, “What Is The Meaning Of Life?”, there are far more meaningful and important things to pursue, such as building a legacy, and working on projects that you are passionate about. A lot of men chase women because they are hoping that they will fill a void. A woman should not be solution to your life problems. Self-love should always come first. As the philosopher and writer Ayn Rand once wrote, “To say ‘I love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.” Self-improvement is crucial. Work on becoming more attractive and on becoming a better person. This includes things like getting a nice haircut, wearing well-fitting clothes, and building your ideal body by working out and eating healthy.

**5)** **Be picky.** 

At the end of the day, sex and dating are simply transfers of energy. Sexual energy is valuable, it can even be used for creative pursuits. Don’t give your energy to just anyone. Make sure that you are attracted to this person, that they are truly your type, and that you genuinely like this person. Time is your most valuable resource in life; don’t waste your time on girls who aren’t worth it and who show no promise. 

**6)** **Never become resentful.** 

Never become resentful of women, of more successful guys, and of the world. You cannot change human nature. If women don’t find you attractive, there is probably a reason. Maybe you need to work on your looks. Maybe there is something about your personality and mindset that is off-putting. Maybe you give off a bad vibe. Instead of becoming resentful, embrace rejection and work to improve yourself. Becoming resentful not only makes your situation worse, but it also serves no purpose. 

**7)** **Be a good person.** 

Make sure that your intentions are in the right place. Women are sometimes afraid of meeting new guys. Make sure that you are doing everything you can so that she is comfortable throughout every step of the process. If you are unsure about something or get the vibe that she might be uncomfortable, use your words and ask her. Be genuine and in alignment with your values and with all parts of yourself. Do not be manipulate. Furthermore, do not talk about other girls when you’re around her. Nobody likes to hear that. 

**8)** **Don’t get overly emotional.** 

As Tyler Durden says in Fight Club, “Let the chips fall where they may.” If things are not working out and she seems to be losing interest, that’s okay; it’s life. You can’t control what happens, you can only control your response. If you get upset, withdraw until you are no longer emotional. Responding in an overly emotional manner won’t help you in any way. Instead, take a step back, clear your head, and respond logically to what life throws at you. It’s okay to be emotional and to show emotion in a healthy manner. However, allowing your emotions to rule you and to control you is unhealthy. 

**9)** **Never chase.** 

There is nothing more unattractive than somebody who tries for force attraction. Attraction cannot be negotiated. It’s either there or it isn’t. Reciprocate her efforts and her level of affection and attraction. If it seems like she is losing interest, then take a break. You might realize that she isn’t right for you. Sometimes, distance will show someone how important you are to them. Do not plead or become needy or clingy. Outcome independence is crucial. When going on dates, don’t have expectations. Be mindful of the present moment. Remember that a woman should not be the center of your Universe. 

**10)** **Understand that attraction is built in person.** 

There is nothing wrong with texting, but it should primarily be used as a tool to meet up with her in person. Talk about the important stuff when you see her. Experiencing things with her in person is the best way to build attraction. 

**11)** **Do not rush things.** 

A lot of people rush into different stages of dating and into relationships. Don’t do that. Take things slowly. Do not ignore red flags. Make sure that a girl is a healthy component to your life before moving things forward. Furthermore, when first meeting a girl, do not compliment her on her looks; it’s shallow and she’s probably heard the same compliment a thousand times. Instead, compliment her on the things that she’s genuinely worked hard on and that she’s proud of. 

**12)** **Always stay true to yourself.** 

I understand that an important aspect of life is to “fake it till you make it”. With that being said, even when you are doing that, you should still maintain a core part yourself. There is nothing more unattractive than somebody who creates a fake personality and acts in a disingenuous way just to attract women. Even if you do succeed, you will have done so at what cost? The cost of your integrity? The cost of your self-respect? The cost of your character? It’s manipulative and unhealthy. Do not use “tricks” to attract her. You want women to be attracted to who you truly are. 

**Final thoughts.** 

I’m not an expert when it comes to dating and attraction; not even close. This article is simply a collection of my own thoughts and observations. I’m sure that in the years to come, much of my thinking will either change or improve, as is usually the case with the passing of time. With that being said, I hope that some of you found some these ideas helpful.

Even the greatest pickup artists in the world will experience several counts of failures. After all, you can’t win them all. No one in the world has a 100% success rate, not even Ryan Gosling for that matter. Nevertheless, there is a need for you to up your game, but at the same time, you have to learn to deal with rejection. So here are 5 valuable tips for you to learn how to shrug it off your shoulders.

Tip #1: Don’t blame yourself

As narcissistic as it may seem, you can’t blame yourself for getting rejected. Some times you just have to know that she wasn’t the right one, and that’s perfectly okay. There are plenty of girls to go around, and there’s simply no time for you to be wallowing in shame for something that’s complete natural.

Tip #2: Laugh it off and don’t be shy about it

I’m sure you’ve come across a few friends who take rejection far too lightly. They may even save a few stories to tell you when you’re having a drink at your local bar. But it’s true, and it works. Don’t take rejection too seriously, no matter how strong your infatuation is. Instead, take it as a story worth telling, it may even come in useful on your next attempt. Be proud that you tried, it establishes confidence and it shows that you’re a man who knows your standards.

Tip #3: Don’t succumb to your insecurities

You should never let your insecurities get the better of you. There’s no doubt that you may end up beating yourself up for not being good-looking enough or not being suave enough, but that’s not true. Everyone has their strengths and their fair share of weaknesses. If you find yourself doubting yourself, then fight against it with positivity and reaffirmation.

Tip #4: Take it as a learning point

People tend to fear failure, but I see it as an opportunity. You should always view your rejection as something worth learning from so that you can improve yourself and move forward. Maybe you can tweak your approach a bit more and appear more confident.

Tip #5: Keep on trying, no matter what

No one’s born immune to rejection; it’s simply human psychology. However, there’s always a way to curb that and recondition yourself.

We are from the same town, and hang out when home, but go to school about 10hrs apart. While at school, we still call constantly, but I don’t want to try distance.

My problem, is that I’ve never dated anyone because I always find a reason it won’t work (school for another 2yrs, career commitment for 10yrs with no control over life/family). If I know it won’t sustain, I don’t see a point in starting a relationship. When we were in hs, I told myself we would graduate soon, and in college, the excuses grew, so I feel like I’m just never going to date at this rate... by my excuses are legit, I think.

Now my dilemma. 
A) I bring it up and we confess our mutual feelings. We go back to school, don’t distance-date, and things are essentially the same, but now weird.

B) I don’t bring it up, causing the tension to continue growing. We never acknowledge it, out of fear, and I always regret it.

I know that if we never date, he has set the bar for any guy I would consider. He is witty, devout, incredibly smart, great with kids and offers great advice.

I recognize people will find this offensive, but can anyone explain why I'm actually wrong? I am sincerely open to other notions but I feel like this describes most of what I've seen pretty well.

I'll illustrate with examples:

My Indian sister struggled with men her adult life despite having hundreds of men interested in her and all the opportunities in the world. Her requirements to date a guy have always been since puberty that he needed to be 6'+, snow white (even Italian is not white enough for her), charismatic, handsome like a TV actor, and treat her well. She ended up in an abusive relationship for years and various other issues due to dating guys everyone around her told were terrible ideas to date, but she thought they were ""hot"" and they met her race/height/looks needs so those were what she chose. 

One of my closest female friends is East Asian and she also has terrible luck. She showed me her Tinder account once and it was to bottom white guys who looked hypermasculine with square jaws and loads were claiming to be doctors/lawyers. Every single guy she's ever dated has been white and usually emotionally unstable or treats her poorly. She's slim and attractive and easily gets hundreds of likes on any app but this is how she uses the apps.

I can give more examples of my cousins or other relatives/friends but it seems like it's so often a similar story.

On the other hand we see loads of posts on this subreddit that match my experience from guys and my male friends. Lots of guys post talking about how they are busting their asses working on photos, hiring photographers or having friends take pics, working out, and trying to improve themselves, yet they can't get any matches or go months between any who will even talk to them.

When I look at the women in my life and the problems they experience in dating it seems they are choosing their problems. No one is making them do the things they do. If I was in control of their apps those problems would disappear, because I wouldn't be making those choices if I was them. I would apply different criteria to get different outcomes.

Whereas the men seem powerless and like no matter what they do they have no choice of any kind. I have even given over control of my photos, profiles, and apps to women and they can't change my results either. So even they are powerless to change my outcomes.

We have never met in real life but the intention was to get to know each other through texts, phone calls, and video calls till we could meet in real life after the COVID restrictions were lifted. We are in different cities. 

On the second day of texting , he says that he thinks that it would have been much better to have met in person. I agree but given the situation, I put forward video call as the next best option. I noticed that he never initiates conversation unless I do first. So I asked him about that. He said that he didn't notice and begins initiating conversation more often.

We share many interests and I find him interesting, polite and nice. We've talked on the phone a couple of times in the last few days. The conversations lasted between 40 - 60 minutes on each call. I enjoyed our conversations. We get to know that I'm a year older than him and he said that age is only a number and that it did not bother him. He also said that he found me intelligent and mature which he liked.

A few days into texting, I noticed that he answers all the questions that I asked but never asks me about myself...my likes and dislikes, or even what I asked him. He has asked me about my family, my education, my upbringing, and how I became friends with our common friend but that's about it. I asked him about it because I got the feeling that he is not really curious about me or wants to get to know me. He said that was not the case when I brought it up. The next day he asks me a couple of more questions about myself. I felt that he was probably unaware and I'm happy with the change.

Yesterday we had a video call. We talked for 2 hours straight. It was good. 5 hours later, I get a message from him saying that he felt the age gap between us during the video call and that we should stop talking. He apologized for hurting my feelings.

I'm confused as to what that ""felt the age gap"" could have possibly meant because he had stated earlier that it didn't bother him and what went wrong. Did he feel I was too mature?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.- I did not wear any makeup during the video call because I wanted him to see how I really look. I had shared pictures earlier both with and without makeup and he kept emphasizing that I looked different in all of them and also in my pictures on Google.

I'll admit that I wasn't thrilled about him because he's not my physical type (shorter than my usual partners, bad hairline etc). 

We hit it off and he had a very magnetic personality. Fast forward 2 months and we were hanging out at his place when I asked him if I could log onto my Hulu on his computer so we could watch a show together. He said sure and gave me the passcode to his laptop, first thing that shows up when I open is literally a porn video.

He was right next to me and looked embarrassed but I asked him how often he watches and he told me everyday usually. He's a virgin so I was already skeptic about his bedroom skills but now that I know he watches porn that much and probably learns from those videos, I am completely uninterested in him. I left his place and haven't returned his calls since then. 

I feel really shallow because part of the reason I was so turned off is probably that he watches so much porn because he can't get that much sex. It's an awful thing to think but that was the first thing that came to my mind. I am also slightly annoyed that I dated ""down"" in attractiveness so much and he turned out to not even be worth it

Here is the situation:

I have been separated from my wife for about 1.5 years. We were married for about 7 years and dated for about 4 years prior to that. Divorce is almost finalized. Everything was amicable. I'm looking to date but am finding it difficult in my current situation.

Most weeks, I work 7pm to 7am Sunday night through Friday night and 11pm to 7am Saturday night into Sunday. Sometimes, I get some 8 hour shifts through the week, but not often. Also, I get the occasional weekend off...maybe one per month. I stay because the money and benefits are incredible and this is the path for me to meet my long term financial goals while maintaining the quality of life I want to live.

When I leave work at 7am, I have to go home, do one or two weekly chores, cook myself a meal, clean up, maybe have an hour or two to wind down, then I go to bed. This gives me about 6 hours of sleep before I have to do it over again.

I would like to go out and meet new people on my rare off-days but, because I work graveyard, my schedule is opposite everyone else's (your 7pm is my 7am and vice versa). It is extremely hard for me to switch to a daylight schedule for one or two days off, only to have to switch back. 

I am reluctant to use dating apps because, at my age, I'm looking for more of a long-term partner than a hook-up. I need someone willing to work with me toward a common goal. I don't have any social hang ups and haven't had any real difficulty with dating in the past. It's just with my current schedule, I don't know what I should be doing or where I should be looking.

I can’t fucking sleep until 4-5 am, or sometimes can’t sleep at all. Sometimes I wake up after 3 hours of sleep, sometimes 13. That fucks with my diet, my workout routine, my work, and every other fucking thing. The reason? I’m too busy feeling petty about my sad fucking life. 

Every single night when the sun goes down, my depression kicks in. One night after another, another, and another I have to go to bed alone. I have to hug my pillow because I can’t remember the last time someone genuinely hugged me. I can’t remember the last time I held hands with someone. I can’t remember the last time I hung out with a group of friends and just had fun talking. 

I don’t know if I’m sexually lonely, or just lonely. Or both. I walk around the city at night for miles because I don’t wanna go back to my lonely ass apartment. Because I know exactly what’s gonna happen if I go back. I’m gonna get depressed, my anxiety is gonna kick in, and I’m gonna feel literal pain in my chest. I almost threw up from the feeling last night. 

But even walking outside isn’t good for me. I see guys with girls walking down to parties, or even a group of guys just chatting and laughing at shit. I’m a fucking nobody on the street with no one to walk with. No group to hangout with. No girl to hold in my arms. 

I spend hours in the shower sometimes, just standing there for no fucking reason. I have a lot of self control, but I’m feeling myself getting more and more inclined to pour a shot of whiskey every night. (I don’t though, when I started drinking I made myself a rule: never drink ‘cause you’re sad…but I’m afraid if this keeps on for a couple more months, as it already has for over years now, I’m gonna lose control) 

I am angry all the fucking time. I feel like smashing every other thing that I see, I can’t wipe the frown of my face sometimes, and every little thing annoys me. That random email notification, pen falling down from my desk, someone speaking too loudly outside my room…this things have started to infuriate me.

I don’t know what to do. I just know I can’t live my life like this.

He said it sounds good, and that Thursday or Friday will probably be best but he needs to work out a schedule with a friend.  And that his family is out of town for the weekend. 

Now I’m basically just going through a loop of wondering if he really is planning things out with a guy friend or if that’s code for waiting on the call of another woman he likes better.  I may very well be overthinking as I’m aware I do that in the early stages of dating due to possible anxiety.  As background, I should mention after our first meet he said he can’t wait til we can meet again, and apologized for being chatty because he was apparently nervous.  And I certainly didn’t really detect red flags in the weeks we talked.

I am now at the stage in my life where I know exactly what I want in a man and I dont want to settle. There are certain key factors in a mate that I wont waver on and some that I'll let slide. Most importantly when ready I plan to date intentionally with marriage being the end goal.

As for myself on the other hand I am hyper aware that there are several things that need work on me. I am not ready to date until I fix those issues within myself. Once I can get a better grip on my mental/physical health then and only then will I consider dating. I'm also tied up when it comes to free time as well (personal life issues). I dont think it would be wise nor fair to a SO if I dont have time to devote to a relationship. 

Now that I've laid out the reasons I cant date atm how tf do I get my brain, body, and heart on the same page? I know I shouldn't but I get so lonely at times. I have no friends, no social life, no job (see: personal life issues). I dont want to date casually or sleep around either.

It's not that I dont have prospects either. I have had to resort to pushing people away because I dont want to hurt anyone in the process of bettering myself but it's so damn hard. It would also be incredibly selfish to just use someone emotionally as I figure my shit out. I also run the risk of catching some serious feelings for someone who I know I am incompatible with but lust has a way of getting the best of you.
