0,qkgers,1635780451,In love with my rebound,"
After a long term relationship of 5 years I registered on dating sites and had several dates. Most were disappointing and boring. But the last one... I felt so different. Reborn. Charmed. In love almost even. I think about him constantly. I have always (and still do) loved my ex dearly and so am confused. So much so that I don't even know if I would go back to my ex if I knew my rebound had these feelings mutual. Unfortunately there is a big distance between us (literally we live in 2 different continents). I'm sadder than before. I thought I'd date to forget my ex, but now I feel like I'm having a second heartbreak. 

Anyone else have experience falling in love with your rebound?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkgers/in_love_with_my_rebound/
1,qkghk2,1635780660,"Advice please! Amazing dates 1 and 2, date 3 suggested by him, but he asked for a delay. What should my next moves be?","I've met this guy through OLD. We have amazing chemistry, so much in common. He initiated a kiss with me on the first date which I enthusiastically reciprocated. He also did the same on date 2. He is engaged in person, remembers details of previous conversations, tactile in both sexy and gentle ways. He gives me lots of compliments on both my looks and character (I do the same to him). He seems incredibly interested. The only thing is that he doesn't text much (if at all) between the dates, but always responds enthusiastically if I do. I actually initiated date 2, as I'm not shy about letting someone know I am interested.

He opened up on the second date about his anxiety. He apologised for not having messaged, and had been worrying about his not doing so, because of where he was at. He opened up about his father passing away earlier this year. I empathised, and listened. I said I understood his struggle with anxiety as I had been through it myself. 

He suggested an activity for date 3, but let me know there might be a 'delay' as he processes some stuff. It sounds like he is going through it. I said he should take whatever time he needs. We parted ways with a passionate kiss and he said that he did want to hear from me between now and then. 

What do I do? Friends have suggested leaving it a week before I message him to check in generally. I know it is not about me, but I feel a little worried that he is not messaging in between despite his explanation. I have been hurt before, and I am wary (perhaps cynical) that I will be messed around. But I like to take someone at their word and be patient.

2,qkgi5n,1635780705,"22F, what am I doing wrong?","22F, never been on a date or had a relationship. I have been asked out once by a very overbearing and clingy guy (turned down the offer due to multiple red flags), but other than that I don’t receive much male attention in public or on apps. When I’ve tried initiating, I get blown off or ghosted (hung out with this guy in a group setting not long ago which went very well, tons of chemistry, exactly my type, and he bought me a drink. I said I’d love to go for coffee with him when he’s free, and after saying he’d see what was going on he never followed through. I gave him my number and haven’t heard back). This one hurt. 

I’m relatively tall (5’9”), curvy but physically fit/healthy, very pale with long black hair, usually dress a mix of casual and alternative, and I put great effort into my appearance and hygiene. I wear makeup most days, but it is tasteful and by no means too much. My hobbies are fitness, cinema (I’m BIG into movies), various collections (artwork, oddities). I currently work a boring “gap year” job (taking a break between MS and PhD) but will be a professor and research scientist by age 27.

My friends think I can’t get dates because I am too intimidating or am “too good” for them (they probably say this because I earned a Master’s degree 2 years early and have a clear career trajectory in an intense subject) but this is confusing to me. I’d think a guy would be interested in a dedicated and smart woman who knows what she wants (guys like this are definitely a turn on for me), so what gives? I put effort into reaching out on Tinder/Hinge, I get matches and responses, but the guy either just wants to smoke or have a one night stand; or when one of us asks about a date, I’m either ghosted before we can plan it or they mention they’re poly and/or smoke weed (both dealbreakers for me).  

Everyone tells me to use apps, because they are in a happy X year long relationship thanks to them, but I’ve got nothing. Meeting people in person is very hard for me, other than random occurrences, because I don’t have many friends where I currently live. I met the guy from earlier in the post through one of my two friends and I don’t know if I should call him out on leaving me hanging, or let it go and just be sad. I’d love to date casually and am open to an exclusive relationship, and everyone around me gets to have these experiences. I deserve love and happiness too but it seems off limits.

4,qkgpn7,1635781298,Why do women have such unrealistic looks standards compared to straight and gay men in modern dating?," P**ease, no misogyny.**

Not long ago I (M24) read an advice post on this sub saying that men should better themselves and meet the standards they want from women if they don't get dates, the main implication behind the thread was that men who are unsuccessful at dating are aiming too high. The thread was frustrating to read because, as a straight man, trying gay dating proved to me and will prove to you that you are not unattractive, most women (not all) just have unrealistic looks standards these days and I want to understand why

**I see too many men who are in my same situation on this sub and at this point I don't think they are all lying.** I literally find 95% of women my age  physically attractive. I'm 5'11"", fit, below average face, I have never had a woman interested in me sexually or romantically. I'm dateless: 0 matches on dating apps, no woman has ever approached me or shown any interest in real life etc. Yet I can get attention from gay men very easily when I look for it. I tried switching my preference to gay men on dating apps and my match rate was insanely high, 30-40% match rate, the same exact rate as average to above average women on straight OLD so I was being judged the same way straight men judge women. I was shocked, I matched with men of all looks levels, hundreds and hundreds of matches, including  hot guys. I received so many cute messages and compliments, I literally never felt so desired. Meanwhile  I even swiped left on hot women to not waste likes since I've never matches with one.  I tried changing my bio, I  think it's good but I wanted to see whetehr it was a problem to women or not, I tried differnt bios that did not represxent me just to experiment, some were written by women I know and some were templates I found on the internet, results? Still 0 matches from women and tons from gay men.

 I'd say it's safe to assume that most gay men my age (24) find me physically/sexually attractive, this percentage is close to 0 with women. And this is not just me, this is every average to below average looking straight guy who has tried the gay dating experience. **When I tried gay dating, I literally felt attractive for the first time in my life.**  And it's not like women do not find anyone attractive through pictures, inspired by many online experiments I saw online I tried creating a fake profile with pictures of a hot man. Suddenly tons of women matched with me and messaged me, even more shockingly they kept messaging me even when I purposedly added red flags in my bio (criminal background,  grammar mistakes  et simila.   If gay and straight men can find the average and below peson attradctive, women seem to  feel the initial physical attraction only towards a minority of people.

I can't believe there are people who think straight men are being judged like straight women are or that we straight men are aiming too high, it's so absurd. If I were gay I wouldn't be in this sad situation at all, unfortunately this is what dating looks like for most straight men and I want to understand why.  **Why do women apprently have such unrealistic looks standards compared to straight and gay men in modern dating?**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkgpn7/why_do_women_have_such_unrealistic_looks/

I shouldn’t have because during our date (which lasted 1 1/2 hours which was more than challenging for me - should’ve left sooner) he did not once ask me questions about myself. I am a pretty good conversationalist and conversation usually flows but only if you give me something to work with. He really didn’t.

She said it was very painful because she wasn’t into it. I asked her did she tell him to stop. She said she rebuffed him. She did admit a few times she did ask him to stop but said he wanted what he wanted and she just grit her teeth and endured the pain several times. Her body wasn’t into it and responded accordingly, hence the pain from penetration which probably was a very dry or nearly dry penetration which would cause a lot of pain for her. 

It sounds like to me her ex husband raped her and I mentioned to her it sounds like the R word / Sexual Assault when she was married. She did say that she had to get drunk at times to endure it and he was mentally and emotionally abusive (she said never physically but after hearing this, it sounds like sexually abusive too). She has been out of this marriage for 20+ years now but I could see while we were discussing it, it was painful and we did pivot away from it. 

She mentioned that her relationship after she got divorced she could not have sex with her boyfriend because she was scared of how painful it would be. She says she is over it but I want to be sure I am very sensitive to this past trauma and supportive. I am not sure if it is an issue where she does not want to fully accept (at least verbally say out loud) that she was raped / sexually assaulted or maybe she does not see it that way as a protection mechanism. She mentioned that she or her son won’t even tell her ex she is in a new relationship because he (although remarried with a child outside of his marriage) will probably try to interfere in it. It sounds like he believes it believed that he owned her. I could be wrong.

They knew each other since they were 19 and got married out of college. I am just heartbroken to hear this and I love this woman to pieces.

Am I wrong for thinking she was raped / sexually assaulted by her husband even though her body responded accordingly by not getting wet causing her lots of pain?

31,qki5tm,1635785381,Is it weird to take a major break from social dating app,"I'm almost 30 at the end of the year. I've been using dating apps since 2014 or so . Tbh that's when I felt my dating life when downhill. When I would meet a  sweet guy they were either young or not ready to commit or just got out of a relationship. Or the classic some were pure jerks. one 2nd date  went Soo bad that involved cops and the guy stealing my stuff. 

I'm not dating to just date. I am wanting to find that guy who accepts me then me changing into the woman they want. 

After that bad date I met my recent ex. He was everything I wanted, did things I prayed to see in my future partner but mental health played a factor. He is from a small town and mental illness didn't exist there. He is still a guy I truly still love and talk but he has some things to handle of course. Also he doesn't want kids and after much thinking I do just a bit later.
It seems like that's always the excuse or reason. I understand and want to give space when I meet someone like that. 

Ok back to my point is it weird to not want to use dating apps anymore, now that it's like how people meet now with COVID and shit. I'm not the most social personal. Heck my best relationship was a neighbor ex that was shy like me but he accepted my flaws and loved them. After that it was tinder exes. Sorry for this long post. I guess I have to meet people again the natural way like at work or around work more likely. And travel more. I just can't put myself back in that position with dating apps again. Soo much anxiety

34,qkicfp,1635785888,"Good on Paper, Makes me sick in person","Tl:dr: I’m semi recently out of a long term relationship and a guy is coming on really strong. He’s good on paper but is that enough to date on when I’m not attracted or should I wait for attraction/love? Read for full background. Also posted on r/dating_advice

I (23f) recently am out of a 3 year long relationship with A (33m). He was the only person I have ever been even remotely attracted to, dated, kissed, etc. but I genuinely love him and everything about him. He is super kind and the calmest most loving person, that I would happily spend the rest of my life with. But he is going through a transition period, a mild crisis, where he honestly doesn’t know what to do both life and work wise, in part from the pandemic, or how long figuring it out would take, so he ended things so I would not be left waiting for him to figure it out. I took it hard but we are still fully friends and talk daily still.

It has been around 5 months sense then and I am still a little fragile, but a male friend B (31m), that I’m not really close with and is more of an acquaintance, has become super flirty, especially over text and constantly holding my hand or being relatively touchy when in person. I had been playing it off with jokes but then people around us, friends and my mom included, have started telling me that I should give him a chance. We have a lot in common hobby wise and B is good on paper but I am not physically attracted and some things about him bother me, like his intensive flirting. I genuinely do not know if I am being superficial about his appearance, if I am just not ready to try and date again or if I just genuinely am not attracted to people in general with the one and only exception of A so far. He’s not terrible looking but even seeing old photos of him and trying to think of him that way makes me really sick.

After some pressing from friends, I asked B if he’s just being friendly with his flirting or if he really is interested in dating. He says he really wants to go out with me. Because of the pressure, I said that we can hang out more, go on a date and kinda see where it goes. That opened the door to him asking me things like my ideal date, my favorite flower, my ring size, how things ended with A, and even if I was a virgin (which was his top question because quote ‘you have an innocence about you’). I now really feel sick about the situation because while I appreciate his seemingly genuine interest, I just don’t see him that way and it’s really too fast for not even going out on a date yet. I think I really made a mistake on saying we can see how things go.

My mom says to give things some time because I might just need to spend more time with him to see if I can be attracted to him and that he has a lot to offer me.

My mutual friends with B say that he would be really lucky to have me and now are even starting to speak poorly of A for being selfish. That being said while they all know each other, A is not really friends with them so I understand why they are choosing B’s side but I don’t think that gives them a right to talk so poorly about someone I love to me. 

I even talked to A about things and he said I should do what’s best for myself and that nobody should pressure or talk me into anything and to do whatever I’d like or is best for myself.

So all that being said, should I still give B a chance and see if the attraction grows?
Or should I stop things now because I really do feel sick over everything?
Do you wait to feel love again?
Or if I do give it time to wait and see, how long should I give it?

So on my last date from bumble, we really hit it off so I started asking hard questions that I feel like I should know upfront, like how long his last relationship was, if he wanted anything serious, etc. Idk why but I’m just so used to mixed messages &amp; being led on, especially with online dating, that I felt like it was right to see if we want the same thing.

We swapped answers and he didn’t seem stunned or uncomfortable. We even ended up making out &amp; he told me he wanted to see me again, but I haven’t heard from him for 2 days, so now I feel like I probably scared him off.

Turned out we had a lot of common interests and we started talking for an hour or so. The whole group then went to a club together. Upon entering the club, I'm waiting to buy a drink and the girl was a few people ahead with her girlfriend. All the sudden a drink gets passed to me and it turns out she bought me a drink, never has happened to me before (possibly the strongest drink in mankind also), and then started talking to me again. When her friends wanted to go deeper in, to the dance floor, she put her arm around my waist to usher me along with her. Then unfortunately a little while later her girlfriend had some type of meltdown so they had to roll without any notice.

Usually I never look up people I just met on Instagram in an effort not to be seen as creepy, but I've been single for a while and figured this chick is making advances, I should see where it leads. I followed her, then she followed me back and started liking many of my old photos. I decided to message her, just saying hey it was nice to meet you the other night and check this band out (we were both super into the same type of music). We proceeded to message for hours, pretty much continued by her. Always following up with a question, asking me about what I do etc. Eventually I asked her if she wanted to go to this cool art exhibit near me next weekend which was related to some of her other interests, and she replied saying she will be with her boyfriend next weekend...lol. 

What the hell am I supposed to make of that? First instinct is to just say no problem and then never contact again, kinda shady. Also it could be that she's about to leave this guy or something cause she was acting so obviously flirty, or maybe they have some open type of relationship.

I F(23) dated M(24) for 4 months. And boy I fell hard for him, making excuses to his actions which not always made sense. 
So I've come to conclusion that he used me as a rebound because even though I expressed how upset I am about him not spending time with me and he still didn't make effort to come see me that same day when he lives 20min away. I've told him that few times (happened a lot) and he listened but never really done anything about it. All he did is apologize that I feel like this and repeat how much he loves me and cares for me etc yet not saying that he will try and do better or just come down and prove me that he means what he says.
So I finally admitted that to myself, and I would like to move on from it although we didn't officially end it (because he didn't come, just messages like if we were 15).
 

Feels like my heart been ripped out of my chest, and everything is still in the air and I don't know how to deal with it. He didn't reach out to me the conversation ended just him saying that he cares and loves me and that I should know that and he wished me goodnight and I just said that if he did he would've been with me at that time not chatting away and that's all. Ideally would like to make this work but since he doesn't seem to be able to be honest with himself I don't know it would be possible.

Except this one instance. 

We go to this one Halloween party and she is dressed like a sexy devil and she drinks a good amount but not crazy drunk. She's very loud and kind of attention seeking and I don't care obviously I want her to have her moment and have fun and she is. I was wearing a full frog costume and was very stoned and usually when i get stoned I go into observation mode and don't talk much.

I noticed that my girlfriend was flirty with my one particular friend that I have warned her about in the past. She keeps yelling to get his attention and keeps kind of gently punching his chest and grabbing his arms. I noticed when she would try to get anyone else's attention she wouldn't try as hard or touch them, just gives up right away.

There was also an instance where they kept locking eyes and she was flirting with him more while my friends girlfriend was there, whenever her back was turned they would look at each other. Like she was trying to steal his attention away from my friends girlfriend. And he was loving it.

I was just talking to a friend pretending not to notice and I'm sure my girlfriend had no idea I was noticing this.

Fast forward next day we have a talk and I don't leave anything out, I fully express my perspective. She pretty much denies that she was flirting. She says she remembers touching him but thought that kind of stuff was normal in my friend group. Denies locking eyes with him etc. Overall she was very sorry and didn't want to hurt me and says she had no idea she was flirting.

She was very sincerely but I sometimes feel like she has 2 versions. Like she gets drunk and doesn't realize she's flirting? Maybe I am paranoid? Am I looking into this too deep.

I feel like a girl asking a guy to grow/keep a beard is a double standard, as many females get offended if asked to change their hair, lose weight, or dress different.  
 
Is this a double standard? If it is, how do guys feel about it?  Would you rather someone swipe left if you don't have a beard, or ask if you're open to getting facial hair if compatible?

Personally, as long as my guy shows respect when sharing his preferences, I am open minded.  For example, I've worn my hair long, until it's length became unmanageable, then I kept it as long as I could when I did have to cut it.  But, I might get offended if meeting someone online or on a first date they said, ""I like long hair, you need to grow it out.""

But I also have a problem that I think a lot of people have, which is that I’m just not interested in the men that pursue me and the men I would be interested in do not pursue me, I guess reflective of the fact I may not have realistic standards relative to myself. 

I would say I’m cute but not hot, generally likable but not extremely cool or alluring. I have a good job, lots of friends, interests and hobbies etc, but these types of things don’t always translate into being immediately romantically desirable, especially for women and especially in the age of dating apps where looks are in my opinion even more influential.  

I generally do buy into the dating philosophies of “if they like you you’ll know”, the guy should be more into it than the girl is, etc, and have also personally found that situations where I wait for the guy to be proactive work out much better than situations where I try to be proactive. 

I know this isn’t a totally unique situation to be in so I’m wondering what people’s thoughts are.

58,qkjoq3,1635789517,"A girl stares at me a lot, but never approaches me","We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I start to pay attention to her as I have a bit of a crush, and I realize that she looks at me, very frequently. I might be working in the hall, she'd walk by, and she'd glance over her shoulder to look at me. She might get something out of her backpack on the floor, and while leaning over she'll look, and she'll glance over while a teacher is talking or sometimes outright stare for seconds. I haven't been keeping track, but this as been going on for at least 3-4 weeks. We make eye contact on occasion, it's been more frequent the past week as I've been looking directly at her more to try to get her attention, rather than keep her in my peripheral vision like I had been.

So, two weeks ago I decide to talk to her in my physics class since I have friends that sit at her table, and seating isn't strict as our teacher wants us to work on assignments together. When I am over there, we talk quite a bit, and can hold a conversation easily as we have a lot of classes and both play soccer. If I wait outside before class and end up next to her, she will start talking to me, but in neither class does she ever approach me.

She's normally a very shy person, she talks very quietly when talking to people she doesn't know, but is pretty talkative to me, and not quiet. Her being such a shy person is what surprises me about the staring, it's so much that if she's giving an analysis on something we read in English, she won't look at the teacher or the class but she will look towards me out of the corner of her eye. At her table in physics, there is another girl that I hardly talk to, but one time I was listening to the other girl, and she was too, but she kept glancing at me to see how much I was paying attention to the other girl.

The issue is, now in physics we moved seats, so I don't have an excuse to go and talk to her. I asked for her number last Thursday after a class where we spent a bit extra time talking, and I texted her but she was pretty slow to respond.

Does anyone have a guess why she might stare so much but never initiate much?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkjoq3/a_girl_stares_at_me_a_lot_but_never_approaches_me/

So I finally asked her why she never wants to come over it always seems like an excuse and she said because it means a relationship and she is busy with nursing school but she has no problem going out for dinner or drinks and spending time doing that because she says that’s different.

My last relationship was disastrous. I am going to try and make a long story short: For years she was ""sick"", she kept saying she was suffering from hypoglycemia and could not do chores around her apartment or study or pretty much anything. So it was up to me to help her while I was trying to study and manage my own life. In the end she started gaslighting me, saying that if I did more for her, she would be better. And in the end she joined a cult that told her she had to break up with me because I have demons in my midst. This whole ordeal hit me really hard and took years to rebuild from. 

I don't miss her one bit, not at all. But I think that whole ordeal and the relationships I had before her (which wasn't sunshine and rainbows either!) has made me afraid of getting in a relationship. What if I meet a lovely woman, who at first is nice and caring and all that but later the whole thing turns sour, and it brings on a storm that messes me up mentally and turns my life upside down?

And I could of course fully embrace the bachelor life. I could just spend the rest of my life here on my computer and games and books and movies. Go to work and go straight home. But something tells me that is not the optimal way of life for me. 

So my question is: How do I overcome this fear of relationship?

Hey!

Im a young guy, who recently started to talk to a girl in my school. We hit if off really well, and talked to each other in a nice way. I started developing feelings for her, and she would slowly open up to me a bit more, trying to get me alone some places, and striking up small talk.

Well that was untill we had talked for a few weeks and she suddenly is insanely hot and cold, meaning she sometimes, will come and greet me multiple times in a short amount of time, and go out of her way to talk to me, just asking me small talk stuff. The hot and cold stuff will happen pretty instantly, and could happen on the same day.

I even confronted her about this, and asked her ""Why are you being so cold to me all of a sudden, we seemed to really hit it off"", and she instantly refused the idea, that she was acting in that way, and reassured me that she thought i was really cool. The same day i asked her this, we would in a big friend group go eat, and we sat across from each other, and she would lay her shoes on mine under the table and start tapping on them for like 40 seconds, obviously feeling mine under under.

She could go a whole day ignoring me, not initiating talks, and just avoiding eye contact mostly, but then she will text me about something and seem really friendly again in tone, laughing at jokes i text back and furthering the conversation.

Now i have not even flirted with her ever, i've kept everything on a friendly level. I like to be good friends, and really get to know a person before asking them out. Just been asking normal stuff, that a friend would, interests stuff like that.

93,qkmzfz,1635798479,How Effed Am I?,"Greetings people of the internet! I heard you like drama, and boy do I have some! This is my first post, apologies in advance for how long it is. Alright, a little background: I'll be 30 in a week, and a few months ago I was tragically dumped, which as is normal, resulted in going some pretty dark places in my head, and I am still trying to fully recover from it. However, within the last month, I decided to try and get back into the dating scene, can't just be depressed and lonely forever right? So I asked a crush of mine out for dinner, and she agreed. She's a few years older, and has kids, which doesn't bother me at all. The date was perfect, I didn't push to take it further, and we scheduled a second meet for the following weekend. I hadn't felt so excited for anything in a long time. Fast forward to second date, at her house, kids are home, but they have friends over, so they're preoccupied. So I kissed her, well out of view of the house. Everything was perfect, except we may have gotten overzealous, and the younger kid saw us kissing, and proceeded to freak out and call her dad. He's out of the picture, and lives far away, both him and the mom are done with each other, but for some reason he still trys to get involved by way of having the daughter more or less spy on her mom.... And I certainly didn't intend to step on any non-existent toes. Here's the kicker, the dad was also a friend of mine, but we haven't exactly kept in contact at all in the last year or two, so as me and the mom are outside still kissing it up, he calls my phone. ""Wow, that's awkward timing to get a call from him"", when I didn't answer, he calls the mom, who also didn't answer. She then realizes her daughter saw us and called him, and proceeds to go inside and try and de-escalate the hysterical kid while I stay outside feeling more awkward than I think I ever have in my life.  It didn't stop us from continuing to fornicate the rest of the evening, though, and we talked about seeing each other more often, which was great and I was excited about. I spent the night, in a different room, and other than a bit of unexpected drama, it seemed fine. The next day I go home feeling both triumphant and also deeply terrible. I genuinely care about the mom and the kids, I've known them for years, and I feel like I've traumatized the poor girl... I'm sure she thinks I'm the devil, now. So I talk to the mom and apologize, even though she said it wasn't my fault, I know it was. Now she wants to take a step back until this situation is resolved. This is the first time I've been with someone with older children, am I effed? Is that the end of something that had potential, simply because of a bit of kid drama? And believe me, I know how important kids are to their parents (at least when the parents aren't shitty people) but I don't think I really did anything wrong, we are adults after all, however, I still feel terrible about it, and this is all new to me. What should I do? Anyone else ever been in a situation like this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkmzfz/how_effed_am_i/

97,qknbps,1635799408,"My bf followed a girl he met at a party on insta, Should I feel embarrassed or was my reaction okay?","
Me (23f) and my new bf (24m) of a few months went to a party of my friends so he could meet my friends.

It was going wonderfully. He gelled with everyone. There were a few girls that showed up that I and my girl friends didn’t know. One of them I noticed was frequently walking up to my bf and talking with him, and he was being friendly. At one point I was away outside and he played a round of beer pong with her as his partner. I overheard bits of conversation and there was nothing obviously crossing any boundaries. 

Her body language was clear she was being flirty and was into him and I pointed this out to him later in the night but he brushed it off. But the insecurity in me gave me a sick feeling in my stomach. 

Yesterday, we were chatting and he stated that that girl was hitting on him. I said thanks for acknowledging that she was in fact hitting on you. I made a joke that that girl was not even invited to the party. He then brought up that she asked him to follow her on insta, which he agreed to do. I was on my phone at this time so I looked her up and they did follow eachother. Then I noticed he had liked one of her pics. I asked him why and he said they went through her feed together and that’s when someone liked that pic.
 
This kinda gave me a gross feeling. I told him I would have rathered he had shut her down and not added her, cuz clearly she was flirty and trying to find a way to keep in touch with him. He said he was drunk, just being nice and had no bad intention. He added in that she isn’t his type and wouldn’t have done anything physical (which was not my point at all but he added that). I said I know, but I found it disrespectful. He apologized at this point, and went to go lie down. I could tell he was a bit frustrated. 

I am a chronic overthinker, and can get jealous easily although I don’t act on it. 

Then I started thinking, and I thought maybe overreacted, and I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. When he woke up I apologized to him and told him he didn’t do anything wrong. I said I know he was trying to be friendly in a new party environment where he doesn’t know anyone. I even said it is a small insecurity of mine to deal with this stuff. He thanked me and said he understood where I was coming from.

Now I can’t help but feel embarrassed. I really care about this guy and I feel like I picked a fight over something immature and it will cause him to think differently. I’m also a little torn because the idea of him entertaining another girl makes me sick to my stomach. 

My friend and mom who I both asked for their opinions said my feelings are valid, but likely not a red flag in terms of his actions. I also liked how respectful he was towards me when I brought it up and when I said sorry. 

I looked at her profile this morning as I was doing my morning insta creep, and noticed he unliked the pic, but still follows her. Not sure what it means but I’ve decided to let it all go.


I guess I’m looking for an external opinion on the situation. Has something like this happened to you before? How was it handled? Did I make myself look stupid?

98,qknbuo,1635799419,"I am not happy with my fiancé, but he gives me no reason to end it.","So here’s the thing. We’ve been together for 3 years, and engaged for two. 
Our relationship is boring as heck. 
We are hardly sexual or even affectionate. I’m not happy, I don’t feel loved and at this point we just act like good friends. It’s awkward and weird. 
But he’s such a great guy! He’s nice, and he’s done so much for me personally and professionally. 
We got two cute as can be kitties and a beautiful apartment and we both work for the same company (he’s my boss)
But we both don’t get what we need from this relationship. I’m bored, he’s bored, we both don’t want to make effort for each other because we both just don’t want to. We’re still in our 20’s, me mid 20’s him late. But I feel like we rushed things. 
I’ve recently expressed I do not want to marry him, for other reasons (parents kind of ruined the whole idea of marriage for me) 
And he was fine with that. I’ve expressed I’m bored and unhappy and nothing has changed. I’m a very honest person and do not keep secrets, if I have an issue we will discuss it. But how many times can we communicate and not change anything?
I want to be single again. I miss that feeling everyday. But again, besides being boring and basically just friends I have no reason to leave. 
Plus, as I stated above he is my boss at work and I love our cats SO much and I don’t want it to be a messy breakup, if it happens. I love him a lot, but I don’t feel IN love with him anymore.
I don’t know what to do. I just want to be happy again… 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What were the next steps you took? Open to advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qknbuo/i_am_not_happy_with_my_fiancé_but_he_gives_me_no/
99,qknea3,1635799603,"I hate blocking people, but I can’t take this anymore.","I met this guy at the gym and gave him my snap last weekend. We chatted throughout the weekend and then come the work week I was busy and didn’t really pay attention to my phone much. 

I do normally respond at some point, but given my job I will go hours without looking at my phone. He would sent me a morning Snapchat that I answered around 4-5pm that day which was fine, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way when he responded back within 15 seconds. The next day, when I didn’t answer for a few hours through, he proceeded to keep sending me more. This just progressively got worse throughout the week. Thursday I was in meetings all day and then had a late class and had my phone off. I had a total of ten unopened snapchats from him and I got a bit creeped out by the clinginess and never answered. He is now blowing up my phone. 

I get the mature thing would be to just say I’m not interested and move on. Normally I would, but given the intense clinginess and the chance I’ll be seeing him around I’m a bit nervous to do so.
