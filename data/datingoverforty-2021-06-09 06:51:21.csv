0,nvw3hv,1623245714,How to stay cool headed?,"I'm 48m, after 25 year relationship, divorced last year. Last couple of years of my marriage I spent basically alone, and now I really need someone to care of, talk to, doing things, just be together. The feeling is almost physical. I met a couple of people since and every time I feel a connection with a person I also feel this unreasonable thrill like my brain wants to jump into relationship after one, two dates. I see that and I try to force myself to keep a level head knowing how it may be a put off but I suffer when I see they don't contact me as often as I'd like. I try not to text or call them too often, not be pushy, but it's so hard, and I'm afraid I fail very often.

3,nvxh47,1623249488,Can y‚Äôall share the lowdown on meetup?,"Hi there helpful-dating-over-40s,

Contemplating getting out there after divorce (48F) and read that many folks have enjoyed meetup dot com groups. I‚Äôm in a big city so I think it should be fairly varied in options. When I signed up, however, it was a little underwhelming at first glance. 

There were what looked like two singles groups. Ok, so I guess that‚Äôs an option. I‚Äôm unfortunately the age cut off, so I can‚Äôt sit at the kids‚Äô (including to 47) high top table at the bar. Probably ok, but still a factor. I wish it was a more open age range given I‚Äôve met many interesting people across their forties vs only my age + 20 years. 

I love love games and trivia, but the trivia groups looked much younger. And the games were‚Ä¶ more ‚ÄúEuropean strategy games‚Äù or role playing. I guess not everyone wants me to kick their ass in Scattergories, Sorry, or Boggle. Lol. 

Some wine groups - I could consider one of those. Do people Uber to those? Just not sure I want to mix my anxiety about being single again with liquid courage. 

I found a True Crime Book Club but it‚Äôs 10 women. (Might also scare away my future lover‚Ä¶üî™)

SO, those of you who enjoy Meetup dot com, could you please share some successes and strategies? 

Please know my comments above aren‚Äôt intended to be a way to look for an out. And I do NOT see it as a dating app - I know it‚Äôs just to get out there and meet people. Socialize. That would be particularly helpful for me because a lot of my life here was ‚Äúcouple driven‚Äù before our split. I‚Äôm fairly outgoing, feel like I can have broad conversations, but it‚Äôs still hard to make new friends as an adult. 

I just like to try things with a bit of a strategy in mind, so I‚Äôm already trying to put myself out there. Would love to hear your thoughts!

I have been divorced 5 years and just started dating (49f) last year.  I met a wonderful divorced man similar in age that I am exclusive with who has been met my kids and family and we are very happy.  

I have a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù ex-husband who was brutal during divorce who almost left me bankrupt. I temporarily lost custody due to false accusations (have custody now), lost home and was dragged through the legal system for 3 years.  I contributed to the issues by fighting him but eventually gave in when I was broke, got custody and we settled.  He had a superior legal team.  

Our final decree has some strange rules I agreed to in order to get a settlement in which one is I won‚Äôt date anyone for a certain time period which has now elapsed.

Last month my ex found out I have a bf and began harassing me.  Sending me hate mail, followed by messages that he still loves me, asking me on dates, and in the same day calling me the worst mistake of his life and calling me horrible names that I won‚Äôt repeat.  He accuses me of harming the children by dating.  I do not respond because he has done this for years and he cannot do anything legally to me that I won‚Äôt prevail in.  

I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with him and my bf wants to help but I am not sure this is his battle to fight.  He has never met or seen my bf and uses our children to try to get info but they stay out of it.

So I've been in the dating pool for a few years and noticed something interesting (at least for me), it feels like interest in my waxes and wanes based on the time of the year.  

  
For example - Even in my younger days, before I got married and divorced, it seemed that between the months of May and September the dating pool seems to dry up for me.. my usual 2-3 conversationships disappear, I no longer get matches on apps, and I just felt like I generally have a harder time meeting new people altogether.  In a way, I appreciate this break, as it gives me time to work on myself and spend time with my kids, but on the other hand, FUD and FOMO come into play.

Today I get a message saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been single a while‚Äù from some one who has clearly seen my profile during that time. 

While I didn‚Äôt respond, what I don‚Äôt get is why people view being single and more specifically being single a while, as a flaw.

I personally would rather be single than waste any more of my life being with someone who isn‚Äôt right. This is a choice. Personally, I respect people that don‚Äôt just need anyone but are holding out for someone who enhances their life like I am. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time either. I‚Äôve had friends say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry... you‚Äôll find someone‚Äù like I‚Äôm currently incomplete until I do. (My response - wasn‚Äôt at all worried... lol) Meanwhile they are suffering through loveless relationships. Being partnered, not matter if you are happy or not, seems to trump being single. 

The way I see it is I could be like them - with someone but unhappy/bored/apathetic. Or living my life, meeting new people, spending time on things like working out and knowing any minute I could meet my person. But yet the perception is still that single = flawed.

HARD time matching with guys my *own* age. I initially resisted even entertaining the notion of dating these guys (‚Äúcubs‚Äù they‚Äôre called ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) but they keep pursuing me.

Then a texted the day before our scheduled date, he canceled, saying he felt the age gap was just too much. So I thought nothing of it and went on. Then the 24-year-old and I did a video chat before our first date and he kept going on and on about how young I look for my age. Anyway we met up for the date, which was at a coffee shop and everything was going well until my teenage daughter and her best friend FaceTime called me, wanting to show her friend‚Äôs new tattoo. My date‚Äôs demeanor changed, because I think he realized that I have kids almost his own age. So the date ended abruptly after that and I never heard back from him again. Still I moved on. Then I matched with a 34yo (so much closer to my age). He liked my profile first and asked me for my phone number. We were having great texting convos, until I sent him a picture of myself and then all of his texts abruptly stopped. Later that day I showed my gf the picture in question and she said I happened to look much older in that pic and said I never should have sent that one.

Ex is v judgemental and is likely to disapprove of bf for surface reasons, and my older child in particular is v close to his dad and likely to agree with him because that's his dynamic.

32,nwrh53,1623341550,OLD - How much does it matter to you that someone lives close to you?," Naturally, it's ideal if a dating match lives fairly close to the area that you live. But how picky are you on that? I went on a couple of dating apps again recently, and I feel like it would be nice to be able to sometimes meet up for impromptu things like going out to get some food (for example if you're hungry at 10PM on a Friday or Saturday) or something. Recently I was seeing someone who was about a 20 minute drive from me, and it was really easy for us to meet up like that, and I liked that (unfortunately, things didn't work out with her).

I initially set a 25 mile radius for searching on OLD, as a loose requirement, and there's a match I've been talking to who's about 30 miles away. Where I live, that could be about an hour drive, depending on traffic etc.. That isn't a huge deal, but I feel like it doesn't allow for spending time together very easily. The best times to meet with someone that far away would probably be on the weekends, as meeting up after work during the week if we wanted to could be difficult.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nwrh53/old_how_much_does_it_matter_to_you_that_someone/
33,nwtlfu,1623346848,Next Door Neighbor,"Neighbor (38 M) has been cordial and friendly for years (this is going on year 8 ). Working from home during the pandemic allowed me to casually observe his routine. Without fail, he leaves for work in the evening, rises early to make repairs/renovations on his home, and sometimes entertains guests from his home country.  

We‚Äôve started chatting at length while in our yards, taking trash to the curb, shoveling snow, etc.  Each conversation is easy and light. He keeps up his end of a chat, and thanks me each time. 
I‚Äôve learned He‚Äôs pretty straightforward; He wants a family, and considers a large family an expression of wealth and success.  I(43F) am intrigued to say the least, but unsure if I want more children. I have a HS aged child I raised as a single mother. Plus, I am wary of dating a neighbor. 

My better angels consider how warm, orderly, meticulous and grounded he seems. I am attracted to those qualities. He‚Äôs good with his hands. He has completely transformed his house on his own, and keeps things very neat. While on a tour of his house last summer, I noticed he‚Äôs got a degree in theology, raising my antenna even more. He‚Äôs not overly spiritual by any stretch of the imagination. Just warm and approachable. 

He made it clear he‚Äôs interested last summer when I mentioned I was seeing someone: ‚Äúput him on stand-by‚Äù. 
I like that too.

However, it was a tough year and half with covid, schedules, distance and kids. He begged and pleaded to make it work. This is the 5th or 6th time we had the same conversation where I felt like he just didn‚Äôt have time for us. I mean, I‚Äôm not super needy and have a lot of outdoor hobbies but in 6 months we went to breakfast ONCE! If we were to see each other it meant me driving an hour to his place after his kids were in bed. I had not met any of his family or friends nor did I meet his kids. Each time we had this discussion he promised he would change things to make time for us. I just asked how I could believe that after all of the other promises fell through. 

Our chemistry in person was undeniable. But the logistics of our relationship just did not seem like they were changing, growing or sustainable. I still sit here sad trying my best not to reach out to him. 

At the end he sad he saw forever with me, he has never loved or pleaded for someone to stay more than me. What I don‚Äôt understand is, why would he still just give me scraps of his time and keep me in the shadows of his life? Maybe I was just asking the wrong person. I think his intentions and love for me were true but that he just couldn‚Äôt manage us and his personal life.

Dated ended with a hug and kiss. Date two was the following week. We went to farmers market to shop and get lunch. We talked about my mom passing and that it had been a rough few months for me but getting better daily. Date three we went to casino for dinner and penny slots. I drove her home and she invited me in. We watched a movie and cuddled on the couch making out and drinking wine. She told me for our next date she wanted to come over to try a dinner that reminded me of my mom. She came over. We ate (she loved it and asked for recipe). She made sangria. We watched a bunch of episodes of Girlfriend Experience (her choice). It was late so I asked her to stay the night sleeping in my bed and I‚Äôd take the couch. She agreed and thanked me for being a gentleman. The next morning after she left I found a note under my pillow. It said ‚ÄúHad a wonderful time and can‚Äôt wait to see you again.  xoxoxo‚Äù.

This is uncharted territory for me so please be patient with me. 

Been with my BF for about 6 months now and things are going great and at a good pace. He is bringing me to a friend's birthday party this weekend and I just learned yesterday that it had a theme. His friend did say we can choose to dress up or not, whatever we do will be fine. I already had a dress in mind but this threw me for a little loop. While I could whip up something halfway decent to fit the theme, I don't know if I would be comfortable in it -- I tend to get awkward and shy with people I just met, so slapping on a costume on top of that will dial my awkward levels way up.  ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" is the inspiration. My original dress  has a great flower print and is a deeper jade green. As for a possible costume, I do have another green dress that i wanted to use for a Renaissance Fair but did not end up going. Was going to go to a craft store and get flowers to decorate it as well as my hair.  

TL:DR - BF bringing me to meet his friends at a themed birthday party and I am torn between dressing up in costume or just going with a nice dress. I would like to make a good impression by adhering to the theme but I don't want to appear trying too hard. 

P.S. BF is not dressing up but tells me I wear whatever I want and it will be pretty either way. Yes, he knows the choices but gave me no preference lol.

45,nxjn6p,1623427861,How do you know when the dating trial didn‚Äôt work?,"I went on a date with a guy a few weeks ago ‚Äî even posted about my first time as a POC going out with a white man. It went well overall. His wit and sense of humor is awesome and he actually knows how to be a gentleman. As in, he knows the etiquette and manners that I thought every guy under 60 on the planet made a pact to erase from history. I didn‚Äôt feel that extra attraction but his personality was so awesome I decided I‚Äôd give it at least two more tries if he wants to see me again. 

He was apparently interested. He asked me out again for a date 2 weeks later having learned that work was crazy through the end of the month. Considerate and patient. The next date was even better. We were able to talk less superficially and he still made me laugh. The attraction still wasn‚Äôt quite there yet for me but I felt a little progress and started seeing the potential. He seemed attracted to me based on his compliments but was still very respectful and I felt comfortable he wouldn‚Äôt make a move unless I was ready. 

Then he asked me to go out again the very next day, which in retrospect seemed a little too fast but I wanted to, so I did. It wasn‚Äôt as perfect but it was still cool and I was having fun. As soon as we paid the check, I saw that my son (17) who was staying at his father‚Äôs had tried to call several times. Without going into detail, my son is going though a mental health crisis. Anyway, I told my date that I need to go home because I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt one of those quick calls you take outside of a loud restaurant and try to brush off (I was right). He suggested I take the call from the car for privacy while he walks around, but it is such a high traffic area there‚Äôs no way to block out the noise and distractions. He seemed disappointed but very understanding and even followed up with a text saying it‚Äôs too bad the date was cut short but he loves that I‚Äôm such a terrific mom and totally understands. Yay, right? 

Well, that was last Saturday and since then the texts have become more brief and sporadic. In fact he hasn‚Äôt texted for two days. I sent the last two, which were light, friendly and I think inviting, so I‚Äôm not inclined to text a third time. Does this mean we sort of just fizzle out? I‚Äôm such a newby to the dating thing (was married for &gt; 20 years). So, shall I consider this trial done and move on?  I‚Äôm not one to date several people at once. I‚Äôm too busy,  it‚Äôs too exhausting and I generally like the idea of focusing on one opportunity at a time. Maybe it‚Äôll get easier with time but it‚Äôs all just too new. 

Thoughts? Do I give it another week or tell him it was fun but I‚Äôm not feeling the chemistry or move on and if he contacts me let him know I moved on? I say move on because there is someone interested whom I‚Äôve sort of been avoiding out of respect for this guy.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nxjn6p/how_do_you_know_when_the_dating_trial_didnt_work/

I know we can say 'well I look at the profile too', but are we looking at the profile before you 'Swipe Left' ?

It's not a criticism, truly. I'm really asking you.

I guess I'm thinking that as I've gotten older I realize that the most beautiful and amazing people I've known, cared about, and/or loved have outward physical beauty that doesn't matter. To be clear, I mean that their whole being is what's beautiful. Their appearance is of little importance in my desire to be around them.

I dunno. Maybe I'm in a different imaginary world. I want to be with with someone who cares about being together as much as being there for each other, someone who gets excited for the others happiness as much or more than their own, someone who is less worried about what can we do next and more about how great it is to have found real happiness, sometime who gets me as much as I get them. 

I know this probably seems weird coming from an older guy, but I've experienced enough and taken the time to learn from life that all the superficial crap just doesn't matter in the end.

I'm not saying I know how or where to meet this right person. Trust me, I'm clueless after the years out of dating. I just wonder , at this point, do I feel like wasting heartache or disappointment on Miss ""Swipe Right""? 

So, I ask again. Is an app really how I'm going  to find happiness? Maybe I'm not getting it. Any help/thoughts/direction would be appreciated.

49,nxr147,1623447718,A secret relationship?,"Some background: I've been divorced 2 years. I don't have a large family, but the family that I do have (mother, aunt, kids, and of course ex-husband) are not accepting of me dating. 

Even if I hypothetically mention dating again, I'm met with abuse, insults, threats.  My family puts my ex-husband on a pedestal, and they can't fathom me being with anyone other than him.  They have told me that they would never welcome or even speak to any new partner.  Older adults in my family encourage my kids to disrespect any man I speak to on a friendly basis.  

In reality, my ex is diagnosed with borderline personality and is emotionally, verbally and a bit physically abusive.  (My mother and my aunt are both abuse victims themselves, and I believe that's part of the reason they find my ex so wonderful.)

Regardless of what they think, I'm interested in dating again.  I'd prefer a serious, monogamous relationship.  I realize I'd never be able to introduce my new partner to my family.  And I know I'd go through a lot of abuse if they found out he existed. 
I'd be willing to be as open as he wanted with his friends and family. I also have a good sized group of friends with whom I'd be completely open about our relationship.

When do you decide it's not working out? On a first, second, or third date, do you tell the other person how you felt about the date, face to face, at the end of it? Later, by text? Do you mutually decide whether or not to give it another go if it's only been one or two dates? Or, if you're not feeling it, do you unilaterally say Thanks but no thanks?

It all feels so daunting, I guess because I'm worried how the other person will feel - I guess the tables will turn when I'm on the other end, dang it! - but yeah, how do you work up the courage to *actually communicate how you feel about another person or about the date, if how you feel is very ambivalent?*

Maybe part of the frustration is, if you've only been on a couple dates, it's very hard to tell how the other person feels, too.

Examples: what they wear/are they put together, should they smell good?Where in your day to day should they be most keen to find you? Should they just walk up to you?

I‚Äôll be polite and say ‚Äúhey hows it going?‚Äù If you have anything I can ask about I will at that point. If you have a dog, I will ask about him/her and if you ask ANYTHING personal about me the guy-stranger at this point I will now notice you and be interested (assuming attraction).

He is courting me, and we've been having a lot of fun (and some good intentional conversations). We share a lot of the same values and life goals, and definitely are attracted to one another. It is so amazing to meet others who share your own dating style/approach. Just sharing that encouragement to forge ahead with what you desire for yourself. It may mean that you have less dates yet if the dates are more quality and with people that also subscribe to a dynamic that feels healthy for you, it makes it so much easier to pave the way to have potential for long term (if that's what you want). We are still newly getting to know one another and not in an official relationship yet. However, we definitely are getting more intentional in our conversations and the desire to check messages or keep up new conversations is getting less, so I know I'm feeling like this could be a good fit to shift to the next step in coming weeks as we spend some more time together.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ny5ivq/were_rounding_7th_date/

I'm in a kind of a weird place in life. I don't have any kids and have never been married. I was in a relationship for 8 years (cohabitating) but haven't been in a long-term relationship since last fall. 

I've only recently gotten where I want to be with my career and am only now finishing up an MBA at 47, so I am definitely behind the curve compared to others in my age range. I've noticed that I have the most in common with, and have the most successful dates with, women that are in their mid-late 30s as it feels we are in a similar place in life. 

I have a lot of debt from completing my MBA (about 100k) but I have a 6-figure job with decent bonuses so I am working that off. 

I guess I just wanted to come in and introduce myself. I've gone on dates with at least 20 different women over the past 6 months and only met one that ended up in a short relationship. Dating in one's 40s is so frustrating!

I always thought I would get married (I didn‚Äôt). I always thought I would have kids (I didn‚Äôt).

I was deeply ready and pushing hard at 43 to get out there. And then COVID happened and everything was on pause.

My only family is my mom. I don‚Äôt have siblings, aunts uncles or cousins. I am asked for two emergency contacts on forms I only have my mom. 

My friends moved away a long time ago. I tried meetups and things in 2019 but I am such an odd person. I don‚Äôt really fit in anywhere.

This spring I was ready to move anywhere in the US. Maybe I would have better luck elsewhere. But prices of everything jumped well beyond what I can handle. I thought moving to where my mom‚Äôs friends moved to would at least be nice for her.

There is an old woman in my building that uses a walker, she must be late 80s or older. Every day she goes for a walk (so do I) and she is always with her mean assistant. The mean assistant lives with her and has a mean dog that lunges at and growls everyone, she is always on the phone and speaks a language I can‚Äôt quite make out. I have tried saying hello but she will usually glare at me or just fully ignore me. She puts out such an unpleasant vibe. But she is always there with the old lady.

After a few years of me smiling and nodding and sometimes waving (as I do for everyone in my building) the old lady finally says hello to me and we will do 10 seconds of small talk once in a while.

And I think,I won‚Äô even get to a point where I can afford mean assistant.

This isn‚Äôt what I had hoped or dreamed for myself at all. I swear though, I tried my best. 

I lurk on here pretty much daily, even if I don‚Äôt say as much as I used to.

I‚Äôm just sad. I missed it. I missed life. I miss people. I had friends in college, I had friends when I worked in the city. But now my life is small and closed and it has been shrinking to this for a long time. I have nothing to look forward to but to hope I make good choices over the next 30 years (and don‚Äôt have too many more crises) or so that I can hire someone to live wit me.

Like many of you, I have forgotten how to be a sociable person, I think maybe it was all in my head.

88,nyqvmp,1623567996,Financial issues - very different views,"This isn't really a ""dating"" post, more of a ""we're in a relationship and this is the problem"" type post, but when I read r/relationship_advice it seems to be mostly younger people and this is a very middle-aged type of problem, so I hope it's OK to put on here.

My partner and I have been living together for a couple of years in my house that I owned before I met him. He pays me rent (which we agreed he would do until my mortgage is paid off) and we split the food and bills and any other shared expenses down the middle. The rest of our money is technically our own. 

So here's the thing... we have totally different approaches to what constitutes financial responsibility and general ""adulting"". He is always in debt, always buying what I consider frivolous things like gadgets and games and stuff that just clutters up the place and serves no purpose. I am pretty careful with money but I don't think I'm mean and I have a nice life and go out with friends usually once a week for dinner or drinks and if i need new clothes I buy them, go the hairdresser and have my nails done etc, I have regular weekends away and went overseas every year before covid.

My partner has done what he called ""borrowing"" money from me in the past.... what actually happened was he took money out of our joint funds without asking/telling me in order to buy himself an expensive luxury and said ""I was just borrowing it I was going to put it back eventually."" We almost split up over that and we no longer have a joint account because of this. He is still paying me back my portion of what he took. Sometimes he asks me to have a ""repayment break"" as he has some other expense, now if this was say dental work or his car needed major repairs or something else essential I would totally give him a deferment but it never is, it's ""I want to buy a 3-D printer"" or something like that. 

We argue about this so often it's wearing me down and affecting what is otherwise a good and happy relationship. We both have good professional jobs and earn about the same, well above average, so it's not a poverty thing. I feel like he isn't committed to our relationship or our future because he just refuses to save and pisses money up the wall (sorry to be crude, but that's what it feels like!) and doesn't seem to think about financial security for our future. I suppose he thinks I'll deal with it, the same way we live in my house because he was 50yo and renting when we met, and I was 38 and a mortgaged owner. Every time we do something like a holiday or any big expense he's taking out loans for it, or putting it on the credit card, whilst I've got the money for it because I prioritise saving a bit every pay period and if that means I can't go out for dinner and drinks one weekend, well I don't go that weekend.

Anyway sorry that turned into a bit of a rant! But these are very entrenched behaviours (for both of us I guess) which I don't see changing any time soon and we can't be the only couple in this situation. What do the rest of you do about massively different attitudes to money?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nyqvmp/financial_issues_very_different_views/
