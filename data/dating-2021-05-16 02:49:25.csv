I received a message from this guy on Instagram a week ago. He hit on me casually and I kinda refused his advances, since he was persistent in getting to know me, I started talking to him and eventually gave him my number since Instagram isn’t necessarily the ideal place to chat. We live in two geographical locations and due to the covid situation in my country, meeting up for a date is a long shot for now.
Things were going great. We both have our jobs and his seems to be more occupying, in the beginning two three days we used to talk for 2-3 hours. Then the weekdays came and his replies grew shorter and the duration became longer. He did mention he was busy with work, otherwise he really likes talking to me. It was perfectly understandable but I do see him online on Instagram often. 
Not just this, Idk if he is a bad texter or doesn’t seem interested, but he doesnt really make a conscious effort in getting to know me. He stopped flirting altogether, maybe as a consequence to him being busy. I sent him a long ass text two days ago, asking him if he is playing games to get me interested in him,and I look forward to remain friends with him. Idk if that makes me look needy, but I felt I had to tell him this. 
Since his replies seemed low effort, I sent him a two word reply yesterday and didn’t text him again. 
Is there any thing else I can do? I tend to over analyze stuff, and I do know I am acting quite entitled but I like to have my intentions towards people quite clear.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndji66/guy_takes_too_long_to_reply_doesnt_seem_as/

9,ndkoxd,1621157641,Feeling nervous and avoidant with guys but really want to fall in love F18,"I don't really text people in general. I really treasure alone time and talking to people I don't feel completely safe with makes me extremely nervous and anxious. I only have female best friends and have some male acquaintances but never really talked to guys in a non-platonic way. FYI never dated. 

But the first guy I talked to frequently that was semi non-platonic (he confused me with his flirting and even told me he'd date me if we were not long-distance but would always be my friend) made me realize something was wrong with me. I just instinctively want to avoid him for fear of making a mistake or stress. Like I don't even know if I had feelings or not, and honestly don't think I would let myself like someone I know I will never meet in real life. Like I just didn't want to talk to him because it stressed me out so much in a way I couldn't understand. I really regret my actions because I realized I could have hurt him, knowingly or unknowingly. 

When I talked to other guys I saw myself doing the same thing but not as chaotic because I kind of learned how to text. Hating the need to text back. Like when I see the notification I kind of dread it. I don't know why I feel this way. The funny thing is when I cleared up that I only wanted a platonic relationship, my stress disappeared and the dread disappeared. 

I don't know what it is. Is it the fear of having an ambiguous relationship when I personally don't have and ""can't"" have feelings? Am I just avoidant of feelings in general because I am scared? 

The thing is I really want to love but in the face of opportunity I just dread it????? I crave romance secretly and reject it outwardly it is just so weird. I really don't know if I can even date healthily like this, or even date at all because something is wrong with me. 

A probably offtopic question about dating and love: 

Why is it I meet guys and they seem like such gentlemen and wonderful people but I have no feelings? I haven't had a serious crush since I was 12 and I just don't understand why I can't crush on people anymore.

12,ndkzah,1621158924,I am giving up on dating and finding love.,"I realized my chances of finding love is over. I have crossed 30. I gave up my 20s to take care of my sick family.   
I am 31 now and all the eligible men in my country are married and men overseas usually refuse for a long distance. Moving to another country has its own challenges.  So essentially I have come to the realization that I will be single for the rest of my life. Initially I was angry and depressed. But with time as i have started to embrace this reality and started changing my perspective. A family life and single life both have its sets of challenges and benefits. No path is all roses or all thorns. Stop looking at things with rose tinted glasses. That is what being an adult is all about. Accepting reality, embracing it, and finding even the little happiness in the small world one can create for ourselves, itself can be all worth it.   


So no! I will not let this false cat-lady narrative turn me into a cautionary tale.

14,ndl9ja,1621160123,A beginner to online dating. Looking for a starting point and alternatives,"I am a 27-year-old brown heteroflexible male currently living in Scotland. I have been with very few partners in life, mostly because of the conservative society and social circles I lived in (back in South Asia). I was hoping to turn this around after moving to Scotland early this year. It has not been the best time for anyone. I have been trying to meet people online and it seems to be next to impossible. 

I find it hard to make an impression through pictures or brief interactions. Longer chats, talks, or time in general is the key for me. Dating apps work purely based on the popular notions of attractiveness. I see that my while tall male friend manages a date every other week while I struggle to get matched or start a conversation. This makes me worry and has resulted in a low self-image of myself. I do not understand what the barrier is (race? color? Or something else?) or how to overcome it. I mostly attribute it to my looks (not that it is bad, but not one that can make a great first impression). 

I just want the opportunity for more human interactions. I have waited a long time to be in a more open minded and liberal society and really want to make the best of it. Maybe I sound desperate, but these are desperate times. Is it next to impossible or is there a way to make this work? Anyone who has gone through a similar phase and yet managed to find and meet people,  let me know your thoughts.

15,ndlbg5,1621160355,How to Socialize When I Have Nothing in Common with Anybody?,"I'll start by saying, I'm fairly certain that I've already had and lost the love of my life (not her fault; my own negligence). If another comes by, I won't ignore it, but my own personal standards have only ever been met by that one woman.

On that note, my goal is simply to meet women and get dates. I'm really not disqualifying for lackluster personalities at this point. I haven't been touched in 3 years, and it kills me.

I'm a guy in my early 20s, I work the night shift, and have my own place. My only hobbies, things that I genuinely enjoy doing, are going to the shooting range (VERY taboo in my state), hunting (activity that is normally done alone/early in the morning), and watching movies, usually at home. I'm also very into politics, but I fall into a pretty hated category by folks both sides of the isle, so it's often times best to leave that subject alone around new people.

I'm decently attractive, and I'm starting to work out consistently. Confidence has certainly been my downfall, but I'm attempting to work on it day by day, and I do see progress.

With all of that in mind, I'm wondering: how am I supposed to meet people?

I'm a firm believer that women can sniff out fakers, so thrusting myself into situations where I don't want to be (social events, etc) and attempting to play it cool would be pretty unproductive; I couldn't do it convincingly. On the same note; I can't, for the life of me, fake small talk. On occasion I can add a joke or two (usually never a good one). But, by in large, unless you're my friend or I have a legitimate topic to discuss with you, I CAN NOT pretend to carry a conversation. I get quiet, my brain fogs up, and I can't conjure up anything I deem valuable enough to say.

I see friends and family extremely often, but typically at my home or theirs. On my own, I live an extremely solitary lifestyle. I don't leave the house unless I've got somewhere to be.

I've tried Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, PoF, OkC, all of them; and in most cases I've paid into them. I won't begrudge anybody with the problems of 2021 online dating, but I'm sure you can imagine the results I've gotten.

I know that the simple answer is ""keep improving, love yourself, forget about women"", but I've got a massive libido, and more importantly, admittedly being desired by a woman sexually or otherwise brings me more satisfaction than anything else I've accomplished.

Given that my problem isn't attractiveness, or even personality (I'm very compassionate and empathetic, I simply can't feign interest or add to a conversation if I'm not personally interested in the topic), what should I do?








Tl;Dr: I live alone, work at night, and rarely see women (save for, perhaps at a store every few weeks). My hobbies are extremely taboo where I'm from, and I'm horrible at pretending to enjoy or do anything else (women can detect this, anyway). I can't hold a conversation unless it's something that pertains to my interest, or if I'm being asked for advice/opinions. I've taken time to love and better myself, but I have an extremely high libido, and being desired by a woman is what brings me the most joy. Where can I go, what can I do, how can I (realistically) act?

This bothers me because its the same thing my ex wife did to me and things went south shortly thereafter so I'm nervous that maybe she's seeing someone else. 

Sometimes when I'm talking to her about something and she disagrees with me she snaps at me and it makes me feel like sh*t, or if i respond to her saying I know, she thinks I'm basically telling her to shut up.

She's also bad about communicating, like taking forever to respond to a call or text. I try to see her as much as possible, usually on the weekends. I talked with her about this a few times and she admits she's bad with communicating and that she's trying to work on that but most of the time I cancel alot of things that I was going to do on the weekends to see her, but when I have to wait hours for her to answer me or finally call me its so irritating. 

I really do love her but I think she's maybe losing interest in me or has something going on, we do try to talk everyday on the phone and she does also call me as I do call her.

22,ndmyex,1621166851,"Heartbreaks, reinventing myself, becoming a new person and finding new love.","I have just gotten out of a 3 year relationship with my ex boyfriend 6 months ago.

He was my 3rd serious boyfriend and was my boyfriend for the longest amount of time.

I thought he was really going to be the one but our relationship got toxic a year ago. I tried to hold on, I couldn't see he was bad for me and our relationship finally halted when I found out he cheated on me with numerous girls.

I was so devastated I couldn't get out of bed for a week and even stopped attending online classes.

I stopped school for a semester.

I hated myself. I told myself I don't wanna feel this down ever again.

I began throwing all the stuff he gave me. I began throwing out all the clothes I've worn when i was with him.

I've re decorated and re-arranged my room.

I've decided to become a new person!

I'm just a simple type of girl who doesn't wear make up. I just dress in a plain blue t-shirt and jeans. I just always wear sandals or plain blue chuck taylors. That's all I wear and when it's winter, a black coat and a black jacket. I wasn't a girly type of girl. Just plain.

I began shopping for new clothes. I began buying dresses. I also brought all sorts of clothing in colors that I don't wear: Red, pink, yellow, White...(I always wear blue)

I brought my first tie dye hoodie. 

Also brought new 6 pairs of shoes, shoes that I don't typically wear.

I've always had short hair up to my shoulders. I began to let it grow until until it reached my back.

I also went to a salon and got a new hairstyle. It is much wavier now and I had it dyed from my natural dark brown to blonde.

I also began putting on makeup a lot more.

I also enrolled in an online cooking and baking class and just recently made my first cake.

I also began making new friends and acquaintances.

Plus I began taking care of my body a lot more. I began jogging and brought a pair of weights.

In the past I had a little bloat in my stomach but now since I jog, it disappeared. 

And lastly, I changed my name. My full first name is Natalie Grace. My parents, cousins, friends, schoolmates call me Natalie and Nat. 

I do not want to be called Natalie or Nat anymore. I changed my name on my socials to be only Grace. I began calling myself Grace when introducing myself to new people.

Recently I also began opening up my heart again.

And I made the decision that if there is an opportunity, I would like to date out of my race.

I've always dated Caucasian guys. All my ex boyfriends are white.

I began a change of perspective on who I view as attractive.

It is time for a new change!

I want to date someone I don't usually go for in the past. I want to become more open-minded.

Very recently I just met an Asian Cambodian American man. We met through my cousin and I think he's cute.

He's very sweet and a gentleman. He's the first man to ever give me flowers and old fashioned hand written loved letters to me (All my exes does not do that and who knew I would really like that!)

We began flirting and as of now I really like him.

Time will tell if this will go well, I hope it does.

This time I'm NEW.

I also began reading about what makes a good a lasting relationship, how to screen potential  partners properly and how to figure out what I've done wrong in the past when it comes to relationships so I can approve.

Super sweet and seems to be too nice to a fault where she would tell me stories of people taking advantage of her niceness. She told me one of her guy friends practically groped her and I was like “wait, that’s not appropriate”. I was explaining to her that’s not right and how her guy friend was trying to pretty much take advantage of her and she didn’t want to be mean to him. After realizing the groping was not appropriate, she then told him about the situation and how she did not feel comfortable and that she needs some space. 

She voice memo me today and was like “see! This is why I can’t be a bad person. The guy that I told you about has cancer... thank you”

But they don't know the nights you held me, looked me in the eyes and declared how much you liked me. The sweet nothings you whisper in my ears, the night long cuddles until the sun rise before out eyes. They never saw how hard you tried to impress my closest friends and my family. 

I don't know what went wrong to be honest. Even though you said you didn't want a relationship, the signs point otherwise. You fell for me, but you didn't want me. :( It's been 2 months now, and im still scratching my head wishing I knew what happened.

Does anyone else experience this?

I had a date today. In my country due to covid you need to buy a seat ticket to travel in a train and they were all sold out so initially my date was cancelled 1hr-30 minutesish before we were supposed to meet (it takes an hour from their city to mine) . The person ended up finding a train ticket after 15 minutes meaning our date just moved to 4 hours later than planned (there was only one ticket and it was for a train later in the day).

In the span of the 15 minutes I lost almost all interest in the person even though this isn't something they could've controlled.

Am I weird or is this also something others with adhd experience?

If you constantly only interact with guys that fuck you then never call you again, I question if you’re a good judge of character. For example, I have a nose like a bloodhound for gold diggers and sex workers. From maybe a conversation with one, I know what they’re after. It isn’t that hard. You can even tell sometimes by what they look like.

37,ndot2h,1621173195,Not sure if it’s a red flag or I’m just being too cautious?,"I (M26) met this girl in Facebook and she seemed genuinely nice as in she is in interested in me. It’s been awhile since I put myself out there (4 years), so to have someone showing interest really felt good. I also few months ago had a major episode so it felt like a huge boost speaking with her. What I liked about the conversation is we could talk about anything and she would respond with long messages and actually wanted to get to know me. I did notice she is a bit reserved and introvert where I’m more open and an extrovert so I didn’t mind that at all. Anyways after speaking for few days I asked to meet up with her. She said even though we are both vaccinated since numbers are going up and we are in lockdown she said maybe once the lockdown is over. I then asked how about a zoom call and what she responded kind of gave me a bit of a red flag. This is what she wrote

“When I have time yeah. One thing about me tho is you will have to forgive me and be patient with me. I’m very busy and I don’t have a lot of time to socialize other than picking my phone and replying to messages when I can. I have a lot of stuff going on all the time lol and it is my priority right now”

From my experience whenever people say I have a lot of stuff going on it’s basically saying I’m not into you and I’m just being nice. I haven’t responded to her yet since I don’t know what to say. I’m wondering if I’m reading too much into it or she is interested but busy. I thought if replying by saying this. 

“I understand where you’re coming from and I absolutely respect it. I know the struggle of balancing a lot of things at once, I’m currently doing that with work, volunteering and online courses. I do appreciate the fact that you communicated that with me. I don’t want to be the person that gets in the way since I wouldn’t like that for myself either. I hope I didn’t come of as too pushy or moving it really fast. I don’t mind just communicating by text it’s just from my past experience I prefer to have a mix of chat and in person or video call.

40,ndpr8c,1621176089,Don't know how to act around this girl,"Hi, sorry for the long text that follows. 

I just don't know how to act around this girl.

Me (32M) she (27)

It all started around the beginning of January. We hit it off on tinder and then quickly moved to WhatsApp and started chatting intensively. After a while, we decided that we should hang out and I went to her apartment and it was great. The sex was great, our conversations were great, true chemistry. So this went on for weeks. I was at her like every second day and we're chatting constantly and both were deep in a crush. Sometimes I had the feeling that she was better than me. She had more education, had worked on better jobs, had traveled more and I guess I become envoys, but never really showed it to her. 

After about two months of this, we decided to meet each other's family. She went to mine first and the day after we were both hangover and she said ""we are different in a way"" Of course, it gave me severe anxiety but she calmed me down and said everything was good, just a thought she had. The next two weeks were not great. She had a lot of troubles at work and it took a toll on me as well. I thought that she didn't want me around but she said ""no I want you here, it's just the job"" And we decided that easter was going to spend with her family. All this got to me and pressure from work and I collapsed back into my OCD and had to start on anti-depressing again.

Easter went by and I thought it went ok.. but she told me afterward that it didn't go well. She thought that I did not want to be there with her and it was not fun for her. We had a quiet couple of days and then we met up and she said that we were too different from each other. She did not see a future with me. Somehow we could not separate from each other and started to kiss and she said ""let's just take a couple of days apart, I have to think"" And it was tough. She wrote to me and was sad and I was really sad. I mean, I have strong feelings for her. We met up at her apartment and had sex right away and later during dinner she said ""this is not gonna work""

We both cried cried cried so much the whole night. We both realized that this could not be the end. I mean, we can't do it. We want each other, but it doesn't work. And the day after she came to my apartment and we had sex again and told each other to ""phase this out""So we started to meet every couple of days, had sex but now we, according to her: ""we're not actively going for a relationship, just dating at her place and having sex""

This went on for a month. I felt like shit because I have feelings for her, but at the same time, I started to hate her just for not liking me back. She got cold and could say stuff like ""I've given all I can, but I still want you to text to me like everything is normal"" or small hints that she wanted to ""have the cake and eat it as well"" It got to a point where I would wake up three in the morning and just google ""I'm being used an FBW"" just to get advice. She gave me small indications that ""I can't say where this is leading, I don't know if I'm going to fall in love"" but I mean her eyes were cold. She loved the sex. But didn't want to know anything more about my personality.

Somehow I finally dared to stand up and say ""Enough, I can't do this anymore"" and we both cried and talked on the phone and she said that she lost respect for me in the last month and admitted that she had been mean and we both triggered things, bad things, from each other. She wanted to reach out in a week (upcoming Tuesday 18/5) just to see how we are feeling and if everything is OK, but I don't know. I said I did not want her to do it, it must be me.

Of course, I want to talk to her, I mean, I still have feelings even though it's been shit for a while, but don't know If I should just give her the cold shoulder or reach out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndpr8c/dont_know_how_to_act_around_this_girl/

47,ndqlqf,1621178528,General query to the ladies and gents...,"Women of the non-“pick me” variety: when you followed this sub were you expecting the constant pity parties cisgender straight men were having RE: “women just not understanding and the dating disparity being so unfair”, or were you mentally having the expectation for this forum?

Do you think the men are posting for validation and echoed statements from other men, or is it to passively aggressively barb women? Perhaps a bit of both?

Men, I love the dating advice posts from everyone but the continual, constant and steady supply of bitter posts towards an entire gender because they’re not spreading their legs at your efforts (if you’re one of the gents who feels this way), isn’t an issue with women... it’s an issue with you.

I’m sure many women would love to be able to have an open an honest dialogue about frustrations of the dating variety but speaking in absolutes and with heavy confirmation biases slanted against an entire gender is something none of us are going to be able to contend with. It’s not a discussion when you’re using this as a soapbox to say what utter shite women are because they’re not sleeping with you.

Everytime I do something he don’t like he yells at me ,gets annoyed with me and doesn’t want to talk about it. And brushes it off as (it’s over now/I’ll be fine) and I’m starting to feel like hes hiding how he really feels about me , I feel as if he’s tired of me. 
And i can see he hasn’t been happy, idk if it’s me annoying him, or I’m just adding on to his issues . And every weekend I come to him happy and excited to see him, just for me to do something that will piss him off and our whole day wasted.
I believe a break is needed, so I don’t hate him. 
*** 

*Things to know:*
•My bf does have anger issues and he’s aware of them 
• He goes to counseling with his mom and brother(but idk if it’s specifically for his problems or his family’s)
• 10 month relationship
•My first Bf, I’m his 3rd serious GF, every other fling/ gf he’s been with, he states they’re toxic/disrespectful etc.
•always talks about our future and what we’ll do, talked about a wedding not too long ago. 
• he hates working night shift but does it for school
•when he’s angry he leaves and comes back okay/happy, as if he’s over it (he leaves for at least 20+ mins
•this problem hasn’t happened since the beginning of our relation 

Been dating since last July, during the first semester of school i seen him once a month for the weekend, cause he stayed in a dorm and went to school 2hrs away. This semester he’s at a closer school and commutes and I been seeing him every weekend. When he started his new job at UPS (night shifts) in March, I would only see him once or twice on the weekend and I wouldn’t know until that weekend. 



**Anyway:**we have been good for a very long time, no arguments 3 weeks ago we had a lovely picnic in a park by the river. (To note recent feelings: that he told me that he was grateful for me and appreciates our time and dates) 
However, after that weekend he’s been so angry and annoyed by little things.

For the past 2 weeks he’s been having issues with his mom, (him and his mom don’t get along well) and they been arguing. He lets me know how frustrating and tired he is of her and can’t wait to move out. Some days he stays at his granny to avoid her. He has been coming over with an attitude, because of his mom and normally  it’s because fri. Is his longest shift 9-6, and he always complains about sleep and being tired, so I’m it’s both of those things. 

One Sunday I was laying down on tik tok, and my door shut. He texts me hear and I sent him an talkin emoji telling him to come in, the door was locked (but I thought it was unlocked cause my mom just came back in and she doesn’t always lock the door), so he claims he was knocking for a while, and I got up when my dog started barking at the door, but my mom was in the kitchen and opened the door before me. So come in with an attitude, “wtf are you doing why you not answering the door..blah”, 
And I tell him, I just didn’t get up in a hurry, and figured my mom would open it cause she’s right there. So he was annoyed about that for hrs, he stayed tho and didn’t go home. When we talk about a couple hours later he like it “it don’t make no f— sense why u just didn’t get up, like I’m trying to understand it’s so dumb, and yk I was outside and told me to come in...blahs”
So after that he leaves, (he always leaves his stuff and just go drive around) and then comes back, happy and like he wasn’t just yelling at me &amp; nothing happened. 

Yesterday, I play sports(college) so had meet, yesterday and unexpectedly my dad came (he from MI) and had me out late, he wanted to spend time with me. The day before me and him planes to spend yesterday together, (just our normal watch movies and eat). He knows my meet was an 1.5 hrs away, So I txt him and let him know I’m with my dad at 2:30 and we are visiting ppl, but we are on our way back now . At 4 he’s responds an reads my text (so I’m guessing he just woke up cause he normal wakes up between 2-4) and says okay thank u for letting me know cause he was about to come over
So I say we stopped to eat, tbh my dad was just fooling around and I told him I wanted to go home, but he drives slows and makes so many stops.
So I let him know I’m home at 6. And he’s txt smart like (are you sure) and th. comes over with an attitude. And doesn’t talk to me or in short sent. Until 8:30 and the whole time I’m asking him what’s wrong, how you feel, are you okay, do you want to talk,etc? 
He leave a and then comes back.
Then he tells me he was upset that he basically put off his whole day , waiting on me thanking I was gonna be home at 4-5. And that’s when he tells me he woke up around 2 and had to take his brother to work and help his granny and then look at Message. And  his friend asked him at 3 if he wanted to go play football and he told him know cause after he takes his brother to work it’ll be 4 and he’ll be coming over my house . So he’s upset he didn’t get to hang out with his best friend and been waiting on me all day .

So I told him will take a break for a couple weeks and next weekend I to stay home and i texted his friend to hang out with him, to make up for yesterday. And he said that’s fair, and next time he let me know when he wants to do something else besides come over.
This morning he told good morning he loves me and to let me know if I’ll be home for him to come over ....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndqyga/i_18f_think_my_bf20m_is_unhappy_hes_always_angry/

I met F18 in HS , and we’ve been friends for quite sometime. I showed up to her Apartment with flowers and we started our date. Now to give some context, F is not a touchy individual, doesn’t express emotions as much, and is extremely straight forward. Also, this is the second person I’ve been on a date with. I’m a pretty nervous guy and sometimes let my anxiety get the best of me at times. I’ve been on one relationship which only lasted 7 months. But that’s besides the point. We continued and got lunch, laughed a bit then we went to the arcade. But I started to notice that she was snapping during the date which I don’t mind, since I didn’t know who it was. I then realized that is was this guy, and this guy was were PlayStation friend. I was like ok, but in the back of my mind I found it kinda strange. We then we were on our way to the arcade, and the conversation of her father came up and she then said how I’d meet him soon. We then arrived at the arcade and had a blast. We then got smoothies and then I noticed she had snapped this guy again, so I went to the bathroom to just take a second since my anxiety was getting to me. When I got back I just asked if they’re a thing at any time and she told me how they’re just friends on PlayStation and nothing more. So then I just dropped it. We proceeded to a nature park and then I dropped her off. I then said how I had a great time and was wondering if she would like to do this again sometime. She said how she had a great time and she wants to go on another date. After she left she snapped me saying, “Thank you for hanging today :)!”. Now first off, I 100% don’t mind girls having guy friends vise versa. My main problem is my anxiety overwhelming me with this thought that It’s too “good to be true” and the fear of being lead on. I know I stated that she’s straight forward so she would have told me straight up. Do I have anything to worry about with this dude?

My problem is that it seems being financially well off seems to be more important to women than to men in my experience (because I wouldn't care if I found a lady that was employed or not. As long as the chemistry is there).

(The place we were meeting at is near my home, I’m a regular, I know most of the workers so I don’t care about hanging out) A half hour later he says what about breakfast or brunch? I don’t want to keep you waiting. Ok so when he said he was on the way to that point he should have been there. I didn’t even respond. I skipped on home.

58,ndrmv2,1621181521,Ending things with a girl after a misunderstanding:,"So I went out with a girl and she was really cool and fun but I wasn't super attracted to her physically. I had a pretty busy weekend coming up so I figured ""well a second date probably won't work out this weekend anyway"" so I just told her my schedule and how it would be hard for me to meet up again and she honestly went out of her way to make it work and fit it into my schedule so I said what the hell, and we went out again.  
    
We get some drinks, we come back to my place and things get a little intimate but before we get to having sex, I tell her that I usually don't have sex until I feel like I've connected with someone pretty well. I said this to mean ""let's not tonight"" because I was pretty sure I wouldn't be seeing her again and frankly, I didn't want to just sleep with her for the sake of it and then end things anyway. But based on her response I could tell she somehow took what I said as a ""hey just want you to know that what we're doing right now wouldn't normally happen unless I really connected with someone"" and SHE told ME that she didn't really feel ready for sex. I should've clarified in the moment but there didn't seem like a right way to....correct what I said so I just left it alone.  


So we continue fooling around/talking until it gets late and she has to leave. But now I'm thinking it's going to come off like a huge dick move if I tell her I don't see this going somewhere serious because she'll probably think it's BECAUSE she didn't want to have sex.

66,ndsinf,1621184041,The idea that most women meet men’s high standards is false," So, i(M20s) was having a conversation with to one of my girlfriends(F20s)  and the topic of standards came up. We both wrote our standards on the iphone notes app. My list was maybe 10 qualities, hers was over 40. So i looked at the things she’d put on her list, stuff like the guy should speak both English, Italian and  Spanish, Lawyer with a business on the side that she manages. And that’s when it clicked, for most men, we don’t really tend to think about the nitty-gritty standards and even if we do, its more like a lala-land.

So i asked her if i can add these fantasyland standards to my list, guess what? My list grew to 50 things.i had things like she must be a doctor with a French accent, loves huskies and golden retrievers, loves working out, prefers smoking 🍃to drinking alcohol, doesn’t smoke cigarettes i’ll spare you the details. However, i know that these standards are too high that maybe only 0.1% of women can meet them. But i also understand that i can get happiness and joy by using my original 10 list because people can bring joy to you in unexpected ways.

I keep seeing people on this sub saying that most men don’t meet women’s high standards but most women meet men’s standards because if i used my list of 50 qualities, 99% women won’t meet them and i could then say, most women dont meet my high standards.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndsinf/the_idea_that_most_women_meet_mens_high_standards/

68,ndsxk4,1621185199,My favorite: being upset that you can’t get a girlfriend is “feeling entitled”,"Maybe it is. But if it is, anyone that wants a relationship at all is feeling entitled in the same way. Because that’s where that comes from. Wanting a relationship. It’s just harder for some people than others. So when people struggle, you see their “entitlement.” When people don’t struggle, it’s not as noticeable. It’s still there though. It’s still the same thing.

So basically, this situation usually amounts to self-entitled people that are having their “needs” met not empathizing and othering self-entitled people that are not having their “needs” met.

Which brings up the other part. Maybe it’s not “self-entitlement” at all. Maybe most humans have a certain degree of a need for intimacy. Like a neurobiological thing or something. It’s difficult or next to impossible to move on from.

I have been working out consistently 3-7 days a week for about 20 years now since I was a teen but I'm still kind of ""scrawny"" by most definitions. If I eat more I can easily gain weight but it mostly ends up being fat and when I trim that off after I'm back where I started. A lot of people seem to think if you work out regularly you should look like The Rock, but in reality most guys just end up looking like Hugh Jackman in the FIRST X-Men movie (all the other ones he was on major steroids). ie. Like a trim and fit but still normal guy.

Health and fitness is important to me so I would like to match to women who are lean and fit as well. But the only ones I get likes from are severely overweight.

I have a 10 year degree and a job that pays top 1-2% income. I have had loads of female and male friends in my life and most people describe me as kind, friendly, outgoing, and upbeat. I have lots of hobbies and varied interests. I have tried going to MeetUps but they're all guys.

I have had female friends and relatives make me profiles which do no better than my own. I have posted for reviews and been told my profile looks good. I even bought a fancy DSLR and tripod to take new photos but it didn't make any difference.

The only ""problems"" I or any of my relatives or friends can identify are that I am 5'8"", brown, and have a mediocre face. It's funny because people will on one hand say ""Those things don't matter!"" if you bring them up. However, on the other hand, if a guy on a dating subreddit says ""I'm 6'2"" and white and people call me handsome"" the automatic reply is ""Well that should make it a lot easier then!"" So which of these two things is true?

Anyway it doesn't really matter. I'm just wondering if there's anything else I haven't done or ""self improvement"" as a method for becoming more attractive to women and getting more success in dating is mostly a scam.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndte6k/is_there_anything_left_to_do_as_a_man_if_you/

74,ndu2j3,1621188414,"(25M) Unexpectedly Falling Kinda Hard For Someone I Just Met, And It’s Kinda Freaking Me Out","First post here, hopefully getting this all written down can ease my mind a little bit.

I suppose I’ll provide a bit of backstory before going into it: I’m fairly recently out of a LTR that was touch-and-go/unstable, and overall just really not good for me. Totally over it at this point and thoroughly enjoying being free from that person. They were too much. Neediness, clinginess, I felt smothered, happy to be out. Grateful for it though, because now I feel like I have a really solid understanding of what I want/don’t want in a partner. Landed a really solid new job, finally feeling fully independent and stoked on starting a new chapter in my life.

So, I took a good amount of time to myself, started getting into my new work routine. Then, since I am but flesh and blood, I downloaded Tinder. Been there before, dated people off there, met FWBs, etc., so like a lot of people my experience there is a mixed bag. I figured what the hell, I’m not attaching myself to any outcomes and I’d just like to see where this leads.

Matched with this girl. And wow. We really hit it off. It’s super rare that I have this kind of rapport with someone just exchanging messages. We have a ton in common, particularly taste in music (I’m a lifelong musician). That was a big factor in this sudden attraction, its so rare that someone has the same kind of taste that I do. Theres a lot more I like about her than that of course, but that was the first thing.

So, naturally, I really wanted to meet her in person. We moved off the app, started texting, exchanged tons of music recs, talked about other interests, set a date, and we met yesterday. Grabbed some coffee, and went to a nice place in a nearby park. 

I was so excited leading up to this, but also super apprehensive and worried. I was concerned that we wouldn’t vibe talking in person and that everything would fall flat. Those fears turned out to be unfounded. We talked for hours, conversation just flowed and I found myself going from liking the idea of her to really liking her as a person. And she’s also way way way cuter in person, like damn.

So, after extended conversation it was getting to the point where we both should probably get going. And I was like, *hey so how’re you feeling about this?* She was slightly taken aback, and offered me the same question in kind. I said *I definitely like you, you’re super smart, we share a lot of similar interests, you’re really interesting, and on top of all that I think you’re pretty cute. Are you interested in seeing me again?* She giggled, and said *You’re direct, I like that, and yes I’m definitely down to see you again. Also I definitely think you’re cute too, I mean, I wouldn’t have swiped right if I didn’t, right?*

So, I walk her to where she’ll catch the bus, we hugged, I told her I’d send her those albums I told her about later, and I was on my way.

As I make my way home my heart is in my throat. I can’t get her out of my mind. This feeling has been more or less constant since yesterday, still there as I’m writing this. I haven’t had this feeling in my chest and butterflies in my stomach for a long long time. Its so fucking unexpected. And I’m scared. The few times I’ve felt this way about someone it has not ended well. It usually gets chalked up to the other person just not feeling the same way. 

I’ve spent so much time slowly, brick by brick, building my confidence in myself when it comes to matters of the heart. I have my flaws, but I’m working them out. I’m not perfect, but I know for damn sure that I have a lot to offer someone. Now that I’m getting this feeling again I’m scared that I’ll get shut down and all that confidence I worked so hard to build up is going to come crashing down. I also absolutely hate the fact that I can’t get her out of my mind. How the hell did I become so infatuated with someone so easily? Its really messing with me. I know I just have to be patient and see where things go, but its not easy. I just wanted to get this all written down and vent it out to some strangers on a subreddit.

76,ndul8p,1621189862,Friends of the opposite gender,"Just some food for thought...

I dated a guy some time ago who was very much a ladies' man. His way of talking to girls was very flirtatious. When we were dating he refused to tell anyone that we were dating, citing cultural reasons that dating is taboo/only tell when you are engaged or married, etc. So, everyone thought he's single.

I was by no means insecure. I know we all have friends of various genders and I'm fine with that. But it did irk me that he wouldn't tell anyone that he even was dating me and then went around flirting with other girls...it may give them the wrong idea. There was this one friend that he had, a single female, whom he always talked about-he always apparently hung out with her. It was impromptu post-work hangouts, according to him, so he didn't invite me-which was fine by me. It was always them one on one. She like anyone else had no clue this dude was even dating someone (ie me).

One day he uploaded a FB profile pic of the two of them SUPER close to each other. From the way pic was zoomed in, you couldn't see the rest of their bodies (ie, arms around each other etc). Now normally I wouldn't care if there were pictures like that around or floating on social media. But I tried to explain to him that: (1) I totally trusted him but (2) people in the outside world don't even know he's dating me or about me and (3) they'll see his, specifically as a profile picture, and get the wrong idea. Profile pictures with someone of the opposite gender are not always indicative of a relationship but that's often what it is...they were so close together too. He refused to take it down, I said nothing about it, but admittedly it did hurt that he wouldn't tell anyone about me yet seemingly led this girl on.

A day later: she apparently strained a muscle in her thigh. He volunteered to go down and massage it. 

We broke up for other reasons. But reflecting back on this makes me think someone who is serious about a relationship would at least tell their close friends about it and not pose as a single person.

In case anyone wonders how the story ended: the girl got a boyfriend, maybe 3 months after I broke up with mine. She then stopped hanging out with my ex. My ex texted me saying he's feeling lonely bc none of his friends including this girl has time for him.

Any advice?,"I do my best to present myself in what I think makes me look really good, on a good day I'd say Im an 8/10 in terms of looks, on a bad day a 6/10.  I have an athletic build since Im at the gym a lot and I'm 6'2 and black. I have a pretty good sense of style when it comes to fashion I know what I look good in and what I dont.

Regardless of this when I see a woman Im interested in I approach her and introduce myself, and I get to know her, I talk about things that we have in common, for example a girl I talked to at gamestop who was looking at Destiny, we talked about the game, and I enjoyed the conversation with her, or when I was at the library and saw this girl browsing the sci fi section. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I always try to be myself during these interactions and I am able to get them to laugh and I hope enjoy the conversation but whenever I ask for their number I always get rejected. This has gone on for a year without success. I

&amp;#x200B;

I know I shouldnt expect girls to give me anything just because they enjoyed an interaction, and I do my best not to let these things get me down. but it really gets frustrating when I see other guys have more success with girls in 2 weeks than I do in an entire year. I've read from advice on other posts by women saying that its a lack of chemistry and that its fine because you arent supposed to have chemistry with everyone, but like, if thats the case, why are there other guys who can get multiple girls numbers as easy as it is to slice butter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things that I've tried to improve my chances of getting a date is, giving a girl my number instead of hers. Not expecting anything of the interactions that I have and being outcome independent (for about a year, this post is now my breaking point). Asking more about the girl and focusing on getting to know her past her looks(I've started loving this more because before I used to be really shallow and nervous about girls because they were really attractive to me and I used to put them on a pedestal, but after getting to know some of them, I realize that some of the entitled ones that I met were really not worth the time.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have a pretty good personality and figured out recently that what I love most about my character (a woman friend of mine told me what she liked about me the most because we were talking about the self esteem we have in each other and she told me this out of the blue and it made me really happy and I sort of started liking my personality more because of it) is my patience, apparently Im not short tempered like most freshmen in college and my patience for others is comforting because i dont put pressure on people when getting to know them, doing something with them, or helping them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get a little bit envious at times (Im trying to work on it) when I see women friends of mine who fawn over other guys because of their physical apperance who they havent gotten a chance to know, its like they see them, and BAM, the ladies are simping for them, usually its white guys with some really sharp jawlines (I state race because I have an insecurity that im not attractive to people because im black, I got bullied a lot because of my skin colour in highschool). I get mad at myself when I think like this because I know its bad that Im getting jealous over guys who women think are more attractive physically than me.

Anyway, I just wanted some advice, I just had a panic attack while thinking about this earlier and wanted to get it off my chest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndv3ic/i_feel_like_im_not_physically_attractive_enough/

So I don't often do this however I feel need help with this one. So basically me 26/25M (birthday soon) has never been on a date! WHAT I KNOW RIGHT! So several reasons for this confidence is basically extinct like I have been hurt ages ago and I have lost confidence massively and I have never really met the right person who I might have wanted to go out with also  I have been so work driven literally haven't had a full week off work since September. However recently we have had a reshuffle and new staff have joined. I saw this one person caught my eye. She is exactly my type a great sense of humour (Like seriously good sense of humour) and just all up a great person. However I am not sure..... Basically the first interaction was AWFUL! I was such a Fricking arsehole as I was having such a bad day due where I was living was HORRENDOUS! However I basically didn't hear her get introduced to me and basically I ignored them and was really rude! Its not me at all and I have apologised profusely as I was completely in the wrong. However from then we hit it off and well over this weekend we were having a great laugh and just found each other funny and even today she shared stuff with me about some stuff and it seems like its going well. But I am not sure because I am a try too hard sorta guy and it always fails when speaking to her with other people around but when I am with her I am relaxed and super chilled and just find it super easy to talk to and this never happens. WHAT DO I DO! I like her but she works with me but  is in a different department and is away from where I work for a few days at other locations so I question the rule of don't poop where you eat. But I just don't know I fear asking her if she wants to go for a drink after work LIKE SERIOUSLY FEAR IT if it were to go wrong but when I am around her and today it was great is it me being stupid. I just don't know what to do.....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndvcz1/heart_says_yes_head_says_maybe_not/
85,ndvg1p,1621192185,Why does seeing pictures of old fling still hurt me and how I do I get over it?,"I’m sitting in my bed right now and I’m just bored scrolling through Instagram and I know I shouldn’t have checked her Instagram but I did. She posted something new and idk even know what I’m feeling but it just hurts. I’m trying to not feel sorry for myself but I can’t help but feel just sad that I thought I finally had like a girl that I connected with and everything, to only have things just cut off over text.

We were seeing each other for like 3-4 months and at some point I started catching real feelings, she started to seem over things, and just like that she wanted to be strangers again and not see me again. It makes me want to better myself so that she can see what she lost but I’m not even trying to bring up that type of toxic energy.

I was probably an afterthought to her the whole time and things wouldn’t have worked out anyway but it still hurts. It’s been like 2 months already and I don’t know why I’m still feeling this way but maybe I’m just in my feelings right now. I’m trying to not think like she’s probably on some other guy now, but I can’t seem to let go.

Could someone please help me just learn how to let go of the thought of a relationship with her anymore. What’s weird is that when it first happened I thought I was over it within a week but the hurt just lingers and stays there, like seeing her Instagram post felt like a  punch to the stomach for some reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndvg1p/why_does_seeing_pictures_of_old_fling_still_hurt/

87,ndvp07,1621192857,Are flaky people worth dealing with?,"So I (23F) have been seeing this woman (31F) for about 2 months and usually see each other once a week. She has rescheduled on me now 3 times total which I don’t know how to feel about in this short amount of time. She flaked on me yesterday and re-scheduled for today and flaked again even though she was the one who asked to see me and picked the day both times. Each time she said she wasn’t feeling well which could be totally possible and I told her I want her to be open with me anyways. Otherwise things were going well and we still flirt over text and stuff. 

I don’t like to jump to conclusions but it feels like she’s losing interest. We almost went a week without talking and haven’t seen each other in 2 weeks now. She was very receptive when I broke the silent streak but now this. I’m not sure if it’s a mental health thing (she never mentioned this) but I know I withdraw when I feel depressed even if I really like someone. I’m just confused and a little upset over it but I’m trying not to take it personal.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndvp07/are_flaky_people_worth_dealing_with/

For context, we live in Nigeria but in different states and he has been trying to move to my state but so far hasn't been able to get a job to bring him here. we disagree about abortion rights, surname taking and trans right. He always said that we don't have to agree on the same things that it's challenging that we have different values. I guess that was a lie because that's one of the reasons he's ending the relationship. Plus the fact that I'm from a minority tribe, he is from a majority and he's like he wants his ideal partner from his. I'm mad at myself for getting into this relationship in the first place.

On one hand I want to see how long it would take her to text me first, and it’s been 2 days so far.

Is there a way to ask a girl if you can go to their place?

I (20M) have a friend in college (20F) who is pretty introverted but has eventually become comfortable with me. 

She was talking about how some guys always look for sex and what not while I was listening to her. At one point in conversation I said “cuddles and hugs&gt;sex change my mind” (I don’t care about sex as much as other men do) and she went crazy in agreement. Apparently she was too shy to tell me that she loves cuddling and would love to have a “cuddle buddy” and I told her that if she wanted to cuddle while we’re out and about somewhere then she can go for it and I won’t mind. Since then it’s been about a month and we’ve hung out like 3 times and we’ve hugged each time. I don’t have any interest in sex but I do love cuddling and I want to go over to her place to chill and possibly cuddle but I don’t know if you can even ask someone to do that. Is there a way to ask if I can come over to her dorm and if so, what should I say?

97,ndxbwc,1621197351,Color Blind to Red Flags,"I’m not sure if the title of this post is even accurate. I’m acutely aware of these so called red flags with new relationships. Still, I somehow convince myself and, embarrassingly, attempt to convince my friends and family, the red flags won’t impact the relationship. I begin to see the flags as, let’s say yellow flags, and those flags are a valid concern but can “easily” be mitigated. The issue is I’m going into a relationship already cognizant that there are things about this person I want to change. The relationship instantly becomes me putting in effort to change someone who either never wants to change themselves or expresses wanting to change but not currently ready to change. I end up disappointed in my SO and exhausted by my efforts to help them make changes and the relationship quickly deteriorates. 

This is so unhealthy and, in retrospect, I can always see why the relationship was doomed from the jump but - I just get this impulse to take the jump. It always feels like “true love,” and I always tend to think I’ll regret it if I pass it up.

98,ndxh66,1621197760,When saying no feels like something rude to do,"I [18F] have always struggled with guys sometimes asking for pictures that I would never feel comfortable sending. Most of them, fortunately, were just strangers working their ways through asking all the girls on IG for nudes. I couldn’t care less to say no or just block them right away. But when they make conversation, when they’re all sweet. That’s when it gets impossible. 

So this guy I’m currently chatting with is really sweet. He doesn’t ask for too much, they’re rather mild things. But I am uncomfortable taking these pictures, even if it’s just on Snapchat and he’ll get to see them only for as long as I want to. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I personally feel a little less worth, objectifying myself just to hear how much he likes seeing this. I can’t help it. It’s not about the compliments he’s giving me. It’s about the things he says he’d do. I’m not completely innocent in this. Still, I feel uncomfortable. 

Sometimes I actually have the courage to be an adult and just tell him that I actually feel uncomfortable with it. I would assume he’d get the hint and back off. But he doesn’t. I’m not sure if he actually knows why this is uncomfortable for me, maybe I’m not being clear. I feel like he thinks I’m just self conscious about my looks. I am, but that’s not the issue. 

I sure am not the only person experiencing the pressure to give these kind of guys what they want. I just wish I knew how to stop this. I don’t want to push him out of my life. Being really honest I’m a little desperate, because the people around me are not dating material. Meeting people online is the best I could get right now. It would be hard to give him up, although I feel like these might be red flags.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndxh66/when_saying_no_feels_like_something_rude_to_do/
