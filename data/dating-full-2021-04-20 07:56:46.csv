Because of this, I've started chatting up more girls (granted not many but even a handful in a period of a year is infinitly better than one every few years) and have received quite a few positive responses in the sense of them seeming to be genuinely interested in me and even agreeing to me taking them out on a date (mainly been asking if they want to get coffee first).


Here's the frustrating part... I usually leave with their insta handle or number and hit them up the next day and the responses end up becoming minimal to the point of them either not responding or ghosting me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a 17-year-old guy who is not experienced with relationships, not that should be but that's just the fact. I have hooked up with girls before but never maintained a romantic relationship seriously. I go to an all guys college and so my pool of girls is almost exclusively through friends. Admittedly I have succumbed to the expectation that you should be in a relationship, and I understand I don't have to be, but it would be fun right? maybe the grass is greener on the other side. Anyways to the point.

I was set up by a friend, let's call her Sophia. Sophia is the year level below me and lives pretty close. (none of us can drive yet so that's important to me, we live near train stations on the same line and are a bus line apart). She goes to a school where a lot of my friends do and people have been very excited by our match up. Speaking candidly, she is very attractive, she is also very articulate and intelligent. She has a love of poetry, I have a love of songwriting and we both enjoy reading. Now to the complicated part.

I have a pattern of giving up easily when it gets hard. Our first date went well, I bought her flowers and we had brunch, talking for hours. The second date didn't carry the momentum, I thought things were moving faster and had higher hopes but ultimately it was just another talking date, and that's fine. She spoke about how she was only a couple of months out of a serious relationship where the guy cheated on her and so she isn't ready for anything serious as of now. She has said she wants to keep it casual and see where it goes.

Now we haven't seen each other in a week, and won't for another seeing as she is busy every day of this week and can't commit to plans. I don't mind this because I understand people are busy but her texting is very dry. Even a conversation takes 10s of minutes between responses from her. I get she may not be glued to her phone, but I thought maybe she would want to speak to me. Another big difference that strikes me is drugs and alcohol. Now I have never done any of the formerly mentioned, I have never had the desire, I don't need them to have fun and I know that most people regret doing so in their teen years. Sophia is open about her use and it just doesn't sit right with me. Obviously, she can do what she wants but I just know there are gonna come times where I am stopping her from doing what she wants or I'm going to be pressured into something, either way, the difference is gonna rear its head one way or another, I feel.

Now obviously very few hit it off straight away and many have to work at relationships and work out the wrinkles. Do I wait for someone more suited for me? or keep pursuing this girl even if I have to wait for her to be ready. I don't want to let another perfectly fine, pretty girl getaway because of a minor flaw or because it was tough.

I was very excited to meet him. Later on our first date I realized our intentions weren't that aligned. I left the first date feeling quite uncomfortable because of some entitled behavior on his side (he was trying to create sexual tension, while I was hoping to get to know him better and he became rude towards me when I rejected his advances). 

I had told him I take things slowly and I told him no several times during the date and he called me shy and told me I was being stupid ('calling names is how he shows affection', he said). I regret not deflecting his flirty messages, I regret going to his place trusting him after seeing him in public for about an hour and pubs and cafes are closed due to covid. I think these gave him false impressions even though I thought I had made my stance clear.

A few days later after talking to friends and reading up, I thought maybe I overreacted because his advances were not that over the top, even though I wasn’t feeling quite ready for physical contact. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt as he apologized a few days later AFTER I apologized for leaving the date suddenly. 

We met a second time, which went nice (we kissed but he was telling me to be more relaxed etc. which I felt was manipulative) so a few days later he invited me for a 3rd meeting. I agreed at first, but then I started to feel doubtful about it, like why do I keep seeing this guy after he was disrespectful and rude and made me uncomfortable? I decided not to see him again due to more red flags+gut feelings, telling him that we’re incompatible and I noticed after the kiss that he would be happier with a more easy-going, less uptight girl but I would be fine with keeping contact as friends. He then said 'oh was my kiss terrible?' And he jokingly said he felt used, which made me feel guilty about changing my mind again.

I keep thinking about how this whole situation went down. I was on the fence about him because we had so much in common and we connected. I kept changing my mind, something which I never do. I feel that I handled the situation terribly. How can I overcome these feelings of regret and guilt?

So I finally cracked, 29 male (Ontario) here and I finally downloaded Tinder. Since the invention of online dating I've never been optimistic about it really and wanted to meet someone the old fashioned way I suppose !

But with apps appearing left right and center and with restrictions in many places I decided it's probably time to just do it.

So I joined Tinder, threw up a few photos and a few very short lines.

But I dunno if Tinder is very active anymore or if people don't use it as much ? No matches so far, I swipe right on people I'm genuinely interested in. Some have swiped right on me but so far very few and unfortunately there's a considerable age difference or children in their lives and I'm just uncomfortable with that at the moment.

I'm 24F and I've been hitting the gym for the past 6 months. When I first started going, this guy (27M), we'll call him Dan, and his TWIN BROTHER (they are identical), would usually go at the same hour I did, so we saw each other a couple times a week. 


At first, I noticed one of them would check me out, and would always greet me, but it took a while for me to figure out which one is which. It was rather fun honestly hahaha. 


Well, after two months, they stopped coming in. I figured they just changed gyms or something. Well, fast forward last week, they guys come back!


So, I had to get some weights and Dan was near the machine close to the rack. So, he struck a conversation with me (first time we actually talk), and I took the chance to ask for his name and introduce myself properly. 


Yesterday, I was going on a walk (gym is right next to my house), and I crossed paths with them. Dan went for a kiss on the cheek (mask on), and I froze. Disclaimer, kissing someone on the cheek as a greeting is normal in my country (and his, bc he is from a different place), BUT with the pandemic, it's rare people go for a kiss. I didn't expect it and basically acted like a nervous 15yo. 


So, I very honestly think this dude likes me, and I do fancy him, too. But I'm really scared of dating someone from my same gym. I don't want to make things awkward.


The thing is that, my dating life hasn't been that great: I was in an abusive relationship during my teenage years. I had one semi-functional relationship 4 years ago, until the guy started trying to control me 8 months in. Last dude I seriously dated admitted that he didn't find me attractive (dumped him). I was sexually assaulted on a date at age 19 and 21. Last year I made out with a FRIEND of mine and he started choking me out of nowhere and tried to do other things without my consent. Two guys tried using me to cheat on their girlfriends, without me knowing. Last guy I was getting to know dumped me over text because I had set boundaries... Plus many more distasteful experiences (I'm in therapy, don't worry).


So, I'm incredibly terrified. My best dating experiences have been with men I met online and it just didn't work out after a few dates. In fact, I usually have much better luck with the men I meet online, than the guys I meet IRL. I obviously don't want to think all men are predators, in fact, I was stalked by one girl, too.

I agreed, and we still talk normally, having the same detailled conversations over text as before but is it worth it? I’m cool with it, but I don’t wanna act as a backup if that’s the deal (although she really doesn’t come across that way as someone who would do that).

I've 25M recently started dating again. Sometime in December I met my now beautiful girlfriend 25F. 
We've been dating for just over a month and honestly this is the healthiest relationship I've been in. Hence why I had been single four years up till this point. 
I'm currently laying next to her as she continues to snore the night away. To be honest it feels very surreal and I'm in a state of bliss with her by my side.

When I first met her I had an absolute huge crush on her. We became friends pretty easily but it was just that, friends. Altbiugh I was completely okay with this I was still a little bummed she didn't like me back. I never told her about my crush. Through conversations we had I just knew she wasn't interested. For example she asked me if I knew any cute boys I could introduce her to. She had just moved to my state and didn't know anyone. Regardless of this I still wanted to be her friend and I would continue to support her and talk to her. 

One day out of the blue she had wanted to hangout. I noticed she had been acting a little different and more or so flirty. To my surprise when the night came to an end she had asked to sleepover. Of course I said yes. She laid next to me and we watched Netflix untill we both fell asleep. At this point I had gotten a feeling that maybe she did like me.

Over the next week or so we were talking more and more and her cues got stronger and stronger. We had another sleepover and this time we cuddled when we woke up we kissed. I remember asking her why she had started liking me and ahe replied saying that I grew on her.

Now with every day we get closer and closer and recently on our one month anniversary I had confessed my crush on her and told her about all our early encounters and how I thought she was the prettiest girl ever. She was blushing the whole time and told me she had no idea then laughed an admited she did not feel the same way at all.

It's honestly crazy to me we ended up together and now she tells me she wants this to last which I feel the same way and I couldn't he happier. I had been single for so long I hadn't seen this coming nor did I feel like I'd find anyone anytime soon. I'm very lucky and I can only wish for anyone having difficulty finding a relationship can find something like I have. The feeling is tremendous.

I guess moral of the story would be to not give up and if someone friend zones you to not take it personally but to continue being their friend with no expectations and maybe you will end up together. She told me a huge reason she ended up liking me is because most guys she friendzones don't want to continue the friendship when I did.

Best of  luck to anyone looking to find love. Don't give up for it could be right around the corner. 💜

Two weeks ago I finally got the courage to ask him out and we ended up having a good date. He was very polite (offering to pay for things even though we both know he’s in a worse financial situation) and being generally great company. Since then I’ve been confused about when we would go on a second date. I can only do anything on my days off, and he works half the week and the other half he goes to school and the majority of his time is spent in classes or studying, so he’s always super busy. When we were saying goodbye on our first date he said he was free on my next day off (implying we should go on another date)  but I had to decline because I had to see my family, but said I was free all of my other days off. Fast forward a week and we’re at work and I ask him if he’s busy on my day off, to which he says “I’ve got a final, sorry” which is a perfectly good excuse, but it’s been 5 days since then and he hasn’t mentioned when he was free, or given me peace of mind by letting me know he’s just been so busy, just, radio silence. And the thing is, we work retail together, so I see him in passing or on breaks or we get paired to work on something together and we’re chatting just like good friends. But he never inquires about a second date. I honestly can’t tell if he’s just so busy and stressed that it just hasn’t occurred to him (which is entirely possible) or if he likes me, just not in that way and doesn’t want to explicitly let me know. He also said that he didn’t think anyone would even like him at all, like, it was an impossibility, which I completely understand and feel the same, so it could also be he’s just insecure and doesn’t think I like him as much as I show or something. But then he also jokes lightly about us being together (we both have self deprecating humor so he’ll say, while looking at our swole coworker, that if I wanted to choose him instead I could) 

If he doesn’t like me, that’s fine, I won’t break down or spiral, but I need to know so I can stop thinking about him, stop romanticizing a possible future with him if it’s impossible. At least tell me! Let me know what’s going on!

&amp;#x200B;

Here is **some context** :

I (24M) junior engineer matched with M.R. (surname) (26M) law student on Tinder in February. We chatted for a while, first on Tinder, then on IG.

This beginning of March, we decided to meet each other. So I decided to host him (first time for me, and hella stressful) \[***sub-context :*** *we both live in Paris, and we have a 7pm-6am curfew due to the covid outbreak. While we are both occupied during weekdays and both less available the weekends, we went for the date nights*\]  


We both **appreciated** this first date. It was ***natural***, ***smooth***, and ***so*** ***authentic***. We talked for so long,  learned many things (in common) from each other, we laughed, we played and so on... We ended hugging and sleeping  with each other while watching some anime.

The same day we shared our opinions about what happened, which *were tune with each other*. So we organized a second date the following week. Same as the first one, and again decided to see each other for a a third time this Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

But this time **he had to cancel**. He sent me a voice message telling me that he had some concerns about his dad who was at the hospital. So he wasn't in the mood for meeting each other. He highlighted that he felt so sorry and hoped that I wasn't mad. 

I responded (via text, cause at work) that I wasn't mad, and hoped that nothing bad happened. I told him to do what feels best for him. I added, that even tho we don't know all our history, I was there if he needs (maybe not the correct expression in english, my bad) **some ears and shoulders to listen and support him, even if it implies tears and sadness**. *\[at first I thought it was maybe too much, but frankly, I followed* ***a long road of self improvement****, on the physical and mental levels, that I no more keep my feelings to anyone - including friends, family, and people I don't know that much mdr\]* 

He responded well, and shared the story of his dad having a cancer. They both live far away (miles away) and while his treatment is agressive, there are some highs and lows... I felt so sad, because it reminded me and my cousin (who I grew up with, and who I consider as a brother) who had a liver cancer a few years ago, and I was too living thousands miles away. So i responded that I kind understand  what he was going through (highlighting that I didn't dare put myself in his place), and I shared my strength telling him to also stay surrounded by people he trusts.

He responded that he appreciated my message, which he considered as **a true source of great consolation**. He then told me that : ""I promise, I will come to see you when I'll feel better, meanwhile, lots of loving kisses"". 

&amp;#x200B;

End of **context**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Even tho I followed that long road of self improvement, I still have some overthinking phases. What do you advice me to do at this stage ? Wait for him to comeback to me ? Or send a quick message someday (when ?) this week ?**

he said that he wanted to be my boyfriend but didn't wanna ""rush"" things to avoid getting in a situation like with his previous ex (he told oneday that he was last year with a girl that ended up treating him like shit si things ended , i asked him if he got over her he said yes : ).  )
So basically he said he made this choice to protect me and to avoid to "" loose me "" , i said i didn't wanna rush things either(deep down i sais that just to play it cool but yeah anyway )
 but i wanted to make things clear i told him 
"" But heey do you mean you Can talk to other girls ? Cause i want you to be my exclusivity "" he said "" ofc nooo dummy "" 
So yeah this is the story as seen on top , now let's go into more details , so at the very beginning When we started talking to eachother , i told him about my drawing account on Instagram he seemed he subsribed directly telling me to keep going and stuff blabla.. but here is where the shady things started he didn't subsribe with his main account (the one he put on his Profil ) he subsribed with another one :V he apologized to not being able to subscribe with the main one because "" that account was bugging "" 
It seemed weird to me at that time but didn't think much about it because we were still just classemates .
Some days after I checked  the accounts to which he was subscribed And his subsribers
I found out that the majority are girls accounts :v
But i didn't say anything ( made excuses for him in my head , i didn't wanna "" overthink"" it too much  )
I feel so naive : (
Days pass and our relationship evolved like i said before but I still have this doubt And this bad gutfeeling about this whole weird Instagram account stuff , so oneday i sent him a request on it then told him on messenger that i did to see what he says , he sais to me 
""Ohh i think i forget to tell you but this account is bugging i can't do anything with it , i use it very rarely "" 
I said okey :V (even tho deep down i knew it was weird And probably a lie but i catches feelings at that time so i made some excuses for him on my head once again .
Anyway to sum up a while after that i discovered that he blocked me with that main account When i went to Ask him if it was the case 
He was like "" whaaaaat ! i didn't And how Can you think i Can Do something like that : ( "" 
I said "" what would you think if you were at my place "" 
He said "" i don't know anything except that maybe "" 
That made me feel a lil guilty about it , so then we continued the convo as if nothing happened
Till 9 days before we had a Lil fight which wasn't really a fight but hé Turned it info one he sais something that hurt me but When i told him that it did he was like "" i don't wanna talk in this subject again ""
He told me "" later "" And went offeline :) didn't apologize or anything When he texted me again he asked if i was okay i said no he asked why ?? I told him once again about the thing that hurt And it was like he didn't Care AT ALL about how i feel "" I'm not talking in this SubJect again "" then he started yelling talking in a harsh way telling me "" MY PARENTS ARE ON THE VERGE OF A DIVORCE AND YOU'RE HERE TALKING TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING I SAID I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT STOP JUST STOP "" 
I apologized for his parents ( two days after everything was okay with his parents ) 
So yeah he used it as an excuse to get away with the fact that he hurt me , And I felt guilty for holding into it while his parents were on "" a verge if a divorce "" so yeah I just tried to support him And didn't talk about how i felt  or what hurt me again till the night i told him i had a shitty day he apologized it seemed that he was deeply sorry asked me to stay with him forever .. i really thought he was really sorry , then everything went back to normal .
Till The 17th of April , i checked his main Instagram account ( thé account hé told me hé didn't use that was bugging ..ect ) And discovered a girl name in the bio : ) the girl had his name on her bio too.
I went to tell him , I was so hurt i asked him why would he do something like this to me , i told him my Heart was broken  ,
He started LYING ONCE AGAIN , telling me it was his ex that is messing with his account And that she still has his password , then suddenly went like IF U DON'T BELEIVE ME F**** OFF LEAVE
"" You're crazyy "" When i gave him another evidance about the fact that he was probably cheating .
II was so confused about the way He was talking to me then he tried to put himself as a victim "" that's why i didn't wanna be in a relationship , huh let's stay friends if u dont want us to loose eachother "" 
Then want like do wanna know the truth i still have feelings for both of u And this why i didn't wanna rush things to  "" protect you "" i wanted to forget her completly then get in a relationship with you
I was so hurt that he continued lying , 
we continued talking on the phone he repeated the same things over And over  I was crying  I begged him to just tell me the truth he then blamed me for making him seem as liar , and was like i Love youu I'm madly in love , I'm sorry i put myself in this situation but it was to protect you , his apologies was so Fake , he kept lying and telling me that I was exagerating then went like nothing happened and said to me take care of urself good bye : )
I was so bitter about how  he invalidated how i feel ,  i didn't even get the right to have a closure , he tried to change the subject to shift the blame on me he tried to put himself as the innocent And as a victim , I was so heartbroken tbh.
After that I contacted that girl i wanted to have a clear conscience And tell her the truth and at the same time to have closure to ne able to move on , 
I asked her if she was really his ex she told me She wasn't 
Obviously  : ) And that she was with him since october 2019 
he betrayed not only me but her too , she told him i was talking to her , so he came to me what are doing ! Stop she's my girl i lied stop ,  you're evil i told him i just wanted her to know the truth and get a closure , he said he didn't Care about my life or my closure  , he called me crazyy , i was telling him stuff And he wasn't replying to that stuff but he was saying things in order to screenshot And make me seem as the bad one to that girl And to have an excuse he told me he didn't cheat on me because we weren't in a relationship :) 
He then told me he used to get a revange from his girlfriend cause she talked to a boy  And that he played me and now he started saying that he didn't had any feelings ,  he was talking in a such horrible  way that lacked empathy even his sorry was so fake and superficial  , he acted as if It wasn't a big deal told me that i was exagerating again .
And this is how things went with whom i thought was the love of my life .
This was my first exprience ever with someone i was so naive even tho there were redflags i shoul've acted on them  , i was so invested And cared so much and ended-up  getting hurt , i think I'll never be able to love or trust someone again ,

He had to leave and go overseas to another country for some time, but we had maintained our communication very well until very recently. We spoke like every other day.

About a week or so ago, I began to notice that he was becoming very sporadic with his replies, taking days at a time to get back to me. I took this as a sign that he was losing interest, which was kind of understandable as we are not seeing each other face to face while he is away for work.

This past weekend, I completely let go of this whole situation between us, because he completely ghosted me. First, he sent me a voice note on WhatsApp. I then replied to him with a voice note (he was asking a question, so I answered him). But I can see that he hasn't listened to the voice note I sent up until now. Never mind not replying, he hasn't even listened to it. And I know he is active on his phone and it's been like three days.

So I took this as an indication that dude is DEFINITELY no longer interested. I couldn't figure out why he even bothered to message me in the first place. But then today, I saw that he randomly liked a bunch of my pictures on Instagram. Even really old ones.

I'm very confused now. Why is he not only active on his phone, but also liking a bunch of my photos and watching my stories, but he cannot get back to my message? What does this mean?

I'll try to keep this short while still mentioning everything worth hearing.

So this girl, we'll call her F, went to the same school as I did for a few years, but was two grades below. We became friends after her graduation in 2018 when we both ended up working together at the same start-up, and we hit it off immediately. She had a boyfriend, whom I knew, but was still quite flirty with me, and despite me having a little crush on her, I never acted on it because she was in a relationship.

I got into a relationship shortly after, which ended this January. Her relationship ended in summer 2020 which she told me about when it happened, but being committed and in love myself, it didn't matter to me. We began speaking a bit more from Jan-Feb, at which point I, noticing we were both single at the same time for the first time since meeting, asked her on a date, to which she said she was not looking to date anyone at the moment. Neither of us are looking for anything serious, but I meant nothing more by a date than hanging out, just with my interest made clear.

We then began speaking a LOT more after about a couple of weeks of not talking after being rejected. We wound up speaking essentially every single day, and as time progressed, she seemed to be texting me a lot more, even when out and busy sometimes, which she does not normally do. We would flirt and I asked her to come over to my house last friday. We had a drink, got high, and watched some Adventure Time, which led to us cuddling and later kissing. She left about an hour later after some making out and another joint to go for a family dinner, which I was aware of before.

Now, however, things seem a little different after us meeting. She has not been as responsive through text as she used to be, now commonly taking multiple hours to respond to each message. I do know people get busy, but she appears to sometimes be online several times before replying to my text hours later. That said, on Sunday she did say we should go for sushi (without setting a date or anything). But the seeming despondence from her since we kissed does have me a little concerned.

What do you guys think? Am I overreacting? (I do have BPD so I am extremely prone to overthinking and worrying in waves). Should I wait and see how she is over the next few days?

Were both in college right now and we havent been able to see each other in a while because of the pandemic.

Lately she's been getting really distant with me and I dont know why, even though I've asked her about it numerous of times before. She's told me people at her university (We go to separate colleges) have been treating her like shit, sexually harassed and such and I've been really worried about her. We had met a few months before we started dating (which was about 2 months ago) and when we first met last year in fall she had low confidence, I still really liked her but because of things that we both had going on in our lives We stopped talking around december. I started to miss her so I reached out to her in the middle of february. We officially started dating at the end of february and when I reached out to her it was like she was a totally different person, she said she had stopped giving a fuck about what people thought of her and her confidence started rising. But 2 weeks ago out of the blue she texted me saying ""Imagine being ugly,"" which caught me by surprise. She told me she was feeling really ugly. This attitude continued for a while and she started getting more distant with me, responding less and less, and giving me one worded answers. No matter what I always told her I was there for her and that I always had her back.

Last week I asked if she wanted to take a break from talking to me for about a month (which I knew was unrealistic for me because I couldn't wait a month to talk to her again). I had deleted our chat to try and keep myself from the temptation of messaging her, but I broke, so Yesterday i had texted her for the first time in a week saying ""Hey."" That was in the morning and she hasnt responded all day. Its 3 in the afternoon for us right now, and she hasnt responded since.

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety that im trying to work on, but this is really triggering it. She posted on her instagram story all week as well as yesterday, so I know she saw my message. I dont know if she has me restricted so that it wont show if she saw my messages or not, but she was up all night last night on discord on a call with someone she posted on instagram saying she ""Made a new friend"" with him.

I cant tell if I'm overthinking or just being genuinely worried anymore because now I dont know if she's mad at me or doesnt want to be with me anymore or what. I feel so confused and sad and I think im going to cry because of it. I'm debating if I should just send her a final text message asking her to be honest with me about if she's mad at me for something I did (which I dont even know what about, i've replayed our conversations over, time and time again in my head and I dont know where I went wrong.), or if I should ask her to tell me what I did wrong, or if I should ask her if she even wants to be with me anymore

I never thought of him as anything more when we were in HS/college. Maybe thought he was kind of cute, but an asshole for the most part. But now he is 25 and I am 24 and there might be something there. We recently connected started texting, and snap chatting. I asked him not to tell my family we were talking and he agreed it didn't need to be explained for now. I can tell he is interested and very curious about me. (I look a lot different than I did at 17/18, thankfully) He called me babe, honey and beautiful. He texts me frequently ""hopes I have a good day"" or checks in to see how I am doing/how my day s going which is super sweet and really makes me feel good. I can tell he is more intrigued by me when I stay stand offish and make him chase, it feels fun and new. My thing is I am wondering where the line is that he is chasing me to he is the only one making an effort and feels like I am not interested. We haven't gone on a date or hung out as anything more than acquittances. The reason I am not eager to show him I am super into him is because he has always been more of a fuck boy and I knew that about him from the start but like I said we are both older now and have changed a lot. Over the weekend he was going to my families lake house with my cousin and his friends. I sent him a few photos while he was driving up and from his response I could tell he was really impressed with how I looked. On Sat morning he sent me a text that was a bit more flirty than usual ""Hey you. I hope you have a great day today ""kissy face emoji"". Since I like to sleep in on the weekends due to being busy during the week I did not respond until early afternoon, and I think I may have came off unintentionally cold.  After that, Sat was a little quiet, Sunday quiet but not mute and he never responded to my last text I sent to him. Kind of a dead end convo... then yesterday aka Monday morning.. mute no texts. So, I sent him a snap chat, which he opened but no response. About an hour after the sc he sends me a sc of him in the office but the sc seemed like it could have been a mass snap for a bunch of people and not just directed to me.  I responded t it anyways and he just sent me a picture of our bitmojis together him blowing mine a kiss. If I texted him and he didn't respond that would be four no responses in a row. He has been really nice to me so I want to show him the same without coming off as lame or trying too hard. I guess this seems a bit dramatic but has he lost interest? **And could it be bc I haven't reciprocated the same efforts? He did mention last week he felt it wasn't being reciprocated and said ""he couldn't get a read on me""** Whatever that means...Should I text him something subtle but sweet that says I am still into you without actually saying it?

To give some context, we had been talking consistently (every day) for 2 weeks before the date and he was saying all the right things - that he was looking for a relationship, wants kids, everything you could hope for. So I went over to his place (couldn't do much else with COVID restrictions where I am) and we had some drinks and food, played some games and had great conversation. I really felt like we were vibing super well, he kissed me a few times throughout the night, was super affectionate (not in a sexual way, but things like holding my hand when we were watching TV). There was no awkwardness that usually comes along with first dates, I really felt like we just had so much fun together. I was planning on Ubering home because I drove there and had too much to drink, but he convinced me to just stay over so that I could drive my car home the next morning. He even offered for me to sleep in the guest room if I felt weird about it. He seemed like a perfect gentleman and we had been hitting it off so I felt good about staying. I slept in his bed and of course we ended up hooking up. The next morning everything was normal, no real awkwardness or anything, and he thanked me for the great company. 

I go home and receive no text from him, so I message him later that night saying thanks for everything and I had a lot of fun. He replies and we have a quick conversation, but then he eventually stops answering. I don't hear from him the next day at all (like I said, before we met we were talking every day consistently). 

I'm just feeling super confused because I felt like it was a great date, and I'm left wondering what happened. I can't help but think it's because I slept with him too soon, but would that really stop a guy from wanting to see you again if they had a really good time with you? Maybe he was just saying all of the right things when really all he wanted was sex? I don't know but I'm just feeling kind of deceived at the moment.

I’m 24M and have been online dating for a few years. Over time I’ve become frustrated because I feel like I’m wasting my time. Today I just want to rant about some stuff I hate about Online Dating.

1. No bios 
This has to be my biggest pet peeve. If your bio is empty then I know nothing. I have nothing to base my decision to swipe right other than your pictures. Sure you look hot but it’s not all about looks. You’re probably thinking “why not swipe right anyway and see if you match” I find that to be a waste of time because if we do match I have nothing to go off of and usually the people I match with don’t really talk. 


2. Promoting social media 
I absolutely hate it when people say “oh I’m not on here a lot so message me on social media”. I’m not here to bounce around apps. Dating apps have messaging features for a reason. Plus when I take the effort to reach out to them via social media it usually results to nothing. 


3. Matched but no response 
It takes two to match. If you swiped right on my profile I’d imagine you saw something you liked. But usually when I message a match I get no response or a lack of interest. This makes me question why you swiped right in the first place. Are people just mindlessly swiping???


4. They always want the other person to message first because they’re “not good at starting conversations” 
I see this on so many profiles. And yea maybe you’re shy or suck at starting conversations but come on you can’t expect the other person to always put effort into making the first move. I usually make the first move and tbh it gets tiring after a while. I could do the same as them and tell people to message first but I know nothing would come of that. 


5. The constant back pain
Say I matched with someone and it seems like we’re compatible based on our profiles, tell me why holding a normal conversation is like banging my head against a wall. I swear the amount of back pain I suffered from carrying conversations is over 9000. I would show interest and ask questions about themselves but I don’t get the same energy back. Most of the time they barely talk or give very generic responses. Like I don’t understand, why match with me if you don’t have any interest??? 

Anyway that’s all I have for now. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope y’all have a wonderful day 🥰

Then I started working out, got a nose job, started taking care of my hair and skin and generally became more comfortable in my skin. Ended up with a boyfriend through my senior year of high school which I ended for reasons primarily related to incompatibility. Have had only one other relationship since, but have dated around quite a bit, met some guys who were great. But nothing that went anywhere.

I find myself only developing strong feelings for someone once in a blue moon, and when I do, it’s rarely for someone who feels the same. My most recent ex was the only exception. After him I caught feelings for two different guys: the first took me on three dates and told me he was crazy about me on the third, then told me he didn’t want anything serious the next day. Ended up having to block his number because he kept drunk texting me to tell me how much he wishes he was in a place to date right now so he could ‘deserve’ me. The second was a guy I hooked up with on and off for six months and ultimately ended things with because I started to catch feelings and we had agreed on casual only from the beginning.

I’m at a loss. Sometimes I feel like I should settle for someone I don’t have feelings for so people stop asking me why I’m always single. I am currently on vacation in my hometown and have gotten a handful of offers for dates but it’s always from guys who are uneducated and lack ambition. I just started my masters in statistics and want someone who is on a similar track in life. I also find myself losing attraction to someone when they become clingy and start outwardly expressing interest in me.

My psychologist says that it may be self sabotage, that I may be choosing to pursue people I know don’t want me because I don’t think I deserve love. That I only seek out casual relationships and hookups because I think it’s the best I’m going to get. I do have a history of self harm and was hospitalized for anorexia as a kid, grew up in an extremely abusive household and left the country once I graduated high school as a result. I know that I have issues and need to work on those. I know that I’m young and have lots of time.

We'd talked about marriage in kids in depth. He was only 31 and he had so many plans and ideas. We hadn't even gotten to the point where we ""defined the relationship"". We'd decided 3 months would be a great point wait it out to see if we matched well, and we were only a week shy of that. I'd been spending whole weeks at a time at his house with him and he lived alone. 

  Part of me is still in so much disbelief. I didn't follow him on any social media platforms and nor did we take any pictures together. Neither of us used social media like that, so there wasn't much of a point. We were both very private. That being said I never met any of his friends or family either, so when he completely stopped talking to me for the first time in 3 months I had no idea where to even start asking. I did think he had ghosted initially, but I knew that wasn't like him, so I combed through what little I could find everywhere and anywhere. 

   None of his immediate friends or family were on social media. I'd only learned of his death from a facebook post his cousin had posted a day ago. They knew he was gone on Sunday and I didn't find out until today. 

 He didn't even tell me where he'd actually gone. I thought he was at a dance competition, but it turns out he went with his friends to a small private birthday party for his tight knit friend group. At this point I'm wondering if I was actually as close to him as I thought. Could I even deserve an invite to the funeral? 

I don't know what to think or how to feel. This is the first time anyone this close to me has died. I've not even experienced a close family members death before. I am only 23 and I've been so blessed.

My ex was 12 years older than me and we met when I was 19 and he was 31 (yes, I know you’re cringing cause I am too now). 

After that relationship I tried OLD and literally lasted 2 days. I can’t deal with or be bothered to expend the energy having to answer multiple messages from multiple people. I barely like texting people I already have some type of relationship with; texting is so draining to me. 

Next, I tried to freestyle (go out and meet people organically). I have absolutely no problem approaching guys first and starting a conversation. What better place than my college campus right? I tried talking to a few different people to mingle in. Then it hit me, a memory from before I started dating my ex (I’m talking all of high school and early college) when I was actively looking for a boyfriend then. Every time I try to talk to and get a guy my age to like me, they don’t. One guy I met called me intimidating because basically I’m not a bum? I have a job that allows me financial stability, I have future goals (graduating w a degree soon) and I’m in shape/take decent care of myself. Another guy wasn’t much of an L when he said he doesn’t date girls that don’t drink at parties (I have a problem with alcohol so I completely stopped drinking it recently. I also stopped smoking tobacco, cause cigs are gross af). 

I get approached *a lot* by men 10+ years older than me, and never by guys 25 and younger. Lots of aspects are attractive to me when it comes to older men. But what it comes down to is Older men are just not fun to me at this stage in my life. Plain and simple. They are either so far ahead of me in life we’re not really compatible or they are at the same place (my ex) or below where I am (unemployed/no income, no car/license, in massive debt) in life as me but hella older which is also a huge turn off because like, what are you doing with your life. I know men like to preach “men get better with age like a fine wine” and that shit just isn’t true. Their sex drive diminishes, they have low energy, past the going out phase... and the worst one of all, call me “kid” or some patronizing shit similar while at the same time trying to get their dick wet. 

I’m 22 years old. I want to have sex everyday, and go out occasionally on my days off, and do things besides sit in a room and look at my phone all day with a man that thinks he’s so much smarter than me just cause he’s older.

Basically, I'm learning that whenever a match seems like a good one, it usually mean it's too good to be true. 

These are what the five matches entailed:

* A woman who matched me just because she wanted to insult my profile and the way I looked. Not sure what her deal was, but I tend to gravitate toward more liberal-leaning women and it was discouraging to experience one who wanted to go out of their way just to be mean.
* A woman whose first question upon matching me was asking how tall it was. My height is in my profile, and I'm average height. All 5'4"" of her then proceeded to make a big issue about how ""short"" I was and it was a dealbreaker.
* A woman who disclosed after a couple of days of conversation that she actually has already been divorced... twice... and she's only 34. Once down the aisle is more understandable, but twice? Yikes.
* A woman whose profile pictures hid the fact that both her arms are absolutely covered in some really corny, colorful tattoos. I'm not against tattoos and love really artist ones, but hers were a bit much to me. I don't think they're regretful tattoos on her part, either -- I just think she failed to use profile pictures that fully depicted them. 
* Finally, this one stung the most: Great personality, smart, fun to talk to, really pretty, and then, the swerve: She not only has a child, but her child is a 4 month old baby, and it didn't sound like she has divorced her drunk cheating ex just yet. Realistically, that situation between them seems far from over, especially with a child that young being involved. It's too bad I didn't meet her before her ex did...

""Do you like me as a friend?""

I sit for a few minutes, think of the right answer. Do i keep the truth to myself and tell her a lie or do i share the truth.

Decided to tell her the truth.
Told her i was planning to keep it to myself but i didn't want to lie to her.

She cracked a joke, laughed and said thanks for my honesty. I was panicking at the point. I was expecting her to shut it down and cut off our friendship but she didn't seem bothered by it, infact she seemed happy.
It was closing time so she told me not to worry, everything is fine.

Yesterday she wanted to talk about it.
Said she felt guilty over the weekend because she was wondering if she led me on by giving me the wrong impression.

I told her the fault was all my mine and she had nothing to worry about.

She told me it's probably just the idea of her i like and not her.

So i told her how i felt,
I told her when i see her come to work i feel happy, when she leaves i feel sad.
When i hear her laugh it makes me happy no matter what i am feeling and her smile makes me even more so

So i definitely think it's her i like.

She told me yesterday afternoon that everything is good and we can carry on talking.

I’m (19 M) sophomore college student who about two months ago met a nice girl (18) on tinder. She was graduating from high school this year. We really hit It off and for about 3 weeks we talked regularly. I was absolutely thrilled about it because I’ve never had this this sort of thing seem like it would pan out for so long. I really can’t overstate how great it was. We talked about all kinds of things, and she brought out my funny side too. She would text me early in the morning to wake me up, which I thought was the most precious thing.

We never met up with each other as we were planning. Due to a week delay for conflicting schedules and whatnot. I had a hell week of tests and due dates and her work schedule was utterly packed. No sweat, I took a break from our usually nightly conversations to prioritize my schoolwork and she likewise. So by the end of the week, I reached out to no response. Then again and again I reached out about a day in between attempts trying not to seem annoying. Another week passed when I made the realization I’d been blocked on Snapchat. Her profile had disappeared from my friend list. That hurt a bit. 

Anyways, i know it might seem childish to call this a relationship, but in my inexperience, this was a mountain of one. I’m just glad I saw what a relationship could be, and it’s made me both happy that it happened, but unfortunately doubtful it will happen again. I’m still confused why it ended, but Im glad it happened. I thought about reaching out on other social media just to make sure it wasn’t some accident. After all, It wasn’t  very clear that she’d blocked me on sc but I googled what was going on with her prof pic. But then again, I figured I’d  rather not be a creep about it and just move on. And alas, months later, I’m just glad I got the chance to experience this thing, whatever it was, if only over the phone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,726855,public,self,Reflecting on my first “relationship”,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muvcxn/reflecting_on_my_first_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,,,

There was a girl I used to be very flirty with but things have sadly died down (I wasn't consistent and in person during our only date wasn't flirty at all). Anyways I'm looking to try to rekindle things and have our conversations as fresh and exciting as they used to be and hopefully see her again. So I wanted to mention a few things I've done before in the past that got her pulling away, and wanted some insights as to why?

I had one date with her and at first she seemed very open to a 2nd date but when I brought up her possibly spotting me next time which got her acting a little weird, no 2nd date was done yet and we continued chatting. On a previous post people pointed out that she could have been turned off or felt pressured as to the why behind this so I know what I did wrong but here are other things that I'd like to point out and get some opinions:

So she likes to consider herself an artist, and I remembered it took weeks to see one pic from her after I showed her a few pics of mine. She said I was amazing. I noticed after the one pic, which I called cute (it wasn't the best but I like encouraging others who also like art), if I tried to get her to send more, she usually ended the conversation and had to do ""chores"" or ""got busy."" I think it's due to insecurities, but not entirely sure.

She grew up as in my opinion an ugly duckling (dorky kid who was average looking), so I also noticed if I tried to get her to send pics (not forceful and never asked for anything inappropriate), it's like pulling teeth. Mind you, she dolls up nicely! She's petite and in my opinion stinking cute now (she's early 20s). I met her this year though, and had looked up previous posts and noticed she used to post a lot more, but it was mainly family that liked it. The pics she did send me were sadly low resolution pics. Not sure if this again is due to insecurities or not. Anyways when I asked a little about this in a light hearted teasing way, she tried to joke it off and say she's on other social media platforms, some of which I'm on and when I added them, they quickly back pedaled and mentioned just liking stuff and not much of a poster when I teased them about her having hardly anything on those platforms either and again she will say ""Got to go, I'm busy.""

She's a huge Anime and Disney buff and this is the 2nd to last thing I've done that got her again pulling away. She ended up telling me about a sports anime and that she has a plushie of one of the main characters who she finds attractive but the character sadly gets a lot of crap from the fandom. I held my composure quite well since hey there were cartoon characters growing up that I found attractive so since she was huge into Disney as well, I asked her about what her story would be like as a Disney Princess. At first she was writing a lot, however when I mentioned her plushie as being her little servant, kind of like Olaf from Frozen or the various Disney animal critters are to the different princesses, and asked what he'd be doing for/with her, she left me on read for close to an hour, before saying she wasn't sure and again, ended the conversation, after this one though, she started to become distant.

We used to chat often and I used to compliment her often as well to let her know I was interested. I used to be the one as well, who'd end the conversations (mind you on a good note). I've known her since February and even though she was very receptive to my flirting and compliments, she never complimented me, and for every 5 or 6 questions I've asked, I might get 1 in return. So I stopped hitting on her entirely and just chatted, and  a couple of weeks doing this, kinda killed our communication entirely (I actually stopped complimenting her before the whole Disney Princess question). When I started using words like buddy, it finally killed things altogether and we haven't spoken in over 2 weeks.

Anyways, she's been on my mind lately and I'm trying to find out if I decide to try again what the best route would be? She's exceedingly sweet and good natured, and I really liked her. Like seeing her the first time made me feel that spark and I like how close she is to family and I really have been wanting her to open about who she is and not be afraid to express herself. I wasn't sure how to approach them. They're heavily religious as well and she doesn't strike me as the usual girl in today's dating market.

Our relationship feels really solid , we have a lot of passion ,good sex, much love. I do consider that we are best friends, we do everything together , we always want to make each other happy, look after each other , am always the first person he comes to for everything but ...From a few moths ago until today he seems to be kind of sexist and hater towards women and I don’t like it at all. He often read bools about women psych and man psych and he brings up this statements from the book to back up things that has nothing to do, also he tries to forcefully convince me about what he reads although I have already expressed I do not agree. He makes sarcastic comments all the time, not only about me but about his sister and mom too, just all women. For example he gets really heated up when driven , and if a car gets in front or does something that stressed him he will say something like “Ofcourse why do I get mad? is just a women” . He also seems to be annoyed or disturbed if he is with a friend or any male and a female figure (me , sister, mom) walks up to the room or joins the conversation. His facial expression changes automatically. With his mom and sister I might understand they can be really annoying and bossy , but am not like that at all , am really not dramatic am super chillen in fact i get along better with boys . And so am really observational and i have noticed that i could be saying the same thing as a male around , same tone same everything and he just looks and talks back to the other male almost ignoring me. There has been times where I have told him something like for example when cooking “oh babe try doing this it will taste better” and well probably be just like an babe let me do it my way but then if A male tells him he shows interest and ends up doing that.  So its really not about something that girls do that is annoying it could be a same behavior or comment and he receives ir negatively and positively from a man. 

Also kind of hurst me like when for example he gets home and he shows more happiness to see brother in law (friend) than to see me . Ive also witness their conversations by just been there and listening and making no comments . Then trying to step in and his friend seems to have the same interest and enthusiasm in the conversation with me and also his gf , is only my bf that looks disturbed by girls including me. 

TL:DR I think my bf is sexist or hates women ! Could it possibly be a trauma from his past relationship since his e was really mean to him? ( she made him chase her all the time and constantly rejected him and treated him like garbage which made him had a obsessive relationship to her instead of a love one) .

Let's get the obligations out of the way: I am on my mobile, sorry. And tl:dr at bottom is I can remember because this might just be a doozy. 

I have been in a dead bedroom marriage for 16 years. I won't go into why I cannot get divorced atm, just know I have good reasons. But it was making it impossible to date, as no one wants to date someone with a spouse even when the spouse is aware and approving of the relationship. Instead, I have had several FWBs type situations in the past. But those were not fulfilling. I needed more than just sex, I needed companionship. 

In the past 5 or 6 years I have met several guys I was interested in. The last one nearly broke me altogether. I liked him a lot, and he, admittedly, liked me back. But he, understandably, couldn't get past my being married. Even with the end in sight. 

For the past two years I have been sleeping with an old friend, off and on. We had amazing sexual chemistry and we found it easier and easier to confide in one another. In February, while discussing what we actually were to one another, we came to the conclusion that we both had feelings for one another. Two months later we are madly in love and making plans for our future. We spend every available free moment together. We have already made two separate weekend getaway trips so we could spend more time together. He has met every important person in my life and I have met everyone in his. We both just want to shout our love to the universe! 

Just two months ago, I was deeply lonely. I was going through so much and I had thought I would just move on after my divorce and be on my own thereafter. Now, I am planning a wonderful future with the most caring, amazing man I know. 

My whole point is this: please don't give up. You never know if your someone is right under your nose (as mine was) or one swipe away on OLD. It is truly worth the risk. And the right person will be willing to wait for you to figure things out.

Then it developed more positive than i thought, she laughs a bit more than im used to see from her, she drops some compliments, i compliment her back. Today she had a lot of stuff to do for uni and still she had time to go for a walk in the park for 2 hours. I initiated some conversations but most of the time she started talking about things. She always sais she had a great time and that we have to meet again next week. Also she suggested baking together next week. In our texts theres a A LOT of smileys like :))))) or :DDD

The first I met in high school and we dated for 5 years and broke up in March of 2014 after we decided it would be best as she was moving to Victoria for University, after that I thought all my relation ships would be like that, I was wrong.

The second lasted between February of 2015 and and November 2016, it was a decent and we had a bit of rough spot but we got along well, I’m even on good terms with her parents still. However her true personality came out when my grandmother was hospitalized and I had to do all the driving and shopping for my grandmother. This made her angry as I went from seeing her 3-4 times a week to once a week (note this was temporary from the beginning), and she gave me the option of my family or her. I was I so much shock at the time that I didn’t know what to say so she decided that was the end. This then led to some trouble later on but that’s a different story.

My last and most recent relation ship lasted from 2017 till January of 2020 , we had been living together for 2 years and everything was fine till I came home and she was with another guy. Her excuse was that she had “decided to become polyamorous” and didn’t even ask me if I was ok with it. Needless to say I stayed together for another 2 months to try and be understanding but after she moved in another guy I decided I was done a left.

Since after the last break up I’ve been trying as best I could with dating apps but covid in general have made it hard and any match I’ve made either is advertising (OF, Instagram,Snap) or ends in the other person just not responding. And the 2 dates I have had both ended with me being stood up. Is it even worth it for me to continue trying at this point?

We decided to have a picnic at the park for our first date which was a bad idea because it was like 100 degrees lol
when he first arrived I was nervous and I think he was too? we didn't really hug or anything like I was REALLY nervous.. we couldn't really keep eye contact with each other half of the time, we didn't even wanna eat infront of each other like 
we were being really stiff around the first few minutes, we were playing a card game and I'd look at him and he'd look away sometimes when I caught him staring but I'd do the same a bit. we played a card game and when we'd exchange cards we were scared to touch each other like idk I was just SUPER nervous
 It was my first date and he said it was his second, but after a while though we walked around and talked and laughed, we got on the swings and stuff too and talked for a while. we ended up sitting down for the rest of the time and we were like far apart on the bench watching baseball just talking.
at that point we got more comfy around each other which was good.
while we were sitting down he showed me a picture on his phone anddd we were just talking about random things. he stated he was ""tired"" and he laid down on the bench. his head was super close to my lap and I think he wanted to lay on it but I'm not sure... I think he was just tired? but then he ended up sitting up after like 3 minutes. he got more closer to me on the bench from where he started which I noticed and we were just vibing, but when things were getting just right I had to go :( 
I apologized for leaving early and he said it's fine, he said he had a good time, and we texted all night after. we planned a movie next so I'm looking forward to that

We had a good chat for almost an hour about life, what we had been up to and where we left off.

We talked about the last time we saw each other, and she told me that a lot was going on in her life and that feelings got a little bit too intense for her. She said that she'd want to take things slowly if we met up again after I asked. It was pretty obvious, or at least I got vibes that she still likes me from some of the things which she had to say, so I proposed we meet, and she said she's willing once she gets herself organized over the coming weeks.
