The first time I fell in love was with a girl who, on the second date, retreated to the bathroom and came back with huge tissues stuffed in each nostril due to her hay fever. The whole realness of her got me crushing on her mad and I couldn't figure out exactly why.

Yet.

Flirting just kinda feels like lying and so does ""leaving a good first impression"" when I know my current behavior isn't the one I'm always going to have around them. Jamming two snot ridden tissues in a nose is far from a ""good impression"", but that's what I loved so much about it. I wasn't seeing her *impression*. I was seeing *her* and that's why it was just so pretty damn attractive. Same when her mouth was hanging open when she was too focused on a videogame.

When I thought about it, I found it extremely hard to believe that I am unique in this. I honestly believe that most people by now prefer ""what's your favorite type of garbage bag"" over ""can I get you a drink"" as an opening sentence. I honestly think I speak for most when I say climbing a random tree is more fun than drinking to world peace. I had a girlfriend and sometimes we'd tickle each other's armpits by blinking with our eyelashes over it. Sometimes in public. It was awesome. But I think even couples married for 40+ years were standing there looking at each other and secretly thinking to themselves ""omg I totally want to do that to you now"". But they won't because of the taboo on weirdness.

And I even bet that whoever reads this post and whatever letters you got in your chromosomes, you now actively long to tickle a SO's armpits with your eyelashes.

Don't get me wrong, we can also be really damn boring. Imagine the absence of pressure if we end our first date(s) doing whatever we'd do if were together for 10 years, just doing our everyday stuff. *Do* we actually find that boring or did we just condition ourselves to believe that we *should?* I mean, why is it boring? Isn't it a prime opportunity to test your compatibility to the best possible extend: seeing how you're both capable of amusing *yourselves and* still find a way to appreciate the presence of the other for simply being there. Nothing *ever* needs to be boring. You can go watch an ant colony outside and not be bored if you learn to have an eye for it. And it all can be shared if so preferred.

Of course I still believe it still helps to be physically hot. However, after having our newfound thirst for liberty literally revolutionizing the developed world, isn't showing freedom by daring to be openly odd or and/or boring now more a sign of confidence (and therefore also natural attractiveness) than to still play the rules of the game and etiquette?

Based on all this and my own personal experiences, I think we'd all prefer to quit the mating dance and be ourselves in the *actual* sense of the term. Like.. don't pop your pimples before you go on a date. Save it for a contest where you both try to hit objects with its contents.

Background below, but also summarized at the end as I know it's lengthy. 

**Background:** We've known each other for 11 years and early on in our friendship, he caught feelings for me. I did not return them, but I liked the attention and company so regrettably took advantage of the situation to feel less lonely. We never hooked up back then. However, I wasn't careful with his feelings and actively sought out his friendship and company. Separately, I also briefly dated his best friend which hurt him a lot. 

We drifted a part for a couple years due to life, location, etc. in addition to him purposely distancing himself from me. However, in the past 3-4 years we've reconciled as friends, I apologized for being a shitty person back then, and we became close again. 

Maybe 2 years back, we tried to date but it was short-lived. It felt unnatural at that time, I was wrapped up in city dating life (being very upfront about it with him) and not ready to commit, and being long-distance got in the way of seeing us as a serious potential and I ended things. He was disappointed, but he understood I wasn't on the same page as him. 

Fast-forward to the pandemic and we started talking every day. When I told him I was interested in trying again, he did not want to open that door back up and said he didn't have feelings for me anymore. Also, skeptical that my feelings were genuine and not due to quarantine/isolation.

We still continued to keep in touch and talk afterwards. For me, the feelings were hard to get rid of, but I started to work on myself by going to therapy. From there, we've seen each other a few times and have hooked up, which left me hurt as I knew where his heart stood. After the last time, I told him I needed some space to process out my feelings, hard to do as we run in the same circles. Half way through this year, we went to the same cabin trip and had kissed the first night. For the rest of the summer, we didn't speak and I made a lot of progress getting over him. 

Last week, I had caught up with another one of our mutual girl friends and she revealed to me that she had hooked up with my friend during the same cabin trip back in May. I was livid. I felt so dirty and upset that he had treated me like a fling with a stranger so I called him after and let it all out. After I said that it probably wasn't a good idea to be in each other's lives, he  told me that he still had feelings for me. 

This week, we had a long conversation about where we stood and what we were looking for. The feelings are there on both sides, but for him he isn't sure if they are enough for the risk and sacrifice due to our history, still not being in the same location, and him going into a busy period of his PhD where he won't have a ton of time or money to spend on the relationship.

For me, I'm still all in despite this. However, I struggle with going into this without hearing his plan. Since he's been hot and cold with me all year, I don't know if his feelings are genuine and if he'll want to put in the work. I told him I needed consistency and for him to show me I'd be a priority in his life, but I don't know how he would do that if he will have limited time or means to do so. 

**TLDR**; My friend and I are finally close to being on the same page romantically after 11 years, but after so much time being hot/cold from both sides we have a lot of mistrust and would have an unideal start to our relationship, being long-distance and during the most stressful/busiest time of his PhD.  

**So my questions to the community are:** 

\-  Are feelings enough or is this even worth pursuing if there has been a lot of hurt on both sides and external factors that are not setting this up to be the ideal beginnings of a relationship? 

\- Should I be taking his hesitation as a red flag for how he will potentially act in a relationship with me?

Background: I met him at a party. We have mutual friends and really hit it off. He even walked me home. We snapchatted almost every minute/hour of every day for a week (from 8am-4am sometimes). It was never anything sexual… or even flirty. The most flirting he ever did with me was call me “nerd” and I loved it aha. 

He did ask me out to a bar twice (while drunk). Once it was at 2am and the second time was Christmas night. He even said that he was gonna come to get me so I could go, but it was 2am. And then on the night that he asked me to go at 2am, from 3-4am he asked me to go over his house to “sleep and watch our fav show”. He was literally begging. I didnt go any of where he invited me because I feel like he wants something different than me. I’m interested in a relationship whereas I am assuming that he is not? 

But even after “rejecting him”, we still talked daily and A LOT. But then one night his friend (we’ll call him Jay) snapchatted me and told me that he (Jay) “thinks he’s in love with me”—even though I’ve only hung out with Jay once along with other people; basically, I barely know Jay and never even flirted with him. And Jay also said “I might have to unadd you but it’s not your fault”… minutes later, the guy I have been talking to (let’s call him Matt), sends me a picture of him over his friend Jay’s house… I can’t help but think that Matt was telling Jay and his other friends that we are “talking”?

Even during that night, Matt and I were still talking back-and-forth for hours but then the next day, he started ignoring me and leaving me on delivered for long periods of time all while his snap score is going up. The same thing is still happening. And last night I asked him if he wanted to hang out before he leaves (he’s in the military) and he just sent his face and took hours to respond to me again… I was so hurt because I really really like him and wanted to hang out.

I’m also sensitive 

Some background, I’m 17, he’s 17. We’ve known each other since elementary school and have been good friends. He took an interest to me in middle school and now I am interested in him as well since we began talking more and becoming closer. He wants to go on a date with me someday but I’m not ready yet since I feel too young and dumb and I want to work on myself before getting into any kind of commitment. 

He’s quite nice to me and I enjoy his company. He went to a different school starting freshman year, so there’s no way to talk in person besides over text which we’ve been doing for the past 3 or so years (only recently getting SUPER close in 2020 just before quarantine.)

Today something really bothered me. He’s out with his friends, I can respect that. I am okay with him being away from his phone and all that. One text I sent him while he was with his buddies was just something about me doing blablabla. He then texts back an hour later telling me “THE TV IS BROKEN // FUCK”

This just peeved me a bit. Not only does he take forever to respond but he completely ignores the thing I said to tell me something useless. I can’t do anything about his TV, so why bring it up and ignore what I say? I send a dry text and he then sends me a funny video of himself. I just think he’s very oblivious or something. But I hate it. It makes me feel like he doesn’t listen to what I have to say or takes no interest in it. And I completely understand that he’s with his friends, but it still bothered me.  feel selfish because we aren’t even dating but since he’s been waiting on me so long it only feels like we are pretty much “together”. I think my feelings are valid, I just care about him and want the best for him. it just hurt my feelings that he ignored me. It concerns me because if I’m going to waste my time or potentially be with this person, if he’s gonna be indifferent I want nothing to do with it. But it hurts me because I really like and care about him. I want to get to know him even more. Please let me know if I’m being dramatic or if anyone who is currently coupled has an experience with an indifferent partner. It just really isn’t reassuring when he can act like that towards me. I did tell him that he very slightly upset me but I’ll get over it because I saw something funny and I wanted to send it to him, but not exactly let him off. I wanted to leave it up to him if he was curious as to what he did. All he said was “I am sorry” Again he’s with his friends so i don’t know how hard it is to text. But when he’s like that it just makes me view him differently …. Im just waiting for his next text back eighth now. But i wish he was even curious to know or talk about what he did that upset me.

How willing are you to ask for what you need or for change, and how much do you think you should expect?

This is mostly hypothetical, but I do have a reason for asking. As some background, my (22F) parents' relationship with each other naturally shaped my perception of relationships, which was rather unfortunate because theirs is not particularly good. They have very different desires, and although one will yield to the other, they very rarely if ever do so happily and without anger or snide and rude remarks. My mother would often come to me after an argument and say things like ""make sure you're with someone who you're evenly matched with, unlike your father and I."" Because of this, I know I'm coming at it with a lot of preconceived notions and fears about falling into an unhappy marriage.

The reason I ask this is because my boyfriend and I get along incredibly well in a general sense, but we do differ in some of our desires (both small and not). As a result, I fear these differences will eventually come to a head at some point and cause issues. For what it's worth, if he is doing something I don't want him to, he will stop if I am blunt enough, but I guess I have this perception that if things were truly \~meant to be\~ we would get along easily or want to do things similarly and I wouldn't have to ask him to go against his wishes. Nothing wrong with him or me, but just different.

Despite that lengthy explanation, I don't need specific relationship advice (although I am open to it), more just hearing different perspectives from those with better world views. So to reiterate, how do you know when you're compatible, and how do you know when you're not?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1142079,public,self,Incompatibility? Differing values?

I learn of this after the party from my roommate, who tells me it would be weird if we dated or anything like that. Since I am close really close with his family and interact with them frequently, if anything bad were to happen there is large potential for awkwardness. However as time passed and I got to know her better, I began to realize I have feelings for her.

Over the past year and a halfish, I begin to realize I have feelings for her. We have a snapchat streak and since I am close with my best friend’s family, I interact with her on a somewhat regular basis. However, I am hesitant to ask her out or anything still remembering what he told me after the party.

For even more context, about a year after said party of incidence, our other roommate asked said sister out on a date (with hesitant permission from my best friend) and was rejected, however I feel like I would have a better shot. We interact frequently and at least I feel like we connect in many different ways.

I am scared to talk to my best friend about this since losing our friendship would be devastating to me, however my feelings for this girl are somewhat strong, as currently and for the past few days I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her. Advice would really be appreciated, since I want to talk to my best friend about the issue but do not really know what to do.

So there's this insanely cute girl I've been super into for the past half-a-year. She lives in my apartment building and we met due to the fact we both have puppies and got them around the same time.

I've been trying to work up the courage to be more confident around her. I'm not the most outgoing person, and I take a while to open up to people. I've had ample opportunity over these past several months to get her contact info and set up a doggy play date or something, but I kept freezing up whenever I'd run into her because I was nervous and frankly intimidated by how gorgeous and cool she was. She seemed very friendly with me from the get go, but I kept telling myself ""She's just being friendly. She's not flirting with you. She's made friends with every other dog owner in the building, I'm no different. You don't know if she's single. She's out of your league"".

Not only did my own self-esteem issues prevent me from doing anything, but the last thing I wanted was to make her feel awkward by asking her out in the case she's not interested given we see each other fairly regularly.

As of late, I've finally felt like I was ready to just go for it and either ask her out, or at the very least get her number. I've noticed a trend the past handful of times I've taken my dog out that when I walk past her first floor apartment unit, she happens to come outside with her dog the moment I walk by and am headed back inside, almost as if she saw me through her window and intentionally came out. I could totally be off and completely overthinking this, but this has now happened a multiple times to the point where it doesn't seem possible to be a coincidence. This made me feel really good, like holy shit, she might actually be into me! Every time I run into her she's very chatty with me and plays with my pupper. 

This evening I was chatting with her for about 5 minutes or so after she came out with her dog when I was heading back inside. After talking about the dogs for a minute, she tosses out the fact that she's moving to another state in a few months. I feel absolutely devastated. I know I shouldn't be considering I really don't know her that well at all, nor am I actually confident she's into me, but I've been beating myself up for months for not going after her. Then I finally work up the courage to take action and go after what I want, and I get hit by this massive blow. I told myself earlier today before I ran into her that the next time I saw her, I was just gonna go for it once and for all. Then I get hit with the fact she's moving, and I just couldn't do it. 

So what should I do now? Should I just distance myself? Move on? Forget the idea of her? Or would it still be worth trying to get to know her? I know this sounds silly because I barely even know her. It's just that I haven't been this attracted to a woman in so long. She just seems so perfect to me, but I know my judgment is a clouded.

Even though he really, really likes hanging out with me, he has a lot of fun with me, our conversations are really in-depth and fun. Oh, and I’m super attractive. 

We hooked up two years ago as a one night stand — I was cool with it, so was he. We went out own ways, I met someone. I broke up with that person, this guy noticed and came back around, but we didn’t hang out for about a year later due to the pandemic, but talked fairly consistently.

I agreed to hang back in January, but kept our visit light, we talked all night and had a great time, made out a bit, but no hookup and I sent him home. Timing was weird for us this entire year, but he kept in contact, trying to get together again this entire year. I finally caved and felt ready to actually date again, prior to our dates I made it clear I was looking for something more serious and no hookups. He agreed. 

We went on a date earlier this month, hooked up, had another a week and a half later, then a few days later, I get that message. In our last text exchange, he swore the sex didn’t change anything and make him think less of me when I called him out about feeling a little used. He said that wasn’t the case and it wasn’t about sex.

What gives?

Some possibly important details: I’m friends with his sister (I was in her wedding a few years back) and he recently came out as pansexual earlier this year.

I replied to his rejection, we talked it out, we haven’t talked since. But, I’m baffled because I felt like he was trying pretty hard and liked me a lot leading up to our dates. Perhaps he built me up so much in his head, I was a disappointment? But, why tell me how great of a time you have with me and how attractive I am, etc. it seemed like an odd rejection.

He honestly broke my heart so badly, I was so lonely in the relationship, that I have no choice but to move on that quickly, even though I know that's not healthy. It's like I don't want to, but I have to, to be able to move on with my life.

Now I know if I have to ask reddit for dating advice it's usually a bad idea, but please bear with me. (Also note that I am quarantining covid so meeting with these men isn't a possibility rn to gauge in person)

Guy #1: initially commented seeking out movie buddies in my city that he recently moved to, I reached out to him asking if he's still looking for that and we exchanged numbers. He seems nice enough but sort of like he's trying to come off as a nice guy pretending he's someone he's not. The reason why I say this is because he commented one or two sexual comments/posts, also involving using drugs, that he deleted once I messaged him. Nothing too bad, just a bit...casual and out there for me. I'm not one for casual sex or (party) drug use at all, but it seems he's pursued it before. However, he also seems relatively stable from his post history and from our text exchange. Especially compared to my mess of an ex, who's emotional instability and insecurity ruined our relationship and my life. 

Guy #2: I do not know much about him, we have not yet exchanged numbers but chatted in comments agreeing to meet up for coffee once we are both done quarantining. Seems nice and stable from his comment history, no sexual stuff which is nice to me since I'm more conservative about that sort of thing. However, he lives in a part of town that's becoming notorious for crime and I fully admit that I am paranoid/wary of going there, so it makes me wonder about the logistics of that in future moving forward.

So, what do you all good people of reddit think? I know this is probably a bad idea, but I also don't do/like dating apps since I don't like putting my photo online. I know some men personally that are friends that I could date irl, but I'm too close to them so wouldn't want to break their heart. So these are 2 possible dating choices I have available to me now.

Here are my posts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rquaac/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_bumble_dating/

So after hearing what all of these guys said, should I really try out Bumble or not?
Based on some other things that I have heard, it seems like Bumble and dating apps/sites in general are very luck based.
If you put a lot of lazy work into your bio and pics, you will have way less chances, but if you are good looking in your pics and have an interesting bio then you will get more chances.
But here’s the thing though, something that I’ve definitely heard a lot is that a lot of girls simply go on dating apps just to get a guy's attention, and I may be able to sense those girls just by looking at their lazy profile.
So I think what I’ll probably do is create a very entertaining and interesting profile.
And then X all of the girls with a lazy profile.
And then check mark the girls who actually put in the same amount of work as I did into their profile who also share the same interests as I do.
BOOM INFINITE IQ😈.
The reason why a lot of these guys probably don’t have the best luck is because they probably just don’t understand how algorithms work and they check mark all of the lazy princesses who put zero effort into their bio, take hot pictures of themselves(well, using Instagram filters probably), and then just post those pics.
Also something else too is that all of the lazy attention princesses have probably taken over most dating apps and bots have probably done the same too and so I feel like there may not really be alot of REAL girls on there actually looking for a relationship, and so that’s probably something that I should think about more.
But yeah what do you guys say, SHOULD I TAKE THE CHALLENGE???😈.
Heck, I honestly see this as a possible very entertaining online dating game instead of just apps and websites and I would honestly record myself doing this stuff on my computer and then post it on my YouTube gaming channel and title it “Bumble Dating App Matching Speedrun Part 1” lol🤣😂🤣😂.
But anyway back to the question though, and I’m going to ask it like a normal person this time haha.
But yeah should I take what I call, well, the online dating algorithm breaking challenge?

He checked all of my boxes when we first started going out, really polite, kind and intelligent.  We have a few common interests and it was easy to have a conversation together.  It's been a couple months though and I feel like the more I get to know him, the more doomed I think this relationship is and the less I like him.  

We talked about what we'd like in the future and I told him light heartedly, a house where I can raise chickens, have a bee hive, garden and just chill with my dog would be nice.  He shot it down pretty fast and said that's not what he'd like.  This entire time I've known him, he's been talking about how he wants to switch jobs and find a new apartment.  It's been five months and he's now saying he'd rather stay at his current job for a few more years and he's not sure when he's going to move to a new place.  Ok, people are allowed to change their minds, but I honestly get really irritated when he mentions how he plans to move every time we meet up but never does anything.  To compound it, he's been at his current place for years and has no furniture, his excuse being that he's planning to move soon.  For christmas, I tried to be considerate and get him things based on his likes and hobbies.  He got me a box of chocolates after I spent the week prior baking a requested recipe upon his request, not taking any of it back with me and telling him it was because I didn't like super sweet things...   

I feel like all the things I'm having issues with are so petty and unreasonable and can be excused.  I'm also sure I have just as many traits that are annoying too and he's being too polite to mention it. But I feel like I can't say anything about it, because the response seems mean and uncaring e.g. I don't want to hear about your apartment hunting because it's been months and you haven't made any decision yet or I don't appreciate you shooting down my ideas even if you think that's what you'd like.

It’s gotten better since starting college but I still can’t mentally handle talking to a guy. It might be my severe anxiety and self-esteem issues.

I have a date in a few days (my 2nd date ever lmfao 😭) and I’m going crazy in my room. I’ve been friends with the guy on social media for over a year now, but we didn’t start having consistent conversation up until a few days ago. He seems nice, a bit of a party boy. We’ve mostly been asking each other basic questions about majors, pets, etc. He hasn’t asked any creepy questions asking for pics or suggesting hooking up (ex: wanna come over?) so that’s a relief. 

But the thing is I don’t know if I don’t find him attractive at all. I wouldn’t say he’s ugly (he lifts weights so he’s fit) but he’s not really my usual type. So should I even be going on this date, with the intention of possibly starting a relationship, if I don’t feel any attraction to him? Or am I judging too soon? Did I say yes because I just liked the fact that someone found me attractive enough to ask out? Or did I say yes because I like him? I have no idea.

I’m also very sensitive when it comes to physical intimacy, mostly because of my past trauma of sexual assault. Last time I went on a date to the movies with a guy, he kept trying to hold my hand the entire time and I was having a silent breakdown. What if that happens again? I’m also not really comfortable with PDA for the same reason, so I have no idea what I should do if he tries to hold my hand, etc without upsetting him.

I have been single for 18 years, I haven't even touched a member of the opposite sex in a non platonic way in all of that time. And even when I was seeing someone it ended because I was incapable of initiating any sort of intimate activity/behaviour, verbal or physical. I was too nervous then and it is so much worse now, now I just feel overwhelming terror.

My biggest issue is that I just have no idea what to say to people that I haven't already previously spoken to. Even then it can take me months of being around someone to be comfortable enough to engage them in conversation. On top of this I have really poor social and communication skills in general. 

I really just don't understand how to approach people and what to say or do in that situation.

 I think meeting someone in person(in a bar for example) is beyond me so I have been trying dating apps. I get plenty of matches but I am basically encountering the same issue, I just have no idea what to say. I have no idea what to say in an opening message and  no idea what to say in any further messages. I have tried but I either just get one word responses and no reply at all.

Do I just say hi and ask someone out?

Do I spam people with questions about themselves?

Other than saying hi and asking people how they are I really don't know what to say.

What did I do wrong?

This is the first time anything like this has happened to me :,) not trying to sound conceited, but up until this one girl, I’ve always been the one who’s less interested and even then, I’ve never distanced myself away from someone after a date. I still love to keep some of my dates as friends as long as they’re willing to be platonic so I really struggle to wrap my head around what went wrong this time as nothing like this has ever happened to me. 

I (21F) met this girl (23F) on Instagram in my city and our conversations were great. She and I were keeping the conversation alive, it flowed, we joked a lot, flirted quite a bit and she, just as much me, was interested in sustaining the conversation. 

After a couple of days of talking with pretty fast replies, on my birthday, my plans with my family had to be postponed. She found out when she was with her friends and all of them were insistent we spend my birthday together. I didn’t want to bother and it made me nervous meeting 5 new people at one go so I told her I’d meet her after if she was still down. I celebrated with my friends for hours and she was still very keen in me coming over at midnight to hang with her and her one other friend even though I kept telling her it’s ok if it’s late and she wants to rest instead. 

We talked a lot that night and eventually her friend left and we were in bed together, just chatting. I didn’t want to pull any moves too soon but she kept touching my hand and even held my hand multiple times which was rly nice. 

Then fast forward, it’s been a week since, and the conversation has died out. She took hours to reply and she hasn’t opened my message for 3 days now (we were talking about my vacation). I’m so confused.

I just got out of a long relationship with someone who was my best friend for years before we dated.

When we started becoming *really* close as friends but still not romantically in any way, we were very different.

She had no friends. She mentally was unwell. She has no confidence, she didn’t love herself one bit. If there was something that could be wrong, it was. A lot of past trauma plaguing her.

I was on top of the world. Physically, mentally, and emotionally never better. Beacon of energy and love and stability. Never been happier or stronger.

She really clung to me (and in hindsight guilted me incredibly hard if I didn’t give her enough attention even though we were just friends). Eventually we got together and fell in love. Some of the highest of highs I’ve ever felt in my life.

I stuck with her through some of her horrible lows. Like LOWS. She (unintentionally?) hurt me so many times through faults of her own. She slowly dismantled and controlled small parts of me.

A year and a half later, she leaves me. Handles it horribly, hurts me deeper and more damaging than ever necessary. Strings me along with mixed signals for a month. We weren’t even fading the weeks leading up, but she was caving from external factors.

Now it’s like she transferred all of her negative energy into me and she’s just whole. She didn’t seem to try to fix anything at all, there was not one bit of “commitment” through the entire process.

I’m hurt, given up on, as unstable as I’ve ever been in my entire life. It’s fucked up. I’ve had to get into therapy which is something that has never even crossed my mind. I took care of her and built her up and gave her everything and now I’m the one left in the dust. She somehow took a “rock” of a person and sent me into the depths. It was cruel and has really shown me that no matter what you mean to someone or what you’ve given them, they may not bother trying whenever things get rough.
