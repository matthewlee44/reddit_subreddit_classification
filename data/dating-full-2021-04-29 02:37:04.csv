I texted her that night and created a classic prom poster to give her on Monday, which she thought was funny. I bought tickets and the males in the group we created decided the activities that we would do this Saturday, which is when the dance is. Tonight I was looking at my date's instagram and BOOM! A post with her and a guy she's kissing. I thought it was no big deal since it was posted last year, but then I look up and she has a story highlights of the guy that was updated just 3 weeks ago. I texted her asking if that was her current boyfriend and she said yes. She asked why I asked and I said ""nothing"". In truth, this actually really really bothers me. Is it normal for people to just go to dances with people other than their boyfriend/girlfriend?

I matched with a beautiful girl on Hinge on Monday, we talked for a day and she was clearly very interested and sending me long messages. She even greeted me the following morning to continue the conversation. I bit the bullet and asked her out Tuesday evening last minute, somehow she agreed and I met her that night.

Overall I initially thought it went well but I've been stressing over it ever since. I hadn't been on a date in a long time and I guess I missed a lot of her signals, I didn't really try and flirt with her or show any romantic intent. Although we talked for 3 hours, at the end of the date we split the bill and I just unceremoniously dropped her off at her house.

But she did give me her number. So I tried to talk to her on Wednesday after the date and while she's not ghosting me, she doesn't seem super interested any longer. The messages are short and to the point and she takes ages to reply. I feel like crap, I can't sleep, my appetite is gone. It feels so pathetic to feel like this over one below-average date, but I can't help it.

I've thought about asking her to go for a walk in the park across from her house, and either have an open and honest conversation about the date the other night, or perhaps just hang out and give it another shot. In my opinion I've already fumbled most of my chances, so it's worth a shot just to see if she goes for it. It's a long shot to think there's anything to salvage there, but at least I'd have some sort of closure if she would just admit to me that she's not interested instead of stringing me along.

Should I try and see her again or am I just punishing myself? Should I just cut my losses and move on? I fucking hate feeling this way.

I love how on this sub, when a guy complains about being ghosted, just like clockwork, there will be a reply that jumps to the conclusion that he might be *creepy* and that he should have a think about his behaviour and see if he needs to make any changes. If any of you have been ghosted, you'll know that he's already feeling shit and he's come here to vent. Instead of being compassionate, a lot of people will tell him things like:

*Maybe you're creepy and she feared for her safety so she ghosted you
*No one owes you anything including a reply or their time
*Everyone gets ghosted, it's not that bad. Man up and get over it
*Seek therapy

I often see people complaining that with OLD, people have the attitude that others are disposable and that there are no manners or respect. So it's ironic to see the people on this sub treat others in the very same manner that they're complaining about. It seems as though many forget that the person they're replying to or giving ""advice"" to is a real human with real feelings rather than just some username on a screen.

Also when ghosting comes up, which it does often in this sub, again, just like clockwork, a woman will give the old chestnut:

&gt;Women ghost because some men can't take rejection and will send mean messages / lash out / act violent etc. *I might get murdered!*

This seems to absolve women from being shitty human beings in the minds of those that agree with that sentiment. Why not send a simple I'm not feeling it text or I felt no connection text. If the guy lashes out *then ghost*. It seems many women use this excuse so they can be cowards and avoid any discomfort. Men ghost as well, but they don't hide behind this shitty excuse, they admit they're being assholes or shitty people. Women act shitty when they ghost, but blame men for their shitty behaviour. They let the actions of a few men dictate their actions towards an entire gender, then blame that same gender as being at fault.

Imagine if someone said something like this:

&gt;I've noticed that black males have a propensity towards violent crime, so when I see black guys on the street, I avoid them. I cross the road or try to keep my distance

Think of the backlash that comment would get. 

Why would you kick a guy when he's down? What if when a girl complains about ghosting, the replies are:

*I'm a guy and when I ghost a girl, it's usually because she't not pretty enough for me. Perhaps it might be a good idea to look in the mirror and see if you're not attractive and think about ways that you can improve your appearance
*Guys are shit but they ghost all the time, it's part of dating
*Maybe you're just ugly. Try not to be ugly when you go on dates and put more effort into your appearance

I'm not saying it's only women that are guilty of this because many comments against ghosting on this sub have been by women, it makes me realise a lot of women do understand that ghosting is shitty and they aren't going to defend that shitty behaviour whether it's done by a guy or a girl. In my book, you girls are the real MVP. If you've dated in any capacity and you've never been ghosted then you've been quite lucky. If you've been ghosted and have been hurt but ghost yourself or defend ghosting, then you're a shitty person. This of course excludes those instances where they guy/girl actually showed some red flags on the date. However, I think this is so rare but people seem to say this is the norm rather than the exception. 

People have feelings and words can hurt people. WTF does ""creepy"" even mean? In these subs it seems to be a catch all term for anyone a person doesn't like. In my job I interact with literally thousands of people per year. I can't even remember the last time I met someone I could say was creepy. I've met plenty of people I would say are weird, and plenty of assholes, but none I can think of that have been creepy. So where are all of you meeting these creepy people? Perhaps you should look at how you filter your prospective dates. See what I did there?

Another thing, and this goes for both guys and girls, is remember that you actually don't know who the people that reply on these subs are. They could be pieces of shit irl, deadbeats, or people who are entirely not qualified to give any advice on dating whatsoever. I was looking at a thread the other day and it was titled something like ""How to get a gf"". It had over 20k upvotes and a bunch of awards. Turns out the OP of that thread was 14 years old. Now imagine if a 14 year old kid came up to you irl and gave you romantic advice, what would you think? You'd most likely disregard that person because what possible life experience could that person have in order to give you meaningful romantic advice? Yet on the internet, many people speak with authority like they know what the fuck they're talking about, so take it with a grain of salt. In saying that, there has been a bunch of great comments and advice on this sub, but generally it seems as though the sub is just a bunch of people who have been hurt trying to hurt others. Or shitty people justifying their shitty behaviour as if it's normal. It's like being gaslit by fuckwits online.

This sub mostly consists of people that are having a hard time dating. It's only natural because dating isn't easy most of the time. These people are often frustrated, in a state of low self esteem and feeling insecure after rejection. However, instead of showing some compassion for a fellow human who might be struggling in trying to find love, it seems to be subtle insults and the same rehashed shitty ""advice"" over and over again:

*Shower and brush your teeth
*Learn to love yourself before you can date
*Get hobbies
*Be happy being alone

Almost very patronising ""advice"". Do you think so lowly of your fellow sub members that somehow reminding them to shower and brush their teeth counts as advice? One would argue if they don't know that they should be showering or brushing their teeth that they shouldn't even be dating. These are low key insults disguised as helpful advice.

inb4 complaints and insults. To those of you, I will preempt this by saying go fuck yourselves and I feel sorry for the poor fucks that do end up with you lot. To everyone else, I know it's hard but try not to give up on finding love if that's what your hearts truly desire.

We're trying to stay friends, but it's humiliating as fuck to have to be the third wheel. With one notable exception that I'll get into in a moment, every time I schedule a first date with someone new, they cancel and ghost. I even got told by someone that I should give up on dating altogether and try to be friends first. Like hell that's going to work for me.

I've had two dates with a really sweet guy, which says a lot since I'm mostly into women. But when we went back to his apartment, all he wanted to do was cuddle (and make out a little). I left feeling disappointed, especially since I know he has another partner already. I want to take things to the next level, but I'm afraid that he'll get weirded out and cut off all contact with me if he doesn't want the same thing. So now it's like I'm stuck in limbo.

Anyways he replied in a long text saying 

‘Okay I understand, I was messaging because I missed you but I get that would make you unhappy. I want you to be happy and healthy! Go date some nice boys or girls that are not old aged and then whenever you think we could wander into each other again send me a message okay. I have grown to care about you and would like to know how you're doing from time to time, but I'll stop messaging you. Take care ❤️’

But I was confused by the ‘I have grown to care about you’ part. is that common to say something like that to a girl who he has been dating? cus I thought his feeling was deeper than just ‘have grown care’.
Now I feel like a total dumb who has assumed this as a deeper thing for a long time by myself.

I’ve been stood up, ghosted, whatever as well. My self-esteem has taken plenty of blows. 

I’ve found that anyone I’m actually interested in does not end up developing feelings—they tell me “you’re a fantastic guy but...”—whereas many of the people I don’t want much to do with end up falling for me.

Some backstory:

My ex and I grew up in the same neighborhood and she was super good friends with my family. I could tell she started to like me around my junior year, but I wasn't super interested in dating because I was going through a lot at the time. Eventually I started to catch feelings for her, we became best friends, and then we dated for about 2-2.5 years in highschool and a little bit when I went to college. 

She broke up with me after my first semester in college because she felt like she would miss out on a lot when she went to college if she was still dating me. I wanted to marry her, so it took me by surprise. It took me a long time to get over it, but I eventually did and lived my own college life too. Looking back on it now, it would've been a shitty marriage if we had gone through with it that young. I understand that now, but it was tough at the time!

I've stayed single since then because I just haven't found someone that compliments my life, and that's okay too. Being single has been a blast, but I definitely want to find someone one day. My ex asked if we could meet up about a year and half after the breakup so she could return the ring I gave her and some other stuff that she felt she couldn't hold onto anymore, and I felt like we left everything on good terms. 

My ex ended up marrying someone soon after and we never really spoke again for obvious reasons. She stayed really good friends with my brother and his wife so I heard about pretty much anything major that happened with her. 

About 3.5 weeks ago, I get a call from her. We joked around for a while and it was like nothing had changed. She told me she had divorced about a year ago. She told me that she's in town and asked if I would meet her to go on a walk and talk. We did that night, she apologized for the way she treated me, I got a bunch of stuff off of my chest too, we talked about what was going on in each other's lives, and I had a lot of fun with her. 

At the end of the night, she tells me that she still thinks that we are soulmates, or meant to be together. She tells me that she may still have a little crush on me, but that it's harmless because we don't know each other anymore. We have both changed a lot and it wouldn't be smart to just jump back into something like that, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited when she told me.

Anyways, we've been talking since then. We've both been a little flirty with each other. I got some hope of a possible future relationship when she told me that she doesn't want to get in a relationship with anyone until a year after her divorce for her own healing purposes. I think that's good for her! But I was honest with her and told her I'd be interested in seeing what could happen in the future. 

She knows I'm interested. So what does she do?

She brings up dates she goes on with other guys when she knows that I'd love to take her out, she sends me cute selfies because she knows it'll keep me coming back, and she has been judgemental of where I'm at in my life right now. I'm living at home, working a part time job, and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I stopped college after my associates because I didn't know what I wanted to do beyond that and wasn't willing to go into debt. She says that my mom has me by the balls if I'm living at home, and I could be doing a lot more than just a part time job, and BLAH BLAH. I'm sure I could be doing more, but we are all in different stages of our life and I don't give af where she's at in her's. This stuff really bothers me, but then she says something that gives me hope again, and it's been like that ever since we started talking again.

I guess that I am not really sure what she wants, but it feels like she's just keeping me open as an option. I wouldn't be hurt if nothing happened between us in the future. Maybe it shouldn't at all. I don't mind being a good friend to her and being there if she needs. I think she is pretty fresh off of her divorce and wants to date around and have fun. I get it, but I don't like games or whatever tf this is. 

I have a soft spot for her because of our history. I was on a high when she spoke to me for the first time after 4 years, but I'm starting to come down from things and see a little more clearly.

So...

I’m a male, from Argentina. I’ve been to the states before and so to many other countries. I have my LDR who lives in America. For reasons that have to do with college and covid, I decided to plan on going to America in July. 
You see, July is summer there and schools / colleges are for the most part closed, this applies to her. However, she is studying to become an actor and signed up for a production in July this year. I admit I told her my plans too late for that, but it was as soon as I could. 

The problem with this is that she says she “can’t” come with me and join me in the trip because of her “obligation” to the production she signed in. 

For a point of view, I understand it’s an obligation. But from another point of view, I see this as a backstabbing. I try on going to her country and inviting her to know it together (she would have to pay $0), I feel she could perfectly call her productor and tell her she just can’t go because of the extraordinary reasons. Nonetheless, she doesn’t agree with me, she keeps insisting that she can’t because it’s her “obligation”.

I think she would have a thousand productions in her lifetime yet she has this one unique chance that probably would never come again in this shape and she declines it. I honestly feel like a fool. I am trying to do everything to get there, from the difficulties of traveling because of the pandemic to the money to pay for it while she just declines it. 

I feel like this is a GIANT redflag.

I've been quietly struggling to find something to gift him, I think this would be good. I suspect he was dropping this intentionally as a hint for gifting but his birthday is over a month away and I hope he forgets he mentioned it. 
I am thinking of taking it a small step further and getting a nicer wallet personalized with his initials and taking some, possibly risque, pictures of myself and putting them in the insert. 
We've seeing each other for almost 3 months and known each other for more than 2 years, if it makes a difference.

Is this a good idea? Any suggestions would be appreciated.

So to kinda give context here, I’m a 19 year old male, who had been living in dorms alone for 2 semesters (8 months), working hard to get into mechanical engineering 2nd year. Around the beginning of the second semester, I felt secure enough in my own skin and personal health that I felt that it would be good to get into dating. I met a few women in real life and dating apps who showed interest in me. So for about a month of the second semester I spent dating and talking to these girls on FaceTime and casual walks on the local beach, most went well, but not many would progress past the first 2 dates. Since most of them either felt like duds or just left me on read after 2 weeks, i turnt to the final girl (yes I had a list or hierarchy but it was unintentional). I had only been talking to her about sci-fi and various topics regarding our heritage over time, conversations over text never felt dry, but they weren’t too frequent. 
One day I said “fuck it, FaceTime her”. so I asked, and I received, we ended up calling from 6 pm to 10 am. It was an immediate spark. Went from blade runner to “the great filter” theory, to Spanish loyalty. I took a test right after, sleep deprived and continued my day. This established a pattern of calls and frequent texts back and forth for the next week, though calls were much shorter, the feeling was the same. Nearing the end of the week she asked me on a date. I promptly said “yeah sure I’ll look at my schedule maybe I’ll be free”. Trying to be a “cool stud” with this beautiful lady. Yeah I had nothing planned for the next 2 weeks. We met at a pizza place, we ate and constantly talked from 5pm to closing time, we teased, laughed stared. Blah blah. After getting kicked out we walked the neighborhood, we had our first few kisses on a thin freshly snowed road. It was mutually agreed that we head to my place. We go there, do some stuff, she asks about my relationships, what I want in a relationship, and what would my future hold, basically everything implying that she wanted to have a future with me. 
I knew she got out of a breakup before this, but I didn’t know how soon and how long they were together.(I assumed it was a 4 month fling with 2 month separation between me and him). As she left I felt something was wrong, yeah sure a real caring human who I’ve been ~kinda talking to for 1 month and really talking to for a week and a half, just left. Of course it’s some feelings of me missing her, but the days followed after that she ghosted me or she would get short with me or just be slower to start talking to me. Like okay yeah I can get clingy and I probably did get quite attached after that night, it would be hard not to. 
It was later revealed that she “just got out of the breakup” and “felt shitty because, he was the first person she ever truely loved”. “Oh fuck yeah” I thought, “a classic for the ages, time to cry in the shower for 30 minutes and walk it off”. But as time ensued I wasn’t able to let it go, I slowly started to distance myself from my friends and clinging onto my cousin and my sister for consolation and needing explanations of the whole thing. I started spiraling. (I started spiraling badly after she started leaving me on read but this was a real nail in the coffin). I could tell my family members were getting annoyed by me, not knowing red flags and how to control my depression. I knew she was just a fish in the sea, but as a guy devoid of any relationships that showed affection, this really got me going. 
I did the wrong thing and tried restarting it with the girl, it seemed to be going well but it she would not want to call or do anything more than casual texting. I know looking back at this that I was dumb as fuck for doing such a thing, I don’t need more criticism now. 
So I went into another spiral. Around this time I felt I had chlamydia from her so I started to make lies in my head about her to make myself feel better about being rejected. I got tested, all negatives. Again I was an asshole. More of these antics ensued until I just kind of gave up. 
I just started thinking, if I was someone dating a guy, and his reaction to this is this whole essay, then he’s one huge red flag. Too emotionally dependent, too clingy and makes up lies to make himself feel better about anything surrounding you. 
I was just awestruck at my shitty brain habits . So I went out with some more women to fill the hole she left, all seemed like god’s sign of “dude I lead these women here to show you that you have value outside of a random girl on tinder”
I just didn’t have it. So I moved back home with my family after being so depressed that I gained a solid 25 pounds in a few weeks and never had left my dorm ever. But yeah here I am now wondering if I should’ve sought therapy back then, or if I even should now. I still feel as if she was just a lucky coin flip. I went  on tinder and restart the process, I only got 2 likes and 4 matches in a week, and all of them left me on read. So I don’t know what happened. Sure different universities, different countries, different cultures, but my speech couldn’t have changed that much. 
So yeah I guess that’s where I am now. Trying to build myself into a physically and mentally chiseled work of art, but seemingly teetering on the edge of falling onto a depressive void. 

What should I do? seek therapy, get antidepressants, work on attachment, or even, what are are some tricks you learned in past Relationships that could help me to be less of a shipwreck in my future endeavors?

Thank you for reading by the way. If you got this far I truly appreciate you caring for me in this awful time of dating.

She says yes but I cancel on her and say I had covid bc I was seeing this other girl at the time that I really liked. Cut to a month later I hit her up and ask her out randomly and she surprisingly still says yes.

We meet up, she’s sort of odd and weird, not I’m a good way but she was telling me how she doesn’t like all these people, all she does is work and school, and doesn’t have any hobbies, snd she seemed a tad self centered. It’s a first date so I’m not expecting anything but I like talking to people so we talked about her mom having cancer, feeling lonely, our futures, etc but we also joked around stuff snd drank wine by the beach. 

The date lasted like 4-5 hours and when I was dropping her off she was like “oh you’re not going to come in,” so I was like why not and we went into her apartment. She wants to do shots, we watch a movie, and next thing you know we’re making out and fucking. Also, it might be worth mentioning that I had like half a bottle of wine, 3 shots of vodka, and a white claw (all on an empty stomach) so I was drunk and maybe that affected my dick too. 

The sex was meh snd my dick kept going soft with a condom snd she clawed my dick with her acrylic nails a couple times while trying to jack me off (which really hurt) and I asked her to suck my dick and she didn’t know what she was doing. 

There were some good moments, looking back it was pretty hot, we were laying side by side making out, while I was fingering her wnd she was getting me off. I ate her out (it was my first time eating a girl out and second time having sex) and she moaned out a couple times when I found this triangle like thing lol, maybe it was her clit but idk.

Anyways, instinctually I’m a biter and I usually check in with the girl to make sure it’s. It too hard but I was drunk and got a little carried away snd sort of drew a cut on her boob. She was annoyed with that and idk it felt weird after and i offered to finish the movie after but she said that she needed to go to work tomorrow and so I just left and kissed her goodbye.

Honestly I felt empty for a little bit but I liked the validation, I just think I didn’t like her that much (even though she’s pretty cute) and it was the first date and it was the first time meeting this girl so I was just mentally unprepared to have sex. 

I message her after asking to hangout again just for shits and giggles, and she said that she would let me know in two weeks bc she’s going out of town (which she had told me about before). I don’t really care about her liking me but I’m just wondering if she didn’t enjoy the sex, even though I feel like I was more attentive to her than she was to me.

I met this guy on a dating app in early March. I've been hurt enough times in relationships that I try to keep my emotions pretty steady and don't let myself get too excited about anyone. But this guy slipped through the cracks, lol. We just clicked really well right off the bat.

We had one video date (March) and one real date (April). He made it clear that he wanted to see me again in April, but I had exams so I had to wait. This put some pressure on us to keep up the texting until then (and we all know how much that can suck). I think it meant the fire/bullshit ""excitement"" phase unfortunately started to wane. 

We were supposed to see each other this weekend. We agreed on that like a week ago. I was (too) excited - this was the first time I'd be seeing anyone in a while, I'm done with school, and it's with this guy I thought was really great! I had a dress picked out and everything.

Anyways, he texts me yesterday and says this weekend will be tough because some of his friends are graduating/ moving away and they're having parties he wants to go to. In the moment, I got pissed. I ignored his other unrelated texts and said ""Seriously??"" and then said ""It's totally fine I get it let me know when you're free"". He sent another text explaining/apologizing and I basically repeated my message. 

My friends all say I didn't overreact... it's important to me that my time is respected and that I'm not walked all over... but idk. That phrase from the internet, ""if he wanted to he would"", is in my head. If he wanted to see me, he would. He didn't even suggest rescheduling.

So two questions I guess: 
Did I overreact? And is this thing with him over?

I grew up bullied a lot, my dad abused me too, drinking a lot, and the worst part is, at 25, I’m still affected by these things to the point I have not moved on and still live in the past everyday. 

I’ve had so many girls back in school, and even more recently online when asking for rates on my pic, tell me “HOW UGLY I AM” (less vulgar way of saying it).

But, at 18, I had a female friend (we were both 18) who wanted to have sex with me, I chickened out.

I met some women online over the years, strictly long-distance. Just how it turned out. But the fact that even just a few have found me attractive, leads me to believe that I could attract more women, romantically and sexually, IN REAL LIFE, if I just improved myself and my life. MUCH easier said than done, of course.

For complicated reasons, not necessarily by choice, I’ve been mostly a shut-in since high school, and was never very much socially successful then. 

So I just took all of those negative judgements from all those women, from school, and strangers online, and assumed/concluded I was simply unattractive to the opposite sex. I’ve been hit on by guys, but then again, men still tend to be aggressors and women still tend to expect men to initiate.

It pains me that I haven’t figured my own shit out enough to the point I can move out and support myself at 25, having some decent job that isn’t for high school kids and contributes to advancing society. At the very least, is just work I can be competent enough in and pays well, then I could at least pursue my own things while being confident and secure that I can pay rent and bills, keep myself afloat. And keep having health insurance, since that is VERY expensive and NOT a legal human right in the US).

I don’t want to end up a 30 or 40 year old virgin who’s still never had a girlfriend. But at 25, I haven’t even progressed enough to take care of myself, so I’m not feeling the most optimistic, especially because I still feel so directionless.

I don’t know exactly why I’m in this position still, if I have some kind of disorder/disability not even diagnosed (it’s clear that even if I become more functional, I’m pretty sure I will continue to think differently than most people seem to) and/or fears/traumas just leading to making excuses without even realizing it?

The worst part of being a legitimate victim, is it leading to you victimizing yourself. Not just always feeling like the world is out to get you, but actually abusing yourself, treating yourself worse than anyone ever has.

And in combination of lacking a real life, I’ve absorbed too much information online. I do not think that a lot of the views represented online actually represent real life. Most people do not think “I’ll just completely focus on a career and choose celibacy and single until I become financially successful”.

No, the vast majority of people start dating, having relationships and having sex before they’re even old enough to get into a real career.

My problem is with falling so far behind, everything is now out of balance. The natural (or manmade?) order of things is, go to school for 4+ years, or even excluding that, work in a field for multiple years before making decent money. 

The older you start, the even older you’ll be to reap rewards. It’s not as if minimum wage is enough to live even a basic lifestyle.

I go on a lot of dates with women who are interested to hear about my hobbies. But I'm quite a modest person and I always downplay it. I only answer their question at face value and leave it at that. 

But i worry that it makes it sound like I'm a bit incompetent, and if i'm committing a lot of time to pursuing a hobby (which I am) it isn't attractive if they assume you're not very good.

For example, i don't mention that i got past grade 8 guitar and am now learning to play virtuoso stuff. 

That's because i see this as being unsolicited arrogance and that's not attractive at all! So I ALWAYS downplay my achievements (e.g. ""well I've practiced a lot so i'm better than I used to be"") and i don't tell them more than they ask.

But on the other hand I worry if I don't tell them my credentials upfront, they may just assume I'm a bit useless. And women don't like that.

Anyway, let's go to the post.

I'm dating a friend of mine, and have been since December. On and off, maybe every two weeks. She's at the point what I feel most women find so important, where she likes to define the relationship. Houston, we've got a problem.

Problem is: I like spending time with her, I like talking to her and sharing stories and I care about her for sure, but... I am not in love. I'm also not seeing her solely for the intercourse. The sex is just a nice (and usually guaranteed) sidedish.

Now, I'm not so sure where I stand. I don't get in love easily, appearantly (as it has happened before), and I feel that's a requirement when settling for a long-term serious commitment. These ""give me your forever dedicated love right now"" - deadlines make me uncomfortable and really turn me off even further.

I'd rather go on as we do, as we have it good right now, enjoy the present and see where it will go while living our own (and very busy) lives aswell.

The children are 26, 16, and 7.

I asked when she was going back to work adding that if she was unwell she shouldn’t, knowing that anyhow I could take care of most of her bills as I’ve done already plenty of time; also she still gets full pay while in sick leave, so she wouldn’t lose that much. 

She answered that she needs to go back to work to pay her bills, and that when her son started working she would stop -referring to the middle son that was listening the conversation. I asked her to clarify because I hoped I understood incorrectly, but she said that the son promised her that when he started earning money he would take care of her and the little one, and she would just relax. 

She was serious, and when I asked why would he do that instead of being free to have his own life and build his future; but most importantly why would she encourage it, she answered because he promised and then asked me if I was implying that she didn’t have a life? -not sure about the meaning of the last bit, but at that point I didn’t want to hear no more.

I was a little bit disturbed by the conversation and decided to leave. I’m not sure why would she say something like that, and why would she plan to have her son provide for her.

How can I keep this alive, or better yet, how can I keep it alive and relatively sexual to not fall into an overly ""bland"" pattern? Sex has always been on point, I've been pretty dominant and she's enjoyed the rides. It's been very unpredictable and pretty hot, lot's of choking, hair pulling, slapping, outdoors, on a rock, bent over a pile of logs, etc.  


So the time we've had together has been absolutely grand, but there is a lot of time not together, and there will be more. I'm very into her and want to explore the LTR potential. It may require some ""long distance"" time, but if I am to make that suggestion to her it would be non-committed, to keep doing what we're doing of coming to see each other once/twice per month, an if we're still enjoying it in 6 months to a year to talk about her moving in, having a longer trial period or something.

She has called me a couple of times but I have never called her. Is this something I should consider? I can be a bit of a dead fish emotionally.  


I told her I'll be in her town on the 7th and asked if she would be free. She said she'd let me know. Should I have instead \*told\* her to be free? She's made time for me before even ignoring important university work by overstaying at my place and even re-buying tickets for a later day. So there's interest. Although I don't want to make her do that again when it gets in the way of important work.

&amp;#x200B;

We've also been in the same room for hours in complete silence whilst she was studying and I was reading. So we can do that too.  


I want to make it clear that I'm very interested without making her feel ""trapped"", and letting her come to me, but letting her know that I really want her to come to me, if she wants. No needy BS.  


We met in a bar over a year ago but she had a bf at the time. She hit me up a few months ago after they broke up, but by then I had moved from that town. Time together is really pleasant. Similar temperaments/interests/etc.

I'm using an alternate account, identify as male/sexually am a male because I kind of don't want anyone to actually know about this, but I have anxiety.  Like, I was diagnosed with it.  Sometimes I have anxiety/panic attacks that make me unable to operate for hours or days.  Yes, anxiety attacks are actually real and not made up.  At least sometimes they are.  My anxiety tends to manifest in becoming worried about people not responding to me for long periods, especially in this era of covid, where previously I mainly interacted with people face-to-face in order to avoid situations like this, I no longer can alleviate my concerns if someone suddenly stops communicating.  This obviously means that ghosting hurts me a lot, especially if I built up a rapport with that person over time.  At it's worst, I shift into what could be described as a ""Romantic Drama SML/Villain"", becoming clingy and desperate, although I have never, ever threatened a person.  Whether or not anyone has interpreted my increasing levels of neediness as threatening, I am not sure and although there have been past events where my anxiety was a significant factor, I have made peace with them.

I recognize that I have this weakness.  I take medication for it everyday.  I actively work to recognize and ""restrain"" it.  I do my best to be patient when communicating, to not be overbearing in conversations, to not worry about where someone is at a given time.  It is natural for me to worry about things, about people, but for the sake of it not being ""normal"", for my wish for a level of stability most people seem to think is unnatural despite it being the only way for me to interact with others in a comfortable manner, I go against my nature, a literal mental illness that although not on the same level as BPD still gives me problems sometimes.  

But I'm a bit frustrated at this point, because if you tell people that this is the way you feel, that this is the way you are, oftentimes they refuse to be accommodating, or they suggest you need therapy (why yes, I do go to therapy, why do you ask asshole?), or they see this as a ""red flag"" or declare it so.  Why does my condition have to be described as a ""red flag"", like this could be easily fixed, that otherwise I'm a broken person who should be avoided?  I have worked hard on myself.  I believe myself to kind-hearted and thoughtful, and have continuously had this belief confirmed by other people.  I am not a monster.  Is there some kind of cabal of people masquerading as having anxiety but actually are stalkers/abusers/etc.?  If someone has even interacted with a person who claimed anxiety either initially or afterwards and then did something heinous, please tell me in the comments.  

I guess what I'm saying is I'm sick of people like me, people who have problems with mental illness but are actively dealing with them, automatically being written off.  Am I somehow impossible to love because of one trait I have that I can't change?  I don't believe that.  I can't believe that.  Inceldom doesn't suit me anymore.  I feel more beautiful every day, both inside and out, but this is the one thing I can't change.

Is there anyone with experience? Do I just ask her what she likes? I am nervous about this, because I don't want to come on too strong but I don't want to be weird either.

So I used to be married to an alcoholic. Naturally, sometimes I get triggered by alcohol related tendencies. I like to drink and have no problem with other people drinking socially. My problem is when I see people behaving in a way my ex used to. 

I've been dating a new guy for a few months now. It's just recently that I've noticed some things...honestly I feel like he was on his best behavior before and just has kinda let his guard down. A few weeks ago he was out with some friends for his birthday. I offered to pick him up, but he said he was fine to drive. Showed up at my house and was clearly very drunk, slurring his words, etc. I let it go. 

We had plans to hang out last night, and I asked if he would pick up something from the store for me on his way home since I was working later than he was. After work he went golfing. Which okay, fine. Except when I got to his house, again he was absolutely hammered. Hadn't gone to the store for me so I couldn't make dinner and when I asked how he got home, he said he drove. Once again, slurring his words and everything. It bothers me for all sorts of reasons. One, because it reminds me of my ex. I don't want to hang out with someone who is drunk while I'm sober. I also don't drink during the week. And it just seemed rude or something, that he knew we were hanging out and had plans but got very drunk anyways. And then there's the fact that he sees no issue driving while drunk. 

He apologized to me this morning a lot, and said he'd make it up to me. 

But to me, this is like a huge sign of immaturity and potential future problems. At 28, I feel like you should know when to stop drinking for the night and be in better control of yourself. 

He texted his apology to me so I haven't answered yet because I'm not sure what I want to say. I don't want to be like ""oh it's okay, don't worry about it""...because I'd be lying. 

I just don't know if what I went through with my alcoholic ex is skewing what's going on here, or if what I'm feeling is valid. 

What can I say to him? I don't know if I want to say 'hey what you did last night reminds me of my ex, and I don't like it'...which is what it is, but I don't want to seem like I'm comparing the two.

shed said videos of her tiktoks, voice notes, in to the early hours of the night, wake up and then I'd see some, warmed my heart.

in work she was very flirty, she'd punch me, brush in to me, I'd catch her looking or she'd catch me and she'd smile,  she'd hold eye contact but not for too long and blush, flip her hair, when we went down for stock refills she'd comment are you following me and laugh, I'd say you'd love that and she'd say stuff like maybe I will.

anyways recently last week we barely messaged, when we do it's slow and less, I brought I up she said ""you know I'm tragic with replying and my phone, I'm more of an in person sort of girl ""(she wasn't st the start?
