1,oqht9k,1627096275,LDR traveling and saying good bye is already stressing me (F20) out and making me feel anxious.,"Okay so I have been in a LDR before and it was for about 2 years and a few months. I just remember saying good bye was so mentally sad as I would have sudden sad outbursts and start crying a few days before leaving because I would feel how sad I was to say good bye, and how much I will miss him. Fast forward, my ex and I broke up.

Now I got into another LDR with this new guy (M20) and I am really starting to fall for him more and more. I do remember thinking that I wouldnt want to do another LDR as it was so tiring and sad with the distance, but then I changed up as I started to fall for this guy more and more. We connect super well and we have been talking every single day ever since we met each other online. So, we were discussing the travel times and all the practicals for when I visit (we live in the same continent, just a few countries apart). And I got a huge sudden wave of sadness as I remember how tiring it was when I had to travel to my ex and the whole part of saying good bye. I explained this to my boyfriend and he said that we can overcome it together and work on it together because as long as 2 people want to work things out, it will always work (which I do agree with). So the problem was that I was getting super worked up over the negatives with saying good bye, and the traveling and the money with that. Saying good bye always feels super sad and shitty (although I do remember at some point with my ex, we sorta got 'used' to it aka not as much crying etc). Bf tells me that he would also travel to me too, and we take turns (it was never like this with my ex and I, as I pretty much always had to travel to him).

Is there any advice with overcoming the negatives and me seeing the positives? I went to sleep sad and anxious and woke up sad and anxious. Just any advice would help. Thank you",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqht9k/ldr_traveling_and_saying_good_bye_is_already/

8,oqin42,1627099596,Do you notice people fixing dating traumas with a new partner?,"Disclaimer: Not shitting on my exes. I share my fair share of blame in my relationships. 

I’ve met my exes over the last 8 years via a combo of meeting irl and online dating. I have noticed my most toxic relationships have been when partners have dated me to work out past traumas. It often leaves me feeling quite sad for us both: a traumatized partner and me, living the shadow of another woman. 

Ex 1: Was cheated on by his fiancé prior to me. Met me and fell in love with me because he could tell I was completely devoted to him and wouldn’t cheat on him. We ended up splitting because I got prettier with age and access to resources and he said he could “no longer trust me”. Found messages from college girls on that app Yik Yak when it was popular flash on his screen notifications. 

Ex 2: Was in a serious long term relationship with his girlfriend but her addiction to drinking and steroids (they are both gym rats) destroyed their relationship. I don’t drink and he loved how stable and even keel I was. Broke up with me after our first fight because I “didn’t fight hard enough” when I mentioned that I was upset with him constantly bringing her up when I was dealing with post partum. He said he could always feel the passion when him and his ex would fight and I lacked it. 

Moral of the story is, don’t use someone new to get over someone in the past. I don’t hold it against them but I don’t date anymore because of it. I’m perfectly happy keeping my baggage between me, my therapist, and my puppy for now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqin42/do_you_notice_people_fixing_dating_traumas_with_a/
9,oqin5v,1627099602,Great start to dating relationship has gone seemingly cold and distant,"
I asked out a long time grocery delivery customer who I’ve admired for several years once I found out she had become separated and at first our interactions were wonderful including all four of our first dates which have lasted 20 hours in total and also many hours on phone calls.
We went on our most recent date this last Sunday and spent all day talking in Birmingham and the train there and back having fun and we both have said how turned on we are etc and seemingly it looked like we would be escalating from being very affectionate to sex probably this coming Monday for our next date.
However she’s a single Mum with two small boys 5 and nearly 3 who has been separated for 2 years and her divorce should be finalised any day now.
For the past 4 or 5 days she’s gone from saying lovely things(her children have been off for summer holidays), reciprocating things I would say like ‘looking forward to seeing you’ or ‘I enjoyed our chat last night’ to completely ignoring those comments and just saying nice things about me having a good day, or her talking about herself or her kids.
Never addresses or refers to her and me.
I did tell her I liked her very much on our most recent date and so far we’ve had great chemistry on the dates and get on like a house on fire so just wondering what do I do prior to our next date if anything at all.
I wish I wasn’t bothered by the texting but she has become almost rude in my opinion and just focuses on other things going on in my life and doesn’t respond to anything about us.

She would then talk about how (L) really loved her and was so obsessed with her that he would our other coworkers how much he liked (S). I told her how it was kind of creepy how (L) was being obsessed with her and she would ask me advice on how to get him to stop liking her.

15,oqje20,1627102713,I think I’ve lost my patience regarding relationships,"I[15M] try to help people as much as I can. In the past this has included suicidal people, people with abusive parents, people experiencing sexual abuse from peers, &amp; people in shitty relationships, why did I do this? Because I believe I’ve had it good coming up and I want everyone else who hasn’t had the same opportunity to be happy to also be happy.

While most of that is being unchanged, one thing is and that’s dealing with other people’s shitty relationships. I met this girl on Omegle not too long ago, she’s my age. I thought she was cute and we have common interests.

She recently got out of this relationship and she’s been talking about how bad this guy was and how he told everyone personal shit about her. Today she said she still has feelings for him and he thinks he’s “changed.” I told her not to feel bad about it, it’s normal but she shouldn’t go in with it, or honestly even talk to him again after what he did. She said she didn’t know if she could cut him off again because “he’s changed.” I told her as a guy who knows other guys, they’ll go back to the same person just because that’s the easy thing to do, especially when they know the other person has feelings. She keeps making excuses for it and it annoyed me to the point I said:

“Okay, this is gonna come off as mean but if you’re gonna take him back do it. Just don’t complain when he does this shit again because I really don’t like telling people the truth when they aren’t going to actually listen to it. But if you’re really gonna take him back after he told people your personal information, even though as a guy I’m telling you guys often go back to people they already dated because that’s the easy way, you do you.” She said “thank you” and I just left her on read.

Was that an asshole thing to say? Maybe, but I’m tired of helping people when they’re putting themselves in a shitty situation and not listening. Especially when I’ve never dated anyone and can’t even see it ever fucking happening. I’m tired of it, I’m tired of being ignored when I’m right here with my support, I’m fucking sick of it.

I’m tired of coming to complain on Reddit. I want this to be my last post about relationships but it’s a new issue I come across ever day and I’m sick of it.

After going out on a few dates with a woman, I usually get the nice break up message.  I didn't do anything wrong per say, but I know a lovely young lady has PLENTY of suitors who she's curious about.  I would be too tbh.

When I go out on dates from Hinge, I feel like any little adversity kicks me to the curve. I took an uber to a coffee date since I was having car problems (blown head gasket). I was met with a stink face when I told her what's up.

I just feel like. I can't really word it. To use an analogy:

I feel like I live in a bad coal mining town in the 1800s that's dirt poor, and I accept being treated badly by my potential employer since I have absolutely no leverage. This same employer has every single man applying for the same job.

**The transaction just feels so skewed for whatever reason made it like this.**

18,oqjxxq,1627105110,I have to vent.,"This girl I have had a major crush on for several months had given me a chance this past June. Despite her 10 month relationship falling apart in early May, she told me she liked me and that i felt the same way. I was ecstatic. After a couple of weeks of just talking on the phone, we started hanging out and it could not have gone any better. This girl was already a really close friend of mine, so we knew each other pretty well and we even had our own inside jokes. It was fun, i enjoyed every second being around her. 

After a couple of weeks, we started laying in bed together, talking about life and what we wanted. We would kiss on some occasions, it truly felt like a relationship was going to come out of this. There was never anything that made me feel we were going to fast.

One day, just before she was supposed to meet me for lunch, her ex boyfriend shows up to her work and he tried bringing her some food. She rejects, and tells him to leave. He does so but leaves a note for her as he leaves. Long story short, the note was him begging for her to give this guy another chance. I personally thought it was funny, she did too. But it took her back, and it made her realize, “oh wait, i dated this guy a couple of months ago. I think it would be best to slow it down and be friends from here on out. I just realized where my head is at. I’m sorry but i am not over him”

Now, this looks like she may run on back to this old boyfriend, but i am so very sure they aren’t seeing each other ever again. I am willing to bet anything on it. 

I give her all the space she has asked for. But now she seems so disinterested with me. Like i gross her out now. But there are times where she seems so into me. It’s the weirdest thing and also the most frustrating thing to be on the receiving end of. Also, what i have noticed is that she never answers my phone calls anymore. Like ever. But she’ll hang out with me and our friends and answer a phone call right away from a guy who she recently met. Makes no sense at all, it puts me in a huge upsetting mood. I feel she’s more interested in this guy now. I seriously don’t know what i did wrong. I feel worthless.

To finish with this, every one of her friends love me. They tell her all the time how it would be perfect if we dated.

Some background- I’m (27f) divorced, no kids. I have been struggling in the dating game for the past 4 years. No good matches, being ghosted, not ready to commit… list goes on. 
I met a guy a year ago, he was great but it seemed like he was going through a bunch of stress with work and home and he wasn’t ready to really dive into anything. We went our separate ways amicably. 
I got a text from him a week ago, asking me out again! Normally I would say no, as it never good to go backwards and very rarely does anything good come from something that didn’t originally work. My gut however- told me to go for it. Why the hell not. He checks all my boxes- good job, home to himself, got a cute dog, good family, no baby mama, etc. 
Tonight we had our date- and Oh. My. God.  It was amazing. We laughed and teased each other the entire time; there was never a lull in conversation. We think very similarly and quietly made fun of the obnoxious table next to us. Like we already had our own inside jokes. He was polite and kind, and HANDSOME. More so than I remember him being a year ago. Maybe it was just the fact he was in a better place now, with less stress and I could really SEE him. 
He kissed me when he walked me to my car- and god what a kiss! Not to be a sap but it was straight out of a movie. Absolute perfection. 
He was a complete gentleman from beginning to end, and even text me goodnight after I got home.
Holy shit. So this is what a great date feels like. 
I’m trying not to get my hopes up- as it’s just the beginning, but I am certainly going to roll in this feeling like a dog rolls in something gross lol Totally reveling in it.

However, one thing remains pretty constant. I seem to only attract women who are a couple years younger than me, around 18-20. For example, on Tinder I will rarely, if ever match with a girl who’s over 20, despite having my age preferences set as 18-24. At parties, the only girls who are interested in me are girls who are a few years younger as well.

If it matters, I do look young. Most people guess that I’m around 18, and I would fall into the category of a “pretty boy” and have a clean shaven face. 

It’s not necessarily that I have a problem dating girls who are a couple years younger, but it would be nice to date women closer to my own age since we have more common ground.

Any advice on how I could make myself appear as a more attractive partner to older women? Please no responses like “grow out your beard.” Ive heard this one countless times and I really dislike the way I look with facial hair.

I just want to make sure that you know that I’ve had a great relationship. 
So I’ve tried the dating sites ,friends trying to meet a single good guy.
With not much luck. I think I had a few misses.
Wrong timing. Should have would have could have . I just gave up.
So I just wanted to stop dating but I would like to have a man in my life.
So I’m from the the old school, but I’m also the type of woman to say what I mean and men what I say.
So with dating sites, Reddit, utube you see everything. And I know I’ve seen and heard about Friends W/Benefits.
Looked it up to see what it meant. 
Two adults having sex with no  commitment what so ever. Live our separate lives. And meet up when we want.
So I thought about it. And decided  I would do it. Men do it why not me.So I thought of who I  would give this  gift too.
Thats what itt is. What  guy wouldn’t want a good looking woman in great shape to call and ask for a FWB relationship.. 
I met him when I started dating he took me out a couple times.  But no romance at all. And I knew he like me and he was really a nice guy just not my guy. And we remained friends.
So I got the courage and asked him
His answer was he’ll ya! When!
And that’s how it began. And we still are seeing each other . 
We have had a few glitches but other than that its been good. 
Except for the last couple times he doesn’t finished. I mentioned it. 
He says age. I say it bothers  me a little. Because I’m not sure what it means. We are not in a relationship but it’ make me question why.
Maybe it shouldn’t matter I should get mine and keep it moving.

I liked him but I wouldn't date a married man. He yet continued to approach me and everytime he would tell me a bullshit story just to have sex with me. He approached me again 2 days ago, said he only wanted to talk and wants to meet in person. I kept refusing but he was forceful and very convincing. He promised he wouldn't pull a move and only wanted to talk. So I agreed. 
The next day he picked me from work and kept driving, i asked where and he said to his friend's house who is out of town. I told him we could talk somewhere else. But he wouldn't budge. He took me to his place and said we were just talking when he began touching me. I resisted. I know I liked him and i like his touch as well but i was in my senses and knew it was wrong so I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. He continued to take off my clothes and forcing himself on me. And I kept telling him to stop. And then I began crying. Finally before he could enter me, he stopped. Then he helped me dress and I just cried a lot. 
I'm confused what was this, I'm not sure if this is what you call rape because he stopped. Why does it feel that I'm at fault. I've been numb since yesterday and cant seem to process what happened. I guess I need a label to help me process what just happened.

Now I can only do this with one or two people which means it's far and few between. 

With the lack of any cohesive circle, and not being active online, it feels like I'm just barred from any dating/sex life. I've got hobbies and interests but I really at least want the opportunity to date. Those hobbies are mostly not social so there's not much there either. 

Going out alone (which I've done before) feels weird most of the time. I'm not really confident enough yet to interact that way much and meet new people or potential dates. I'll exchange a few words with people but that's about it. I'm really not sure what needs to change with my life.

59,oqnwb8,1627124607,Above average looking guy ON and OFF Tinder experience of 3 years,"Hey Reddit,  


Wanted to make this post, because I see a lot of people complaining about Tinder(and other apps) so I wanted to share my experience and a few tips potentialy.

I was 21 when i first installed it, so now Im 24 years old, I dont have it installed all the time, i install it every few months, have it for a day, two max then delete it,

As far as my profile goes:  
Pictures: A selfie, me with my cat, about 2 of those, full body, a selfie of my back in the mirror, and a video of my drawings

My bio: I usualy dont write anything here apart from a few emojis, and most recently i wrote something funny that i discovered but thats it.

I get about 30 matches for that day that i have it installed, 95 percent wont say hey first, so i have to say something, i usualy send a gif or ask an interesting question so we can continue the conversation easily, small number of girls wont respond at all, some replies will be really bland and at last very low percentage will continue having the conversation with you, i realised most girls are there for attention.

The girls that say something FIRST, are usualy the ones that I dont go out with lol, they will say nice smile or im cute or that me and my cat are cute and i would have to carry the conversation from there and they are just not engaging, they are mostly boring, as far as my opinion goes.

I try to set up a date very soon, because im really not interested in talking days on tinder, and its a good way to eliminate those that dont even want to do it in the first place. I usualy take girls to get some ice cream, i do it mostly because i like it, and i know that most girls like it as well, so its a win win, we take a walk, sit in the park, you dont have to spend as much money, u can both end it soon if you dont like it, the only thing is that all my dates were at least 4-5 hours long, ALL of them, which IS weird.

Sometimes I arrange a date so fast that after 20 mins i realize i dont even wanna go, so i had to cancel a lot of times, which i am sorry for, sometimes girls invited me to their places to hook up, and when i was younger i thought thats cool but then i realized that its like making love with air, when you dont feel anything, its pretty ordinary, at least thats my opinion, if u like doing that go for it!

I didnt get a single relationship out of tinder, mostly wouldnt even go past the first date because i just didnt like the girls, maybe they didnt like me either who knows.

My advice for you guys, and this is more of a life advice then advice for girls, but take care of yourself, brush your teeth, shave that patchy beard off, that care of the unibrow, shower, deodorant, parfume, dress nicely, it doesnt have to be expensive, just make sure its clean, its ironed and it fits you well, have something to do, play sports, draw, play games, anything, get a job, excercise, u dont have to go to the gym, i dont, i do calisthenics, pull ups, dips, push ups - all sorts of those, trust me you are gonna look and feel great, take care of those nose hair, now i know most of these are some regular-ass advice but trust me, i see a lot of people/men not even doing these, so start now  


And my final word is, Tinder aint all that, most girls are there for other reasons like self promoting, didnt run into bots however, most girls there are boring even though some of them can be pretty, hot, cute whatever.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqnwb8/above_average_looking_guy_on_and_off_tinder/

My stress levels are up by constantly thinking of “will they reply” or “why is it taking so long”. I also hate the fact how excited I get from the notification of them sending me something.

68,oqpgqq,1627131221,At a loss,"I'm (33F) dating a (38M) for 3 years. We met online. We messaged for a year and a half before I could finally convince him to meet me. We did and we hit it off wonderfully. We both aren't fans of being on the phone, so we text.  This isn't a problem for us. The problem we are having is I'm the one who pushes for things to move forward and is always initiating. With us dating, I asked him out. I also pushed for us to meet one another. I am the one who pushes to see one another more often. I also pushed for us to be intimate with one another. 

We started having some issues with intimacy. We went camping one weekend and we used to not keep our hands off one another. Even on long car rides we would tease one another. Well, the last couple of camping trips weren't like our previous ones. I even cried during one of our trips because I told him we weren't like we had been. He said he didn't see anything wrong. A few weeks went by and I asked him if maybe we should try sexting. He said he wasn't really into that, but would try if I wanted. I said I did want to try because I wanted there to be more intimacy. Well, nothing came of it because I didn't push for it to happen. I initiate sex and if I don't initiate, nothing happens, which sucks because sometimes I want to feel like I'm someone he desires. It feels like we are kissing friends.

He won't even talk about a future with me. I bring it up and he always says he had to think about it. I'm at a loss on what to do. I've thought about us taking a break and seeing if he can figure things out without me being in the picture. I could really use some advice from anyone who's been in this situation or similar. He is a terrific guy and I want to make it work. 

I should mention neither of us has any children. So children aren't involved. (This is another issue).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqpgqq/at_a_loss/

70,oqpruo,1627132306,When do you think someone should end a relationship?,"For some context, me and my girl have been dating for almost 4 months now and we’re in a long distance relationship. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love her a ton and I miss her so much but if I’m being completely honest, there are days where I’ve thought that it was a bit much sometimes between me and her. She’s had trust issues with me in the past over insecurities of her own and she says that she’s very moody and needs a lot of love/attention to be happy (which I’m happy to provide for as best as I can). 

But the thing is that we’ve had a few fights before about being there for one another and our relationship in general. Just today she said that I’ve changed and that why didn’t I do stuff like text her, tell her stuff, etc. She knows that my job is very physically and mentally demanding and when my job requires my attention, I’m basically chained to doing my job and won’t be able to text or anything. Before she’s also asks how she feels like we’ve grown apart and how I’ve changed/am a different person. She’s also even asked if I wanted to break up with her multiple times and I always say no because I love her, which ends up with me and her eventually making up and carrying on together. 

If I’m being honest, I love her and care so much about her but I feel like we’ve ran circles in this race already. It’s been mentally draining having her say that I don’t actually love her or if I wanna end things (when she claims that she doesn’t actually mean it). I don’t want to break up with her because I still love and care about her but I’d be lying if I said that it’s been a perfect ride this whole time. And of course relationships aren’t perfect but I feel like sometimes this is draining my energy. 

So how do you know when a relationship should end? What can I do to salvage this and make it better?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqpruo/when_do_you_think_someone_should_end_a/

for some context we are good friends and have hung out multiple times, but she is currently abroad for about a year and i have been texting her every month. this is what i have noticed:

She never texts me on her own, i always have to start the conversation (she is also very shy)

She askes me a lot of questions like where have i been, what i do etc,... (i also ask a lot of return questions)

she takes a long time (over an hour usualy) to respond, but never leaves me on read. i am guesing she is rly busy like me. i also dont respond imediatly.

our conversations are generaly light harted and casual and about the stuff we like. and i think we both enjoy them.

i respond with a couple of texts (not whole essays) while she usualy only texts very short replys (not just ""k"" or ""nice"" but a short sentence).

72,oqpv65,1627132654,Does She Like Me Or Am I Overthinking it?,"Ok so I work at this fast food place where the entire ordeal is pretty casual. It does get busy sometimes as expected but things are generally pretty laid back.  Anyways I met this girl there and I have reason to believe based on her behavior and body language that she may be into me. I have had decent luck with women in the past and girls have liked me and asked me out before so I guess I am not without cause to suspect this particular girl likes me. 

I was working with her and and I made a silly mistake whilst interacting with a customer, and when I looked down and caught her eye, she smiled one of those teeth showing grins, the kind where I could see both sets of teeth in her mouth. Another time she randomly sat on the ground and complained about being tired. I wasn't paying much attention but then she said she needed my help. She wasn't injured or anything but she wanted me to take her hand and help her off the ground. She sort of made it harder for me to get her off the ground, thus leading me to hold her hand a bit longer that what would have been necessary. Keep in mind this all occured in the same day of me meeting her. 

Whenever I would accidentally make eye contact with her, she would hold my gaze and look into my eyes. This happend about three times and she did this every time.  She also rubbed her hands against my back as she way walking past me. Now that I doubt holds any significance...

I am not sure if these are signs of a possible romantic interest on her part, and if it is the feeling is mutual. However what makes me doubt as to wether she has a crush on me or not was this one time I had to stop by after work to retrieve something I forgot. She was busy with something and when she heard my voice she turned and looked at me and went back to what she was doing. I should have said hello or something but I wasn't in the mood.

We got along great, always laughing together and having fun. We would hang out usually once during the week since we both worked and then all weekend Fri - Sun. There were a couple times I got upset with him because he would get distant after sex sometimes and it really bothered and triggered me. When I feel someone pull away, I tend to pull away even further. Which I know isn't healthy. Anyway, this last time everything was great Friday and Saturday. We didn't sleep together Fri bc I was on my period. Saturday I wasn't bleeding much and we started messing around. He knew I had been on it. Since I hadn't been bleeding much, I went along with it and we ended up sleeping together. The sex was very passionate and he asked me if could finish inside me and I said yes since we were in the moment. I'm not sure if this is what made me bleed but when I went to the bathroom I noticed a lot of blood. When I came back I told him and he just said ""Yeah.."" and seemed all of the sudden distant toward me. The next day I go to his place and things were fine but the end of the night he seemed distant again and just turned over and went to bed. We usually make out or have sex every time we hang out.
His sudden shift in energy made me pull back all week. We text a little Mon and Tues and then nothing Wed and Thurs. We always text everyday btw. So Friday I sent him a text asking if he was ok. He said I've been acting weird since Mon and he doesn't want to go through this again. I text him back saying the reason I was acting weird is because he got distant with me after Saturday night and I don't want to keep going through that either. He never text me back after that and ended up unfollowing me in social media.

96,oqsytm,1627143044,Confidence got riggity riggity wrecked.,"Hello friends. A little bit about me, I'm 24 years old, I love to go to the beach and I love to skimboard! On here looking for advice on something that disgustingly stomped on my confidence.

I've been quite active in the hook up world not so much in the dating world(by choice). With only one relationship under my belt that lasted almost 7 months, I'd say I have a decent ""mouth piece"" as they say - if you don't know what that means it's just another way of saying ""game"". So I recently started working in a retail store and I hooked up with this cute blondie after we got out of work and after 2 days passed, we were sitting outside making out. I was a bit tipsy but fully functional. She started to point out my quirks and stated that I have a lot of quirks.... 

I disclosed to her that I'm on the spectrum (I have asperger's). After that - the vibe completely changed and she started to be extra nice to me which weirded me out and we made out a little more and we both got a little tired so we parted ways. So when got home and for some reason she really wanted me to text her saying I got home safe since she was punctual about it last time and I didn't do it. I texted her that I got home and the little typing emoji thingy showed next to her name and she was typing for quite a while...

When I finally received a message from her, she sent a long paragraph text and to keep it short she basically said that she couldn't be with me in a sexual way because ""common knowledge is that with autistic people they cannot fully consent to sexual activities"" as she said....

I'm typically a type of guy to shake off any mean jokes or insults pretty easily or even say something witty back. I've gotten rejected by many women, but I've also hooked up with many women.

I come here to this sub humbled.

 But in all honesty I think this one stung pretty badly and I would really appreciate any sincere advice.

These past years, we would constantly talk on Snapchat and I got to know him more and more, and I started to like him A LOT. Since two year ago we became closer because we were in similar stages of life (recent college grads, applying for jobs, getting in the stock market, dealing with becoming adults, etc).. He ended up accepting a job offer about a year ago in the city I live but because of COVID we was working remotely. Three months ago he finally got a lease here and he invited me to go to his house in multiple occasions but I never could. 
Two weeks ago I finally went over and it went SO well, we talked for hours, had a few drinks, and I got a good feeling about us. I ended up staying the night, we had sex, overall everything was good.. but ever since we have spoken twice and both times I initiated the conversation. I was expecting him to talk to me this past weekend, but nothing… and I’m getting a bad feeling as we would normally talk throughout the week. 
My friends say that I would have waited to have sex with him, as it looks like he lost interest in me… so idk what to do now. He mentioned getting food the next time we hangout, but it’s been two weeks ñ and I’m getting zero vibes from him now. 
A side note is that I accepted a job offer in a different state that’s 9 hours from here, but I still have a month and a half before I leave, so I thought about spending that time with him. 
What should I do now??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqt0a8/ghosted_after_sex/

99,oqt77d,1627143811,Why does she act all talkative in real life but distant and cold in text? I'm scared to ask her out.,"I don't understand this. Whenever we see each other at work she is always talkative, always near me and stuff and enjoys my presence, but when I try and text her she is distant and gives blunt one word replies. It is like I am not speaking to the same person. I know she isn't a bad texter because she shown me some of her perfume collection photos and selfies etc on her phone and messages from her friends constantly pop on her phone. I glanced at her phone while she is texting her friends and there are multiple messages, long sentences etc, but why when she texts me she always gives me one word replies. 

I know she likes me because I can tell with her body language, her voice, her starting majority of the real life conversations with me because I play it cool and don't wanna show desperation. She finishes her shift earlier than me and she stands there next to the checkouts waiting for me as I am still serving customers. Other girls in this place just walk out but she waits for me.

Does she only text one liners with me because she is shy when texting me only or what? I am so confused and scared to ask her out because of such a personality change in real life vs text.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqt77d/why_does_she_act_all_talkative_in_real_life_but/
