0,nrffw6,1622732177,I met the perfect woman and I blew it. Right now we‚Äôre in no contact and I think I really have one shot at trying to get her back.,"So I actually met a woman around my age here on Reddit through r/r4r. She lives in a different country from me but we got to talking and she was literally perfect. 

Most women I do start talking to can‚Äôt even hold a conversation and they ghost me, not her. We always had something to say. We shared literally every intimate detail about our lives, we told each other we love each other, we told each other we wanted a future with each other. We video chatted every night and went to sleep together on video chat. I actually intended on meeting her.

The only thing is, she is inexperienced with relationships. She‚Äôs never had a serious relationship before so in that sense she is emotionally immature. 


I think she got scared with how fast we were going and she started to become distant, she then said she needed a few days to think about things. The next day she said basically she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship and deleted the app we had been talking on and deleted me off Snapchat. I‚Äôve been missing her dearly, whenever I see something that reminds me of her my heart literally hurts because I miss her so much. But she won‚Äôt talk to me, it‚Äôs been a week and radio silence from her. 


I figure I would try to contact her one last time after a period of no contact, however I don‚Äôt want to come across as needy, desperate or even creepy by sending her some wall of text about how much I miss her, that can actually make things worse and run girls off even more. Am I crazy for pursuing this again? I don‚Äôt usually do this but she was like the perfect woman for me and abs made me so happy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrffw6/i_met_the_perfect_woman_and_i_blew_it_right_now/

2,nrfvo6,1622733296,DO APPROACH WOMEN ‚ú®,"Like the title says, APPROACH US.
I just recently found this sub and have seen SO MANY 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt approach her, she doesn‚Äôt want it...blah blah blah‚Äù.
That makes me so sad for us :(



I‚Äôll say it, since no one else seems to want to.
The only reason a woman won‚Äôt take kindly to you approaching her?  
Is if she considered you ugly, and is NOT interested. Or you come across as creepy. If you can‚Äôt take a no, etc.


It‚Äôs so easy to go up to a girl and say ‚Äúhey, I thought you were cute and just had to talk to you! I‚Äôm ____, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

Then small talk blah blah blah 
Then you ask for her number. 

If at ANY moment she says she has a boyfriend? Don‚Äôt keep pressuring her. Take the L boys ü§£ it‚Äôs ok, some people just won‚Äôt be interested. 
Also, watch body language, in dating...you have to be intuitive. 
If someone seems uncomfortable that you‚Äôre there? end the conversation, kindly. And LEAVE HER ALONE üñ§

I can assure you, most women want to be approached. Most people dare over online dating. Unless you‚Äôre in it for hookups, then they‚Äôll be all for online dating, maybe. 




Here‚Äôs a deer analogy I heard recently...
Say you live in a wooded area.
There are lots of deer around and there are signs alerting others to 
‚ÄúNo feeding the deer‚Äù
You may think, oh but they‚Äôre so cute I‚Äôll just feed them anyway! 
But there‚Äôs a reason that sign is there. 
When you feed the deer it loses the need to go and hunt it‚Äôs food.
It loses the fear of people.
therefore, it will frolic along to any hunter thinking they have food. 
They become complacent seeing as they have no need to hunt because people are bringing the food to them. 
Instead of helping them, you‚Äôre hurting them. ‚òπÔ∏è




That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to men on here with the repeated ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach women‚Äù 
Stop it. Men, I can assure you, if you‚Äôre kind and respectful a lot of women  will admire the bravery it takes to approach someone!
And in the event they are not interested,some might introduce you to a friend or encourage you to  continue your approaches ‚ù§Ô∏è


Ladies, isn‚Äôt online dating exhausting? Let‚Äôs encourage our men with ways to approach us how we like to be approached than to belittle them for following their instincts.
Granted, many men do not know how to adequately approach us.
Therefore, coming off as creeps. 
Yet, that isn‚Äôt the approach itself,
It is the way it was carried out.

Ladies; if you have any tips for men on grooming so that they can improve their looks, or ways in which you feel most comfortable being approached? Feel free to please share! üå∏

3,nrg5i8,1622734021,"My girlfriend wants to smoke weed and it breaks my heart, what should I do?","I (19m) just finished my first year of college with my girlfriend (19f). We‚Äôve been together since October, and things have been great.

I‚Äôve had horrible experiences with weed. My friend in highschool used it and killed himself (probably unrelated but still). Every friend I have that starts using it glorifies it, loves it, and they do it so much and I resent them for it. It‚Äôs changed a lot of people in my life and they move away from me. 

I smoked weed myself in college, I had some good times, but the last three times it went wrong and it was very traumatic. I‚Äôm still mentally and physically recovering.

I hate it so much, and I hate my friends for it too. During second semester, my girlfriend asked me if she could do edibles with her friend. She‚Äôs never done it before, and said that she just didn‚Äôt want to die without knowing what it‚Äôs like. And I said okay, sure, that‚Äôs fine, have fun. And she did, but she enjoyed herself way too much. Then she smoked with my friends, and I felt so alone.

She said she‚Äôd never do it again. Until we got into a fight because I did something stupid. And one of her terms was that I let her start using weed more. And it crushed me. I said yes but I‚Äôm depressed about it. I‚Äôm actually on break from my work right now because I had a panic attack, it felt like I was going to die.

It really bothers me. I asked her if she had to choose between me or weed, what would she choose? And she said she‚Äôd pick me without a doubt.

But I don‚Äôt want to make her choose, I want her to live her life the way she wants to, I love her so much, so much that it really hurts me to even think of her doing that again.

We‚Äôve talked about it so much to the point where it just annoys her.

I have women try to start conversations with me regularly and I can hold myself fine until like 10 sentences in when I say something ""weird"". It's hard to describe but its like I have an insane train of thought going on in my head and I never know whats appropriate to say. Like we are on step 3 in the conversation, so I try to think what step 4 should be then then I blurt out what should be step 15 probably. And then the girl/women gets that ""scared/weirded out look"" and might give me another chance or just tries to end the conversation as soon as possible.

I managed to get 2 dates even, ones that weren't just food calls but well....I am a numbers guy. My world is recoginising patterns, visual and abstract and trying to fit a correlations, reasons and possibilities. That's why I love working in engineering. And I am not saying this to say ""look how smart I am"" but I can never get past the basic stuff with people, we either stay there too long or conversations end abruptly. I have such elaborate thoughts yet I can't properly get to express any of them, nor do I think they are interested in it, since it's not ""fun"".

Also I think whats the most offputting is how I am pretty clumsy because my motorics are pretty janky and my voice can be very monotone if I am not careful with it.

It feels very cursed at times. I never would try anything malicious on anyone, I think I am one of the most naive people. Whenever something happens I always assume the other person is acting in my best interest too, so I do the same with them, it just comes across as weird.

Also I am always trying to be honest, I never lie. Unless there are some real risks to telling the truth. If someone asks me something I always answer 100% honestly and don't hold back any information.

13,nrgxx5,1622736096,"[Tinder, Bumble] not just 0 match, but 0 like","Hi

Please pardon the lenght of this post but maybe you'd be more enlighted about the situation if you have all the informations.

I'm a 23-yo guy and actually I never was engaged in a relationship for more than two days. I don't rely on my parents since a few years, fully independant, which means that I have my own place in Paris. And even if it's a real tiny one, I feel like I'm finally an independent adult and It'd be just about time for me to find girls to spend the night with or -even better- find The one.

So, obviously, nowadays, that means dating on apps -not just that but a majority of people use them. Friends, colleagues, people that I don't especially know -and even my doctors with who I discussed about my eventual feel of loneliness- often make lots of compliments about me, making me uncomfortable,  saying that I'm handsome, interesting to speak with or even a smooth talker -but in the good way. I mean, I really get a lot of compliments on a weekly basis.

So when I say that I don't get to date many girls, people who don't know me personnally often show some surprise. But I actually don't get to date ANY girl. As I'm not the kind to approach unknown people in pubs, I thought that Tinder would be easier, even if I hate selfies and I don't use any social network.

Everytime I got on Tinder, I tried a different method. The ""funny guy"" with a tiny humoristic bio, the romantic one with a long text, the bad boy with a serious tone. All with pictures of me matching the selected ""axis"" of my method. It didn't lack in sincerity because all these are a true part of me.

I tell you what : not only that I don't get any single damn match but I also never get any f***ing like. It's the absolute ZERO. NOTHING. 

For someone like me, being the extrovert-and-easy-talking-but-deeply-self-unconfident type of guy, every time that I recreate a Tinder account -or bumble- I get a massive slap in the face and it's really hurtful. I don't get what's wrong with me : I hide my deprecation of myself behind excessive humility, people are largely balencing that with big compliments and, in the other hand, I feel like I'm 10000% uninteresting to anyone.

What are your advices ? did you ever go trough that before finally getting some success ? 

I can provide you screenshots or link to my tinder profile, if you need to get a look at it

14,nrh646,1622736698,I‚Äôm sort of lost on how to move things forward,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm sort of in limbo with this girl I‚Äôm seeing, where I‚Äôm a little confused on what we are. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre just friends, it seems like it‚Äôs a little more than that, however we aren‚Äôt boyfriend and girlfriend either.

I think she might like me though, one reason I say that is because she seems to like touching me. If we‚Äôre walking somewhere she‚Äôll hold onto my arm, or if we‚Äôre watching a movie she‚Äôll sit close to me on the couch so that we‚Äôre touching.

17,nrhhmk,1622737527,Confusing and Hurtful Dating Experience,"I'm trying to process a confusing and hurtful dating experience that took place over the past two weeks. Any outside thoughts would be appreciated. 

I met this person on a dating app and we decided to meet for coffee over the weekend. 

I was nervous before the date, so I got to the coffee shop early, ordered a pastry and a cup of coffee, and waited around awhile. During this time, I ate the pastry and moved the plate off to the far end of the table. I know this seems like a meaningless detail, but it resurfaces later (much to my confusion). 

Eventually she arrived, and I thought the conversation went off to a great start. We seemed to have a lot in common, there was plenty of laughter, we shared a lot of the same goals and opinions, etc.. 

We parted ways about two hours later.

Just to clarify, there was no physical contact on this first date. I avoid any kind of overly romantic gestures or displays of physical intimacy on first dates. We are just meeting in a coffee shop as strangers and getting to know each other. 

I texted later to make sure she got home OK and told her how much I enjoyed our conversation. 

She responded and said she enjoyed it too, but was confused about whether or not I was attracted to her. She asked if I thought she was ""kissable.""

I replied that I found her very attractive, but didn't want to ""move things along too fast"" or make her feel ""pressured or uncomfortable"" on a first date. 

She said she was attracted to me too and wanted to meet a second time, so I suggested dinner the next weekend. 

We met the next weekend and had (what I thought) was a great dinner with more wonderful conversation. We seemed to have a lot in common.

She had previously mentioned her love of houseplants, so I brought her a small plant in a decorative pot. Nothing overly fancy or expensive. Just a small gift that I thought she'd enjoy. 

After dinner, she asked if I wanted to sit in my car and talk some more. 

I agreed, and we talked for another hour or so. By now, she was telling me about her family, her childhood, and all sorts of details about her everyday life. I liked everything I was hearing. 

Then things started to get weird. 

She brought up our previous date and asked about the plate and fork on the far end of the table.

She wanted to know why I had finished my pastry before she arrived, and that it seemed ""kind of rude"" and ""suspicious"" to have eaten anything before she got there. 

I was taken aback and didn't even know if she was joking. 

We talked a little more, then she said she needed to go. 

I didn't attempt to kiss her this time. I would have, but the time and place felt wrong. We were sitting in a dark car in a crowded parking lot at an awkward angle, and she opened the car door to leave rather abruptly.

She said she wanted to see me again on Thursday evening (tonight), and I agreed. 

Then, last night, everything fell to pieces. 

She texted me and once again brought up our first date at the coffee shop.

She wanted to know why I had mentioned ""not wanting to move things along too fast"" and ""not wanting to make her feel pressured or uncomfortable"" on a first date, and said that those comments seemed ""kind of rapey"" (her actual words) and asked that I clarify what I meant. 

I was stunned. 

I told her that I had heard many stories of women feeling uncomfortable on first dates, and that I didn't want to make her feel that way. I wanted to make sure she had fun and that we genuinely got to know each other as people.

She then responded ""I don't want to meet anymore. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a nice life.""

As someone with terrible self-esteem who has been in some abusive relationships, I am constantly over-analyzing my behavior and trying to make sure I do what is expected. 

I lost a lot of sleep last night wondering what I must have done and why things ended this way. 

Has anyone had a similar experience?

Any advice?

We lost touch in high school and for a few years after we graduated. We both took similar paths (travel, volunteering, self discovery, sort of the black sheep in our families) and found ourselves back in our hometown when covid hit. We reconnected on Facebook and after talking for a bit, we decide to make plans to go ice skating that week. Long story short, from that night on we were crazy about each other, a feeling either of us seldom have. 

 He had gotten out of a 3 year relationship the previous year and had a tough time getting over her, was drinking a lot (borderline addiction), feeling really lost in life (he had just moved back from Hawaii after living there for 2 years with ex gf). The night of ice skating and pizza which we didn't even eat bc we were too caught up in each other, quickly turned into seeing each other 2-3x a week on dates and at each other's places. I'm in nursing school and he works full time, but we would get through our weeks with each other on our mind's until we were together.

The chemistry was immediately noticed and talked about. The sex is off the charts and the best either of us have had, we have the same sense of humor that keeps us laughing even before bed at night, we spent countless hours with each others families (he lives with his parents and sister). I developed very very strong feelings. The stronger the feels, the more nervous I was about asking what we are. In the beginning we wanted to keep things casual, but everything we did said otherwise. He tells me he has never felt this way before for a girl. When we are out in public, we are romantic and obviously crazy about each other. People assume we are a couple and we never knocked it. He referred to me as his gf once when I was cuddling his doggo. he said ""hey, that's my girlfriend"" when we stand in front of the mirror, we'll say things like thats a cute couple right there. But we have never had that conversation about being exclusive. Although we were each other's #1

Here is where things get messy (personal stuff, skip over if you want):

In February I found my step dad dead in his car from a heart attack after just being with him minutes before(he is like my real dad, my real one isnt in my life) and it immediately changed everything. My mom who was with him for 5 years became depressed, homeless, and dependent on me for most everything. She cleans houses for a living and has arthritis all over her body and a recent hip replacement surgery. She aches and has trouble working, letting alone getting out of bed or going to the store sometimes.. All of my energy was focused on my mom's well-being, her work, and this boy, hardly focusing on myself or school. In the fall I had a 3.8 GPA, I felt confident about my studies, but I ended up failing my spring semester. This recent trajectory sets me back a year in nursing school. Its okay, ill get another chance next spring.

Through everything, he was there for me and made everything okay. Without him I think I would have fell into a downward spiral depression this winter.

About three weeks ago in May, he moved 700 miles away to work a seasonal job at a resort in a kitchen. It pays well and he will work 50-60 hour weeks for the summer. He mentioned it to me months ago and asked to come with him, I said no bc situation with my mom (working and being there for her). I was hoping he would change his mind but supported his decision regardless. He was unhappy with his life here (we live in rural small town where locals never leave) he was ashamed to be living with his parents, he has no long term goals or ideas... i think he felt like he had to just do something or be anywhere but here. The last phone call he had he rushed the words and seemed nervous to say ""I mean you could come here for the summer and make a lot of money, we could room together"" again I said no. If I felt more confident about him as a boyfriend maybe I would consider going but not when I feel like this

The night before he left he held me in bed, told me how much he cares about me, and that he will be coming back a rich man. He said ""I have a home here too, you know""..

So he left and it's been almost three weeks. He works all the time, he has called me twice and has barely texted. He told me he doesn't really like it there and his job isn't enjoyable. He sent a few snapchat videos of him listening to our song and letting me know he's thinking of me. Whatever we have going on right now, situationship,  relationship, it feels like radio silence. No progress is being made and I feel disconnected from him. I want to tell him all of these things but I don't want to scare him away. I believe if he truly wanted this he would pursue me and make time for us. I wouldn't be feeling so uncertain of how he feels about me. It has been five months and I feel more confused than ever...

Not one woman has ever put in as much effort as me...not one.","I see this advice all the time, whether it's about conversation on dating apps, putting effort into dates or even a relationship. I'm wondering where people are finding those who put in the effort. Not one woman has ever reciprocated with the effort I put in. Not one. I'm ALWAYS the one making the first move, always the one making conversation (or at least putting the most effort in to make the convo interesting), always the one coming up with plans and date ideas. And lets be honest, they don't need to put in the effort. For every guy like me who quickly gets tired of unreciprocated interest, there is someone waiting to lavish them with attention.

22,nri1b4,1622738964,Need advice,"Me F(17) and my bf M (18) have only been dating for 3 and a half weeks. We met in April and we started dating in may on the 6th. I've only known him for a month. Basically
My boyfriend has only had one girlfriend in the past and he told me it was a bad experience,  it was super toxic and they only lasted a month or two. he told me he attempted suicide after they broke up which alarmed me. He also said he was sent to a mental hospital after the attempt. He stated this happened three years ago and that he's moved on and better now.
He claimed he loved me after we started dating so basically he said it in a week after we've seen each other multiple times. 
This kinda put me on edge as well, I didn't say it back though because it was early but I did eventually. It was a kinda in the moment type thing, but now that I'm looking back on it, I'm really unsure. We still tell each other I love you but sometimes I don't mean it. 
I like him, I don't love him fully? I think we said it too early. I feel like he likes or loves me more than I love or like him necessarily
We also ended up getting a bit sexual after the three weeks too, not like crazy but just little things. It was a in the moment type thing again..
But getting sexual made me overthink about moving too fast even more. Don't get me wrong, I do like him and I like spending time with him, I'm just really unsure at the moment.
 I eventually ended up asking him about if we had moved too quickly and he told me ""No"" and that he meant saying I love you. He sounded confused when I brought it up to him when we talked about it. Then reassured me that we could go at any pace I needed too including the sexual things. We talked about our boundaries and left it at that after but I'm still not really satisfied? like I'm still unsure or on edge..

23,nri2h1,1622739044,Being set up with someone through friends is one of the best ways to date imo,"I'm a little biased because I was set up and it's going really well, but I feel like it's just such an overlooked method of dating! There's a reason matchmaking used to be so popular! Online dating just doesn't have the human aspect to it, and it's too easy for people to treat others like they're just pictures or vice versa. I think everyone can just agree that cold approaches suck. Men hate having to do it, and as women we tend to not like being approached in public. Being set up still has that human aspect though even if all you've been given is their phone number. As long as the mediator has asked both sides and they both agree that they're interested in being set up, I think there's a really low risk of rude behavior like ghosting from girls or guys ghosting after sex. If you're both have mutual friends or your families are close, you *have* to treat them with a certain amount of respect or else there could be the risk of social backlash. Of course if things don't work out between you, you might run into each other later but I think the odds of that happening would be really low if you hadn't seen each other before you were set up. Another plus is if you have reliable friends or family, they can do vetting for anything too crazy. If things work out, you already know your family will like them. It would literally be so easy to ask your siblings if they could think of anyone, ask your parents if their friends have any kids your age, ask your friends, etc. I mean, I feel like even your grandparents would *love* to try and set you up with someone. All you have to do is tell them you're interested in being set up and ask if there's anyone they can think of. If they can't think if anyone right away it's fine because if they eventually do meet a single person your age that seems nice, they'll just have to say ""Wow! I think you'd look really good with this person I know"". They'll show them a profile photo you and give them your number if they're interested or they'll ask if they can have your phone number to give to you. It's great, it takes the stress out of dating, and I wish people would think to set up their friends more often so you wouldn't have to ask them to set you up with someone lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nri2h1/being_set_up_with_someone_through_friends_is_one/

I was nervous and prepared myself for a date that wasn't a good match. I quickly realized I was wrong and enjoyed the few hours we spent together. Right off the bat, I was caught off guard by normal I felt around her; I wasn't anxious, I was relaxed.

It didn't take long for me to pick up on how interested she was in me. Although she didn't know it, she handed me several compliments that, in my head, have long been deep insecurities of mine. In fact, they were things none of my exes‚Äîor anyone I've dated before really‚Äîhas told me before. I didn't know what to say at first, but I felt *super* flattered. I've rarely been complimented with such sincerity. None of them were things I typically hear, but they're things I've always *wanted* to hear. It felt so nice.

I have no idea things will unfold with her. That's not the point. If it lasts or if it doesn't, I'm beyond thankful for a date that gave me confidence in myself like never before.

However, I won't be able to see her again for a while and I'm not sure how to proceed with self healing.

I've always wanted a family with values, i want a smart but humble woman. And as the time goes by, the few women with good manners and values are going on extinction. So me settling down with someone i don't want to be doesn't make me abnormal, it's just that society expectations are changing exponentially quick and we're probably still living on a different era.

56,nro2wy,1622754559,I (M22) need advice regarding my FWB (18),"Hello guys!

TLDR at the bottom.

To preface this, I need to explain my view of FwB (because I know most people on here differ on this). Basically for me, friends with benefits actually means FRIENDS with benefits, meaning that altough sex is the most important part of our relationship, it is not the only part and we are not afraid of ""catching feelings"" - I like her very much and she confessed to me multiple times she likes me a lot as well. I'm saying this because I'm not looking for replies like ""why do you care, its no strings attached, just drop it"". Having sex with someone has always been a hugely emotional and intimate act that I couldn't do with someone who I don't care about.

Now to the question itself. We have been together for 8 months approximately, usually meeting up to have sex once every week or two. We agreed to be just FwBs because we both like sleeping with other people and I don't feel ready to enter a relationship (with anyone) yet. For the vast majority of our relationship, I have been able to feel secure. She has always demonstrated to me that she cares about me, either by being really present with me (like looking into my eyes when we talk, kissing me randomly etc.), driving up to my distant house when I couldn't arrive, messaging me when I didn't inquire if she's ready for the weekend and so on. I could just TELL she was interested in me.

Fast forward to about 2 months ago - for some reason, on one of our ""dates"", she became distant. Didn't look me in the eyes, didn't want to hug (which is very much out of character for her), didn't seem interested in me. I asked her about it if everything is fine, she said yes, but still nothing changed, so I just kinda got sad and anxious (like I usually do in situations like these) and basically froze. After that, she was VERY slow to text me back (sometimes up to a week of no text to a question if we're gonna meet up). She apologized to me and said she won't do it again. I finally managed to schedule a night with her after a month, and while she was much better, the interest still seemed low. Now my anxious attachment style kicked in and I tried to prove to her how much I like her, by being sweet to her, paying a lot of attention to her, texting her sweet things, stuff like that.

We met up again after a week when her parents were out of town. I suggested we spend the entire weekend together (because at that point its been a long while since we last spent an entire weekend together, although it was pretty much tradition before all this mess). She agreed, I spent a night with her from Friday to Saturday. She said that she needs to do some things for school and said that she works better when shes alone, so she asked me if I could leave for the day and come back in the evening - I obliged. But then she texted me ""it doesnt seem like we can meet up, sorry"" without any further explanation. I know it wasnt her parents coming home. So I asked her about it and again, no reply. After 5 days of bad anxiety I asked her if we do not talk anymore. She said we obviously do. I said why did she ignore me for 5 days then. She replied that she wasnt ignoring me and it would have been ignoration only if Ive written more messages but she didnt reply to any of them. Well at that point I kinda checked out mentally and couldn't believe she actually wrote that shit.

I think she doesn't treat me right. But at this point I don't know what to do. I still like her and don't want to leave her, although I know that I will have to if this keeps up. Should I try to be open with her, tell her how much her change in behavior is hurting me and ask her to stop or at least explain (this does not seem to me very effective btw)? Should I just cut contact with her and hope she will miss me at some point? Or is it best to just leave now? I'd be happy for some thoughful and considerate replies.

TLDR - FwB changed her behavior to distant, I dont know why and its hurting me, she usually refuses to communicate. Now I need advice on how to proceed, because I don't want to lose her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nro2wy/i_m22_need_advice_regarding_my_fwb_18/

So I‚Äôm a divorced 44M who has been split for 6+ years, great relationship with ex , her bf, and of course split time with the kids. I feel the need to mention that from my first gf up until last year if I was single and interested in someone I could start a conversation that would lead to her number and at least a date over 90% of the time. No I‚Äôm no Brad Pitt. Quite the contrary. I‚Äôve always been an athlete and would infiltrate the college bars with 15-20 D1 athletes who totally invested these selves in there physiques, functional fitness etc.  This was around the mid 90‚Äôs if you‚Äôre familiar with baseball at that time it was the beginning of canseco, McGwire being the bash brothers and pretty much the beginning of weight lifting for the position players. Us pitchers, nope flexibility and strong legs. Lots of running. I hated running and skipped most of it. Needles to say I wasn‚Äôt a fat guy but I don‚Äôt look like an athlete. I‚Äôd come across a woman that I would notice and eventually make my way to the bar or her table and politely offer to buy her a drink, if she said yes we‚Äôd chat, if she said no thank you I‚Äôd ask her permission to hang around and talk with her a bit.  After some laughs about the horrific approaches I‚Äôd seen made on her and chatting with her and her friends it was successful. That is normal to me. Fast forward to my divorce it‚Äôs the tinder era. I arranged a meet up with someone I met there snd it went well for a year then she turned so crazy I slept with a knife. Mix in single dates evenings all good over the years. Pandemic‚Ä¶boom. Try to call someone anyone and they‚Äôll never answer. You can text them right after snd they‚Äôll fire off an excuse.  Exchange conversation back and fourth for a bit and everything is going just fine.   As soon as you drop so much as a hint that you like them, or think they‚Äôre funny, or the worst that they‚Äôre beautiful though you‚Äôll notice that the texts only get transmitted one way. The incomings cease. Soon after it‚Äôs üëª time for them.  I thought it was a millennial and gen z thing but no it‚Äôs the 40 somethings 30‚Äôs you name it.

Few days later she said she just isn't in the right mind to date anyone atm and we've not spoke since. Again, fair enough.

63,nroyw3,1622756960,So this was my first dating experience," 

Sorry if this is hard to read in some spots, I'm kind of tired and dazed. i just need to vent.

I have to preface this with the person I was dating was the complete opposite of me:

Me(Mike): I have anxiety but it has been getting better, I'm much more outgoing but still have anxiety

I analyze, sometimes too much.

I'm was a virgin,never french kissed a woman before and of course was never in a relationship      before either

Her(Amanda): Very outgoing

Has kids

Has had a lot of experience, is a very sexual person

Is very confident, talking about being a strong woman a lot

Goes with the flow

Has been cheated on before numerous times

So  we had been dating for 6 weeks, with us both having a lot of fun. I  mentioned to her my anxiety, where I think its coming from, some  personal thing and I talk about a few of my friends since I feel weird  to just introduce them when the context doesn't fit. When we decide that  we want to become exclusive and we have our date and a really good time  then part ways, we both delete the Bumble app we are on. I didn't  delete my tinder app because I didn't think about it, I forgot about it,  since I barely used it. I also never told her about my past because I  was too insecure about it and I thought that once I told her she was  110% going to end it because she has kids and is usually talking about  being a strong woman.

The  following Tuesday I get a message on Tinder and I thought to myself""Shit  forgot about that"" but decided to read the message because of my  insecurities(that I could have a backup when my date does break it up  after I tell her about my inexperience). I messaged the girl for 3 days  and ended it . We messaged each other about our jobs, she said I was  cute and I said she was too to keep the convo going. We just joked back  and forth and that was it. I told her nothing personal and didn't want  to. I stopped messaging her the Friday when I went on a date with Amanda  (I met her friends on the date which is a very big deal. She told me  that she barely ever lets anyone in as quickly or this much). The next  day Saturday, I didn't message the Tinder girl . On Sunday I told the  Tinder girl that I was not interested and didn't text her anymore. Now  we were using a texting app so I forgot about the Tinder app again and  was being lazy about deleting it when I saw the ""swipe party  notification""(I know,really dumb). The following week Amanda saw the  tinder notification on my phone a second time(she saw it another time a  week before or something) and justifiably freaked out. I let her look at  the app and she saw that we exchanged numbers and snap chat.She said  that shes going to put her guard up but we will continue dating.

That  Friday she came over to my place and I told her why I had made contact  with the tinder girl and about my inexperience.I also told her about my  past and a more in depth explanation of my anxiety and anxiety in  general. She seemed fine about it, she said she felt sympathetic for my  situation and makes sense but will end it if she finds out I'm cheating,  I said that's totally understandable.That Saturday we went on a date  and she seemed mad(later found out she was hangry, she was very happy  after eating). So we are talking and she starts asking me about my  friends. I didn't mention my female friends because I thought that it  would have caused a big issue since the tinder incident was just a few  days ago and she seemed angry. The rest of the night was really good.

The  following week had two separate events. I will start with the second.  On that Saturday she asked me what I'm going to be doing that night and  then I thought to myself ""Shit I never told her about (lets call her  Suzy)"" I took a big breath and decided it would be best to tell the  truth. So I text her back and tell her that I'm going to be hanging out  with Suzy that night. She calls me and this is the convo:

I  was trying to stay calm but she talked to me in an abrupt, headstrong  way where she barely listened to what I said and flipped it.

Her:""So you're now just telling me about her, right before you're about to see her, and it's just going to be you two?""

Me""Yes, I didn't want to lie, I wanted to be transparent. I can stay home and won't see her.""

Her:""Why didn't you tell me before?""

Me:""I thought it would be better to bring it up later because of what happened""

Her:"" No, you should have mentioned it sooner""

Her"" How long have you two known each other?""

Me: ""About 5-7 years, I just got back in contact with her in January after not contacting one another for around 3-4 years""

Her:""How many times a day do you text her?""

Me:""Some weeks it's everyday, some weeks it's every 2 to 3 days""

Her"" That's not a friend""

Me:"" What do you mean? Just because we text a lot doesn't mean we are anything beyond friends""

Her:"" I don't hang out with my male friends alone""

Me:"" I wouldn't have a problem with you hanging out with you male friends""

Her:""Why, why is that?!""

Me:""I don't think it would be healthy for me, to constantly pay attention to what you're doing""

Her:"" Why is that? It wouldn't be good for me to pay attention to what you're doing?!""

Me: ""I said it wouldn't be good for me, me! You can pay attention to what I'm doing if you want!""

Her:""So  I thought that I saw Suzy's name on a text that you were sending on the  first date. I was waiting for you to tell me about her""(She was heading  back to the table from the bathroom, so I decided to check my texts.  She has done the same, texting when I'm away.  It was actually one of my  male friends when I checked back. Before checking I gave her the  benefit of the doubt and believed her)(one thing that struck me was that  she was holding onto this thought of a girl I was in contact with and  had been waiting for me to say something since the first date)

Me:"" Ok, I was just responding""

Her:"" Why when we were on a date?""

Me:""Because I don't like making people wait""

Her:""Well, there were times when it took you a long time for you to reply to me""

Me:""I'm not looking at my phone all the time, I don't reply to everyone right away""

She hangs up and I call her back

Her:""Mike, I need a break!!""

Me:""Fine, no more, you make me anxious, no more"" Whenever someone argues with my in a very aggressive tone, it makes me anxious.

I hang up

The previous day,Friday, she asked me if I could bring her to pick up the car she bought, I said yes.

The time passes and it's cutting into our dating time. I'm wondering if we are still picking up her car. So here is the texts:

Me:"" Do you have an estimated time of when you will be ready? i have to do a few things but they're not absolutely necessary""

Her:"" I'm done at the dealership. I just need to get ready. I should be ready by 6""

Me:""ok,  you asked me to take you to get your car. Do they need to prepare it or  something for a day and then you come back to pick it up?When would you  need me to take you?

Her:""Oh I'm sorry. it's ready, I was hoping we could pick it up tonight. I know it's cutting into our dating time""""

Me:""That's fine, i was just wondering""

Her:"" Are you sure that's ok? i can work something else out tomorrow""

Me:"" I't ok, I still get to see you, it's no big deal. It would be different if this happened a lot.""

Her:"" No I feel really bad. This is already later than I planned. I will figure out another ride tomorrow""

Me:""It's ok, seriously""

Her:""I can't tell your tone in text. I think i would feel better figuring something out tomorrow.""

Her:"" I'll be leaving in 20 min""

Me:""  Ok, should I It would be different if this happened a lot call you? I  was figuring it was the text that was making you feel bad. Maybe we  should call each other more""(We text a lot, so the tone is lost in  texting)

Me:""Ok, it's up to you""

Me:"" I actually wanted to bring you because I wanted to show you that I want to help you out and do things for you""

She calls and this is the convo:

Me:""Hey Amanda,whats up!""

Her:""  Why did you say that it would be a problem if this happened more,  that's fucked up?!""(She had a shaky, angry tone right away)

Me:"".....I  was saying that if there were a lot of errands that cut into our dating  time, then it would be a problem. I was reassuring you that it's ok,  since it doesn't happen all the time.""

Her:""What? That's just fucked up that you would say that, how would I know it has to do with errands""

Me:""I want to come over there and bring you to pick up your car, seriously,ok Amanda?""

Her:"" If you cared you would have been here before 6""

Me:"" You said you should be ready by 6, so you weren't sure. I want sure if I would be waiting a while""

Me:""Let me come over, we will talk about this""

Her:""I don't know, Ill just come over there""

ME:""I want to bring you to get your car:""

Her:""I don't know, now I feel weird about it!""

Me:""I'm coming over, ok, Ill be leaving soon"" (It was 6 when we were done chatting)

Later  when I picked her up, she said that she doesn't ask men for help and  reiterating the  ""It would be different if this happened a lot"" text "".  We talked about it and we were fine.

So the next day Saturday, the Suzy incident happened and we ended it.

I  just felt at times that she didn't want to talk about things, that she  was looking for things to convince her that I was cheating. Once I  mentioned something that could be used , she latched onto it and didn't  let go. She barely let me explain myself. The two conversations that  resulted from problems always felt rushed and I was left wondering what  just happened. She said I was leading her on but I felt like after the  tinder incident she already knew she was going to end it, it was just a  matter of time, which was short. It just left me dazed and sad.

Now  I'm not trying to play the victim here, I fucked up, definitely with he  tinder situation. I'm just venting. I know I'm a good guy, I just let  my insecurities and anxiety take hold and the fucked up situations  brought out the worst in her.

Wendsday I was concerned because I overthink and have small anxiety problems and that‚Äôs a reason why my last relationship didn‚Äôt end the way I wanted it to. So all wendsday I was going through mixed emotions and my friends and parents were concerned about me because I was just down. So after ranting about my shortcomings and how I‚Äôm not attractive I looked into the mirror and started talking to myself.

I was saying that I‚Äôm worth it and if someone doesn‚Äôt like me that‚Äôs alright. I told myself that I come a long way from, fearing talking to anyone to talking to someone you find attractive with no regrets. 

After that I gained my confidence back and texted saying I find her attractive and I want to take her out-sometime and how being ghosted didn‚Äôt feel good at all. After I sent it I went to sleep 

The radio silence went until today when I got a text back. This is what she said:

Hey! and that‚Äôs sweet as hell &amp; im sorry for ghosting but that‚Äôs the main reason why i‚Äôd have to say no &amp; im sorry, i just don‚Äôt do well with stuff like that &amp; i tend to disappear half the time, you are really cool tho &amp; fun to talk too but i just know i‚Äôm not at the right place rn to accept anything like that currently

Basically, I figured out what I was and was not comfortable with before diving back into the dating scene. This can be like how long you want to wait until you‚Äôre exclusive, how long you want to wait until getting physically intimate with someone, what parts of yourself do you want to share with someone immediately and what parts of yourself do you think you want to share once you get to know them better, etc. 

I like setting these boundaries BEFORE going on dates with someone just because I know my head / mind can get clouded if I like someone. I no longer think as rationally and will bend my boundaries for someone else. 

I like keeping note of what my boundaries are in a notes section on my phone. This way I don‚Äôt get swayed or convince myself to break a boundary for someone else.

Been outta the dating game for a while (I'm 28 now) and wanna give it one last shot to see if I can find anyone I'm compatible with.

80,nrrhsa,1622764175,Should I ask this girl out?,So I'm a 22 year old male about 2 weeks ago I started snap chatting a 20 year old girl that I use to work with. We never really talked before when we worked together but since we started snap chatting we have been talking everyday about a lot of different things with in depth conversations and we have a lot in common and alot of times she'll be the one to start the conversation or ask me questions which leads me to believe she is interested. What makes me unsure is that I stopped by my old job where she still works a couple days ago and we didn't say anything to each other but she snap chatted me asking me about it later that night so she knew I was there. Another thing that makes me unsure is that we only Snapchat about 5-10 times a day Bc she doesn't get on Snapchat a lot but when she does get on she talks to me. And the last thing that I am unsure about is one of her good friends does not like me very much for a reason I don't know so idk if her friend knows we've kinda been talking or not but I'm worried she may get in the way even if this girl does like me. I also should add that she's friends with my little brother and friends with a few of my other friends so if I just go for it and get rejected I'm probably gonna get some shit for it Bc she's definitely out my leagueüòÇSo I don't know if I should just let it keep going how it is now or if I should ask for her number so we could text or if I should just go all the way and ask her out or just not attempt anything if she's not interested I'm just lost with it.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrrhsa/should_i_ask_this_girl_out/

85,nrrzvn,1622765704,"To everybody who has had a guy say ""he's not ready for a relationship/needs to take it slow""","When we first met, for me, it was just about sex. I thought I'd met this hot, kinky new sex friend, that I enjoyed hanging out with, but he'd just got out of a long term relationship, felt still kinda of enmeshed with his ex, so I assumed he wasn't looking for anything. And for that reason, I kept our interactions strictly homebased, in the beginning, aside from the first night we met at a bar in a nearby suburb after matching on a dating app. No dates, no dinners out, meeting at each others houses, ordering food in, eating it naked before, during, after sex. Sleepovers being the rarity, not expected, but nice to have somebody to spoon with if it happened.

One night, 6 weeks or so after we met, he wanted us to go to a sex shop, so we jumped in a taxi to buy a few toys to play with. He said to me ""do you know this is the first time we've been out in public together since the night we met?"", saying he wanted to do this more with me. I responded with, ""what, so you want to go on dates with me?"", him saying ""hell yes, let's go on a date"". Me, feeling surprised but more than happy to give it a go, to start exploring the world with him. So, date we did. The frequency of our dates/hangings out went from once a week to two, three, four, date nights on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, entire weekends at his place with him and his dog. Going out, curled up hungover in bed, on the sofa, going food shopping together, going to Ikea, walking through the streets holding hands, or with our arms wrapped around each other. We went to gigs, pubs, bowling, bars, restaurants, I met a load of his friends. He'd be out with a friend or a few, and he'd message me asking me to meet him, or else he'd be having a house party and he'd ask me to join.¬†

One night, about two months after we met, we went out for dinner, us holding hands across the table, him saying to me that he really liked me, really enjoyed spending time with me, that I made him happy, he found me really easy to talk to. Us grinning stupidly at each other across the table, flickering candle under our gaze. He said he hadn't met any of my friends yet, I asked him if he did and he said yes. I remember going to the bathroom, looking at myself in the mirror and putting my hand over my mouth to conceal my huge and unwilling smile, thinking to myself ""wow, could this be something? Is this something?""

Around this time, he disclosed to me that he'd been struggling with depression and anxiety. As somebody that has dealt with bouts of both before, I knew how hard they are to get a handle on. One morning, we woke up and I felt him shaking with anxiety, his eyes were scrunched up in pain. I remembered reading about anxiety blankets and how feeling contained can help, I said that to him and asked if he wanted me to hold him, and he nodded. I wrapped my long body around his, pulling him close and hard in to me, and we lay like that for hours until his anxiety passed. I spent 6 weeks supporting him through this, spending mornings, afternoons and evenings wrapped around him, talking to him, being there for him, as he tried to pull himself out of the huge mental health challenges he was going through, seeing him basically daily.

Then, he started to feel better. We'd been dating for about three months at this point and we went to one of our go to bars after dinner, and he blurted out that he really liked me but he had to take this slow, was still processing the break up with his ex. Me, only 15 or so months out of a 12 year relationship, and I was happy to take it slow. Him saying how rare it was to find somebody you connected with, felt attracted to, had similar sexual appetites, and from my year of dating I knew that it was rare, and I wanted to keep on seeing him. We spoke about it again a few weeks later, with me delving a bit deeper in to his comments, asking him if he was in this with the view of getting in to a relationship at some point, assuming him to say yes. But, he didn't. Instead, he said that he didn't know, again reiterating that him and his ex had a toxic relationship that he was working through with a therapist, it had fucked him up, was still fucking him up.

He told me that he really loves hanging out with me, and getting to know me, telling me that I was sexy, clever and compassionate, and that I'd become one of his best friends over the last few months.  I asked him if he saw me as a friend or if he was sexually attracted to me, to which he said clearly he's attracted to me. He said that he'd written in his journal that morning how happy he was that he met me, that he was so grateful for me coming in to his life. He told me he wasn't dating or having sex with anybody else, but, knowing what a sexual person I was (and given his anti depressants were making having penetrative sex a bit difficult, at times), he wouldn't mind if I was having sex with other people. I responded with that I wasn't dating anybody else either, that I really liked him and I enjoyed hanging out with him.

He then said that he needed a bit more time on his own, and a bit of space, to which I fully accepted and understood, given that over the last few weeks we'd seen each other basically every day. I certainly didn't want him to become co-dependant with me, needing to see me every day, as I have a life, have friends, have a demanding job, and that I'd been a bit slack with all of the above over the last few weeks of falling into this comfortable bubble.

But, then his text messages started to pull back, as did his invitations to hang out, going from seeing each other 4 nights a week to 1. We went from texting each other every few hours every day, to one message a day, to sometimes no messages. The next time we caught up I asked him if by space he wanted space from my texts. He told me to stop overthinking, and told me that he still wanted to see me, and that if I wanted to text him, I should text him. He said that he didn't believe in God, but he felt like somebody had literally sent me to him, at a time he didn't really feel like he had anybody. 

Look, I'm usually somebody who is secure in their relationships. I've done the whole secure/active/avoidance test and the reading, and I'm pretty solidly secure. But what I didn't realise is that your behaviour can change if your needs aren't being met. Secure people can start exhibiting anxious or avoidant behaviours if they're not getting what they need from a relationship, and I had a few days where I was crippled with terrifying, gut wrenching relationship anxiety because our status quo of seeing each other so much, of communicating so much shifted so rapidly, over the course of 10 days, with little or no warning. 

I took the weekend to process what I was feeling, read a few books about relationship anxiety and realised then came to terms with the fact that the rapid shift in behaviour was spawning this reaction inside of me. By this point, we'd been dating for 4 months or so, so a fair chunk of time, and I didn't know what the right thing to do was. But I knew I needed an answer.

I text him and asked if he fancied doing something during the week, and we locked in a date. We went out for dinner, and he started saying how grateful he was that he met me, how I was there for him when nobody else was, that he was thankful every day that I came in to life. But then told me that this was all this was ever going to be, that he was in no way, shape or form ready to be in a relationship, that he wanted to date, play the field, that he'd been on a few dates recently but it felt like he was cheating on me. Said he didn't want to string me along, he still had feelings for his ex, they were still talking a lot, although he didn't want to get back with her. Said that I should date, that he wasn't ready to be in a relationship. I asked him if this was a goodbye dinner, and he said no, he said he still wanted me in his life. He said this had been weighing on him, because he didn't want to lose me from his life. Said he still wanted to be friends, said he'd like to keep having sex with me if I was down.

We kept drinking, kept chatting about more of the same, I went back to his and we had sex, I slept over and we spooned each other all night. I woke up at some point, went to the bathroom, sat and cried for a minute, wiped my tears and got back in to his bed. Went home early this morning to get ready for work. And then, the anger and the hurt and the upset starts to build. Vacillating between crying and anger, because FUCK does it feel like I've been used. Used as an emotional crutch during a time he was talking about being suicidal, shaking with anxiety, talking about how depressed he was. And, now he's feeling back to normal, he's bailed, he wants to be single, date, play the field, do his own thing, to not be in a relationship with me.

I'm still processing, feel lighter for knowing while simultaneously feeling hurt and used and upset. And I'm posting this because Reddit has been such a source of information for me while I've been grappling with what to do, what other people have done, people's advice, people's stories. And so, I wanted to post mine as a warning, as a cautionary tale, should anybody else need to read this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrrzvn/to_everybody_who_has_had_a_guy_say_hes_not_ready/
86,nrs0i2,1622765754,"He confessed he likes me, then started acting weird and now he‚Äôs saying it was never serious (22F and 23M)","So my CLOSE FRIEND of 2 years (bear in mind this guy knows sooo much about me including the times people have hurt me or lead me on) confessed about 2 months ago that he likes me. He kept calling me his love and saying he wants to spend his forever with me. At first, I did not take him seriously at all and kept brushing it off and friendzoning because I thought he was joking. We ended up speaking all day everyday for maybe a week but I stopped for a few days because he was coming on too strong. I thought it was a phase too so I left it. Somehow, we started speaking again and he had calmed down a lot with the tone so I started enjoying our conversations. We met once during this and things were great with the anticipation of maybe a relationship hanging in the air.

Fast forward to the last week. Our finals start and naturally we're both stressed but we still speak a lot, mainly me helping him out with assignment plans. But all of a sudden, he wasn't saying anything about liking me anymore, he'd gone cold on me but kept the topic to finals only if we spoke. Like I would have to purposefully bring up a topic other than this to keep the conversation going. At this point like a week ago, I caught feels in return and wanted to communicate this to him so we can maybe move forward. But everytime I would tell him something obvious to let him know I do like him, he would shut it down with stupid comments like saying he's actually gay or he has a girlfriend (lies).

Today I called him to ask whether any of this is serious and I was going to say I liked him. He kept mumbling and saying it was all not serius and he ""speaks like this with everyone."" So I asked him about the 3 hour phone calls and he asked me if I don't do that with my girl friends. I said well, no we dont talk til 5am the way you spoke with me. He didn't know what to say and kept insisting that none of it was real feelings. I know he's partly lying because you don't make that much effort to come off strong when you're simply leading someone on because he risked embarrassing himself. I feel so hurt right now because he was one of my closest friends and he knew someone had lead me on just a few months ago but not as bad as this. What shall I do?

EDIT: I told this guy I needed time to think and he still carried on coming on strong with me. I didn‚Äôt ghost him, I simply toned down how much I texted him for a couple of days to see whether he‚Äôd persist or he‚Äôs simply going through a boredom phase. He‚Äôs basically making me feel like I‚Äôm crazy for thinking he ever liked me. 

TLDR: he claimed none of his feelings were real and it was all just 'waffle'",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrs0i2/he_confessed_he_likes_me_then_started_acting/

But we actually haven‚Äôt hung out an awful lot, we would just usually bump into each other on nights out quite often when we were younger but would speak most days. A few times after we had been out, it was pretty apparent that we were both attracted to each other, but we were both in relationships so nothing ever happened. But we‚Äôre talking like 4 years ago. 

I‚Äôve been single for 2 years and him less so but we‚Äôve kept in contact all this time and we‚Äôve hung out a few times since. A while ago he text me asking if I wanted to get to know him more and I was confused as I‚Äôve known him for years I know everything about him. He then said he meant in a way that was more than friends, I then sort of cringed at the fact I didn‚Äôt pick that up. 

I agreed as I thought well what‚Äôs the worst that could happen, we never really made a date for anything but he‚Äôs been asking me a lot recently. I think I‚Äôve been putting it off for a while because last year I got involved with someone who was also a friend and it ended in the worst way possible and it would be a shame if this didn‚Äôt work out and we stopped talking completely.

So we‚Äôve agreed to go on a date next week, but because I know it‚Äôs a date and not as friends, I‚Äôm feeling a little strange about it because I‚Äôm not even sure if I see him in that way anymore but I won‚Äôt know unless I go. We have had the conversation that if nothing happens we will still be friends.

Do I kiss him at the end? Will it be awkward? What if I don‚Äôt feel anything?

My last girlfriend had 17 unread Instagram dms. You‚Äôre lying to yourself if you‚Äôre a man and you don‚Äôt think this a problem. If you‚Äôre women and you honestly believe this isn‚Äôt a real thing. Let me ask you something. Think back to the start every relationship you‚Äôve ever had and be honest with your self was it you who started most of the relationships you‚Äôve been in or did most of those relationships start with him coming to you and asking for your number? Who asked who out? Could you honestly say that is was you who who asked him out the majority of the time? Or was it the other way around? Let‚Äôs be honest 90% of you would be lying if you were to say it wasn‚Äôt the man. Multiple women have even admitted to me that the refuse to make the first move or even make the the approach. This is a FEMALE problem not a MANS problem. If you don‚Äôt believe anything I said look up the CEO of bumble and watch her interviews. My point is this bumble literally made a multi-million dollar app based off of the sole idea of forcing the woman to make the approach and women still don‚Äôt get the message and some of you have the audacity to tell us to approach you!?!? It‚Äôs not us that‚Äôs the problem it‚Äôs you. Man up and get over it. None of us have empathy for you and it‚Äôs fucked up for you to expect us to.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrtupx/i_just_wanted_to_make_this_clear_as_a_response_to/

I was kind of a loser in high school but I ended up being successful as an adult in my early 20‚Äôs. Two homes. A house in Florida and an apartment in downtown Chicago. 

But I don‚Äôt go out much so I don‚Äôt meet women that often like I did at my old job. I‚Äôm not sure how to approach women. 

I figure taking girls in college out to expensive restaurants and buying them expensive gifts was a good strategy because they‚Äôre not used to established men doing stuff like that for them at 18 or 19. 

I‚Äôm good at sliding in women‚Äôs DM but I‚Äôm not sure how to approach random women that I think are cute. 

I don‚Äôt want to look like a jerk by wearing an expensive logo on t shirt. That‚Äôs kind of tacky. 
Because I was a loser when I was younger, I‚Äôm not sure how to meet women. 

I don‚Äôt even have friends who go out or are even able to because they actually bust their ass for a living. 

I think I‚Äôd have a shot with a pretty girl if she knew what I could offer",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nru2g0/women_what_makes_you_want_to_date_a_guy_what/

Alright so I had a bit of hot and cold with this girl over the summer, we were totally into each other then out. She said she didn't ""feel it"". We live quite far apart, 6 hours, different countries. So we stopped comms. I was really heartbroken cuz I started really liking her, so I had to heal a lot. Been like 10 months. I'm good now.

But being the curious person that I am, I noticed a trend in her Instagram behavior. Whenever I post a story, post, anything, she is always liking it, viewing it, within like 5 mins. EVERYTIME. 
And on top of that, she hasn't posted anything in the 10 months. Before, she used to post about twice a month, not super active but would post. Now nothing ü§®ü§î

What do u guys think about this? Does she still have feelings for me? Is she trying to send me some kind of ""hey I'm still not over u? Or am I just being too Sherlock Holmes here?... Lol, women always tell us guys that we fail to read in between the lines üòÖ.

Short: Girl Liking my posts, stories within 5mins everytime for 10 months, does this mean anything? Does she have like notifications for my activity? Why?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nru83l/girl_liking_all_my_posts_as_soon_as_i_post/
