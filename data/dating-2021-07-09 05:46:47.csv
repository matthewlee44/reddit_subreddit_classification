10,ogux1q,1625835134,HELP!!! SHOULD I GO OVER THERE FUCKK HIM ONE LAST TIME THEN CALL IT QUITS? NEED INSIGHT! Is this sex or love? What is this?,"Hi everyone. I used to have reddit (not sure i posted anything in the past) then forgot how it even works but here i am again looking for just some place i can TELL IT ALL without fear of judgement of so called friends!!! Like i am soooo over friends advice at this point!!! Anyway excuse me coz i will pour it all out here, TMIs, detail to detail, judge away if u want, u are a stranger anyway so judge all u want, i don't care but i desperately need perspective!

WARNING: My life is like a movie. To any doubting Thomases my name is Elizabeth Irungu Sweetie on I.G so u can be sure this is not some teenage boy typing away lies! This is my own true life experiences!

So anyhu i am a 31 year old married woman. An African, a black Kenyan who married a 44 year old white Austrian Financier. 

We met 5 years ago while he was on holiday in my country Kenya. We travelled the world together and basically fucked in every city we landed (Zanzibar,Cairo,Mombasa,Dubai,Jakuzyce-Poland,Berlin,Prague,Milan,Zurich,Vienna, Venice)......

U name it, we probably fucked there too! Lol! Travelled over 15 cities in only 3 months!!! Best time of my life to be honest! We weren't really ""in love""...just excited and good company/ good vibes.

We settled down after like a year. Got married but we (my husband and i) then had some problems because he was/is always working/travelling etc. and we grew apart in the process. Also he isn't keen on having kids. He is dragging his feet about it because he was already married in the past to his highschool sweetheart, some hot Austrian blonde (now 41) and has 2 kids with her, he divorced her and was made to pay alot of Euros in child support so he is careful with women these days and i want kids like NOW! 

She did not treat him very kindly that lady so he is veryyyy careful which has proven to be a trust challenge between us! He just doesn't give himself easily especially emotionally and doesn't trust people! It has been hard dealing with him. BUT HE IS A GOOD PERSON AND A VERY GOOD PROVIDER.

Anyway at some point we decided to separate and i took an apartment away from the main residence where he remained with a Jamaican girlfriend (26) though he never cheated on me, they met after i left, he told me she moved in just so i know and just so i don't hear it from other people. Which was nice of him 

(we can't divorce because of property dispute and my being a foreigner complicated things even further) he is a good person though. A very good person at heart, he still saw to it that i was okay at my new place (that was around 2018)...very hard working guy &amp; smart too and after months of living apart, we got back together and are now trying to make it work. He is not a bad person and i am also a good person. And so we don't fight plus to be honest, we are used to one another by now. Like family. U don't just break up with ur brother or sister.

So anyway during our separation i met this German Rasta guy also white!!! (Abit older than my husband. He is 47 going on 48 now. He looks exactly like Johhny Depp in that Pirates movie) I don't know what it was about him 🤔 Coz to be honest, he is soooo NOT MY TYPE! He is the complete opposite of my husband (who is my type) 

The rasta guy looks homeless!

My husband is what i like in men corporate suits, high intelligence, clean cut hair, well fitting trousers, good manners, well read, sober minded and with a steady career!!! The rasta guy lives in his car like a hippie, has been jobless since forever, smokes a blunt anywhere he feels like, he doesn't fear anything, he is a REBEL covered in tatoos, seldom changes his clothes, has no plans, gets government support or sometimes works then quits, then works then quits again, sometimes draws (he is very talented by the way. Alot of people believe in his talent but he just doesn't care. He disappoints them everytime! He hates routine and lives how he wants) draws and sells his pieces upto 500 euros a picture and with that money we drank and partied all over Europe (especially Italy) like two crazy people. He wouldn't listen to me to open up an art studio and take his talent seriously. He'd rather drink!

Underneath that big bushy beard, he has the cutest face you will EVER see. Green eyes like the ocean and his penis is like paradise, ice cream and sunshine mixed together. I just love his dic to be honest. We just had great sex together! We did things i can't dare do with my husband coz he will think i am mentally ill. From sex in moving elevators, to bondage, to very rough sex, to sex on rooftops with half our bodies almost falling off the damn building, to sex in reggae clubs in Germany, to even sex with a priest 🤦🏽‍♀️ on an actual altar ""holy fuck"" (pan intended)... i mean we are definitely going to hell, that's for sure!!!

We had so much fun together, then he dumped me!!! 

He emotionally abused me, verbally insulted me, CHEATED told me to go back to my big shot banker, MADE ME FEEL INADEQUATE, Made me such a pathetic desperate little person, needy for his attention, a pathetic little girl who even once asked him if he would love me had i been white 🤦🏽‍♀️ he reduced me to that question! ""Baby would u love me if i were maybe white?"".....It was that sad! 

I legit feel sorry for myself during that period, locked me out of my own apartment and just soooooo much shit!!! Soooo much shit that ended in violence and my husband bailing me out of the cop station. 

Now that i am back at home with my husband, safe and dry and the Jamaican left, i do not know why i cannot stop thinking of that crazy rasta!!! What the fuck is this even??? 

Who do i love and why?

He is now texting and i do not trust myself not to go to him!!! I have blocked him but i do not trust myself coz i know his number off-head! He is still texting. I am screwed coz i don't know what to do! I am on vacay alone in Vienna right now but since he texted, this shit is driving me crazy!!! 

Nothing is wrong at home but hmmmmm.....i need answers! I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND!!!! CAN SOMEONE OUT THERE MAKE ME UNDERSTAND! 

Like i need answers and insight like right now. Please do not recommend therapy, i won't go!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogux1q/help_should_i_go_over_there_fuckk_him_one_last/

13,ogva3y,1625836384,I wonder how many men are out there that reddit talked into giving up on dating and just staying single forever,"It’s probably basically a factor pumping them out one after another. Transforming one hopeless romantic after another into a man that has better shit to focus on where his efforts are actually appreciated. The more an average man actually wants a girlfriend, actually cares enough to put in a real effort and get emotionally invested in it (that’s what happens when you care about something), that is actually trying to be the kind of guy he would want if he was a girl. The more he tries to do that, the more he gets burnt by it here. People aren’t friendly to guys that actually care on here.

So we give them reason after reason after reason to stop caring. To realize that they are mistaken, they don’t even want this. It’s just a big fucking lie. There’s no getting what you want because what you want was never real in the first place.

So they start to focus on what is real. What they are good at. They start only caring about those things. And they stop believing in fairy tales. Their expectations change. If they can’t even find anyone to empathize with them a little bit when times are tough, what are their odds of finding someone that wants to share their life with them intimately? They grow up. And realize that no one gives a shit about them. Really. And start living accordingly.

In my area everyone knows everyone so word spreads around quickly and it makes me not want to ask anyone out to save myself risking embarrassment.

One girl I met a few years ago seemed interested in me as a person and I liked her as well. I didn't say anything because I felt like my friend group would clown me for it if it didn't go as planned. Then she told me about how she was hooking up with randoms on Tinder which shattered me on the inside. It hurt to see myself get walked over like that, all because of being forced to suppress my feelings for her.

I did get lucky one time and had a thing for a few months with someone I knew for a while and got my first kiss so far. Feels like I'm missing out though, I'm still a virgin because I didn't have a private place at the time. I don't know if I'm looking for something long term right now but it would be nice to experience sex at least once.

Now I'm just a bit lost. I've gotten a high paying internship recently so career wise I'm doing great &amp; wanted to try relationships but before that everyone always told me to not get into one and focus on myself.

How do I stop letting myself get walked over all the time and being seen as only a friend?

17,ogvgwd,1625837013,Self sabotaged potentially a good thing today,"I’d [29M] been working on myself for quite some time and have been in a really good headspace for a while. But today I threw that good work out the window.

Met a girl at a festival and we immediately clicked and ended up spending a couple of days together there. She messaged me after the festival and we then exchanged some texts over the next couple of weeks. I then drove, last weekend, to her city to see her for a couple of dates.

When we were saying our goodbyes, I told her she should come visit me down the coast sometime. She said that she’s too busy with work to do something like that until September. I misinterpreted this to mean that she was saying she was too busy to hang out at all (and only just figured out from a friend that I probably misunderstood this). She’d also mentioned she wanted to do some hikes near where I lived, so I suggested we do them together after September. But she shot that down really quickly saying she likes to hike solo.

5 days later. She had messaged me once but then hadn’t responded in four days. So I sent her a message calling it off and self sabotaging. Basically said, like an idiot, that I get strong vibes she’s not interested and that we have incompatible communication styles. She responded and thanked me for my openness and agreed that she was a terrible texter.

The thing is, her terrible texting is actually something I liked. I hate texting too. I was more off put because I thought she was saying she didn’t want to hang out for a couple of months. But now she thinks I called things off because of her texting habits.

I’ve been completely torn apart and berated by two different men one after the other. 

Apparently I just attract those people. 
The ones who make up their own situations in their heads. That accuse you of doing something or feeling a certain way but won’t even listen or have an adult conversation. 

I’m so tired of being gaslit and torn down because I can’t give someone what they want. Or because I don’t feel the same way. 

I’m always incredibly upfront and honest. If I suddenly feel like I don’t think something will work out romantically I tell them. And yet it always comes back to it being MY fault. 

Im told i’m an asshole, that I led them on, wasn’t honest, made them feel like garbage. 
I can’t even stand up for myself. Can’t share my own emotions because it’s my fault. 
So I sit there and take it. I apologize and take accountability for anything I said or did to hurt them. I take the blame and just sit there so that it’ll be over sooner. 

But that’s never enough. They don’t like that. They don’t like me being placid. They want an argument, they want to see me hurt. But I’m exhausted and just don’t care. 

I’m at the point where I literally scared to go out and meet new people. I’m tired of the abuse. 

And yes I recognize this could all be my fault. And sometimes I think it is. I’m not trying to play saint or say it’s everyone but me. I know I have issues.

21,ogw72d,1625839337,Tinder 101; a Useful Guide :),"Here are a few tips anyone can find useful:


-Avoid having 100 conversations, you’ll loose track of most of them. Try having a few and when a conversation dies, open a new one and so on 

-Meet at a public spot first, if you don’t click or get bored, it’s easier to get out of there

-Be clear and be honest about your true intentions to avoid misunderstandings 

-Totally okay to ask the other person about their intentions as well 

-If you want to meet someone in person, avoid waiting many days or weeks before meeting them. Waiting too long can create false expectations. 

-Always notify a friend where you’re going and who you’re going to meet with

-Use real and recent pictures, you’d expect the other person to do the same

-If your intention is to meet people in real life, make sure they’re from around your area. It’s highly unlikely you’ll travel long distances to meet a stranger. 

-If the conversation flows, ask for their social media profiles (IG/twitter) to get a little more information on this person. You’ll be surprised and maybe have friends in common plus, you’ll get to see more pictures of them :)

I work out a lot and have a nice body which people say is hot but guys don’t like my face. And I barely get any replies back on apps like Grindr. Being black and not conventionally attractive is one of the worst set backs in life. I don’t blame attractive people, congrats to them for winning the genetic lottery. But I have no worth or value if im not attractive. Value to myself and other people. I didn’t ask to be here, I didn’t ask to be born, so I don’t understand what’s wrong with wanting to kill myself because I know things aren’t going to get better. No guys my age wants me now and everything I have with guys never works out. I don’t feel like I’m attractive enough to have a partner. It’s probably going to be the same as I get older. I’ll graduate school before ever being in a relationship. If this is what my life is going to be then I just don’t see what’s the point of continuing to live. Yeah lots of people care about me, but so what. I don’t care about myself, I don’t have value because I’m not attractive like these conventionally attractive white guys on tiktok are.

She broke up with me at about the worst time she could have possibly done it. There was some drama at work that was bringing me down and making me sad/depressed. I was thinking about moving jobs. My Grandmother died after a long battle with cancer. My family was fractured. I was already struggling, and she knew that. But she still chose to break up with me in the midst of all those things. 

The worst part is that I still love and care about her. I find myself trying to find ways to win her back, or ways that I can ease *her* pain. I'm the one who is hurting to the point of agony, and she's the one who decided to leave. 

I know that there's never a good time to break up with someone. I've broken up with people before. But there is definitely a bad time, and she chose it. I should hate her for what's she's done to me. Part of me wants to. But I don't. I hate myself. And she did this to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogxpiy/my_ex_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_at_a_really/
31,ogxqf7,1625843904,comparing current bf/gf to ex (or vice versa),"I dont really have much experience in relationships, so this didnt really seem like a big deal, but apparently it was to my 'ex'.  And I'm wondering if he was just overreacting, like I thought, or if it was apparently as 'hurtful' as he claimed...

so he was pretty sensitive about money (he has none), and this guy that I talked to before him...(never even met or dated the guy, but apparently, he might as well be an ex to him)...so anyway, I said ""at least \_\_\_\_ bought me a pizza"".  and apparently he was so offended by this, that he had to take a few days to himself to ""process"" and then come back to tell me how ""hurt"" he was, bc I ""compared him to \_\_\_\_\_"" and ""made him feel like he wasnt enough"".  that was kind of the last straw for me, as I felt he was being oversensitive, and whenever I had an issue (like him seeming into his hot girl friends, simping over OF girls, then claiming theyre just friends and it doesnt mean anything, ignoring my FB and claiming he just didnt see my posts, while he can see all his 'hot' girl friends posts that he simps over and then says theyre just friends) he would try to make it seem like it wasnt a big deal, even using the laughing emoji's, and say ""what!? whats wrong w/that!?!? insert couple laughing emojis here), like seeming like he didnt take it seriously, or try to excuse/justify it, but whenever HE had an issue, it was all seriousness so he made sure I knew what I did and didnt do it again, no laughing emoji's, etc...he wanted to make sure I ""didnt hurt him w/that again"" so at that point, like I said bc he didnt seem to care about whatever issue I had w/him, or ever think he did anything wrong, but when HE did, he expected me to apologize and never do it again...I was just fed up, and refused to apologize, so finally he was like ""fine, we're better off friends"" and I was like yep, sounds good. LOL.

then later, he couldnt wait to tell me all about his new date(s), how much ""better"" and amazing they are, and not like me, etc...then I wondered, if he somehow thought that was fair, bc he says I compared him to \_\_\_\_, and ""made him feel like he wasn't enough"".

I mean, I didnt think so...it was one comment, partly joking...and again, its just money...it can always be made, and it IS pretty standard for guys to spend money on their dates/gf's...it was an online LDR,  though, so of course no meeting...but that doesnt mean uone cant still spend money on their bf/gf.  (I never met the guy that bought me the pizza, either lol).  and its not like I compared him to other guys I've dated like ""yeah, he was so tall and experienced..."" at least money is something that can always be made.  its not like I compared him to tall guys, since that would be rude since he couldnt do anything about that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogxqf7/comparing_current_bfgf_to_ex_or_vice_versa/
32,ogxrml,1625844003,Is it possible to date while being an extremely flawed person?,"So the general advice for dating when you don’t have much luck is to turn inward and improve yourself (with wealth, body, etc.). But is it even possible to find dates while trying to fix that or in the event that the flaws can’t be overcome?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogxrml/is_it_possible_to_date_while_being_an_extremely/
33,ogxwqs,1625844428,"Why ""Results Based Analysis"" is Inappropriate for Dating","One of the most common misconceptions I see on this sub is that getting an undesirable result (Rejection, break up, etc.) in dating automatically means you did something wrong or that someone didn't like you. This isn't reality, so I'm going to lay out some examples to explain why you need to de-couple the results of your interactions with people and the approach you took. The basic premise is this: You can do everything right and still end up with an undesirable result.

1.) The more options you have, the more picky you can be. People that have tons and tons of options in the dating world are afforded the opportunity to be more selective. Typically this manifests as people shutting down a potential date over something relatively insignificant (Like the car they drive) but in extreme cases people can reach a state where they're so picky that no one can impress them and as a result they never date anyone. You might think that you got rejected because you were boring or because they weren't attracted to you, but in reality they're impressed by no one and you never really had a chance in the first place.

2.) People often choose to do what is easy and comfortable instead of what they really desire but is hard/uncomfortable. This is very, very common. People will be interested in someone and plan a date, but as the date gets closer they will become more nervous and cancel the date/ghost even thought they like the person and are attracted to them. This happens *all the time*. The amount of people (Especially younger people) that cancel dates because they're nervous is massive.

3.) Many people are influenced by their friends/family when it comes to dating. A person will be talking to someone else and interested in them, they show their friend a picture and the friend doesn't find them attractive. They'll often cut things off because they don't want to date someone that their friend doesn't consider attractive. 

4.) People go through ebs and flows in their interest/effort in dating. Sometimes a person will be super interested in dating and put in a lot of effort in, going on many dates within a short period of time and having an open mind towards different types of people. Other times they'll put in little/no effort and not go on dates with anyone despite being attracted to them and interested in them. Depending on when you meet someone your chances of having a ""successful"" date with them can change massively.

5.) Some people have baseless biases that influence whether or not they go on a date with someone. For example, if a girl has had a bad experience with a guy named Kevin she might choose to not date people named Kevin in the future. It's not reasonable and has nothing to do with you, but someone could reject you for this reason despite finding you attractive.

I could go on and list many other examples, but hopefully this gives you a good idea. I'm not trying to say that it's never your ""fault"" when you get rejected, but rather that rejection doesn't automatically mean they didn't like you. People reject people they like all the time for a myriad of reasons so you shouldn't get too caught up in things like ""Did I say something wrong?"" or ""Did they not like my outfit?"" or ""Should I have kissed them?"". Those things can matter but are often a sign of someone that's overthinking something that they never had much control over in the first place.

Hope this helps someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogxwqs/why_results_based_analysis_is_inappropriate_for/

35,ogy08s,1625844719,Is is wrong of me to be upset by my family and ex boyfriend reconnecting after almost a year of us being broken up?,"My ex (M27) and I (F21) dated for about 5 months before the relationship took a turn. He essentially started to ghost me, wouldn’t meet, would barely text, and stopped being the romantic boyfriend I knew. I met with him and asked if he wanted to break up and he said “I don’t know”. I was utterly in love with him so I gave him time to think about it even though I figured what would happen. He told he he was “too busy” for a girlfriend. We stayed in touch and I begged him to work it out with me until he got into school and wasn’t as busy. He said okay, but pulled back even more. It went on for about 3 months until I finally broke and said goodbye. He didn’t even reply. I was completely heartbroken. (Keep in mind this was my first boyfriend, my first kiss, and the first guy I slept with). The only time we talked after that was when he texted me months later that he missed me and got into school. Since then we had both started seeing people. 

Almost a year later I find out my mom followed his social media, started liking and interacting with his posts, and eventually he reached out to ask about how my family was. My mom was with me at least half of the time I was sobbing over him. She knew how bad he hurt me. But her excuse was that she liked him, he just handled the situation wrong. Me and my ex haven’t stayed in touch and it drives me crazy that my family gets to have him and he gets them, after he clearly didn’t want me. He and my family get to just start back up like nothing happened while I have to stay away because I can’t get over the fact he never even apologized for what he did.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogy08s/is_is_wrong_of_me_to_be_upset_by_my_family_and_ex/
36,ogy4k9,1625845076,Met a girl at the psych ward,"Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.  


So we were about 10 patients and probably around 40 staff. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. One of the staff asked me if I had met this girl yet. I said ""no"". She then said that it was the pretty one. I had  no idea until a few days later when I met her. She was pretty and seemed quite healthy.  


She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasnt interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.  


I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.  


I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.  


The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.  


She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasnt too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.  


I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated. So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.  


So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.   


I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasnt ready and to be honest I wasnt really ready myself. So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.  


We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps. And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.  


So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors.  


Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.  


I am meeting her again tomorrow. I havent kissed her yet despite knowing her for 4 years.

62,oh1blx,1625854467,"I think I’m done with online dating, at least for the time being.","To preface, I’m a 30 year old dude with very little dating experience. I’ve dated two women in the past. One when I was 27 on and off for about a year, and one for a couple months at the end of last year/beginning of this one. I’m not a conventionally attractive dude, not ugly but not good looking enough to stand out on dating apps and sites. I’m inexperienced to say the least, but I’ve got just enough experience to know that I bring a lot to the table in the dating/relationship world. I know what I want in a relationship and I know what many of my dealbreakers are. 

I’ve had a surge of confidence lately when it comes to approaching women irl. I don’t really care about being embarrassed or rejected. I’ve done a lot more in the last several months than I’ve ever tried in the past. All to no avail, but it’s so much more satisfying than trying and failing online. 

I get some matches. Not a ton, but enough that I should have a decent chance at getting a few dates a month. But no one ever messages me back. The ones who do either seem to get frustrated because I’m not asking them out soon enough, or stop talking to me when I ask them out within the first 10 messages. Or even more common is that they are the typical boring one sided convos where I’m putting in too much effort. I’m so so exhausted by it all. I’ve spent 4 years on dating apps and sites and gone on 3 dates. I’m living the definition of insanity and I can’t do it anymore. While it’s the only way I’ve ever gotten dates, it doesn’t seem realistic long term. 

Just wanted to vent and let others know that they’re not alone when it comes to this. I know I can do better irl, and I think you can too. We need to get off this stupid crutch and go learn about dating in the real world. It’s scary but it feels good in a way, even with the rejections.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oh1blx/i_think_im_done_with_online_dating_at_least_for/

65,oh1jas,1625855130,"Men’s advice. The centered, chill guy always wins","In whatever scenario arises, whether it’s with women, career, confrontation, conflict, or adversity, the guy who is in control of his emotions and stays calm is the one who always comes out on top.

Think of the men in your life who truly impress you— the ones who have great people skills and are successful in most facets of their life. Are they hotheads? Do they get emotional when they encounter rejection, or do they handle it and move on like a fucking man without dwelling? Are they insecure, controlling, and rigid? The answer to these questions is likely a resounding ‘no’.

Being calm and centered doesn’t mean avoiding conflict, it’s just approached differently. It’s being confident enough to state boundaries without anger, to de-escalate confrontations with other men without ego because you know you can handle yourself physically.

It’s being able to encounter a beautiful women and maintain the same level of composure as you would talking to the elderly lady working the register at the grocery store, because you treat all women the same, and don’t put some on a pedestal.

Stay cool, maintain your composure like James Bond, throw in some humor, and at the same time don’t take yourself too seriously and you’ll come out on top.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oh1jas/mens_advice_the_centered_chill_guy_always_wins/

Since i can't put external link here, google ""mens looks may matter more than personality"".

The study sample was 80 daughters and 61 mothers. Most important quote from the study: ""The results showed that as long as a man was considered attractive or moderately attractive, both mothers and daughters would pick the guy who had the most desirable personality traits. But when an unattractive male was paired with the most highly desirable personality profile, neither daughters nor mothers rated him as favorably as a potential romantic partner, compared with better-looking men with less desirable personalities"".

This girl checks off a lot of boxes for me. Most importantly she’s genuine, knows what she wants in life/relationships and actually cares about what’s going on in my life. 

The issue is that she’s fully settled into living in our current city and her life here. Her family is all here, she has a couple of pets and has pretty much lived here all her life. She has also talked about settling down here. Me, on the other hand, I’m a transplant from a different city and honestly could be moving out pretty soon (I’m switching jobs within this year)

Another thing is that I’m a few years younger and can kind of feel that we’re in different stages of our life. This is giving me cold feet about getting into something serious when I haven’t figured out a lot of the things I want to, especially after covid put a lot of my life on hold.

70,oh1sc3,1625855904,"Right person, wrong time?","So I (22m) am moving to a new city in about 2 weeks (probably a month til I'm fully moved).  I'm about 6 weeks out from the breakup of my last long term relationship, and wanted to have a quick Tinder fling just for fun before I moved, nothing serious.

I always get into long term relationships too soon and am currently trying to be single for a while, move out on my own and focus on myself.  That being said I still want to date around very casually now that I'm single

However after a few bad Tinder dates I met this person (24nb) that I really really resonate with.  They're not normally my type but I decided to be open minded and man did we hit it off.  We went on a date and talked for like 6 hours.  It felt like we didn't even scratch the surface of things we have in common, similar life experiences, and values.

I don't make deep connections with people often and it's wild to meet someone like this in my small hometown just as I'm moving.  I felt so understood, this person seems to really like me for me and was so genuinely excited about our conversation and what I had to say.

My problem is, not only am I moving, but I also fall in love too fast and commit to relationships.  I definitely need to be single for a while, and this person feels the same way.

So idk what to do, I don't want to lose this connection.  But at the same time I'm moving and can't commit to anything, nor should I.  I've got a new job and college courses coming up as well.  However I'm only 2 hours away, so the drive isn't terrible.

I would love some advice on what to do in these kinds of situations.  For now I'm thinking live in the moment and really enjoy a few more dates or trips with this person, &amp; see where it goes


TL;DR

I get in long term relationships way too quickly and just got out of one 1.5 months ago.  I wanted to have a quick Tinder fling but met someone I connect with like no one in years.  

Problem is I'm moving 2 hours away, starting a new job, college classes, etc.  Do I try and build this connection anyhow, or let go before it even starts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oh1sc3/right_person_wrong_time/

73,oh1z98,1625856494,Sudden change of feelings,"So i have met a girl about a month ago and we sat with mutual friends in a cafe couple of times and then i added her on social media and we talked abit and decided to go out just the two of us and we did that like 3 times, but on the first time i told her that im developing feelings for her and she responded positively (in a shy way)

We recently were walking close to where i live and she told me she wanna go to my place so we did that, ended up making out on my bed for like an hour and we did that 2 more times.

I think its important to note that im a 23 years old and never had any intimate relationship with a girl in my life, this is literally my first experience and im very happy to have had this experience with such a wonderful girl.

The thing is i suddenly felt my emotions changing, i still like her but i dont feel like im deeply in love, another thing is when we were making out and dry humping, she came once but i never came even tho i really wanted to, I tried but couldn't ejaculate and it was very weird for me, my penis is erect and there is no problem with that but i have no idea why that happened, performance anxiety?

I should also note that, recently she told me that there is a guy who is interested in getting to know her and he might be coming to our town (he is currently in another country) and she asked me what do i think of this, i replied its her choice but i dont wanna be a plan b for anyone and she responded with i choose you (could be a test? If it's a test then that's manipulative) and now she kinda felt my change of emotions and its really frustrating for me, i dont know what's happening and im starting to get mad at myself.

Is this normal? I just lack any experience and i dont wanna regret anything.

I’ve had this friend with benefits for eight years, ever since high school. I met him when I was 16, and he was 18. We’ve hooked up on and off for the last three years. He was in the military, so he moved around a lot, and I didn’t get to see him. Sometimes he would text me when he had a girlfriend, or one time he left me A girlfriend three years ago when I told him I would text him if they were together. 




Six years ago he said that he wanted sex and nothing more than two years ago he said that we had a mutually understood sexual relationship I just never expected anything more from here and this year I’ve just gotten depressed and over the last two years I’ve just been very depressed I don’t usually initiate contact with him so I’ll text him when he contacts me but usually hi I don’t really initiate stuff with him I hooked up with him twice in the last year but I haven’t seen him in six months because we live in different states just last week he was trying to talk to me or FaceTime me but honestly I don’t like to FaceTime too much so I made some excuses and we didn’t I think he was annoyed with me last year he told me to get on Snapchat and I said maybe I would create a new account because I had one when we were younger and we would go back-and-forth and text each other but honestly I just have grown tired just because in the past he’s thrown that like we’re not in a relationship in my face and I don’t wanna make connections or strings attached if it’s an NSA switch situation, so I said maybe and then didn’t make an account, and then we didn’t talk for about eight weeks. 




Last week we talked a little bit, but just this week I notice he’s with someone new and has a new girlfriend. I don’t know if I should feel hurt by it. I feel weird.

Of course I told him this is impossible for me, I don't know him that well. And he snapped, he started to be really condescending and rude to me, he told me he wants to do everything for me and I am ungrateful to him. This came to me as a shock, since we stopped talking and I thought we both moved on.

He started to send me messages non stop, and although I begged him to stop because his persistence scares me, he still doesn't stop, I blocked him on all social medias and he still finds ways to write me messages. Now I know he wants to come back home and I am horrified of the fact that he might show up at my house, since he knows where I live.

I’ve dated 4 guys in that time (holy hell that sounds like a lot lol) but it hasn’t worked out with any of them. Usually them not wanting to commit. My parents had me pretty late, my dad is in his 70s with a health condition and is clearly having some existential crisis that he’s never going to have grandchildren or see me get married. 

This is such a heavy burden on me and I’m already heartbroken enough by how hurtful my dating life has been the last 3 years. Like I can’t help that no one seems to want to be with me. My parents have said things to me like that are concerned that I’m going to end up alone and an alcoholic like my aunt, that I’m never going to have a family of my own ect. 

It’s just making things worse and making feel desperate to get into a relationship when I should be focusing on myself and being happy and not needing someone to be happy",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oh459b/parents_pressuring_me_into_finding_someone/

97,oh4h52,1625864086,Is this fine for a 2nd date?,"Hey everyone, hope you are all having a great day. Well anyway, I went on a first date about a week ago and it went really well. We both hit it off and both want to go on another date. Unfortunately due to my busy schedule we were limited to Sunday evening to meet up and in our city pretty much everything fun to do is closed by 6:00 PM on Sundays. The weather is also going to be ridiculously hot so anything outside is also completely out of the picture. Due to this I was thinking of just doing dinner and then afterwards going to a coffee/tea shop and bring some board games and just hang out there. To me it sounds relaxing and fun but honestly I don't know. Is this allright for a plan? Should I come up with something else or would this be okay? There were some other things that I wish we would have been able to do cause I know she would have really liked them but we just can't that evening. Don't really feel like going to a bar either, cause I'm going to be exhausted from work. Thank you all so much!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oh4h52/is_this_fine_for_a_2nd_date/

99,oh4nyd,1625864655,Does dating someone you think is 'out of your league' increase odds of irl attraction?,"Hi all,

I (28F) met this great guy (30) on a dating app about a week ago. When I first saw his profile, I immediately thought: Wow this guy is so handsome, I probably won't stand a chance. I almost swiped him left because of this but eventually was like why the hell not and was pleasantly surprised when we matched. We've been having great convos and have a lot in common so it's going great. We've also decided to meet up irl next week.

Now the thing is, I have a lot of difficulty falling in love and being truly attracted to someone. I only ever did so once before and at that time I too thought the guy was 'out of my league' to use those terms. Turns out he thought exactly the same about me. So eventually we had quite a happy relationship for some years but ended because of reasons.

Anyways, back to this guy. So I asked my friends for their honest opinion concerning the league thing. They were a bit amazed by the question and said we were equally attractive (me even slightly a bit more attractive which baffled me to hear) and certainly on the same playing field. 

Could this possibly be a good sign concerning the chances of irl attraction ? This is kinda the first time I really click so well with someone while thinking he could be unmatching me any second because he suddenly realizes he could get 'better'. But he doesn't. 

I'm just very nervous for the meetup. After having a lot of failed first dates where it turned out there was no attraction whatsoever, I really want this one to work out. 

Tldr:  Does dating someone who you think is 'out of your league' (but while others say you're on the same level of attractiveness) possibly increase the odds you'll be attracted to them irl?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oh4nyd/does_dating_someone_you_think_is_out_of_your/
