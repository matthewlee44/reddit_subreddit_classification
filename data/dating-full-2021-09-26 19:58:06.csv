Average to above-average looking ladies claiming how hard it is to get guys to show interest in them on a dating app, put up or shut up. I can put up.

Just on OkCupid alone, since April, I have over 5,000 Likes. FIVE THOUSAND! I’m average to better-than-average in looks. A friend I trust says that with makeup, hair, outfit, etc. I’m a 7.

Many of the guys showing interest are on a higher attractiveness level than I am.

You have to pay money to see the numbers and I stopped my subscription awhile ago, but if someone wants to see a screenshot for proof of this, PayPal me $33CDN to re-subscribe and I’ll take screenshots of my OkCupid numbers for you.

I’m not saying all, most, half, or even *quite some* are men I’d be interested in dating. I’m not saying I have 5,000+ “quality” men to choose from. (By “quality”, I mean gamer nerd dudes who keep clean and relatively fashionable. I want a gamer nerd dude, not a neckbeard. Not every gamer nerd dude is or *has to be* a neckbeard. You *absolutely* can be a nice looking gamer nerd dude.)

I’m *also* not saying that *anyone*, men *or* women, has to date *every person who clicks Like on them*. Shove your strawmen arguments up your chocolate whizzway.

Just *don’t for a minute* let some average to above-average woman *anywhere* tell you it’s hard for her to get attention on dating apps. 5,000+ Likes since April prove otherwise. What she *should* say is it’s hard to get attention from the *types of men she’s most interested in*. *That’s* a perfectly fine, fair, and realistic complaint.

I’m not saying any woman deserves or *doesn’t* deserve whatever attention she *wants*. You deserve whatever you’re truly worth and there’s no way I would know that nor do I *claim* to know that.

I just got sick of this bullshit myth that “girls have a hard time dating”. No, they have a hard time dating *guys they want*.

And because I know people would wonder, most of the guys I swiped right on either became uninterested in me because I’m too much of a dork and I’m too affectionate out-of-the-gate, which is *totally fair*, they can like what they want, they don’t owe me *anything*. Or they were Nigerian scammers. I have proof of that *too* for those who think I’m lying.

No, I won’t give out my personal identifying info on here or my pictures for judgment. I don’t owe anyone here that.

Want more of my dating anecdotes? You can DM me and I’ll see what I’m interested in talking about.

But there you go. Myth *busted*. :P

Edited to add because I’m sure the Female Dating Strategy people will screencap this post to post in their subreddit and try to mock it:

I am not saying any woman must date *any and every man that clicks Like on her*. Having *any* kind of standards you want is *fine*. It’s *your* life and you shouldn’t be forced to date *anyone* you don’t want. Your standards are *yours* to choose and fight for. You don’t owe *anyone* your time and effort. You don’t owe *anyone* a date for *any reason*.

It really hurt. What hurt more was that he said a few more things and everything based on conjecture. Plus he decided everything on his own. The bottom line was he didn't feel romantic interest with me. But he said he can't loose me and wants to talk to me when I'm over him.

The thing is I tried. For a year and I told him after careful consideration. I don't know if I can or want to.

The thing is. I'm sad that I might loose him completely as both friend and partner. Because he won't discuss it and expect me to gloss over it. (Something I foolishly suggested)

He ignored 3/4 of my messages and gave me a blunt response: “ahaha yeah okay.” So I messaged him the next day and we had a normal conversation. 

He gave me a even blunter response that ended the conversation again: “lol okay.” (Punctuation included)

This turned me off so I didn’t prod any further. I didn’t contact him again but this was two weeks ago.

I am in my mid twenties and only recently truly started to take care of myself in the last two years. I had a drastic transformation from 310lbs overweight to 190 lbs fit at 6ft1. This has done wonders for my health and dating life. However I still suffer from anxiety that has stuck around from when i was overweight. 

My anxiety only really appears when I am on a date or seeing a girl I'm really into, especially if she is attractive. I get attention from girls I never thought would ever find me attractive two years ago. I get so anxious I can't relax and be myself, and hook ups are quite difficult on my part. This is very stressful for me as I would really like to get out and date but I don't feel like I'm putting my true self forward, and I'd like to be capable of hooking up too which I also can't do. 

Does anyone have any advice to overcome this? I understand it's very likely a self-worth issue where I still overvalue attractive people in comparison to myself. But I'm not sure how to combat that. I have more upcoming dates and I would like to find some solution to help make it less stressful and gain a more positive outlook. Also I have a therapist I am seeing but that is a very slow process and I haven't had much success unfortunately because I'm also studying to become a therapist so I rarely feel I connect with what she tells me.

So I've (F20) never really been in a serious romantic/sexual relationship. But a few months ago, I thought about dating or going on to some dating apps. So I talked about it with my mom and my best friend. My mom thought it was silly because I'm still unsure about my sexual orientation (because I've recently been wondering if I'm possibly demisexual or graysexual) and what I'm into.  And my friend just said ""You know you don't have to be in a relationship"" Which that is true. 

It left me wondering whether I really want to date or be in a relationship. What am I looking for in a partner? Will I ever know what I want if I don't test the waters? Do I really want to be in a serious relationship? Or do I just want to meet and hang out with new people? Am I just lonely?

I decided to jump into online dating, and for me that was… not what I expected.

I signed up for numerous sights including:
- eHarmony
- Bumble
- Christian connection

There were several other sites I went on but I will speak about my executive on the above sites. I will go through these in chronological order.
I was on Bumble for a week before connecting with a young lady I was interested in. I went to her end, met her for a meal and had a short walk around her end of the woods (around 40 minutes from myself.) Although I and get connected on most things, but then there was the big sticking point that had not been mentioned in the week that I had been speaking to her- she wanted to go abroad and become a missionary. This never came up in conversation until the in person date.

After the above experience on Bumble, I decided to move to a more well established platform, so I tried out on eHarmony. I spoke to three different women on this platform in which there were two notable people of interest. The first was a woman that thought I was a catfish or a fraudster of some description. The young lady drew this assumption from the fact that my dating profile photos as well as my WhatsApp photo all looked somewhat different- but not significantly, the one major difference being that in some I had a beard while in others I did not. For context, I normally keep my beard quite short, so you may still see them shape of my face.
The second woman on eHarmony was a different bag of fish. I got speaking to her over the course of two to three weeks, and we agreed to see each other on a date, even though we lived at opposite ends of the country. Something which I did not take enough notice of was that I and her did in fact clash on a number of issues, and she was alot more open with her intimate side (including with pictures.) This let me in a difficult spot as I wanted to stay her but I felt conflicting feelings. I caved and resulted in a handful of somewhat intimate photos from myself sent to her. Although she was impressed, I felt humiliated and had let my guard down. About a week before I was to see her, she claimed she had almost been in a bus accident (note *almost*). When she asked for empathy from me, I was frankly a little confused - how should I give empathy to someone i’ve never met when I can’t relate to what they’re talking about? (I have had bumps and scratches in cars and I’ve not felt the need to want some empathy from someone for that.) That is where she and I parted ways, I having deleted all explicit messages to distance myself from her.

Now, my final experience on Christian connection. This has been my worst date in living memory. I met someone online on the CC app- she having liked my profile and myself liking her profile back. We chatted for two weeks before I suggested a date. I traveled to her area- 80 minutes from where I lived in an area I was not familiar with. Let me tell you readers… wow… I’ve never felt so insulted in my life in the course of two hours, so let me summarise what was done and said:
- Upon arriving (after my long journey and having spent more than I anticipated on travel) and suggesting to go to a deserts cafe, she promptly says to me that she is not hungry (you agreed to meet me here, so why don’t we go in and eat as we agreed?!)
- We go on a walk, and after 10 minutes of walking in a unknown direction and turning round to our starting point she says to me “that’s ten minutes that I’m not getting back”
- She says that as I am a particular star-sign that is the same as a friend of her’s, I must be aggressive, violent and unhinged frequently (you have been speaking to me for 30 minutes and that’s your conclusion??)
- She compared me to my photos online and came to the conclusion that I looked very different (physically I had not changed, but having slightly more facial hair now)
- the comments “my ex was taller than you by 3 inches” and “you’re the second best guy I’ve dated on CC” (if that’s the case why aren’t you with them?)
That date went on for two hours, after which I quite enjoyed the train ride home. I have not spoken to her since that day.

Now, what are my key points I’ve taken away from online dating:
- You WILL be judged on your photos
- Make sure your photos are all up to date
- If your gut tells you that something is not right (such as anything from my experiences that rings true), end the relationship/conversation there
- faith-based dating services often have people with a loose definition of what “faith” is (honestly if they’re not sure what “faith” means in this context, there is a red light for you religious folk!)

I can tell I’m his whole world and the love he shows me is so pure. But there are some things I’m a little “eh” about. And maybe I’m just being picky. I was recently diagnosed with ROCD about a week and a half ago and I started having symptoms back in April and he’s been supportive through it all even when I made it EXTREMELY hard. My parents love him like he’s their own son and everything is great. 

However 

Last Sunday I had his phone and went to his deleted photos just to be nosy. I found a picture of a porn star and she had a dildo on. I’m aware that people watch porn especially men so that wasn’t the big deal. I jokingly asked “what’s this about?” And at first he was hesitant to explain which again I understand because talking about porn can be awkward. He eventually told me that he saw the porn star’s profile on Twitter and wanted to view her girl on girl action. it was a link connected to it. So I went to the PS’s profile and clicked on the link. Her website popped up and I saw she had girl on girl action AND videos of her pegging men. I jokingly asked “babe do you watch these too?” He at first said no then after some digging he said “ok yes babe, I saw the video of the pegging and was curious as to how it worked but that’s not my thing and I don’t want that done to me”. He insisted it was the only video he’s ever watched like that and that he doesn’t want anything up or around his butt. I know I shouldn’t be bothered by it but I am. Idk I feel embarrassed like
Why is my man watching that? I hate that I’m questioning his manhood. He’s assured me it’s not his thing. And before finding this I would playful try to play with his butt and he was NOT into it at all. 

He sometimes does the broken wrist gesture and that makes me overthink even more. I do have ROCD and it causes me to overthink things and obsess over them to the point I’ve contemplated ending the relationship because of this. Idk I just feel embarrassed. Maybe that’s crazy. 

My mom’s last marriage ended because of her husbands homosexual past so idk I have this fear of that and it’s really got me thinking the worse.

It's basically an interview and people need to step it up. You can't expect to only talk about yourself and answer questions without trying to get to know the other person. It's a two way street;

\-------

Is it me or every time I talk to a guy on dating apps, the conversation turns into an interview. Always me asking the questions and carrying the conversation while they just would answer but not ask anything about me. It's not like their answers are short and show disinterest, but more like several sentences answering what I asked but they never ask me anything about me so it makes keeping the conversations alive difficult.  


Here's an example:

Me: ""Hey XYZ, how's your going week so far? I saw some of your pictures and they look awesome and very aesthetic. What are some of your favorite places that you have went to so far.""

Him: ""Hey ABC, Thanks for the compliment. My week has been going great, with a dash of busy, but I'm hanging on until Thursday where I get to play some online games with some of my buddies. Those pictures I took were from my trip to PLACE X and it was one of my favorites because of the amazing food, views and friendly locals who showed me the non-tourist hot spots. It was crazy how the safety there is so different compared to here.""

Me: ""Nice! What kind of games do you play? I play a few games myself and sometimes stream them. I would definitely put that place on my list. Were you able to try X dish from there? If so, what did you think of it? I heard it was delicious! Do you have any other places on your list to visit in the future?""

Him: ""I play -INPUT GAME NAMES HERE- with my buddies. We do this every Thursday as a way to stay connected and we try to form teams and compete online for fun and sometimes go to in person competitions on weekends. Yes, I did try that dish and it was really good. I kept eating it everyday there too lol. This was the last place I was able to go to before covid so hopefully I get to go to X, Y, and Z in the near future.""

Then this goes on and on back an forth for a day or two until I start to feel the drag of the conversation. I hate these interview like conversations and it really triggers me. At times I feel like ghosting these guys out of spite, but I would remember my ghosting experiences and straight up say I am no longer interested. I mean, it's pretty obvious when my messages start to take longer and longer to reply and everything is one sided.

I can't be the only one that experience this, right?

I’m a 27 year old male and have only ever slept with one person. I didn’t even lose my virginity until I was 25 to someone I deeply loved. I broke up with her, but up until that point, I didn’t get into a relationship because I didn’t feel ready for a relationship. I had insecurities that I knew would make me clingy and I didn’t want to subject a person to that. 

Anyway, I did have opportunities to “sleep around” in college. girls would approach me and seemed open to the idea of one night stands, but internally it would be a massive turn off to me. I would feel disgusted that someone who didn’t even know me more than an hour would be willing to give me access to their body. Most men and women seem to be open to that idea, so I always thought there was something wrong with me. However, sex is a very intimate act to me that I don’t think should be done freely. Not to mention, the dangers of being promiscuous (STDs, kids out of wedlock born to dysfunctional homes, emotional damage, etc.)

At times, I thought maybe I was just jealous because I couldn’t hook up with every girl like my peers, but now that I’ve been going to bars more frequently I’ve had an opportunity every time and it just doesn’t seem worth the pressure and risks. I’d rather just continue to hang out with my friends.

Maybe I just have issues with intimacy. For me to even want to date a girl I have to have strong feelings for her to put up with the emotional aspect of dating. Most people are not comfortable enough with themselves to even be in a relationship, so I just don’t think it is worth the time and effort to invest.  I rarely see relationships or marriages work out. Of course I do have sexual urges, but then I just masturbate and keep it moving lol.

At the end of both dates we hugged, talked about how we had a good time and both girls mentioned going on a 2nd date. One them rubbed even my arm while mentioning the 2nd date and made it very obvious she was interested in me.

The first girl ended up ghosting me a couple days later and the second girl text me she didn’t think there was a connection and she’s going to have to decline when I asked her out again.

I am totally confused about what went wrong. I’m not too big on texting so I wasn’t acting desperate or anything(I waited a couple days before I got in touch with them).

I guess my question would be is this a common thing even if they weren’t interested in me? I don’t like playing games so I wouldn’t expressed interest at the end of a date if it wasn’t genuine.

Usually a women wouldn't go out of there way to talk to me more than like 5x a year, but now its a weekly thing i think?

For example last night a couple of (attractive) women randomly wanted to take pictures with me (??), each one individually. They said i looked cool, and were obviously flirting / touching my hands and shit. I don't know weird stuff, I get hit on some but usually its just asking for a phone number. Anyways I've got no idea how to handle these sorts of situations, I really have no idea how to talk to women. I usually just want to have fun, enjoy music, and just talk to strangers when i go out, but now I kind of want to start dating? 

I guess i just need a step-by-step guide on how to talk to a women lol. I'm pretty sure im overthinking it and just need to actually ask for their number or something. Anyways I'm 23M if that matters, probably above average looks, awkward when it comes to talking to girls i want to date (but not awkward when i don't want to date them?)

Hey, first time writing here but I need your help!
So I started uni almost 1 month ago and I needed new friends. After random cause of events we formed a friend group of 10 people. We are all from the same country so that helped bond us because we are studying in a foreign country.
So this is about a girl who is part of this friend group. The first two weeks we were just on a hey/hi basis and nothing more. I didn’t expect much and didn’t have any plans dating her. But things changed after we had a party 3 days ago. Usually I was pretty introverted back home so my new goal was to be really confident in myself and try not to stress over social experiences. So after the party ended me, this girl and 2 more people left together and decided to chill out at another place. We sat down and started talking about each other. For example when we started talking about our fav movies it turns out we have the same fav movies with the girl. We started talking more and found even more strange coincidences.As I said I am starting to be mor extroverted and not really caring about opinions so I was really bold. I made some comments like ""Oh, we have so many shared interests I think we should be dating already"" and she just laughted it off. I was kinda losing hope by that point but made some stupid joke along the way and she just kept laughing after each one. She wasnt drunk or anything like that. Like every single joke she found it the funniest thing ever. Then I got some hope again. After some more conversation she says she is a serious person and she is looking for a serious person. And I said to her ""Oh, well you dont know me, I am actually really serious"" and she replied with something ""Oh I dont believe you."" I kept making some stupid jokes until the end of the night. The next day, the same group of people from after the party(me, her and two more people) decided to go to the market together to shop for some fruits. Again, the same thing happened. We started finding strange coincidences about us and she kept laughing after every single stupid thing I say and then saying about the serious stuff. 
So I dont know what to do. We started messaging today but her replies are really slow. I am really confused what to do because half of the time she laughs at every single thing I say and we find many strange coincidences together, the other time she says she is into serious people, she replies really slow to my messages even though she is online and overall is playing really hard to get.
So what should I do? I have never been in a relationship before so I dont know when should I make a move or if I should make one at all. I have gotten to this position a lot in the past but never actually made a move because I was scared of embarrassement and rejection. Is she even interested in me? If so what should I do in the current situation? Should I just jokingly ask her out and if she rejects I will just say it was a joke.

I've been talking to this girl, who I've been in the same school for 5 years with, but I've never really got the chance to get to know her. We've been walking home from school together a couple of times in the past 2 weeks since the school year start when our schedules match. I've also chatted with her inviting her to a group volleyball meeting, that we've been doing regularly with our friend group. I invited her, because she's been to 2 of those meetings before and she shared that she was scared that she would ruin the game because she can't play, so I wouldn't call inviting her an obviously sign for her that I might be into her. (It also opened the chat between me and her, so I'm happy with it)
 While going home we usually talk about school stuff, but there is nothing much to discuss so I run out of things to say. I wanna get to know her better and become friends no matter if there could be something romantic between us or no, but I'm not sure how to casually do the transition from talking just because there is nothing else to do and talking about personal stuff, because we both wanna share. I'm also not sure about this feeling in my chest, but I think I might be falling in love. I've been in love only once before and at first I didn't look at her that way, I just found her friendly and cool and then one day I just realized I might like her, a week later I was sure that I'm in love. In my school there are mostly males and as a shy teenager I don't often get to meet girls my age, who I find different from the rest, so maybe it might be exaggerating, but I really haven't talked to someone new who I would consider partner-material in a while.
She also texted me herself about something school related yesterday, but our conversation was kinda weird and sloppy. 
So my question is how can I make the transition and maybe give her a hint that I might want to get to know her better. And also how would I know if she didn't like me or didn't want to communicate with me and instead just do it because she would feel bad or something... Personally for me when a good-looking girl has a nice personality and behaviour, I would just try to get to know her better and if I have luck we might get into something. But does it work like that for the females? Do they instantly get attracted to decent looking guys with good personalities.

I gave him a note (yes I am lame and childish) it said along the lines. “Hi I know I should be direct with you but, I’m not sure how to approach you. I think you’re cute and funny. Would you be interested in getting coffee or lunch? If not I totally understand. P.s I think your omelette story was funny” I tried to talk to him but I started stuttering I tried to say “Hi (insert name) I’m not sure how to approach you but I wanted to give you this” he said “what? you don’t know how to interact with me.” “why?” I guess I spoke softly and he had to bend down a little to hear me he is 6’7 and I’m 4’9 for reference. I just handed them a note it also had my number on it I tried to run off but I did not think about my escape route since our school in a single building and I would have walk down 9 flights of stairs to leave the building so I had to wait for the elevator. He opened the note that’s when I ran off he finished reading just in time the elevator open to come up to tell me he would love to go out with me and he tried to schedule something. 3 days have gone by and I’m not sure if he’s actually interested since he hasn’t texted me.

I (F20) am currently in university and within the past few weeks it has occurred to me that I cannot get this guy (M22) from my high school out of my mind. We go to different schools in different states and we honestly don’t talk much at all, we have only Face-timed once within the past few months and we don’t communicate at all in other forms. 

However, I had a crush on him in high school but I was not ready for a relationship. Since that period, I have grown so much as a person and overall feel more comfortable with myself and my emotional intelligence has really grown. I feel like I am at the point in my life where I am ready for a relationship, I’ve never been in one, but I just don’t know how to get the ball rolling. I’d love to reach out but I’m so nervous/conflicted on multiple things. I’m worried he doesn’t like me back or doesn’t want a relationship. I’m also worried if I reach out with the hope of a relationship and it doesn’t turn into that, I’ll be really bummed. Any advice or personal experience with this would be amazing! Thanks for reading

She sits besides my friend who sits between me and her.

Now, I would like some advice on what I can do and say to make it normal and casual. 

My best friend said to just be her friend first. Meaning don’t ask her out till class is over, which is in May. 
My dad says to just talk to her, build a relationship, build intimacy. He recommended talking to her during class breaks, he said maybe buy her a soda to show you’re a good person lol. 

I’ve checked her fingers, no rings lol. And in class, she does not talk to anyone, I mean no one! During class breaks, I hear people taking to each other just like me talking to my friend, but her, she just walks out of class, returns, and talks to no one. She’s just on her phone and stuff.

I recently made a joke about changing that and while it's never been a big deal to me his ***response*** to my statement was everything ( if that makes sense).  


 I can at times overthink things, and it's left me wondering if he said no because he is just a private individual or because he's hiding our relationship. He's admitted that he's never dated someone younger than him and I'm beginning to wonder if he's embarrassed.

1. Naivety: The first time he ever sent a dick pic was in 10th grade when his first ever serious girlfriend asked for one. She then replied by sending him nudes and they had sex for the first time soon after. Because of this experience, he now thinks that girls like unsolicited nudes as much as he does, and since he doesn't mind sending them he thinks it's a good way to get a girl's interest. 
2. Strategy: He knows that most girls aren't into dick pics unless they're already interested in having sex with him. It's a lot easier to send a pic than it is to write a convincing paragraph to the same effect, so he sends out the pics regularly knowing that even though the vast majority won't have any positive return, some will. 
3. Malicious intent: He knows that the girl in question isn't interested in unsolicited dick pics, and especially not from him. He also knows that it's the most sexual act he can do with her without getting in real trouble or feeling like he did anything wrong. For him it's a win-win situation, creating disgust for her and pleasure for him. 

Sometimes you see a mix of these philosophies as well. A combination of 1 and 2 might make a guy send a dick pic to a girl seemed like she was flirting, but was just being friendly, and a combination of 2 and 3 could motivate a guy who wants to get laid but hates women in general for rejecting him so much.

TLDR: I’m living abroad with foreign boyfriend and 5 week old baby. SO has some prior trauma from not being able to keep a boner in his younger years, which was so traumatic he actually cries about it. Subsequently, he didn’t kiss anyone until 17 and didn’t lose his virginity until 21. I caught him with a second phone, where he intended to meet up with some girl to have sex (we had not had sex for awhile due to pregnancy and depression) and he said he was going crazy. Unfortunately, I feel his traumas have made him unreliable and he will forever need this attention from girls since he lacked it for so long. Should I stay or leave?

So I’m a 22yo American female living with my 26yo Brazilian boyfriend in his country. We have a 5 week old son, together for going on 2 years. I only officially moved here 4 months ago, but I spent quite a bit of time here including 3 months during the pandemic. We got along amazing. I really felt he was the one. We had lots of coincidences that further convinced me. I accidentally got pregnant and after many discussions about what to do, we decided to keep him. We love him, he’s an amazing father to him. He really loves our baby.

Fast forward to me moving here. I arrived here pretty pregnant, I was trapped in his room all day while we looked to move to our own apt out of his apt with roommates. He is doing the equivalent to a navy seal course with the military right now, he worked mon-sat 5a-8p. I got depressed. I purposely went to sleep before he got home just to not show my depression. I wasn’t affectionate. We barely had sex. I couldn’t smile. He always tried to cheer me up, talk to me to know the issue, etc but I was standoffish. 

We finally got our apt and I was a little better, but many times he found me randomly crying. At this point I was huge pregnant, uncomfortable and overall sad. Many times I told him I was considering to go back to US until his course was done. At this point, he’s working 5a-8p mon-fri. He also was gone for one solid week without communication, and 4 weeks with communication only on the weekends. I couldn’t smile when I saw him. I loved him, but I was just so depressed. We didn’t really have sex, so it has been a solid 5 months since we had a decent sex life due to distance, pregnancy and depression.

Fast forward to one week ago… I found another phone. A phone he’s had for 4 years for some unknown reason, which he destroyed when I found and asked him to open it. What I did get out of him is that he’s been talking to girls on there, and one of them he intended to meet after work and ultimately backed out because “he thought of us.” He obviously has some secret on this phone unrelated to me since he’s had it even before I came alone. 

He apologized profusely, asked to work it out. Said he would do therapy, open passwords, cameras in the house, live location, video call for the entire day that he isn’t here, etc etc and how stupid and sorry he was.  

Here’s the problem: he was a virgin until 21 and he had a traumatic sexual experience when he was younger. Apparently he would try to have sex but couldn’t get boner. He had to take medicine for it. He finally defeated this at 21. It was so traumatic for him that he actually will cry when he talks about it. Idk if there’s more to the story. 

My problem is… he barely had attention from girls when he was younger. Now he’s attractive, he gets attention. I fear he craves this attention, since he had this traumatic experience and lacked this attention for so long. 

Although he’s sorry, I’m not convinced he will never cheat again because of this. Overall, he’s one of the nicest and genuine men you will meet. Everyone thinks highly of him. But due to his trauma, idk if he will ever be someone I can rely on. I know this man loves me and his son, but I don’t know what he is capable of if he did that in *this* situation. 

What do you guys think? Should I kiss him goodbye and save myself the trouble in the future? Should I continue on, let him do therapy for his trauma, see what happens? We live in separate countries if I leave… he won’t just let his son go.

So… my fiancé and I were an LDR. I had more ties and a better job, so we moved him here in February. He talks to and FaceTimes his family every other day or so, which I stay out of because that’s his time and his grandparents have termed me the gold-digging B from [state]. Ftr, there’s no digging; I have/make more money than he does. My family is dysfunctional at best. 

My job is not amazing. It has perks, but at the end of the day, it’s a job. I am shipped to multiple different locations in the week and this is exhausting for me because the different locations have very different expectations and requirements. At my home location, I am primarily front-end, so I do a lot of face to face interaction and people pleasing. At my secondary location, I am managerial, so I do reviews, schedules, pinch-hitting, etc. At my tertiary location, I am whatever is needed - front end, back end, inventory, etc. Sometimes, I go into work expecting one thing and wind up blindsided by something unusual. For the most part, I’m pretty roll with the punches. 

On Friday, I was back at location three, where I haven’t been in about six weeks. Things have changed, including almost everyone I know having taken better positions elsewhere. I’m happy for them, because they’re great people. But obviously, new faces were seen and one of them was this flamboyantly gay, socially awkward guy. We started talking about D&amp;D while we were working, and he invited me to check out his party in a themed bar because I’ve never played. 

Meanwhile, my fiance is having a rough day at his work. I invited him to my work and I would take a short break to talk with him because I’d been asleep when he left and I wouldn’t be home for another four hours or so. Immediately when he gets there, I finish up what I’m doing and go talk to him, but he’s got this attitude of just pissed off petulance because he saw me talking to the new guy, and starts to be rude to the new guy and tries to get me away from him. 

I excuse myself, even go outside with him, and he’s being aggressive and unnecessarily rude about me talking about how new guy invited me to check out his party. I’m trying to calm him because I know his day was rough, but he’s just being a jerk, so I go back inside when my break is up. 

It’s now two days later and he’s been rude to me the whole time, and is trying to pick a fight because there’s a bad anniversary coming up and he’s got anger management issues. I’m tired. I’m hormonal, and it’s in the rougher end of hormones. I feel like shit and have now worked in three separate buildings in three consecutive days, and I’m exhausted. I’ve been vomiting most of today because of the hormones. 

I leave work a few hours early to come and lay down, but he has the bed covered and instead of packing (we move on Friday) he hasn’t completed anything he was supposed to today and is instead playing video games. I broach the topic of neither of us having completed any specific task yet, and he immediately starts throwing things and screaming. We argue until he throws my abusive ex in my face and tells me I “wish he would hit me so I could get rid of him like I did my ex,” and I leave. I tell him he can go back [home] because his behavior is not acceptable and I’m tired of him throwing my abusive ex in my face. 
He tells me to “enjoy [my] date with New Guy.” 

I come home, hoping for some peace and quiet and to use some of my anger as energy to pack. He’s here. I should have left again. But I didn’t, because I’m having massive amounts of anxiety about this stupid move. I angrily remind him that New Guy is gay, and it starts another argument. He eventually tells me to “get that memory thing checked” because I have a brain tumor that impacts memory. 

I took off my rings. Because we were LDR in the beginning, I never take off my rings except in the shower (unrelated plumbing issue). I just… feel very disrespected and like there’s a huge double standard because HIS friends can invite HIM out, but a gay guy cannot invite me out to a D&amp;D party.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1028526,public,self,Is it Over?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw6rbp/is_it_over/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,

Here’s the thing, I find her cute and all but I just don’t really want her as a gf bc I don’t feel that spark snd that insane attraction for her. It came up in the conversation like what we were looking for and here’s were things got complicated. She told me out of the other guys she’s seeing that she has a connection for me (I guess she got out of a 6 year relationship like maybe last year or something, she was vague), and she’s bisexual as well, so it was a lot to take in.

I don’t really like holding her hand or being too intimate, but we got drunk and ended up making out on and off for like an hour or so. I started kissing her neck and she said it didn’t really do anything for her, but maybe she was lying bc I did it and she started getting worked up, and she ended up wanting a hickey lol.

While this was all happening in the beginning she was like “I feel like you’re gonna break my heart,” and she was hesitant to make out at first, but I reassured her, but at the same time I was drunk and didn’t really mean those things and just wanted to keep kissing and making out. I told her that something casual like a friends with benefits could be good, but she said that she feels like she’s catching feelings, and that she wants to see where it goes. 

I just like the intimacy and I like feeling desires, feeling loved, etc (as anybody probably does), but I don’t really like her like her. So I guess the options are to just go with the flow or just stop things, before she becomes attracted and things get messy. 

I didn’t like that she tried to act like she was talking to a lot of guys and to try to make me feels special she was like, but I like you the best. She also said she hasn’t felt like this in awhile, and idk we were both drunk so I’m hoping she was just talking out loud or something.
