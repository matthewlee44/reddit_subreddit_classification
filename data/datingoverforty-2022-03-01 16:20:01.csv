0,t4mpd5,1646180442,Rejected 3 months ago. We're still matched on the app. Should I message her?,"Here's the situation. I'm 33 years old and I have permanent erectile dysfunction from a med I took when I was younger. This pretty much destroyed my sexual confidence, and I freeze up with any sort of intimacy.

I matched with this woman on Hinge. First date we clicked perfectly. We went out on 3 other days, but I would always get super caught up in my own head. We did nothing but pecks here and there.

We were supposed to go out on a 5th date, but we both had to reschedule twice. The day of our 5th date, she sent me a message saying:

""I feel like we're not moving in a romantic direction. I truly enjoyed spending time with you, but I just look at you as a friend.""

I wrote back saying I do want to move in a romantic direction, and told her how much I cared about her. I left a voice mail, and she called me and said she meant everything she said.

I said if I had to do it all over again, I would have kissed you more. I think I just friend zoned myself is all. She said ""it wouldn't have made a difference and there was nothing you could have done differently.""

In my guy brain, I think she's just unaware that it would have made a difference. Going on pleasant dates with nothing happening she just lost interest is all. We didn't make out once, and when she tried, I froze up and backed off. I'm sure my sexual unconfidence painted me with ick.

This was 3 months ago. I just can't get over her. I have went out on six other first dates, and this sounds bad, but it's just trash. Low interest, ghosting, clunky conversation. Every bad date I go on just reminds me of how great she is, and how interested she was initially. She gave me sooo many opportunities for make outs to happen.

I hired a therapist, but the therapist is kind of useless.

Should I message her on the app and ask ""How have you been?""

This sounds bad, but I'm just in so much pain every single day, and I just can't get over it. To use a bad analogy, it's a woman who had sexual trauma in her life, and she finally meets a guy who she likes, but she freezes up a lot and the dude just moves on and now she's heart broke. That's kind of what happened to me.

What would you do if you were me? I know reddit hates hitting up someone from the past, but I mean... I just don't know.

Edit: I sometimes feel like just sending her one long ass disconcerting message about how I feel about the whole thing.

1,t4n7lw,1646181908,Prove to me your not catfish,"Dating apps suck. I have had numerous encounters of guys trying to pass as someone else. So I got smart about it. Whenever my spidey senses started to tingle, I would ask them to send me a selfie with my name written in marker on a piece of paper. They would get mad then take their time then send some god awful photoshop pic. So fast forward to my current situation. Meet a guy on Bumble. Checks all my boxes. Handsome, sweetheart blah blah blah. We hit it off beautifully. He’s several states away though. So my guy is actually telling me he’s who he say he is but I gotta know for sure. So I ask him to prove it to me and I would return the favor. So I send a short video asking for proof. He sends a pic and it looks legit. He’s flaming mad in the pic though. So I’m apologizing all over the place.  Now he’s mad and won’t return my texts. I feel so bad because it’s also his birthday and I feel like I ruined it. He feels like I should have excepted his word. We also discussed how ppl are fakes on dating sites, so he knows what I’m talking about. Was I wrong for asking for proof?

I see these blatantly biased and gender-based comments every day in the comments here on D≥40. They never seem to be flagged as breaking Rule #6.

Occasionally, someone will encourage a woman to ""use her words,"" but very rarely do posters push women to ask guys out, or continue communication. The general advice is WAIT, andif he doesn't contact you again, he's not interested.

YMMV, but that feels so passive and 1950s to me.

16,t50p6q,1646229501,Ran Into My Ex + Feelings Coming Back,"Over the weekend I ran into a guy I'd dated for about a year and broke up with last June, and while the intelligent part of me knows that the reasons we broke up are likely still there, I keep thinking about  him.

The situation: I was in love with him but he ultimately decided that was too newly divorced to be ready for a serious relationship, so we split. It sucked, but in September I found someone else whom I thought I loved, and I moved on. Well,  that ended (badly) about six weeks ago. I hadn't seen or spoken to the guy from last year since the day after we broke up, but we were in the same place on Sunday night and, well, obviously we spoke. 

He told me that he'd been thinking about me a lot, and wondering how I was and wanting to talk to me. He said he wanted to meet up and talk if I was open to it. But he also said that he is seeing someone and has been for a while. I thought about it and, given the weirdness of running into each other and the fact that I had been low-key thinking about reaching out to him, not to get back together but simply to sort of try to figure out WTF is going on in my stupid love life, I decided to say yes. 

But then he told me more about his relationship and, well, I'm finding myself feeling some hope, which is so ridiculous. It seems as though he is actually trying to get himself to a place where he actually CAN be in a relationship—where he understands how to love after the betrayal he experienced in his marriage--but he's not sure the person he's with is the person to do it with. I got the sense he had been comparing her to me unfavorably even prior to running into me. What he actually said was that it's not ""easy"" between them on a day-to-day basis. I said that I had felt like it was always easy with us, and he agreed and said that was what had made him think that the lack of ease in his current situation is a red flag. \[Sidenote: Duh, obviously it should be easy at this stage. Things only get harder!\]

My read on him was always that he was in love with me but too fucked up to know it. Since the breakup, friends convinced me that that was ridiculous and he just saw me as an FWB with whom things got out of hand. But he seemed utterly thrown by seeing me. At one point he said something like, ""When you grabbed my arm, the way your eyes looked in the light, jesus it was a moment. So many memories came flooding back."" Unlike my last ex this man talks no bullshit and tells no lies. 

We agreed to meet next week, and I swear to god I know it's idiotic but I keep wondering if there is any chance that we could eventually be together? Almost everything that went wrong with us came down to timing. Time has passed but... if he's been dating someone else rather than working on himself, or trying to work on himself through dating her, probably not enough? Even if there is no hope I'd like to connect with him and talk about everything we went through together and have gone through sense. Just once. I'm sure we can't actually be friends--our sexual thing has not faded at all for me, even if it has for him--so this is either a one-time meeting or a step towards a reconciliation. But is it a terrible idea either way? Somebody talk some sense into me please.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t50p6q/ran_into_my_ex_feelings_coming_back/

Having been on about eight dates now, I'm feeling a bit rusty on the chemistry part. As in, every single date has been fine in that the conversation flowed well, no major hiccups. But they have all felt a bit like business networking meet-ups, if that makes sense? Lots of info exchanged. Vibes? Not really.

I was talking to a female friend who said I should be more deliberately trying to create chemistry, and that this can be physical or not. I've already decided I'm going to try to step back a bit on the talking, not try to fill every silence. I still struggle a bit with when it's a good time to touch my date, whether just lightly on the back, etc. On last date, I put my arm around her as we were walking down the sidewalk, and she neither leaned in or moved her bag to the other side, so I backed off. I also think it's not right to force things with someone you don't know.

Background: Both kids have been bestfriends since elementary school. We know the family well. Live 9 houses away from each other. Many a Thanksgiving dinners together. Frequent coffee dates, nailsalon trips and Costco runs with the friend's mom. I know the best friend's parents well - but this ""Uncle"" has always been mentioned in a slightly negative way by the friend's family. The info I've overheard about him over the years tells me he is a careless, financially irresponsible and acts like a child. Divorced with 4 kids, two under 14. Cheated on his wife and stole money from his brother's business account in 2016.
I've met the Uncle twice in the years I've known this family. Nothing beyond a cordial hello. He is very good looking, talkative, intelligent, well dressed and an extrovert. 

Current status: The Uncle has turned a new leaf in recent months (the kids and the family claims). He has ""cleaned up"" his act they say. My child suggested to meet the person once and decide. My child's friends mom called me and requested the same. She asked if she could share my number with him. I told her I'll let her know in a few days because I need time to think about it. 

Conundrum: should I listen to my head (no) or heart (yes)? I find him physically attractive but I do not think I really trust him. Also I have never dated anyone connected to my friends in the past so I am unaware of the baggage it may lead to in other equations. 

Risk: If it doesn't work out, would I mess up my friendship and my child's? This family is extremely precious to us. My only child has sibling like bonds with the children of this family and the parents have always been there for us.

I am a homeowner and my home needs a lot of work. Fixing houses is what he does for a living.

He's now measuring for new cabinets, telling me he's going to buy me new appliances, and remodel my kitchen this year. I don't want it but he won't take no for an answer. I get that my home can be frustrating for him but I don't think it's his place. I also earn far more than he does but have other financial commitments for the next year and feel like the house can wait. 
He keeps paying for other things too. My daughter and I went for haircuts last night to a woman he recommended. He told me he wanted to pay for us both. I told him very clearly that I did not want him to. He did it anyway which I discovered once we got there and were half way done.
He wants to get married, like now. I've told him I'm not interested yet but he won't let it go. 
There is far more to the relationship that is great. These are the few things that make me nervous.

30,t635zd,1646345635,"Is it possible to find a ""soulmate"" level of love after a divorce, where she was the only one I've ever been with?","I am a 38M at the time of this writing, but xposting here with r/datingoverthirty because I'll probably be in my forties by the time I'm ready to date again.

Backstory: I met her in High School, where we were both 17 at the time.  We became fast friends, we took a liking to each other, but she ended up getting married the next year (normal where I'm from).  Reconnected with her years later when the marriage failed, and ended up dating her.

Long story sort, we went through a __hell__ of a lot together, she was _very_ unstable at the beginning due to a _very_ fucked up childhood, cheated on me twice (she ""ran"" away from my relationship physically each time, suddenly), and each time I took her back because I had some kind of stupid, unreserved love that made me unable to quit her, because I saw potential in her, the real her, the best in her.  The last six years up until 2021, we were married, and she had evolved into someone perfect for me, no instability, no cheating, just the perfect woman I'd always known she was capable of being.  She was truly the light of my life, and we grew together in a way that only two young trees could entangle and enmesh.  We never had children.

I've been a slightly depressive person all my life, but it'd gotten especially bad during Covid, and my father died in 2020 suddenly from a heart attack.  I got really bad, and self-absorbed in my own depression, and while I thought I was managing it fine (she showed me absolutely __no__ signs she felt upset, I even asked her if I was being a good husband often, and she said yes enthusiastically), she ended up suddenly leaving me last June. 

I feel like I didn't get the chance to right myself that I deserved, considering I had done the same for her multiple times in the past, I basically lit myself on fire for her, and from my point of view she appreciated it enough to completely change who she was as a person for me.  

Our relationship was _so_ good, until I messed it up, but I've come to learn through mutual friends that even though she was enthusiastically telling me that I was a good husband, that I would cook for her, sneak up behind her and shower her with kisses while she giggled like a schoolgirl, that she apparently was unhappy for months, maybe a year or so.

I will never understand how or why she could do something like that, leaving all of a sudden just like the last two times, but it really is over now, and the only person I've ever loved and been with left me.

I am utterly terrified of dating, I don't think anything can ever be as good as what I've had.  There is an innocence that comes with your first love, even if they hurt you in the past, because they're the one that you had loved completely without reservation or cynicism.  I don't know if it's possible for me anymore.

I keep reading stories about modern dating, and it seems the social-media aspect has just destroyed any semblance of a real connection, for some aborted simulacrum of one.  I don't want to search a needle in a haystack for the ""privilege"" of meeting someone who will treat me as disposable because they have tons of options even if they're shitty ones (I'm aware as a guy, I don't have that luxury, we get way less options with the same percentage of shittiness).

I feel absolutely screwed.  It's not like having your first love as a teenager and then being utterly destroyed, but bouncing back because you're still developing and you feel like there's a huge distance in experience between 16 (when I should have started dating instead of 22), and 25, when your brain has for the most part stopped developing and changing.

There is no ""emotional distance"" for me at this age, with my first, because my brain isn't changing as quickly as it would have as a young person, my identity is basically pretty static now, and it grew to a mature age around a person who absolutely destroyed me in the worst way.

How do I even date.  I know I'm not ready, and I would never subject anyone to someone like me with my kind of issues.  I think I'm destined to just be alone for the rest of my life.

[I wrote a post on r/trueoffmychest about some of what I've mentioned](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/t5ikes/i_hate_my_38m_existence_and_i_will_commit_suicide/), because I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of attachment that will keep me here.  I think I've experienced everything I need to here, and that everything left is going to be a ""sequel"" to what I've already experienced anyway, so why try?

I'm looking to see if anyone has any different experience, or can make a convincing argument that it isn't the case that I'm totally fucked in regards to finding another connection at this age.

36,t692rd,1646363319,When and how to have the exclusivity talk,"I (49/M/Divorced) have been dating someone (39/F/Divorced) for about a month. We met on Match and hit it off instantly. We texted throughout the day the first few days and managed to meet up for dinner and drinks 5 days after starting to get to know each other. 

Dinner went well. There was mutual attraction and during our talking we continued to check off boxes for one another. The night ended with an amazing time kissing and saying goodnight before we parted ways.

Texting daily - from good mornings to random stuff to deeper conversations - continued. We met for several more dates. On the second date the kissing lasted longer and went a little further. The pattern of daily texting continued and we met up 2 or 3 more times. We ended up being intimate together and the sex was amazing. We have been intimate twice, with both times being intense and lasting for a long time. We even spent time completely naked after each session touching, talking and just enjoying each other's company.

So far so good, right? Yeah pretty much. So after the second time we were intimate I asked her if this meant we were ""Seeing each other..."" She said yes and said that she was not actively looking for anyone else, while I said the same thing.

There has been a period of about two weeks since we have last seen each other; with the last time we saw each other being the time we were intimate and had the discussion I just mentioned. There were some times where I was getting the vibe that she was a little less enthused for texting than she had been, though she had been fighting a bad cold, had to miss work and just wasn't feeling good. This was the reason why we had to cancel a scheduled date.

We have continued our daily texting and have had a few phone calls. While texting one night I told her some things I really liked about her and that I wanted to keep vibing with her. She said that we should ""definitely keep vibing"" and we have continued to have great daily texts and phone calls.

I also believe that she may have some mental health concerns, which I totally understand, as those types of situations have impacted my life as well. I believe she may have PTSD, as she has hinted at a few things, and is actively in therapy. I haven't been to pushy on this subject, as I know from experience that it is very personal. Being as I work from home and have opportunity to text all the time, I sometimes get anxious when people don't text back immediately. I recognized this and told her that I don't want our texting to be a burden and that she is in no way being pressured to respond immediately. She thanked me for saying that and said that yes she is a person who needs her alone time and sometimes doesn't get back quickly to text messages.

She is finally feeling better and we are going to a show tomorrow that is about a two hour drive from the city we live in. We have both been excited for this and I cannot wait to see her again. I have missed seeing her these past two weeks, though I am thankful we have maintained positive, ongoing communications aside from being able to see each other (we live about a 25 minute drive from each other...)

We have a lot in common, we get along good, we communicate well and we have had enjoyable intimate time together. I kind of think we are already exclusive based on our earlier talks, but am not sure. I like her a lot and she says that she likes me too. I want this to be exclusive and for us to continue ""vibing"" together to see where this goes...

Any advice on how to talk about this in a safe, no pressure way? Keep in mind that I don't want her to spend all of her time with me or to commit to a lifelong relationship. I just want to make it 'officially' exclusive. Also, with the fact that she may have PTSD or at the very least some mental health issues that she is working on, I want to have this talk but don't want to do so in any way that might put pressure on her or make her feel like I am trying to force anything on her that she doesn't want.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t692rd/when_and_how_to_have_the_exclusivity_talk/

43,t6eu7a,1646384362,Will he come around- should I even want him to? *very long- just trying to give the true big picture,"I (f43) recently broke up w my bf (m45) after 1.5 yrs bc he wasn’t future-minded. We met during COVID lockdown and pretty much lived together. We had some very early struggles w a fwb (also nearly 20yrs younger) that he didn’t want to sever ties w bc ‘they were and could be friends’ but I wasn’t comfortable with them hanging out bc they had had sex during the early stages of us being together- although it wasn’t until later that he disclosed that, but I had to put my foot down bc I wouldn’t ever feel comfortable w them hanging out. It took months of  fights, but eventually he knew that it wasnt something that I would ever feel ok with if we were going to continue being together and he finally ended their relationship. Things were great for a long time after that tension was removed. We share the same interests, get along well with the people in one another’s lives, the sex is good and often… then the world started to open back up. He is in entertainment and a gig worker. He had essentially been unemployed for a while during the pandemic bc there was no work for anyone in the performance industry. When things started opening up again I noticed that he would go out for gigs and for fun too (the leisure part w friends also totally normal) but there started being occasions when he would blow me off even though we had set plans -bc he got caught up in his evening out. I was forgiving at first, but then started to realize that I needed to set boundaries bc it felt hurtful and I didn’t feel like the way I wanted to be treated by the person I loved and was committed to. There was a night in particular that I remember bc we had spoken earlier to confirm plans and I had gone to the store expressly to get everything we might need to cook a nice dinner together when he came over at the time we had planned for. But it got later and later and there were excuses and justifications about why he’d be out just a little bit longer until it got so late that he eventually said something like- I know you have work tomorrow, so maybe we do it tomorrow. I am a teacher, so I have to be in early-no exceptions. I have to be on point so I can give my students the best I possibly can every day because I have them for 180 days and I owe them that. We all remember our elementary teachers- good or bad, they shaped us. But I have stayed up later than I would if he weren’t around and eaten dinner at crazy late hours bc I wanted to support him in his creative ventures. But in hindsight, there were a bunch of times he prioritized what he wanted to do over my feelings. Sometimes it was just drinking with bartenders he was friendly with. All that being said, the good in our relationship outweighed the bad. But anytime moving forward in the relationship was brought up, he found an excuse or hurdle or some way to poke holes in that being a good idea. Most recently  - about 3 wks before Valentine’s Day, I had suggested we go away just us for the weekend for a change of scenery the wkend before. I have a friend that has a little spot in a farm town that she and her husband weren’t using that wkend and they were happy to lend it to us for the occasion. It was when I suggested it as a fun idea that he let me know he was flying to see his mom for a few days including that wkend. His mom is awesome (also very alone) and I support their relationship and we all FaceTimed when he was there, so it was nothing nefarious- except it kind of sucked was a totally unilateral decision on his part that I was filled in later about. But still, no biggie. And he was going to be back for Valentine’s Day, so it was going to work out ok. I asked my friend if we might be able to go use their home the following weekend- it worked out that we still could and he and I talked about it-in fact we actually talked about it with other people- and they remember us discussing it too. Fast forward to valentines night- the first time I had seen him in a week. I was excited. I tried to look nice for him; I made sure to be on time. We met for a fun activity before and then dinner. At dinner he told me that oh by the way- he was going to bartend that wkend at a bar where he used to work and still sometimes occasionally fills in. I honestly don’t love when he bartends bc he always gets really drunk and sometimes can be rude or dismissive towards me at the end of the night. Still, I know he can be of help to the manager (who I like very much) when the guy is in a tough spot, so if we don’t have anything going on, ok. But I was disappointed bc we had a special getaway planned. He told me he ‘forgot we had plans’ and the manager really had no one else to work. I asked if he could explain- just like he had to me -that he forgot he had a prior commitment. But he said no- they absolutely needed him and he was going to work. I felt disappointed but didn’t want to argue so I excused myself a from the dinner table and went to the bathroom to take some deep breaths and talk myself into realizing that it wasn’t something I wanted to ruin our valentines night over and we could sort out later. We finished dinner and even went out for drinks after. We had fun! We were socializing with other people and all seemed well. Then when we were in the subway home (we weren’t even seated anywhere near each other) I guess there was some reference to that situation and didn’t nod my head when he asked if we weren’t going to talk about it anymore. I don’t even remember hearing him ask, but next thing I new he walked out of the subway car. I was shocked. Next thing the doors closed and the train started moving. The train left the station. I text to see if he had in fact really  left or just maybe moved to another car. He replied that he had left and that he didn’t want to hear it from me and argue all night. At this point is was about 130am. The walk to my home is about a mile from the station. And the thing is, I wasn’t even arguing- and never want to-he just likes to say that I’m trying to start a fight anytime I express that I’m upset or am disappointed about something he does. I felt very abandoned in that moment. It’s not a terribly unsafe walk home, but still. It didn’t help that I had a few special gifts that I had taken a lot of time to hand-make for him and tickets to a concert that I knew we would both enjoy, some sexy new lingerie- the whole bit. About an hr after he left me on the train on valentines night, we spoke very briefly and he told me he thought we should take a break. He said he wasn’t mad at me, that he was just sad, that he loved me and it wasn’t a sexual break where he would hook up with other women and that he hopes I would think about who we are and our expectations of the other person. For nearly two weeks I gave him space. I didn’t reach out. When he sent me any occasional message (2ce) it was with a very different tone than I had ever gotten from him. Eventually-nearly 2wks later he suggested we talk. During our time apart I tried to handle my emotions and sadness in healthy ways- I rejoined the gym that I quit during COVID, I tried to make as many plans with friends and family as I could,I kept myself busy projects etc.. and when I went to go speak with him I brought his things that he kept at my place. I assumed he was going to break up w me or that he would feel relieved when I broke up with him. That wasn’t the case. When I went over to meet him we talked  hours-730pm to 2am. I cried (he never does) but I truly could tell how sad he was when I said that I felt it best we end the relationship. He even said that he maybe does want the things that I do. As much as I wanted to hear that and believe it, I am not completely convinced it wasn’t disingenuous and just a way to keep me on the hook a little longer. He’s 45 and never been married and his last relationship was for about 5 years. They never lived together or moved the relationship beyond dating exclusively (despite her wanting more- and I only know this bc I asked recently when evaluating the possibility of our future outcome).  He is fiercely independent and that’s cool,but I do want to settle down with someone and have shared goals and with a person that can visualize a blended kind of life where we are a team and work towards bigger plans and goals for ourselves together. To note, I am a homeowner, have job security, a pension plus independent retirement savings, and incredible family and friends. I am ok with or without him, I just wanted him. Since I ended things, he has forwarded stuff on Instagram or shared his Wordle score for the day etc- but nothing of real meaning. My question is this- while I do still want to feel connected to him bc I love him and miss him and know there is something very special about us and our chemistry and connection (and I admittedly so wish he would run back and bang on my door and say that he’s ready to take the chance on us and actually follow through with actions, I’m not sure it’s going to happen- so) should I cut off all contact while the dust settles and until I can truly look at him like a friend? I still hear a text notification and hope it’s him. I see he forwarded me something on Instagram and have to use a lot of restraint to not open it immediately. But he’s not fighting for us - maybe it’s bc he never will, maybe it’s bc I’m still engaging w him during this time while he is also at liberty to do whatever with whomever.. I’m not over him though. You can’t shut off love that easily- not in my book at least. He has made BIG life changes during the course of our relationship as a result of my encouragement and convincing. Sometimes I feel like that is a show that even though maybe a bit resistant, he just needs the push. I guess I’m hoping us breaking up is the push he needs to see that he wants me in his life. Maybe he won’t, but I’m trying to take care of myself in the meantime and it will be ok no matter what ends up happening. But again- would it be better of I sever all contact completely until he figures it out or keep that casual connection? And should I tell him I think if I think is us  not talking for a bit is best or do I just not reply anymore and go quiet?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t6eu7a/will_he_come_around_should_i_even_want_him_to/

We both were friendly when we were married and after both of our divorces we started hanging out more and eventually became official. We had a big fight not too long ago and she “broke up with me” but we were back together after that week. While we were broken up I decided to check out dating apps and I’ve got a couple of matches but ended up deleting the app when we got back together. Now it’s our third fight around the similar topic (us being long distance there are some trust issues). 

During that week though I realize that there are other people out there. I never dated much before I got married so I never had that experience. Now I got a taste it’s sort of addictive. I would like to experience what dating is like but I also don’t want to ruin things with my girlfriend. It would break my heart if I ever broke hers. I don’t know what to do. I can ignore the urges and not going on the dating sites but the thoughts are there and I wonder if that will end up causing issues down the road. I don’t want to cheat on her because I’m not that type and she deserves better than that.

50,t6shns,1646426716,So. Much. Pain.,"Hey, everyone.  I lurk here a lot and don't post very much, but I just need a place to dump my pain right now.  After what felt like 500 Tinder dates and many shenanigans, I met someone IRL about 9 months ago.  I didn't actually ""meet"" him, as he was someone I had seen around a lot due to a shared hobby.  I got divorced last year and he and I got to talking at an event we both attended.  The connection was INSTANT.  One of those things where you just feel bonded to someone.  He lives about 5 hours away from me, but after that first day, we talked every day.  We texted all day long, and we saw each other at events, which are about every 2-3 weeks from spring - fall.  When winter came and there were no more events, we tried to get together.  He was selling a house and buying a new one, my work had me running all over the country for a few weeks.  The usual stuff you run into in relationships, especially over the holidays.  But the distance made everything that much harder.  Next thing you know, we hadn't seen each other in nearly 3 months.  We still talked and texted every day, but we were both having a hard time with the distance.  He told me 2 days ago that he just can't do it anymore.  While he loves me and he knows I love him, the distance is too much.

I am absolutely dying.  I am in so much pain, I can't believe it.  It's not like I haven't dated since my divorce - I have.  I even had a relationship that lasted a couple months, so it's not like some ""first love"" type of thing.  But since the day we started talking, there has been no other man in my life.  It was just that simple - there was no room for anyone else.  It's killing me that I know how he feels and he knows how I feel, and it's still not enough.  Our lives won't allow either of us to move - we're both established in our careers, we both have grown kids in our respective areas.  I know t his will pass eventually, but I am paralyzed with grief right now.  This man is everything I want and I can't have him.  I gave my whole heart to him and I just don't know what to do right now.

61,t724js,1646456961,Lost virginity at 40: I'm a mess😔,"Hello. I've been following reddit stories for quite some time now. That's because I myself have a lot of isues needing to be solved, and I read and search in hoppes of an answer hiden inside a story similar to my own. Somehow I find that hard to believe, although my depression and anxiety maybe clouding my judgement.
Well, enough with the 'prelude'. To keep it simple: I'm a 41 year old man, very shy, who was brought up by a very controling and posessive mother. Dont get me wrong: my parents were low income workers, who busted their ass off to provide for me and my siblings (and indeed we always had food on the plate and clothes to wear)... but she kept us on a tight leach (to prevent any harm to come to us, has she once told me). So forget about the usual stuff any growing teenager takes for granted: his first party (or sleep over) at a friends house; his first night outs with friends; his first girlfriend; his first kiss; his first sexual encounter... 
So, as to make it clear: I wanted all those things, sometimes really bad... but something prevented me from 'streching' my arms, and I quickly asumed it was for the best, lest mommy got angry. In time (colledge; first job, etc...) when everybody was out partying and having f/x, I was at home, watching tv and hearing music. And thus I began to love my golden cage. Many years went by, and 5 years ago my father past away. Bells started ringing in my head. The mortality of the human beeing became a reality, so I started therapy to work on myself. Of course, by this time I was 38. Allas, with my sister and mother as matchmakers, I got myself a girlfriend. I got myself my first kiss, first time helding hands... well: my first of everything. And I did it 10 hours short of my 40th birthday. Sufice to say the relation didnt last long. I felt like a child learning to walk, with a woman 4 years younger then me, but much more expefienced. I felt like an idiot. I felt humiliated. I felt inferior. I didnt knew how to proceed in bed (which, having a 10 cm penis, didnt helped). And for her part, she was extremely posessive and capable of holding a grudge for everything (which was one of the reasons that drove me away from her...).
So here I am! 2 years later, having banged one woman only, and torturing myself: I feel like I lost my prime years. All those things I didnt do, I just cant go back for them. But I cant bring myself to accept that it hapened, and its no big deal. I work with kids, teenagers, so I'm reminded constantly of what I lost or didnt do (AND ITS EATING ME UP INSIDE!) I cant come to terms and accept it in order to move on. I just cant. I should... but I cant! And my ex-girlfriend would actually describe me what she did in bed with such and such (although never indicated a specific body count). I feel cheated by fate. I sense that any woman joining me by this time, will want a man to sit in his sofa at night, smoke his pipe, kiss his wife good night, and go to sleep. BUT THA'TS NOT WHAT I WANT DAMMIT! Besides: how many women has a normal guy had by my age? And when women actually reach my age, despite the fact that they gave it away for free without asking in their youth and teens, they expect a companion to take bare minimum, as if they (women) are a valuable catch, and we simps are lucky enough to have them. It really boders me to read and listen to boys who could have been my students not a while back, to actually know more about these things then me. I mean... how do you go about to kiss a girl, to say you're in love with her? And who were their previous parteners, and what did they do in bed with them? And what if I dont live up to the expectacion (in bed and otherwise).
I need peace of mind and accept this, or the 'washing machine' will keep spining...

It’d seem like there’d be more time available with a woman who doesn’t have kids at home, but most probably wouldn’t be thrilled for my other time commitment to my kids (as always, it depends on the person). I’d also understand if people, whose kids just graduated from HS, would want to enjoy life and activities w/o kids for the first time in forever.

Now I've got a crush...tell him or nah?","I was new to online dating, met a nice chap, and he followed up perfectly—asking me to a nice dinner. At the time I felt like I had to decide if I was really interested in dating him because accepting would mean ""leading him on."" I couldn't decide, felt like ""if it's not hell yes, it's no"", and said I felt more like a friend vibe. He respected that gracefully and invited me to ""be friends"" when we bumped into one another. 

Life began to throw us together, and then I made an effort to cross paths ""accidentally."" Every time I saw him since, I liked him a little more, but there was something that kept me from escalating. Sometimes we talked about other relationships we were in or pursuing. 

Over the pandemic, he leveled up hard, mostly mentally. My crush went from ambiguous to unmistakeable. Now, whenever I see him, I am an anxious MESS. I embarrass myself pretty much on every interaction and just cannot act chill. I feel like I'm not even myself...just a blathering idiot. 

He's a gregarious person and has always given me little compliments or noticed if I made a special effort, but I'm not sure that's unique to me. I'm not getting obvious signs that he's interested. He's a bit of an absent minded professor type, and I'm not sure he has any idea I like him. I'm dropping hints, but I think he's a bit clueless in the female attention department.

81,t7jpfk,1646516961,Advice needed - sorry for the length of the post,"So I've been dating a woman for 7 months and we have both been juggling our hectic lives to see each other and the times we have spent together have always been great.  We get to see each other about twice a week and we both have children.  Around the 3 month mark we did have a situation where she was doubting the future of the relationship due to the amount of time we get with each other but since then we have managed it and things have been great.  She initially ended the relationship and I backed off but she came back to me within a few days.

She does not communicate how she is feeling so its hard to get an understanding of things with her.  Earlier this year we had a date night with her staying at mine and we ended up in a huge argument where she was raging at me, and honestly I was so confused. Drink was involved.  The next day she came over and apologised and said she thinks she is perimenopausal and ultimately got HRT for this.  I understood and supported her where I could, and educated myself on perimenopausal stages.  Since then I have experienced again with her in February but she brushed over it and said she couldn't remember and we are fine.  She doesn't open up and communicate very well at all (her words).  

Early Feb this year she was under a lot of stress with work, home life and kids, etc and slowly started to fade on the communication again to the point of not coming back to confirm plans when we had indicated that we are both free on the weekend.  We talked and again she went off on one so I left her place and sent a message to her when I got home.  She replied to my long message saying that there is too much to explain on text and she will come over the next day to talk.  She did come over but dismissed it and said everything is fine, but doesn't remember all she said.  She was drinking but I was driving that night.  

So that's all the bad stuff.  In between these occasions we have a great time together, sex is amazing, we don't argue apart from the above situations, talk on the phone regularly, text, and she tells me that I'm the best thing that has ever happened to her, how lucky she feels and she loves me. 

Around a week and half ago I messed up and caused an argument after a shitty day at work and I wrongly vented it towards her and misunderstood what she was saying.  I apologised straight away but she wanted to leave, which I respected.  I gave her some space and tried to talk to her after this but she is cold and has now finished the relationship stating that too many issues keep cropping up mostly on her part or because of her.  I know she has had bad relationships in the past and her kids father doesn't see their children so she has done everything on her own.  

So questions:  Do I walk away or try and save the relationship? I love her and she says she loves me.  Its her birthday next week and I have already purchased a spa day for her to get some 'her' time and relax.  It wasn't cheap.  I'd still like to give it to her even if this is the end.

I joined OkCupid a little while ago and I was wondering,  for those men with experience on dating apps - Do you typically just look at the pic and decide to ""like"" or do you read the profile first? 
I have had guys that have ""liked"" me and I responded by liking them and initiating a conversation, but then get no response.
Just kind of curious how men approach dating apps.


Let me know if this was the wrong area to post this question.

89,t7y7vy,1646571471,Moving to increase your odds? Would you if you could?,"Hello all you Wonderfull people! 

  I realize this question has been asked in various forms over the years, but I feel like mine is specific enough to warrant another go.

Im a 47 year old guy, fit, active, moderately attractive, professional with a great career who has no kids and currently single. I moved to a semi-large southern/midwestern city a year ago as a career move and while it IS fairly large, its very rural in personality. Theres limited growing industry here; you might call this place a dying city.Its a pretty horrible place to date as a single non parent, educated well-traveled guy. There are limited single people and its not really transient enough to have anyone new come through (lets just say that I can start bumble and get through all potential matches in a single day).  Overall,  Im pretty unhappy here and even though the work is amazing, I don't think I can say.  

All that said, I may have just been thrown a lifeline. I was just soft-offered a promotion to a global role where have responsibilities in several places in the US and also in Europe. While this will require me to travel more, I'll have no home base requirements. My company is large enough that all the US states are fair game. I would have peers that live I AZ, NC, TX, PA etc.

  My thoughts on all of this is that while I feel like a bit of a leper here where Im at, there are parts of the country that Im quite the catch. Whenever I travel to certain areas, and turn on my apps its a night and day difference for me specifically. Some of these areas, I would be really into living for some other reasons as well (activities, weather etc) so what Im thinking is while Im learning the new job, I could travel to my top 3-4 locations that fit this bill and stay in an AIRBNB for a month or two while I feel out the area and the dating potential. This feels like such an exciting thought that It has me really energized... However, Im not sure how it would read to the opposite sex. Would they think Im hiding a wife in another state (Im certainly not) ? Would they think less of me because Im not settled down in a house in the suburbs? 

What do you all think ? Would you move to an area you like because it increases your odds? Women, what would you think if you met a guy that was doing this?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t7y7vy/moving_to_increase_your_odds_would_you_if_you/
90,t7z65m,1646574733,Roast me?,"After reading this sub for a few weeks, I’m wondering how good of a dating candidate I am. I’ve been surprised at some of the opinions I’ve read here about people who are separated and newly divorced, so I’m just wondering what different people think based on my situation. As an FYI I am not ready to date yet so this is like research for me so I know what to expect when I finally get back out there. 

F47 
—Separated for 7 months, divorce will be final in the next couple of months
—This will be my 2nd divorce
—Stable career, financially independent, no debt
—I own my own home
—No kids, just a dog and a cat

If it matters:
—First marriage was 10+ years, we got married young and it just didn’t work out
—2nd marriage was 4 years (10 years together total) and he cheated on me while I was away taking care of my dying mother so I left him",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t7z65m/roast_me/

Problem is, I am a mint professional myself and goddamn, having a mint partner would be very exciting for me, cause it is just a lot of shared knowledge, interests and learning effects. And it is an exageration close to a lie, right? Maybe others wouldn't care, but for me it was an enormous plus.

I am 34 years old. Looking back, I was divorced, and I thought my last relationship would last forever.

It's good that I'm single, but it's good to have someone I can live with.

I can't find anyone in Los Angeles. In the last 3-4 years, it was hard to find anyone. I feel like giving up. But I still hope one day I can have a family of my own.
