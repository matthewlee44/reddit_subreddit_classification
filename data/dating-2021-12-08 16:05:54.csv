Then one day I came to work and I looked cuter than usual. I wore a little bit of mascara and did my hair nice. (I always look nice and presentable at work but this day I did my hair different). Then he came in and said, ""are you new here?"" and I said, no.. I've ring you up all the time. And he said how he's never noticed me before. Then he was with his mom and she was bragging about how he's a personal trainer, almost like she was trying to set us up. He then asked for my number and I gave it to him cuz I felt pressured because his mom was right there. And btw I am NOT attracted to him!!!!!!!!!!! 

Anyway, he texted me and I just ignored his messages. So he comes into my work again with his mom and goes, ""did you get any of my messages?"" and again, because the mom was there I lied and said no, my phone was broken. It was just so awkward. So then he texted me again and this time I have been responding to avoid another awkward interaction at work but he doesn't get the point. I am so dry and uninteresting in my texts and he STILL keeps trying to keep the convo going. GET THE POINT DUDE! He kept calling me adorable and that he thinks I'm someone that he can really relate to.... he literally doesn't know anything about me. It just rubs me the wrong way because he only is saying this because he thought I looked cute. He NEVER noticed me before, now he's being all sweet cuz he thinks I'm attractive and telling me he likes my mind. He really rubs me the wrong way and I would just tell him in not into him but he's kind of creepy, idk he creeps me out. I don't want to make it weird for myself when I go to work. What should I do?

We quickly become very close and eventually started dating when she left her bf at the time. 

We dated for 2 and half years. I fell in love, we saw each other regularly, we were in talks for moving in together. 
We traveled a lot together and made a lot of memories. 

Then after I graduated I needed to take a break from life and left for a solo backpacking trip through USA and Mexico that was supposed to last two and half months. 

A month in, we became distant. Then she messaged me saying she wasn't optimistic about our future. Then she broke up. 

She's been avoiding any sort of conversation ever since. When I came back from my trip, she was still avoiding meeting me face to face to talk about things (at least to give me peace and closure)

Since I had the keys to her apartment i went over to her place to get all my stuff back, and details from her apartment lead me to understand that she had someone new. 

It's been 6 weeks since the breakup. I feel sad everyday. Sometimes I'm doing normal things like doing dishes or cooking and just break down crying out of nowhere. 

She was my love and my best friend, and i feel abandoned and betrayed.

M&amp;f Both 20 

I've been seeing this girl for a relatively short period of time and all had been going well, however she'd recently suffered a family bereavement and whilst texting and arranging plans, I didn't give her enough space.

 In hindsight i should have just backed off until winter break is over with and then attempt to reconnect. However i feel i was being way too eager and not getting the message.  I've had more than my fair share of bereavements and feel this may have dulled my sympathy, without even thinking that this could have been her first. I am also not aware of how close they were. 

It culminated with her sending a strong but civil message that she didn't want to meet at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly do not truly believe she'd lost interest in me, as previously everything had been going well and it wouldn't make sense to use a bereavement as a means to finish the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be wise to message her after the winter break, after allowing her to process her emotions and atleast leave the offer of rekindling our relationship on the table? I feel like i should ultimately apologise aswell for bothering her when she was clearly grieving and wouldn't have been in the correct head space to date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc3vo7/insensitive_messages/

14,rc3ybg,1639006192,(21f) Repressed but beautiful and charismatic girl from class. I'm (24m),"So, I got the courage to hit this girl up through email to 'study' outside of Zoom in our language class because we really hit it off in class when we got partnered up multiple times over the course of our term.

She always has had her camera on in class, and I never thought about it before, but her walls were always bare. Just a girl, in an empty room, with nothing on the walls. Strange, but I never thought much about it because I was always engaged in our conversations or making her laugh while we studied.

We were chatting in our extracurricular zoom sesh, things were great, she's highly intelligent, beautiful, has a great sense of humor, and just seems so innocent. She even practically speaks three languages! Which, I'm really interested in. I love language learning.

All of a sudden she hits me with a bombshell. She was almost shy to say it. I think she was embarrassed.

""I'm not vaccinated because of my religion.""

I was totally shook, but I played it off like it was cool. I asked her what religion she was apart of, and she wouldn't tell me. She just said the closest thing she could think of is like Judaism. She also mentioned that she can't do anything on Saturdays because her religion denies people in the religion from doing anything pleasurable on Saturdays. My friend said she's a Seventh-day Adventist. Do Seventh-day Adventist's not get the vaccine though? I told her I wasn't religious and she was cool with it. I definitely have a problem with her not being vaccinated, but I feel like deep down she knows its wrong. I think her family controls her life.

Apparently she lives with her mom and her brother. I kept talking to her and we got to talking about where she was from. She got really kind of sad (it looked like I could've made her cry if I pressed it) and she just said that her family moves around a lot and she has never stayed in one place for long, but that she likes it in this state (US) the most and she's always wanted to come back here. Multiple times throughout the call it seemed like she wanted to cry when I would ask her personal things. And at one point I swear she was speaking in codes to me, which is a little hard to put into quotes, but it had to do with how it's not good for people to feel trapped. This really hurt my feelings, and I legit wanted to reach through my computer to hug her based on how she was acting. Also I'm pretty sure her brother was listening to our conversation the whole time because she would look over a lot as if someone were in the room and she mentioned her brother was standing in the doorway earlier in the call lol. I thought he was just playing around or something.

Things she does for fun include-

\-walking her dog

\-studying

\-listening to old classical instrumental music

\-watching appropriate movies

\-drinking coffee

... how sad is that? She's way too young smart and charismatic to have that be all she does in life....

We talked about music, language, history, going on a date to a tulip festival; rose garden; a market pertaining to class, and just a bunch of other really cool stuff that made her really smile. Part of me wishes I never had hit her up in the first place because I don't want to hurt her feelings, but part of me is happy that I could make her smile like that.

I guess I just don't know what to think? Obviously I shouldn't date her, but holy fuck I feel so guilty if I just cut her off. She is such an intelligent, beautiful, funny, charismatic young woman my age; but she seems so repressed. I think her family is lowkey kind of keeping her hostage. I don't know what I would do either if thats all I knew my whole life. And I really make her laugh so much. It really breaks my heart.

I guess I just don't know what to think. In the perfect world I would love to be her Alladin and show her the world. But I know that's not likely. What do you guys think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc3ybg/21f_repressed_but_beautiful_and_charismatic_girl/

17,rc40zj,1639006414,Should I move on or keep trying?," 

So I met this girl on Hinge and we started texting the ice was broken immediately we just kept texting for hours and then she asked me on a date for the next day. The date went well it was a movie date, we talked for 30 minutes straight before the movie started and even during the movie. I made a move to to put my arm around her during the movie and she cuddled up right next to me like she knew me for years. After the movie we take a bus back to her house and hangout a bit, then we start watching some comedy movies and were laughing and having a good time. We started cuddling again and before I have to leave and I give her a hug goodbye.

I made it clear from the start when I first met her on hinge that I was not interested in hookups and I was looking for something serious.

sounds like a good date right?

well the next day I text her telling I had a great time and we should do something again sometime and she says something like ""absolutely!""

however after that she takes hours to respond to my texts, and didn't respond to the last one until the next day. I know she had work that day so I didn't think much of it, however the following day she told me she had a day off but started taking even longer to respond to my messages and she just didn't seem at into as she was initially.

I thought our date went perfectly, we were both smiling and laughing the whole time and she even shared some very personal stuff. but it seems like she's trying to just fade out, or maybe I'm just overthinking?

what do you guys think, I'm only 18 and the last time I was in a relationship was when I was 13 so I am not very experienced

TLDR:

Met a girl on hinge  
she asked me out  
great first date, that lead to me going to her house after (no sex just cuddling)  
started to take a long time to reply the following days after the date

he didn’t like to ft, or really talk on the phone so that was out of the picture. i work 40 hours a week, and am in school too but i still tried to at least make one day out of the week to see him. i made all the plans too, he said he’s a “homebody” and that’s why he doesn’t plan stuff for us to do which is an excuse . i told him we can’t always use this excuse forever. then Monday, i told him how i felt and said if u don’t wanna be with me tell me . he said it’s best if we broke up because we “ clearly aren’t happy and are only hurting eachother more “ . he said i was clingy but i don’t expect his attention 24/7. it just hurt because he promised a lot, he promised forever and he made me feel a lot and i never had that connection with anyone else. 

I’m scared i won’t get that connection or find someone like him even though I’m only 19. i told him it’s gonna hurt when i see him with someone else , and he said it’s gonna hurt him too but how he never wants to let me go and how he wants to still be friends and i said how can i be just friends with someone i did so much with? S he kept saying in the future will be our time and we just need to get our heads clear right now but we can build it up again in the future, and he’s willing to start over. he said hopefully our time comes soon but i told him look at all of these couples that have bee n together for years and years , they don’t give up on eachother they work it out. he said “ yeah, but obviously I’m sure some break up to get themselves together and get back together “ . idk how to feel, I’m hurt but in shock he broke the promises i once believed . he tested up on the phone while we were talking for 40 minutes and i was crying , im not sure if i should even believe him about the working it out in the future thing. do i wait? or no? ..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc4h8q/is_his_breakup_reason_valid/

24,rc505y,1639009422,Any way to get in touch with a flight attendant after a flight?,So I was returning on a long flight a few days ago and had asked a flight attendant out on board for a drink after the flight. She laughingly said she was tired and not today. Then she asks me how long I am going to be in the destination and if I have a connecting flight however I was to leave the next day. She tells me she can give me her number to which I said sure and she says she will be back and give it to me. I wasn't really sure how it would be worth it in that moment as I was to leave the next day and so I didn't take my phone out and get her number right there on the spot. Then towards the end of the flight when she was making her way down the aisle checking seat belts she tapped me on the back and said hey. I kind of regretted for not getting her number and I think I may have given off the feeling that I wasn't interested enough to get her number. I don't like to doing that to anyone and I may have came across as rude as I initially asked her out then acted cold. So recently I took some time to fill out a feedback form for the airlines on the website and was honest by saying I had a quite friendly interaction with one of the cabin crew members and provided her name. I also mentioned that there was some mutual interest in exchanging contact information and it would be great if the airlines could pass on my contact information to her if she has any interest in contacting me. If I were to straight up demand that they give me her contact information then the security issues may come up but I figured if they could ask her briefly whether its true someone had an interaction with you and if you'd be interested in having his contact information then it may work out well. I also knew some of the other cabin crew names on board since they had name tags and a quick search on facebook returned a few of them however I don't want to come across as someone creepy while messaging them and telling them to put me in contact with their colleague. Is there a non creepy way to message her colleague on facebook and come across as genuine about the whole thing and perhaps she'd put me in contact with her? Her colleagues also served me on board and I had moved seats after asking so they'd probably instantly remember me and they could easily verify with her whether it's true if she was asked out by a passenger. Overall I feel really down about a situation like this since I probably came across as rude and cold to her and probably should have handled it better.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc505y/any_way_to_get_in_touch_with_a_flight_attendant/

29,rc5jgx,1639011047,Putting himself before us,"I want to know what other people think about this.

My fiancé and I have been stuck in seperate countries for almost 2 years because of Covid and the border closures.

The borders are finally open now and i am supposed to be going back to him in a few weeks on Dec 28.

As soon as I told him the borders were open, the first thing he said was that he is going to book a trip to go back home and see his mum. 

I said ‘wait what, why is that the first thing you’re thinking about when I say I can come home finally’ and his reply is 
‘Because I want to go see her and you’re not going to tell me not to. I’ll see you after I get back from there’. He has been there twice in the last year already and they have never been that close. He also calls her every single night for over an hour when we have limited time to talk already because of the time difference right now. 

Not once has he talked about me coming back except for when we are having video chat sex and he will say I can’t wait to have sex with you again. That’s the only time he mentions it. 

Whenever I bring it up and that we need money for it and I need help with getting back and finding us a place and everything he says “I’m broke I can’t help you”.. he has also booked no time off at all for us to spend any time together after 2 years but he can afford to go On his own holiday and buy all these new guns and car parts and book time off for that trip. 

We are engaged, we are about to start trying for a baby and our wedding is very soon. I believe he should be focusing on me getting home to us and getting our house sorted and everything.

31,rc5las,1639011202,Is there anything I can do to lower my standards?,"I wouldn’t consider myself all that picky when it comes to women in general, however with dating apps, I find that I rarely swipe right unless I find the girl physically attractive. For example there’s this girl I met who lives in my building that I find insanely gorgeous, yet I see her pop up on Hinge and from her photos, I wouldn’t have even liked her. I see all these stats like men tend to swipe right on women more so than they swipe left, however I do not fit this mold in the slightest.

Unfortunately it seems that every girl I think is attractive based on their photos doesn’t share the same view of me as I NEVER get a match with any of the girls I send likes to. There have maybe been 1 or 2 times that I’ve actually gotten a match with a girl I was physically attracted to, however they just stop replying after literally one message. Any of the incoming likes I get are from women I do not find attractive in the slightest. 

With all that being said, I’ve concluded that I’m aiming way too high. I refuse to attempt to talk with or match with women I don’t find attractive because why would I waste their time? So I’m wondering how I can somehow lower my standards if that’s even possible. I know for a fact I’m aiming for women that are way out of my league appearance-wise and it’s destroying my self-esteem because none of the girls I’m into seem to feel the same way about me.

He seems the kind of person that doesn’t rush into things, and is quite passive or maybe a bit shy when it comes to romantic stuff.

First date was supposed to be just grabbing bubble tea but turned into a 3 hour trail walk. 

2nd date was about 8 - 9 hours this weekend; we had planned to visit a christmas market and go skating. I picked her up around 3:30 and the first part of the date went well. Then my dumbass didn't realize I would need a reservation on a Saturday night in downtown Toronto and we ended up walking restuarant to restaurant for an hour trying to find a place to eat. She didn't seem to mind and when I apologized because I live in the suburbs and don't venture downtown much so I didn't know, she seemed very cool about it. We still had a great time talking and walking around the city. We finally found dinner at a fairly nice place and had a lot of fun. At the point, when we got to the skating place, the rink was already closed. We took some pictures and just sat together for a while before walking back to my car. The date didn't go as smoothly as I hoped but I think it still went well and she had a good time. The one thing I messed up on was not kissing her (Which I plan on doing this date). We had gotten back to her place around midnight and I said I would walk her to her door. When I got to her door, she hugged me and I think gave me the sign that I should kiss her, I panicked and ran away. (stupid I know). 

Anyways, we texted a little the next day. The usualy ""had a great time"" and stuff and she told me that she is looking forwards to skating with me. So I asked her to see the lights at Casa Loma and then dinner followed by skating which she agreed. Over the last 2 days, we ended up changing the plans to skating, then dinner, then Casa Loma.

Now, I'm just confirming with her when I should pick her up and I decided I would ask if she'd like to come with me to the mall before we head downtown since I need to get my skates sharpened. After I asked that, I started having second thoughts. I'm scared I'm throwing too much at her and I don't want to make her spend 12 hours with me this early on. She didn't seem to mind the second date (When I apologized for keeping her out so late knowing she had to work the next day, she actually told me it was okay and she was expecting to be out even later).

Hi using a throwaway so no one I know sees this.

I have never kissed a girl or held hands or done anything sexual of that matter.

Dating was never really a priority for me before and I’m starting to regret it. I feel very left behind from my peers because they have all done that while I have just been focused on School and finding my passions. Because of this, I feel insecure about my inexperience in dating.

Side note: I’m not socially awkward or anything. I am actually very sociable! However, a lot of women I meet are either taken or im just not interested in them.

We went on a coffee date and walked throughout the park. He was very talkative and whenever I would intervene to make a comment he would interrupt me again and he would continue talking. It felt like he was telling me his whole life. I thought he was just nervous, but I enjoyed his company. I really wanted to kiss him. I flirted with him but then I backed down because he didn’t react to it. I wanted to continue getting to know him so we decided to carry this on by going into the city and explore around. Throughout the city he kept talking nonstop. Here I am trying to listening but he kept rambling, and whenever he paused he would looked at me waiting to say something. I just kept it short I was not paying attention most of the time. I really wanted to kiss him, but I controlled myself and turned away. (I wished I didn’t, maybe all of this would of been different) While walking he did put his hand around my waist which I liked, but I didn’t react to it right away. I wasn’t sure if it meant anything at that moment. He was giving me mixed signals. Eventually I also put my hands on his waist and at one point it looked like he wanted to hold my hand, but he backed down. Again he kept talking nonstop. We eventually went to eat dinner. This was a very awkward dinner. He kept talking and Im just eating and at the same time drinking lot of water (I wished I had wine) because I was getting food stuck on my braces lol. He looked very frustrated with me because I was making small talks. He didnt know that I had food stuck on my braces as I kept covering my mouth. This was embarrassing lmao.  The night was coming to an end and I tripped so hard on the concrete too.  I was laughing so hard but he was serious. The night ended with him giving me this awkward hug. So the next day I send him a text thanking him for the date and that I would like to go out again sometime. I wanted to try this again. Im not too quick to judge a guy on a first date. So he replied  back by saying that he was glad that I enjoyed the date and he enjoyed getting to know me (I was like really you did all the talking) but he only see me as a friend rather than pursuing a relationship. He also said that if I want to hang out as friends to just let him know. I was disappointed, he judged me too quick and put me in the friend zone lol.

When I meet a new guy I first want to start as friends and see where it goes. This date was embarrassing and funny in a good way from my perspective with all the things that has happened on my end. He probably thinks I am weird. I want to tell him what happened, but with that text I'm not sure if I should bother.

My question is, is he being sincere that if ""I would like to hang out as friends sometime to just let him now"" or that is something that is commonly said after a date. I want to try this again maybe I wont be put in the friend zone lol. What do you think.

i have a lot of conflicting thoughts when it comes to my relationship of 4+ years -minus last year we split for a bit but were still slightly talking. anyways we worked things out &amp; honestly i had seen a lot of growth from him that i needed to see &amp; also growth within myself. here we are approaching the 4th year &amp; i still have the same questions i’ve had all along. 

how does a couple last when they have extremely different values? is it even possible? am i wasting my time? 

i’m a heavy feminist, all about BLM &amp; that includes equality within all race, ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ+ community, classes, etc. i fully believe in this &amp; always have. my boyfriend however is pretty much the complete opposite &amp; it actually baffles me that i am even able to be with a person who carrie’s such dif views; bc with anyone else in my life, i don’t allow my values to be quieted. (not that he “quiets” them it’s more that we avoid talking about politics &amp; morals all together to avoid conflict). &amp; ik this isn’t healthy

when we got together we were 19 years old so we didn’t care about that stuff - but now approaching 24 years i’m like okay.. can i actually spend my future with someone where we differ so much ???

on the other hand we have a lot of great similarities &amp; enjoy being together. but i just worry that our moral values are too separate from one another… &amp; i’ve never seen myself being with a partner who believes in everything i despise… i’m about equality &amp; it seems like he is the classic republican (no offense to anyone who is)

We  went on a coffee date and walked throughout the park. He was very  talkative and when I would intervene to make a comment he would  interrupt me again. I was feeling overwhelmed at this point, I thought  he was just nervous. I flirted with him but then I backed down because  he didn’t react to it. I wanted to continue getting to know him so we  decided to carry this on by going into the city. He continued talking  nonstop. I couldn't keep up with him. While walking he put his hand  around my waist which I liked, but I didn’t react to it right away. I  wasn’t sure if it meant anything. He was giving me mixed signals.  Eventually I put my hand on his waist and at one point it felted that he  wanted to hold my hand, but he backed down. We eventually went to have  dinner. He kept talking but I  just kept drinking lot of water because I  was getting food stuck in my braces. He looked very frustrated with me  since I kept making small talks. The night was coming to an end and I  fell down so hard.  I was laughing  because I felt I was being punished.  The night ended with him giving me this awkward hug. I The next day I  send him a text thanking him for the date and that I would like to go  out again sometime. He replied  back by saying that he was glad that I  enjoyed the date and he enjoyed getting to know me, but he only see me  as a friend rather than pursuing a relationship. He also said that if I  want to hang out as friends to just let him know. I said I feel the same  way being as friends and wished him good luck on his work that he was  doing at the moment. He replied by saying thanks and you too. I was  disappointed, I wanted to give this another try and explain myself. At  this point with that text, should I even consider ""hanging out as  friends."" Is he being sincere about this or is he just saying that to be  nice. We did texted and talked alot before meeting in person and I felt  that we had chemistry.

Update on my last posts that keep getting deleted by mods.

I want to say first Thankyou to the people who try to help me.

What I didn’t mention in the other post, is that I live in his country. I moved here to be with him and have no family or friends in this country with me, which is why everything is so hard for me.

Today I called the ivf place and told them I won’t be doing any further procedures. And Even though I have very low chance of getting pregnant I went to the doctor and had a birth control implant put in that he will never be able to know is there. Not that I want to have sex with him anyway but just to be sure until I can leave. 

I will not be making any further wedding plans. I haven’t cancelled anything until I leave as he would find out and I’m scared. 

I tried to talk to him today one last time, and it went exactly the same As last time. 
I said “it seems weird to me that you spend hours on the phone to her every single day, which never used to happen, and that you immediately threaten me for even asking about it. That’s not a normal response to someone trying to talk to you about something”.

He again lost his mind and started laughing while he was screaming and swearing at me.
He told me ‘ you will never tell me when and how long I can talk to her for I’ll do whatever the fuck I want and you can get fucked and fuck off for life ‘ and then got straight on the phone to her and now he’s been on the phone to her for an hour and a half.

I feel really sad and different inside after these things. Please no one tell me I’m not doing anything to leave because I am. It’s really hard to leave someone you loved so much, especially when you’re alone apart from him. And especially when he constantly breaks you down totally to where you’re crying in a ball on the bathroom floor and then turns into his nice loving self and says how can I help you babe. 

I’m working on detaching myself emotionally as best as I can right now so it will become possible to leave. If anyone has tips on how to do this I would really appreciate it. I told myself just don’t care but it doesn’t work like that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc8a2s/follow_on_from_earlier_about_toxic_relationship/

I had actually messaged her a few weeks ago, but she ended up matching with me Saturday, and sent an answer to my leading question (about one of the hobbies she posted). We went back and forth a little Sunday and Monday, jobs, holidays, etc. It was usually a few hours between messages for both of us. I last messaged her Monday and included a question about another one of her hobbies. She still hasn't responded. Total # of message sent: Me: 5, her: 4. I decided to turn on ""read receipt"" and it does look like she saw it on Monday. 

Did I screw up by asking that one last hobby question? I was intending to ask to call or meet with my next message, but did I go one too far? Should I message her again tomorrow or Friday, something like ""I had a good time talking with you, was hoping we could call/meet."" (phrased better)? If I do that, should I be a bit more blunt, say ""I really like you...based on your profile."" or something similar but much better phrased? I just didn't think 5 messages was enough to make that next step. For further clarification, both of us \[seem to be\] are pretty conservative when it comes to relationships. Neither of us are looking to sleep together, and if what she says is accurate, we're both dating with an eye toward marriage at some point.

Recently, whenever my boyfriend texts me, I start to shake uncontrollably. It started a while ago, at a time when a lot of our texts were very serious in nature. We don't get the chance to see each other alone very often and calling is often inconvenient, so texting is the best form of communication we have. I have a tendency to get really nervous when I talk to him about serious stuff. But recently I've noticed that even when we're texting each other in everyday conversation, I start shaking out of seemingly nowhere, like I'm incredibly nervous.

Does anyone have any insight to this? I've brought it up to my boyfriend, and he feels really bad about it.

77,rc8usb,1639021543,Need advice - GF developed feelings for her friend.,"My girlfriend (24F) told me (23M) that she started to develop feelings for her friend at school. 

I knew they texted and hung out a lot but im not the type to tell my girl who to see and text.

She only started to catch feelings after he told her that he wanted to kiss her and she rejected him. She told me a few weeks later that she’s been thinking about him, wanting to text him and enjoyed the attention he provided.

This is all happening while my gf and I are the happiest we’ve been together. She told me she would never act on these feelings and wants to be with me. She also told me that she can’t guarantee that this wont happen in the future, but that still she would not act on it.

She asks herself a lot of questions like am I right for her and would there be a better person for both of us out there. I on the other hand dont bother myself with these things.

We have been together 2 years now and it feels like the time to make a decision on either ending it or committing to each other (not mariage but just commit to a future together and promise to always try and work things out). Is there a third option where we just stay together, knowing that it will probably end further down the road? Is it best to just end it early and not waist any extra time? 

We love each other a lot and dont want to break up now, but something feels off, like the only way this ends is me getting my heart broken. I need advice.

TLDR - My gf developed feelings for someone else now I dont know if I should brake up or try and commit to a future with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rc8usb/need_advice_gf_developed_feelings_for_her_friend/

Met a woman who is pretty spectacular so far. Been dating for a month. She also has a kid (6). We talk on the phone everyday. Have serious conversations as were both in our thirties and dating around just isn’t appealing anymore. Most days we click well but I’m a very emotional person and I can tell our love languages are different but we still relate on so many levels and I know we’re compatible. But if I feel a change in her tone, attitude, actions whether that be in person, on the phone, or through text, my mind automatically reverts to something negative. 

Like what did I do wrong. Did I say something bad? Am I being too emotional? Too romantic? Am I pushing her away? I hate when this happens because I can’t ever rationalize these thoughts. 

She wants to take things slow because she doesn’t want to bring another man in her daughters life for it not to work out so when we all hangout together, it’s like we’re friends. No physical touching at all and I respect that. But it’s hard for me though because I like holding hands, light touches, etc. 

I guess what I’m getting at is I don’t want to get burned again and I hate when I overthink and make up absurd scenarios in my head. Any tips to work on this?

When me and her first started dating I started to pick up she was wealthy, while myself is middle class, and my suspicion was confirmed when I went to her house that was easily three times the size of mine. Her Dad owns a business while her mom is a lawyer, they're extremely successful. They constantly talk about lavish trips and items and I just sit there amazed by how easily they spend money. 

I can't help but feel intimidated by it. Like I have to achieve the same wealth and accomplishments and I'm slowly starting to think her parents want me too as well. I'm in highschool and I'm still trying to figure what I want to do with my life and every time I'm with her parents they ask questions like what college I'm gonna go to or what I want to do with my life, when literally I few months ago I was considering being a mechanic. I want to impress them and more importantly I want to give their daughter they same lavish lifestyle they give her. I don't want to be the downgrade.

A couple of weeks back she asked me if I was seeing anyone else to which I said no and that I’m only interested in her. She also said the same to me. We also recently had a chat and agreed that we are seeing each other exclusively. 

So everything was fine for a while except for the fact that I always go to her house when we meet (we do make plans outside of the house aswell though). She always has an excuse as to why she can’t come here (usually that she has work the next day even though I do too). It’s not like we live far apart either, no longer than 3minutes in the car. 

The thing that’s confusing me is she actively messages me to make plans and then sometimes either bails on the day (or rather acts as if they were never solid plans) or sometimes stops replying half way through when we are making plans. I just really don’t understand what is going on here, one minute she is saying she likes me and suggesting more plans to do things together and the next minute she’s leaving me on read? 

If someone could give me some insight on what is going on here I would really appreciate it because I do have feelings for her but right now it’s unclear whether those feelings are reciprocated.

I’m just psyching myself out I think. But while I’m at it, I also worry about what life would be like if we did date. I’ve always had social anxiety especially around a partner’s parents.. the idea of meeting a doctor-boyfriend’s family is too much. I worry they’d see right through me and see how inadequate I am for their son.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rca34m/matched_with_a_doctor_on_tinder_anxiety/
96,rca8ad,1639026147,I need an advice…..,"Me (22M) and this girl (21) matched on hinge and we are dating for 2 months. We’ve never had sex but I kissed her a couple of times. We have been on many dates over 10+. 

We have not had sex because she is very hard to read physically (she is always like keeping her hands/legs to herself and stuff like that) I tried holding her hands twice and one of the times I think she felt uncomfortable. Also, I’m afraid of getting STD’s and I’m a virgin. 

We had a really nice night where we both said to each other that we really like each other. 

I recently (after 2 months of dating) was just showing my friends her hinge profile and I saw that she updated some things on her profile. A picture and those little tabs under the main picture.  I know she is “keeping her options open”. 

What should I do? Should I tell her about my sexual life and concerns? Should I talk to her about what she expects from us dating? Please help me. I really like her and I don’t like wasting time because I’m only looking for a serious partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rca8ad/i_need_an_advice/

Lets say you enjoy expensive restaurants or trips. What if he/she cant afford to join you!? Would you or other party feel comfortable to pay for the cost all the time?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcac5t/financial_compatibility/

I explicitly did not use the word date when asking her if to get lunch or go bowling for example. Any ideas?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcag40/date_or_hangout/
