5,rt9n97,1641004884,Indescribable feeling that I need clarity with,"I’ll start of by saying I’m a 21 year old straight male. Grew up in a household that was very dysfunctional - parents always fought, dad was an alcoholic and at his worst during the formative years of my life. 

When I was younger, I remember feeling like the world was falling apart when my parents fought - I remember wanting to do things to help patch them up. The thought of them splitting would traumatize me - I also remember feeling suffocated and shriveled up when my parents would ask my who I wanted to live with. 

All this being said, I’ve come out pretty headstrong… 

The point of this post (and the backstory) is me seeking help about this feeling that I’ve always had and have never been able to rationalize: when I was younger I hated the thought of looking at toys or anything else that regular kids (myself included) would collect and source a ‘certain child-like’ freedom. I remember going to the extent of wanting to get rid of them (I’ve throw them away a couple of times) to get rid of the pit-like feeling in my stomach. 

Recently, while I was at college (before winter break) - there’s this girl I really wanted to ask out but i had the same pit-like feeling that’s always kept me from getting what I want (emotionally).

What is this? Is it just regular jitters or something more? If I had to dissect it , it isn’t the ‘asking out that’s daunting, its what happens after

6,rt9o8z,1641004965,The best way to get a gf…,"This may or may not be the end all be all, but here goes… 

Stop being desperate. Stop actively and aggressively looking for a gf. Work and improve on yourself. With time and chance, someone will come along, see you for the great person that you became, and decide to want to be with you. Simple as that. 

This is to all my dudes who are just simply desperate for a gf just to make themselves feel good or happy or just to boost their ego. Trust me; not to brag or flaunt, but once I came to this realization, I decided to focus on myself and move away from “the game.” Although I am not yet in a relationship, things have finally come about to where I notice that someone finally seems to have an interest in me. 

Plz, improve on yourself with only your well-being in mind, and it’ll help you long term. And if you do improve and no partner comes still, well guess what? You’ll still be happy on your own, and with greater freedom, as you won’t have to consider the feelings of another person.

8,rt9wpp,1641005797,I don't get this guy?,"Hello everyone, happy new year.

As I'm trying to get better at dating and evaluating my worth, i still don't know how I can react or how i should react to certain ""things"" that dating brings since I'm a very romantically driven person.

I've been talking to this guy (26) i matched with on Tinder for about a week now. He was born and raised in my hometown in Greece but now lives in London. Since the beginning, he said that he's looking for ""friends"" considering the circumstances etc to which i replied ""There is no need to be a label, just go with the flow"".

Since we exchanged social media accounts we talked for some days. These days he seemed very interested, very sweet and very romantic. He was a little bit too much romantic at times (using the word ""us"" or things that imply a romantic intimacy) to which i am no fool and tried to be as rational as i could. He seemed to forget that he said the ""only friends"" scenario. Very weird.

We said that we should go out asap since the vibe was really good and this is where trouble starts. At first he said he wasn't sure when he would be able to and since he's leaving mid January, we could schedule it sometime. 
That was fine by me, after that, we didn't talk for one day, next day i text him and he leaves me on read after a very dry conversation, today he texted me and we chatted. I brought up the issue of going out again even suggesting some dates (to which he ignored) and his general response was ""I don't even know"".

Now i get that he might be busy with family etc but I don't really understand how you can ""supposedly"" like someone so much but have legit no time to set a date? I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt but it's all kinda BS to me.

Then I realized that I communicated over text differently than I did in person out of fear of being too offensive. I flame everyone in real life on complete accident lmaoo, and I realized this when I made a joke in front of a girl I met irl and she didn’t expect it… although my friends and people I’ve talked to before expect shit like that often. I use to offend absolutely everyone when I was in middle school two years ago because I say whatever I want 😭

But now I decided to start texting like a communicate in person, same jokes, same style and it’s working. I’m finally having normal conversations with girls and I want to meet some. Here’s the issue.

There is too much to choose from, I have about 5-6 I could pursue and get to know more but I don’t know which to choose because I wanna meet these people in person and see which one has the best vibes.

We had good chemistry over text and went on a first date. We held hands and made out, and a few days after the date he said that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match. 

But he wanted to have unprotected sex in his car on the second date and if it was good, we'd be in a relationship. I'm a virgin and didn't want to have my first time be in a car with a guy I only knew for a few weeks and only interacted with in person once before. He said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that us being in a relationship would be delayed until we did, because he needed to see how good the sex is first.

We stopped talking to each other shortly after that, but since then I've been going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and kicking myself for having a really attractive guy be really into me for the first time in my life and then me ruining it. 

I messaged him on social media last month and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted sex. He said that he did like me at first but I ruined it.

After thinking about it for a bit, I came to the conclusion that he actually ruined it. Taking him at his word, he was falling for me and liked me enough to see himself spending his life with me, but he was so insistent on unprotected sex on the second date, even though I didn't want to and was hesitant about it. That's not what I'm asking.

I'm just wondering if I phrased the question wrong, only giving him those two choices. Of course he would pick "" I ruined it"" out of the two choices to shift the blame to me, although admittedly I did say that I was okay with having unprotected sex on the second date at first, since I was afraid to lose this guy who said that he could see himself spending his life with me and might be my perfect match.

We’re texting most days and all that jazz - everything’s really clicking. Wonderful!

So everything’s going great. She’s super enthusiastic and would even insist driving way across town to spend just a bit of time with me some nights (she’d come to mine more than I to hers)

After a month of us being really into each other, I asked her to go to a museum on a Sunday, she can’t make it - no biggie.

We make plans for the Thursday but she cancels cos her brother got Covid (he’s in another city) and her Xmas plans were now a bit up in the air and generally she was down about her brother being sick - OK, no worries.

She gets in touch on the Saturday saying she’s still feeling low. I offer to come over or do whatever she wants, or nothing at all together, to try and cheer her up. She says thanks but no thanks …. Hmmmmm.
She’s expressed she wants some space at this point to deal with her shit and I totally respect that boundary.

Anyways, I gotta go visit my family for Xmas which is in another city. She initiated contact, wishes me a great trip and Christmas. I do the same to her and say if she wants to reach out and chat over the break, hassle me anytime. Once again I dont want to hassle and crowd her.

There are a few merry xmas texts checking in that get replies but kinda go nowhere over the break.

Then a week goes by ….. nothing.

So I address it by texting that things seem to have cooled off for some reason and if you want to call it off please communicate honestly with me so we don’t waste each other’s time.

She replies she has Covid (I feel terrible about her being sick) and that we should call it off because she “would hate to waste my time”. Ouch.

So, I’m sad and agree and respect her decision. But I’m just wondering what the hell I did wrong!?!

Did I blow it bringing it to a head with that text or was I a dead duck all along? Sounds like another guy maybe….?

Call me naive but I just don’t understand how someone changes tack like that! (Being so into me to shutting me out) I probably need a few days to get some space on this to see it properly.

39,rtcl6i,1641015512,Am I friendzoned? lol,"Ok the backstory: So I met a girl on a dating app, we went on a date two weeks ago but could not see each other again since because she went home for christmas break. During the date, she was playing with her hair and the talk was good, we hugged as we parted ways and she texted me first saying she had a good time. Since then, we've been texting and a lot of it is casual talk but I've hinted about going on more dates with her in the future, I've also joked with her and made her laugh and I've casually flirted with her here and there. All of this has been received well, she seems to look forward to future dates, she sends me good morning messages and she even flirted back with me a couple times.

Here is the problem, she calls me BESTIE and FRIEND lmao. Not all the time but once in a while. Is all hope lost?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtcl6i/am_i_friendzoned_lol/

I said I had fun and I would like to go out to eat and get to know her more. She said ""I'm flattered""...

At least I met some cool guys to play with lmao. 

Honestly am I expecting too much from trying to have a slight Convo before wanting to drive an hour plus to a date  to see if there's any similar interests? Bloody convos end up with short disinterested replies. I've been on 3 dates over the past 4 months with the 2 people who showed interest over text but it didn't work out for one reason or another.

42,rtcywj,1641016918,Where do I turn?,"I don't know how to title this post, because my situation is unique. But I will try and keep it short. Feel free to ask me questions about anything, whether that be below in the comments or my DMs.

Some background: I am a 22-year-old virgin man. I also come from an abusive background where I have consistently been taken advantage of. Because of this, I suffer with some mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. I have had to visit the hospital before, but I go to therapy, and I take medication. I feel pretty stable at this point. I am currently a sophomore in college but have no real home to call my own because I cut ties with my parents. I have several friends, but no one I feel comfortable fully confiding in (apart from one online friend).

I have precious little experience with women, but what experience I do have is not that great. I have tried dating apps, but that has almost always ended with me being ghosted (I barely get any matches to begin with). I have been introduced to a girl by a friend, but that didn't end well either and I was just strung along. I have even stepped outside of my comfort zone before: I've attempted a cold approach before (bad idea) and even acted on trying to start a relationship with a little crush I had (she stopped talking to me). I cuddled with a couple different girls, but the experience wasn't special to them in the slightest, and it crushed me.

I honestly have no idea where to turn. I think having a girlfriend would be awesome and maybe even help me out in some ways. It would be nice to be held and feel loved, you know? I want someone I can feel safe with. But I have had no luck, and I feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness day after day. I've lived a dark and pretty hopeless life. I want someone to share my life with now, instead of walking alone. I understand getting a girlfriend won't magically solve all my problems; hopefully I am not giving off that impression. And I understand that relationships are a two-way street, and I would also be there for her.

In short, I feel like I have exhausted all of my avenues to getting a good healthy relationship. I don't know what else to do. I am tired of waiting around and listening to the same old advice that, ""You'll find someone when you stop looking for them.""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtcywj/where_do_i_turn/

47,rtd7jw,1641017857,He bailed on me last minute because he wasn't feeling well BUT went to a new year's party the next day.....,"I don't know why I'm posting this. I think mainly because I'm really upset and write know and just want to vent.

He's my ""fwb"", who I'm attached to more than I'm supposed to. After him asking to see for month and me saying no because I knew he'd cancel last minute, I gave in and said yes. He seemed excited or so I thought. Not surprisingly, he cancelled five minutes before.   Here's how the conversation went.  

Me: ""How are you feeling?"" (2 hours before I wanted to make sure he didn't have any COVID symptoms)  

Me: ""Should I change?"" (20 minutes before our planned meet up)  

Him: ""No I'm not feeling well."" (2 minutes before)  

Me: ""Was it so hard to text me an hour ago?.""  

Him: ""Sorry, I haven't been feeling well.""  

Me: ""Is it COVID? Do you need a rapid test?""  

Him: ""No. I don't think so.""  

Me: ""Does it boost you ego....getting me to say yes and then bailing?""  

Him: ""Wtf. No.""  

This is when I got really mad and blocked him. But my friends made me feel really guilty and said that he may have COVID. So I added him back and said ""Sorry. I exaggerated. Add me back.""  So he added me back and sad ""Man. Please. I'm not feeling good.""  At this point, I thought that he may have COVID because the numbers are really up where I live and asked him if he needed me to drop him a COVID test.  

He said: ""No. It's not COVID I'm just not feeling it. Moody.""  

This is when I got really disappointed with myself.  I probably said things that I should have but here's how the conversation went.   

Me: ""I hate you. Mainly because I really like you. And every time I say no he won't have the audacity to cancel five mins before and then you do. And it just hurts me and makes me put into question if I even have the slightest worth as a human to you. Maybe you’re really going through something but saying you’re not feeling it just makes me think you just didn’t want to see me and we both know this is not the first time you do this I know it’s just a “fwb” relationship and it’s not that serious but that doesn’t mean you get to treat me like this.""  

Him: ""I know. I wish I was in a better state. but I'm not.""  

Me: ""You're never in a better state. Mainly because you never really liked me. So you don't even try. I've seen you three times in this whole year. You're obv not that into me. Idk why I keep wasting my time.""  

Him: ""Stop being dramatic. I going through my own personal shit.""  

Me: ""You say this every time. Are you saying the world turned upside down in the past 24 hours?""  

Him: ""yeah.""  Me: ""Just tell me what happened?""  

Him: ""Nothing. I'm allowed to not want to hang out to focus on me.""  

Me: ""Wtf. You've been asking for a month. You're just talking to another girl and don't want to see me so you don't ruin things with her, How would seeing me for an hour ruin your focus? How did I let this happen so many times? I can't believe I'm this dumb. You just get me to say yes ad then premed to be busy. This is textbook definition of narcotic behaviour. I'm just saying my last words. I'll never fight you again because that's exactly what you want. Not that you care but I'll see someone else and you'll never see my face agin and instead you should see a therapist. Otherwise, you'd just end up alone snapping your pe\\\*\\\*s to random snapchat girls.""  

Him: ""I'm not seeing anyone. Please stop."" 

Me: ""I'll stop. You simply didn't;t want to see me. You'll never understand how much this hurt so there's no point of fighting.""  

Him: ""Bro. I DON'T FEEL GOOD.""  Me: ""Hope you feel better one day. Bye.""  

Him: ""Thanks I do too.""

48,rtdabf,1641018137,I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND IM LOSING MY MIND,"
To understand this story it’s going to take a minute, so if you don’t really care nows your chance to leave.

I went to a summer camp in Moab. It was a fantastic experience and I made a ton of new friends. I had tried not to focus on girls as I thought it might ruin the experience but as the week began to wind down and we all left and went home.. the girl who I secretly had my eye on the whole time said she had a huge crush on me. Normally this would be a dream come true except she lives 621 miles in another state completely out of reach. I had been in a long distance relationship before and it was catastrophic so I was immediately pretty bummed. But I really liked this girl so I decided I would do my best and just see where it went.

Fast forward 1 month later, we had talked every single day for hours on end. She surprised me and was coming down to visit for three days. Needless to say, I fell in love with her during those three days. We visit led everything there was to see, watched countless movies together, went driving, blasted music, laughed. And to top it all off she was my first kiss.

The week after she left was hands down the saddest week of my life.

Now once again, fast forward 5 months and the relationship has lasted 5 months longer than I thought it would.
I miss her every single day and I’m starting to wonder if I’ll ever see her again. 

I’m not really sure what I’m asking for I just really wanted to vent. And who better to vent to than random people on the internet.

Anyway, happy new year everyone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtdabf/i_dont_know_what_to_do_and_im_losing_my_mind/

This isn’t his first relationship but it is his longest lasting one. He was the first one that said I love you and that was 3 months in. I initiated our first kiss during the first time I slept over at his house which was 5 months into the relationship. Some extenuating circumstances made it unable for us to see each other for November and December. I’m finally able to start seeing him again January 9th.

I must also note that while I am fully out, he is only out to friends and not family, therefore I haven’t been around for that part of his life even though he’s met my immediate family. For more context pertaining to the title of this post, I never once thought I’d be in a committed romantic relationship as I was content with having purely sexual encounters. Now that I met him, my entire outlook on my previously nonexistent dating life has changed. I haven’t had sex since the pandemic started because it felt unsafe. I now feel like I’m at a point where I want to start being sexually active with him. He’s never had sex before and I have no idea how to bring it up to him as he isn’t a very sexual person in general. He has expressed interest in it though. This has been the only struggle I’ve had so far in our relationship and I don’t want to ruin it because of one thing. However, I feel like if I wait for him to make the move, it won’t happen for a while because neither he nor I know how to initiate the conversation.

I say this as a tall, muscular, relatively good looking guy who's quite outgoing and has a decent sense of humour. Most people won't even make eye contact with me in public, and I never really see anyone hitting on anyone these days as I remember seeing about 10 years back.  A lot of my friends are struggling as well - the only two who are in long-term relationships met through their work. 

Yet I personally know (at risk of sounding rude) people who are average in every regard (average looking, average self esteem, average intellect etc) who somehow seem to enter into relationships with apparently quite well put together people with relative ease, and every time I go out I see tons of couples walking round. 

It's as though they all meet when I'm asleep or there's some bloody speed dating event that everyone else knows about.

He began to lecture me about making smart choices and I was just sitting there speechless. 

He then proceeded to conclude his lecture with, ""Not to be like your parent but you know better."" I was shook.

In another instance, he's very good at reading me. He often asks if there was anything he could do to help.

63,rtezh4,1641025107,I was sexually assaulted by a guy I’m dating and I’m still seeing him,"I am a non-Afghanistan girl seeing an (ethnically) Afghanistan guy. For the sake of the story I’m just going to give him a generic name like Adam. 

I just got out of a three year relationship when Adam and I started talking. I immediately recognised Adam and I had a lot of similar traits. We even worked in the same field. I loved Adam’s sense of adventure and ambition. 

We’ve been seeing each other for a month. I like sex as much as the next person but I’ve been hesitant with Adam because of his background. Years ago I had a really close Afghanistan friend who told me Afghanistan guys will always date but never marry outside their culture. I was upfront about my concerns with Adam and he told me he wasn’t dating an Afghanistan girl because he felt like they had to be brought and he liked the idea of a more equal relationship. I want to give Adam the benefit of the doubt but I’m scared of being someone’s experiment.

In the month we’ve been dating Adam hasn’t really been a touchy person. He doesn’t kiss me goodbye, he doesn’t touch my leg or do the typical things to show me he wants me. The only way I can describe how he’s been is very abrupt. He goes from no touching to aggressively making out with me. The most that had happened is slight groping before I stop him.

One day, he encourages me to nap in his bed. I’ve slept in his bed before and nothing has happened. But also to add to that, as a bi woman I don’t think anyone has the right to your body without your consent regardless of the gender or situation. I wake up because he started slipping his hands into my underwear and feeling me up. Instead of getting angry I just move his hand and hope he gets the point. He persists a second time, I move his hand. He does it a third time but this time tries to finger me. I move away from him and show I’m awake. It’s obviously awkward as hell and ends with him apologising but also saying it’s hard for him because we’re cuddling. I forgive him but make a mental note of the situation. 

One night we get drunk at his place. I eventually want to go home but because we’re both drunk and I have my car there he told me to stay at his. When he saw my hesitation he told me he’d just sleep on the couch. So I go upstairs. Pass out. I wake up and realise he’s in bed next to me but there’s also a pillow barricade next to us. Apparently it became really cold in the living room and this was the only way he could control his urges.

I told her that if thats the decision to block me she makes that i would respect it but i would greatly appreicate it if she didnt and that i would like a chance to show her the real me. She opened the message but didnt reply.

I (19M) ask about the most genuine way since I have a feeling scrolling endlessly on Tinder and actively searching maybe isn't the best way(I may have tried this for a little bit). So background of me, I am 19 in college and have dated 3 girls so far. My longest relationship was previously 6 months and ended because of the toxicity of it. It ended when I turned 18 so it's been a while and I have started to try and get back out there(Covid kinda prevented me from getting back out early on). I would prefer to have a real relationship, so not a hookup or something slthough I don't have much experience with hookups or snything other thsn a serious relationship. So I ask, what do you think the most genuine way to meet the girl of my dreams is? Should I forget about it and just focus on enjoying the single life and being by myself and if I meet someone I'm interested shoot my shot or is it better to try and just go out to parties and meet as many girls as I can? Should I spend time trying things like hookups? Anything helps especially maybe stories on how you met your spouse",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtfm2q/what_is_the_most_genuine_way_to_meet_the_girl_of/
68,rtfp6c,1641028132,"Finding the one for the lonely, anxious, depressed.","

I have no right to tell other people how to experience life.  All I can do is share my experience after living nearly 50 years, 30 of them with the same man.  

I don't remember how I found Reddit.  I feel like I am a minority here as a middle age white woman.  But, I care about people and can't help but hurt for the number of people who seem to feel alone and unloveable.  

Here's what I want you to know: 

1). Everyone has worth and deserves respect.  I believe everyone has a purpose in life, even if it doesn't seem profound.  It's not about what we do in life, but how we make people feel. You're more likely to make an impact listening and being patient with someone than if you were to find a cure for cancer.  

2) living and caring for yourself and others is a choice.  How you respond to life is a choice.  There are a lot of things that we can't change in life... What we're born into, our race, our height, many medical conditions... Lots of stuff.  But when it comes to (good) relationships, it's really not about us.  It's about how we make others feel.  

I chose to treat people with respect.  I chose to reach out to others and listen to them.  I chose not to be judgemental.  Dating today seems to be more about rejecting people rather than getting to know them.  We have laundry lists of what we don't want.  While I believe there are some big things that make good dealbreakers, the fewer demands you have, to more open you are to love. 

3) you're not looking to build a championship football team.  You're not looking to hire a crew to send a rocketship to Mars.  You don't need to find 3 or 10 or 100 people you are attracted to and who all want to be together at the same time and same place.  You are (probably) looking for ONE person.  I kinda believe in the idea of ""the one"". And I kinda believe in ""soulmates"".  But I don't believe there is only one soulmate that we have to find like looking for a needle in a haystack.  

Close doesn't only count in horseshoes and hand grenades.  Perfect doesn't exist.  Once you get CLOSE to finding someone that you care about and that cares about you, choice carries you the rest of the way.  That's because in a good relationship, we choose to listen. We choose to communicate.  We choose to be patient and kind, and we choose to forgive.  

You don't have to find The One.  You're not going to find someone else ""perfect"" for you. That's like trying to find a person whose fingerprints match your own.  Finding your person is less about that perfect match, than finding the glove that fits.  Not every glove will fit.  Not every glove will match your style.  But one thing is certain.  You're not going to conjure up a glove out of thin air.  You have to reach out your hand and try on a few styles to see what's really the best fit. 

I don't know who's reading this.  But whoever and wherever you are, you are important and loveable.  Wishing you peace and joy in the new year and years to come.

Ps... My husband and I choose over and over again to be there for each other.  We choose to show respect.  We choose to be decent to each other.  We choose to overlook each other's flaws.  We are far from perfect.  We make mistakes.  But we choose to overlook what's unimportant for the sake of having tomorrow together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtfp6c/finding_the_one_for_the_lonely_anxious_depressed/

I am not ""dating"" this person. We just like to talk, that's it.

Well there's this guy that I have been talking to for a little bit now (not like that, just talking to talk and not be lonely) I worked with him a while back. He's super cool, he's in a band and plays shows. We talk about music and share songs, feelings blah blah.

I'm on Tinder and I saw his profile and I swiped right. What the heck, doesn't hurt to try. A few hours later, I got a notification. He matched with me. We didn't bring it up for a few days. Didn't talk as much. 

But tonight he texts me and asks how I am tonight. Honestly I wasn't too good. Kind of in my feels. He said he wanted to come see me then we talked on the phone for 45 minutes. I was at my parents for new years tonight. I texted him address and he came and brought me food, plus we watched a show together that were both in to (peaky blinders) Yall it was so nice. He was a little stoned but it was so funny. We chilled for a few hours. He was so sensual that it made me feel all kinds of things. He put his arm around me. We kissed a few times. We were playing with our hands together and just sliding our fingers around the others. Eventually he laid on my lap and was rubbing my ankles amd giving my calve a massage. I scratched his back and he fell asleep on my  lap. It was so cute

But anyways we both got tired and called it a night. It's like he knew I just needed to be caressed, and held. It was awesome. That's all it was.

We’ve been together for nearly 4 years now and the past year has been hectic. I feel like he’s too busy for me. And before I sound ungrateful please hear me out !! I can never get tired at someone for being tired or for being busy, I don’t expect to be a big big priority in his life because he has his own life to live. Seeing how busy he was made me want to start doing things to make myself busy too so that I don’t wait around for him. 

But he’s so busy that we don’t really get to speak to each other at all for days on end. I haven’t seen him for 3 months even though he lives only 20 minutes away. I’m not really complaining about not seeing him, I guess I just wanted to talk to him. 

He would tell me he’s going to speak to me the next day but then when the time comes around he gets too tired. The thing is, he’s genuinely trying. He’s honestly the kindest person I’ve ever met and he would never intentionally hurt me. I know all of this is unintentional (even though it probably doesn’t sound like it because of the way I worded it) but he’s really trying. 

Even though he’s trying I don’t seem to want to speak to him anymore. I guess it’s tested my patience a lot, it’s been like this for a whole year now, since January last year it’s been like this. I find that little things he does irritate me. Sometimes I’d make plans to play a game together and he would be too tired. Even though we had a decent conversation last night, I still don’t want to speak to him today. 

I have communicated how this hurts me several times, I’ve explained to him that my wants in a relationship has changed and he’s very understanding about that, he was so sweet about it. 

I almost feel guilty for not wanting to speak to him and feel like I kind of have to force myself to do so.

92,rti7gd,1641038869,Possible Love Bombing?? / I am insecure about my appearance,"So I have been talking to this new guy I met on a dating app. We haven't met up in person yet because I have been traveling. We had plans to go on a date before I left but I had to cancel due to a COVID scare. But we have talked on the phone for about an hour every day since and text all day. He is very good looking, about 7 years older than me, and I really enjoy talking to him. We have a lot in common and are very similar, but I cant help but feel insecure.

He does photography on the side of his 9-5 job. He takes photos of GORGEOUS women (one of the things we have in common is photography). It makes me insecure. I am pretty attractive, but not influencer IG attractive if you catch my drift. I have also recently gained weight due to a health issue, so I just don't feel like I even begin to compare to any of these girls. 

He is so sweet and very consistent in communication which I like. But he also always talks about wanting to meet my family eventually (I have been with them over the holidays), go on vacation together, calls me pet names (i.e ""my love"", ""babe,"" ""baby"" etc), and he has made a list of future activities we will do together when I am home in a few weeks, even though we have not met IRL. I have been in an abusive relationship before, so I am very scared that this is lovebombing. He sent me ""I have such a good feeling about you. I love my life the way it is but you would be an amazing addition to it, I look forward to talking to you everyday - you make me smile so much.""  He even told me that he told his best friend about me, about how much we have in common, how ""beautiful"" I am, and how ""comfortable"" he feels when talking to me, and as if he can tell me anything. He has sent me ""you are my favorite person"", ""can we just get married already,"" ""I am so excited about you, you have no idea"" and we sext almost everyday in addition to that. I feel as if those things are a tad intense for not having spent anytime in person together and dance on the line of lovebombing. 

I am also nervous that I cannot live up to the expectations in his head / I will be a disappointment when he sees me in person. I looked at his IG and saw a girl who I think is his ex. She is an absolute BOMBSHELL.. I cannot even begin to compare to this Victoria Secret-esque woman.

I am really excited about him. And the attention from him has been so nice. But the things I mentioned above make me want to end it before it even starts because I am already insecure. I send him selfies and pics of my body, so he does know what I look like. But it is hard to look at his IG that's full of smokeshow women that he photographs. I feel like he is so successful and could easily date one of them, so why the hell is he talking to me??

 I am confident in my personality, intelligence, my face etc., but my body is by far my BIGGEST insecurity. So its hard to see these gorgeous women in bikinis with their insanely amazing bodies when I know that is NOT what my body looks like at the moment.

I guess I am just looking for some guidance here as to whether this is lovebombing / if this is even worth pursuing.

She was really pretty, we had a lot of similar interests, etc. Eventually I pretty much dumped her, because my parents are your everyday Conservative, fundamentalist Christian type, and I was worried how they'd react. I hate to think about it, but at the time I was an insecure kid who just recently started college. I turned something that wouldn't really have been that big of a deal into a huge problem, and I dealt with it in entirely the wrong way. (And as much as I hate to say it, I was somewhat right about my anxieties. My parents have said some pretty shitty things about trans folks in the years since).

Now, soon after I immediately realized that I fucked up big time. And again, being an insecure kid, I dealt with it the wrong way. I was 100% That Ex. Rambling apologies, saying a shitload without really getting across what I wanted to say, etc. After taking a lot of time to myself, eventually this year we talked a bit, and she acknowledged that we've both changed over the years, and she doesn't have any hard feelings whatsoever. We'll wish eachother a Merry Christmas every year and occasionally chat about stuff like we used to.

But I can't seem to escape the knowledge that, if we had started dating a few years later, like today, we actually could have been good together. Every single problem during and after the relationship was entirely my fault. If I had just slowed down for a minute, and talked to her about my family anxiety, we could have figured out a way to push through that together. Instead I ripped the relationship in half, and set it on fire when there was still hope for a second chance. I don't blame her at all for just wanting to be friends. It just hurts because I STILL feel like I've never explained how much I wish things could have worked out. As far as I know, she hasn't dated anyone since then, and I really just want to see her happy with someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rti9zv/i_24m_dumped_my_ex_30f_constantly_regret_it/
94,rtiaf5,1641039194,I (25F) thinks the guy (27M) I’m dating did something inappropriate while I was asleep.,"Long term lurker first time posting so plz excuse any mistakes. Also, TRIGGER WARNING possible assault. 

I (25F) have been dating this guy “H” (27M) for about 3 months now. He is funny, we have many things in common and overall very sweet. He has been the perfect gentleman on all of our dates. We have gone out on about 10-12 dates…about 1 a week since meeting. On our 5th date I had an allergic reaction and he rushed me home. I invited him up to hang a bit since we had to cut the night short. I took some allergy meds which ended up knocking me out very quickly probably since I had been drinking earlier. H had tucked me into bed, plugged up my phone, and left a glass of water for me on my night stand. Very sweet - at least I thought. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and H slept over for the first time and we hooked up. I woke up to him giving me head. We had a great night together and while we hadn’t discussed this particular preference before I just went with the flow. It wasn’t until later that morning we were chatting and he mentioned how hard it is to wake up me up. I am a heavy and deep sleeper. Its caused me issues in the past. I can sleep through almost anything (loud noises, my dog jumping on my bed, even water on my face). But his comment made me wonder what else he had done and for how long. However, I brushed it aside since everything else was great. 

On to last night. H was going to a NYE party at a friend’s place a few blocks away from me. I am getting over a nasty cold (not COVID) and decided to stay in. H got a little tipsy &amp; didn’t want to drive home or crash at his friends since there were already a few folks sleeping over. So he asked if he could come over and crash with me. I agreed but told him I was still a little sick and super tired so I am going to go straight to bed. He said that was fine. He came over and within 15 minutes I was sleep. About 2 hours later I woke up to him fingering me and jerking off. H just looks and says “good your up” and tries to get on top and kiss me.

I immediately freak out and tell him to leave. I told him he had crossed a line but he said he was only trying to “turn me on”. Now I’m freaking out and second guessing all the times I’ve fallen alseep around him. 

I have no idea if I am overreacting or if I should go to the police. I don’t have proof of anything but I feel so violated. Outside of this he the nicest guy I’ve dated in a very long time. Also, he didn’t seemed fazed or defensive by my confrontation so I’m starting to feel like I’m the crazy one.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtiaf5/i_25f_thinks_the_guy_27m_im_dating_did_something/
95,rtib6k,1641039290,Liberation from OLD,"2022 for me started with deleting my dating apps at midnight. It felt liberating! I was wasting time scrolling, becoming disappointed, ever more judgemental and picky as these apps so frequently foster. I didn't want to be the person who rejects someone based off 3 lines of text and a few photos, but that's who I became. I'd love a relationship but I know now I can be happy enough on my own and be patient for someone incredible. Here's to 2022 and making the most of chance interactions!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtib6k/liberation_from_old/
96,rtipea,1641040908,No contact with twist,"Long story short, I (M19) broke up with my girlfriend (F19) three months ago because she emotionally cheated and lied to me.

The twist is, we are in the same uni and the same uni accommodation, same flat but different rooms, with another other 6 people. We were together for 6 months and new each other before moving to uni.

The people in my flat are my friends as well as hers so we are trying to be civil for the sake of the other flat mates. She goes on nights out with other different friends.

We don’t go out together but it’s impossible for me to not see her in the kitchen, social events, same club etc. We also have a flat group chat where she can see if i viewed/ opened group messages. 

Im back home right now due to the Christmas holidays and after two weeks of going no contact she reached out to me, telling me she misses me, and wants to speak to me. 

I understand stand this is not the best situation, we have a little over 14 weeks left in the accommodation then we move out for good.

In terms of no contact, how do i come about this ? She knows I’ve opened group chat messages but not hers. 

I will be seeing her almost everyday when i go in two weeks back to uni so what do i do ? 

How do i reply ? Do i reply ? or leave on opened or delivered ? 

My head says get back with her but my heart is still crushed. Any advice is welcome 🙏🏽",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtipea/no_contact_with_twist/
97,rtiwla,1641041720,Just my opinion,two things about adult dating sites;  A lot of men use these sites as a brothel catalog.   Also they will talk to you back and back for month so then by the time we would meet them they are under the impression we are in a relationship.  I will not have casual sex until I feel something.  If I mention this the meet &amp; great is over.  lol,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtiwla/just_my_opinion/
