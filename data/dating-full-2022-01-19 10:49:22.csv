We haven't seen or heard from each other in 6 full years and 4 months ago we ended up in contact, by chance.

In high school, I was an annoying kid and she even said that she wasn't really fond of me (can't blame her at all!). I was bullied through elementary school and then I wanted to be cool in high school, so I was the loudest, most annoying kid in the class. I was a bad student, had pimples all over my face and strived for attention.

She was always adorable, with a beautiful smile, eyes and pretty much everything. She was never one of those popular girls, in fact, she only had a few friends back then that she's still close with nowadays. She was a good student, quiet and attentive. Apparently, she claims that she did have an attitude back then and was a bit rude, but we've rarely ever even talked.

However, I still had a crush on her for like a year in high school. I didn't really tell many people about it, since we were in the same class and didn't talk to each other almost at all, so it was a bit ""illogical"". I remember sometimes staring at her, while sitting in the back, probably looking creepy.

High school ended, we had prom (where she was absolutely stunning) and after the last day, I haven't seen her for 6 years. Last year, we ever had a small get-together, a 5th year anniversary, but she didn't come. I grew up a lot since high school, became a better, serious and ambitious person, people even commented on how different I was.

So, months ago, I wrote this really long status about my year, 2021 was really dramatic and life-changing for me and I decided to share what I went through with my Facebook friends (for whatever reason). Turns out, it was the best thing I ever did. It was a really, really long text and while many of my friends and close ones read it, I was surprised to see her like on it, after 6 years with no contact, nothing. Even more interesting is the fact that I removed many of my hugh school classmates from my friend list, but she was one of the rare ones that remained there.

My logic was telling me that if somebody was willing to read something so long and intimate about me, they obviously care about me in some way, at least enough to wonder about my life. So, I hit her up, nervously, after 6 years.

To my surprise, she replied with a long, detailed and excited message and we started chatting. It went from few messages a day to all-day long chats and I recommended for us to meet. Obviously, she said yes. We went out and damn, when I saw her, I was speechless. I've been in relationships since high school, I've had crushes, but that smile of hers and those eyes hypnotized me once again.

We really hit it off, talking about everything, she was also in a long, toxic relationship, just like my last one, we talked about our lives, intimate things, what we went through, everything. She recommended the next day that we meet up again in a day or two and we did.

That time, she came completely ""prepared"", made herself look even more attractive and not casual as the first time and we continued the trend of really getting to know each other as people, sharing our viewpoints, experiences and traumas, even.

After that evening, I asked her out on a date... and she declined. She said that while she does feel some attraction to me, it's way too soon, she's recovering from her previous relationship and she wants to really get to know me before accepting that. I understood her and we continued just hanging out, but I was crushing on her very much.

After a month and a half, I went on a vacation to Netherlands for a week and a half, she read my novel while I was there, I even surprised her with a video call one evening. Basically, things were really heating up and that vacation was beautiful in general, but even more so knowing that it helped us get to where we are now, as she missed me and I had a chance to distract myself for a bit.

Soon after I returned, we met, we talked a lot, I talked about my trip, she was dissecting my novel, there was even more physical contact than before and so on. A week or two after, I found a stray dog close to my work. It was my second one in 2021, the first one I adopted and he is a precious, thankful little fluff of happiness, but this one I just couldn't. So I offered it to her and she adopted him.

After that, she said how much I changed her life, even to the point of being responsible for having her first dog. And then she asked me out. I was smitten, smiling and I accepted it (obviously).

We went out, held each others hand, talked, hugged much more, but we actually only kissed on our third date! First one was a jazz concert (we both love it), second one was unplanned, but a music video filming for my friend's band and the third one was dinner. Our first kiss was absolutely phenomenal, extremely natural and breathtaking.

After that, it became much easier, we dated for a few more weeks, kissed a lot, only became more intimate after a few weeks and we have officially been together since Christmas Eve, which we spent together (one of the best nights of my life).

Everything with her seems so easy and beautiful, she makes me smile, really brings out the best in me, we have similar views, beliefs and interests. Even after some time, I still feel shivers when we kiss, no need to even mention anything further than that.

I've never been with somebody so amazing, so drop-dead gorgeous, smart, funny and into me. She really appreciates me and I appreciate every little thing she does. She really deserves every single thing that I do for her, especially cooking - I love cooking, have been doing it for years and I prepare some really exotic, nice meals for her and she returns that and so much more. I don't think loving her will ever be a problem.

I intend to continue taking her out on amazing dates and being the best for her, just because I ""have her"" already, doesn't mean that I don't want to impress her every now and then and bring out that perfect smile.

Home was and is always a hellhole with an abusive, controlling father. I never had a lot of friends but I used to cherish whoever I had. I was immensely into video games, tech and anime but lately that passion has fizzled out. Right now my only hobby is to read fictional books and maybe watch movies sometimes. Working a dead end Machine Learning related job but I am in the process of updating my CV and applying for better jobs. Underweight due to medical conditions related to mental health. I only use Twitter and Telegram as my social media as I've deleted the rest, and occasionally Reddit. Sought therapy but no major improvements. No smoking or alcoholic habits. 

I began looking for dates since I craved companionship immensely when I was 18 years old but luck has never really favored me. I never went for the top, hot girls, only for average, decent girls that I thought would be in my league and thought both of us could potentially have good time together. I have seen basically everything from 

\- being defamed in front of my crush by my best friend 

\- brutal rejections (""I wouldn't want to be with you even if you're the last person on Earth"")

\- woman faking interest and using me to pass a university course 

Finally landed a short relationship with a person who proposed me first (to very much my surprise) which ended up alleviating my mental woes and boosted my confidence to the moon, only to bring me back down to reality with her possessive, manipulative and controlling attitude until I broke it off after about 1.5 years. To give a sample of her behavior, she used her own home situation and suicide threats to make me cut off a female friend whom I had known since college. Between each of my pursuit/crush/relationship, I took ample time to grieve and move on, ranging from 8-9 months to a maximum of 3 years. As such, I have only tried my luck with about 5 women over a span of 8 years.

My last pursuit ended rather badly for me and is probably why my motivation is all drained. My anxiety about ending up alone made me rather heavily invest in a person I had known for a while. She was seemingly single, but later confessed that she liked a college friend of mine secretly for 2+ years but hadn't made her move yet. I cut her off then and there after confessing my feelings and wished her well. I also cut off her love interest, because although we used to hangout occasionally, to me he became a walking reminder that I'm inferior to him in some way. Although, he's not aware of the fact that I had cut him off (due to COVID; we're not that close anyway; and my social medias are all gone) nor is he aware of the fact that she likes him.

About 8 months later she reached out again, in hopes of fixing the friendship we had and I basically reiterated that our needs from each other are different. I also stated that I had cut off her love interest because I needed that space and that's how serious this was for me. I haven't heard from her since. Probably never will again. 

It has been two years since I cut her off, and to this I have no energy to do basically anything other than work related things. She owes me nothing, and it is ultimately my fault for being too invested. All I want to know is that given my current state, how do I regain the motivation and energy to put myself out there again?

She and I had a good time while it lasted and when it ended, while endings suck, I more or less let go despite the fact I well and truly loved her in ways I had never loved anyone else before.

She was the first person I flew out to meet me (valentines date and dinner) and together I helped her set up the new pc I'd also helped her pick out. She wanted to be a streamer but never had a lot of confidence. She stayed over for a week and we slept together etc. To be entirely honest she was my first though I wasn't hers. 

Just a bit after we had met she was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and began immunotherapy. Well, turns out that despite being unlucky with her diagnosis of cancer, she was lucky in that yours truly just happened to have a kinda world class oncologist for a dad. I talked with my dad and he helped review her lab work and would give advice and analysis of how the treatment seemed to be going. (She did recover a is currently cancer free! )

 Fast forward a few months and she had a pretty good streaming community and a regular schedule. Things were going well until they weren't . Somewhere along the way between the sex, I love yous, and literally everything else you could think of that make relationships well relationships,  she suddenly does this about face and decides this is all too much commitment for her and we should just be friends. 

This sucked to lose someone you love and not be open with em about how you feel anymore bit hey can't win em all, so okay whatever. Friends is cool too.  We had already  planned another meet up though before this all went down. She still wanted me to come over and still wanted me to stay 9ver until last minute she asked I'd I could get a hotel instead...

Well I'm not in yhe business of just stay over st peoples places when they're not comfortable with it so fine but she'd have to go half on the hotel cause last minute bookings suck ass. She accepted the conditions.

Again things were okay ish despite my expenses having spiked and now somewhere in the ~2000 range for this week trip to see her and help her get her new apartment set up and stuff.

Then one evening were just relaxing and I was pressing her shoulders and back and apparently this whole massage was some indicator of her wanting to get some?¬ø despite being ""just friends""?¬ø and not to mention  she has not actually  SAID she wants to get intimate again and wouldn't say that's what she wanted UNTIL AFTER I FUCKING LEFT THE STATE TO GO HOME.

Can you say poor communication? Lil bit.

Also at one point she decided to stream with friends while I was over and basically told me to pull a Harry Potter and be quiet and pretend I'm not there so people don't know I'm visiting blah blah.

Now that bit is going to be important because it isn't the first time she's tried to make me some kind of dirty little secret where I'm not supposed to act like were close or whatever.

Things continue to decline until we basically just don't talk anymore.

Enter current situation:

I work full time as part of a Critical Care Transport team and was working two back to back shifts with little sleep due to having to go in early as a massive snow storm was baring down on us.

Mid snowstorm, after I've already helped rescue 6-10 vehicles from the snow on the interstate and began running calls, this woman texts me out of the blue with two demands:

One: delete the singular picture I had of us from Instagram where we were both riding the metro together when she visited me (nothing sus or obvious that would make it seem like we ere anything other than friends like any other pic of myself and friends on my insta) because and I quote ""she doesn't want her friends to see it""

Two: Don't friends my friends or talk to them


Me over here frozen af, getting freezing rained on and trying to get meemaw back to her care facility in a literal snow/icestorm does not appreciate this.

I took some time to talk it over with a close friend of mine after I got off work and made it back home and they suggested that I delete the pic in question but then block her everywhere at this point.


I care about her and accepted that I wasn't what she wanted but her trying to make me delete shit on MY insta so she can pretend to others that SHE has nothing to do with me etc just really really pises me the fuck off.

I really didn't want to take it down because it was a happy memory of good times for me but out of respect for the request and my best friends who suggested to take it down regardless lt is off the page. 

I just...i don't get it.

Is it normal for people to just demand you erase them from your own social media so they can hide an inconvenient truth? 

Like if you regret it that much that's your fucking problem. I was happy. I enjoyed our time. I fucking loved you and was all in.

But to you I was the guy you had to hide, keep quiet, and subsequently pretend you had nothing to do with...

It really hurts my self esteem that the first person. I let get that close to me also chose to essentially act like and present themselves like what happened between us just...didn't.

Am I wrong for just flat out cutting all contact with her for this? I hadn't removed her from socials or unfriended or anything because I never felt the situation called for that. We parted amicably...

But this just pushed me over the edge. I'm not a dirty secret to hide..I'm not your inconvenient truth you're trying to cover up.

I deserve better...and I never ever thought she'd be the one to do this to me.

I‚Äôve admittedly crushed on this girl for 8 years and, we‚Äôve def had high sexual banter over the years. But shes bi so she‚Äôd been in &amp; out relationships with women for a while, which I‚Äôm totally cool with. But she‚Äôs told me couple times that she prefers men &amp; hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship with a woman/or anyone for couple years, as her ex was controlling.

So we got talking again, as we‚Äôd swing in &amp; out and this time was different to the other times we‚Äôd spoken as she was strongly initiating a drink (couple times) and, a facetime session. Her energy was alot stronger than mine and, so we got talking, teasing each other abit &amp; talking generally about life (this is something we hadnt done so much before) to arrange a date - where we‚Äôd go for drinks &amp; you know in a hotel afterwards. That was made very clear.

She then initiated going for Valentines weekend &amp; for couple nights when I gave her the option of 1 or, 2 nights so we could ‚Äòbuild a connection‚Äô. Again, she expressed how excited she was &amp; it genuinely felt real.
Like, sometimes I‚Äôd fall asleep at night and she‚Äôd pop up saying morning babe, double message me on snap - sending me stuff even though I hadn‚Äôt asked for them.

The last couple days have felt different, i cant identity what it is. Vibes dont lie right? She did say she had period pains but, this morning she replied to my snap (replying to her story saying the sunset was beautiful like her) saying Awww babe üòç but, something feels off - especially as she hasnt replied to my text from last night &amp; she‚Äôs been posting to her insta story.

Sorry in advance if it‚Äôs lengthy.

So I (26m) have been talking to this (24f) girl on and off for 2 years now. A lot has happened between her and I. We started talking to eachother around October 2019. I tried to be the best person I could be, I got her a small gift for her birthday, flowers, but I knew to keep it small to not go overboard immediately. She told me her favorite kind of flowers, so I thought she was hinting that to me to get her that. But after awhile, she started officially dating someone else, so we stopped talking as much. But they ended up breaking up and long story short, he was a bad guy. She confided in me and told me what happened, different kinds of abuse (trigger warning), but I have kept that all a secret because I truly believe if people find out, she should be the one to tell people. It‚Äôs not my story to tell.

After they broke up, I initially was just trying to be her friend since she recently got out of a bad relationship. At some point in the future, her and I started talking again. After this point, we started getting really close. It got to the point that I quit my job and got a job where she works. The bad part is that I thought her and I were getting super close, like right on the path to officially dating within a couple months. But there was a point where she was feeling sick, so I told her I‚Äôd come get her to get tested for covid at the doctor. She declined my request, but I found out that night that she got a ride to the doctor from her abusive ex, and she said he was flirting with her the entire time. I honestly felt really hurt from that. She declined my request, but accepted it from the guy that abused her. I felt like she was basically saying she‚Äôd rather be with an abuser than be with me. 

So that time, I created the distance between us. This all happened before I started at the new job. So it was like 2 weeks before then, but at that point, I stopped talking to her, but I was still interested in the job since the pay was higher and because I already put my 2 weeks in at my other job. I went to the interviews and got the job. But within the 2 weeks of us not talking, she started officially dating another guy. I had no idea she was talking to this guy, I just noticed she would answer the phone while walking out of the office and I‚Äôd hear her say ‚Äúhey baby‚Äù openly infront of anyone that was in the office. I wasn‚Äôt working there long. Within a month, I had a new job that paid more than that one too.

So then it was like 6 months later. Her and I hadn‚Äôt spoken to eachother at all. I was dating a new girl, she was still dating that guy. The girl I was dating was planning on moving in with me, so we were looking for a job for her. I thought to ask the original girl, if there were positions open there and I explained it was for the girl I was dating. She was fine with it all and she said she‚Äôll find out if there were any openings. Well me and my girlfriend ended up breaking up the day before I was going to get her. She was thinking it was going to fast. I honestly agreed, so I didn‚Äôt mind too much. But shortly after I became single, girl 1 also became single. At that point, I seen more of an effort to communicate with me. So I shared the effort and we got super close again.

Now this is starting to get into more recent stuff. I‚Äôve been trying to be more direct now that I know she‚Äôs interested in dating. I‚Äôve been trying to shoot my shot more, sometimes she shows interest, but some other times she ignores my messages completely. I‚Äôve been trying to just spend more time with her in person. We both agreed to getting later Christmas gifts for eachother. I don‚Äôt know if she got me anything, I don‚Äôt mind too much since I do it because I want to, not to get anything in return. But every time I ask to hang out to have our mini Christmas, she leaves me on read. I try yo be as respectful and none-dramatic as I can be. I‚Äôve mentioned to her that im handling everything on my end seriously and I‚Äôm not talking to any other girls. I know that can cause anxiety to tell someone that you‚Äôre trying to date, but her and I have had this thing going for over 2 years. Now I try to stay cool-headed, but yesterday the girl posted a pic on Snapchat of flowers. I kept it cool and all, I just said they were cute flowers. After she agreed, I asked her if someone got them for her or if they were someone else‚Äôs at the office. She told me a guy she‚Äôs been talking too got them for her, but she didn‚Äôt things things were that serious.

I feel like I should just cut things off, but we‚Äôve gone through so much together. Would it be better to completely cut things off if she starts officially dating this guy that sent her flowers? I really like her, but I honestly don‚Äôt fell like she loves me that much. I remember I got her some other stuff around Christmas one year and she mentioned to me the she threw the stuff away in the trash after she was dating the guy. Some stuff I understood, like a glass rose, but there was some self defense stuff I also got her so she would never have to feel completely defenseless ever again, that stuff I was hurt that she said she threw away.

We got home and I thanked him for the great time and dinner and mentioned I enjoyed the evening; we swapped numbers.

1. In case he initiates a second text, well and good, if he doesn't, is it safe to let this one go? 

2. Idk if his texting skills arent great, what is a nice way to let him know we should text in-between dates so we can know each other better?

Matched with a girl on Bumble, at first I didn't really have any high expectations from a dating app but once we started talking, I thought at the time, we really clicked. We would message each other day and night constantly without pauses, we shared personal stuff, tell each other boring details of our everyday lives, play games together and somewhat flirted with each other. I felt that I related to her vibe in every way.

We finally met in-person about 3 weeks in, that's when I started really developing feelings for her. I've dated in Uni before, but never developed the feelings in which I cannot describe which is why I decided to get Bumble to try my luck. Truth be told, I've always felt down and idk how to describe it but just her presence really made me happy. I even got excited just receiving notifications from her which would make my day.

So eventually I decided to confess that I liked her, it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life (I'm not exaggerating, that's how much she meant to me) and I'm glad I've done it. Unfortunately she didn't have the same feelings for me which broke me a bit but I understood that and respect how she felt.

After that, I couldn't stop thinking about her, you could say I was obsessed so I told her how I really felt. To make a long story short, she told me I should just stop talking to her for a while so that I can focus on myself.

So far (few weeks after), I've been trying to move on without much success, I still think about her constantly (worrying about her wellbeing and general stuff) and I know it's an unhealthy obsession as it's eating me up from within as I try to avoid contact with her. It's really destroying me. Most days I can't even start to do anything like Uni work and when I finally stop thinking about her and actually sleep, I dream about her and wake up worse off.

It's like my brain knows what I should do, but my heart tells me otherwise and I don't know what else I can do as it affects me day by day. In fact, it occupies my head so much, I'm not even stressed in my Uni exams at the moment as I can barely focus on anything else but her.

Honestly, this is the worst I've ever felt in my life. I mistook the signals. I'm usually the unemotional (Just depressed) type of person so I don't really know how to deal with this, I'm trying to occupy myself with other stuff but every second of the day, all I can think about is her and its tearing me apart.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153685,public,self,"Thought I found the one on Bumble, now I can't do anything else but think of her",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7qtvu/thought_i_found_the_one_on_bumble_now_i_cant_do/,no_ads,0,

That's my number one requirement to or not to proceed getting to know a girl.

From there we started getting to know each other and talking about different topics and we clicked, then I gave her my sc and insta and we moved there. Unfortunately, she lives 2 hours away by plane.

She has checked all of the boxes so far that made me ""I hope this would work"" except for sense of humor irl not behind the phone and I will find that when I see her in person.

One thing she said was that she's not interested in getting married any time soon and want to accomplish something and self-fulfilment as she thinks marriage will hold her back. which is not true to me specially when there are no kids. But because she saw her friends change their principles and what they stand for after getting married like a vegan friend started to eat meat because of her husband, she developed this view of marriage.

You may wonder why I'm already talking about marriage, it's because we live in a society where long term dating is rare (like both being in college) and no sex (religious societybut i'm not a virgin) and there's a stigma that if the guy prolong dating and didn't propose means he's not serious. A year or two of dating is maximum.

One annoying part is that she never initated conversations or just sending memes, It is always me but she engage well in coversations (long texts, voice notes). I feel like if I didn't send somehting she wouldn't message me, which made me feel like I'm the one who's dessperte for her attention. We only talk a little during our lunch break or 1-2 hours before going to bed, not everyday. 

I guess I'm fantasizing about what we could be becuase I know that meeting a girl that matches me like her would be difficult/ rare so I don't want to ruin or miss this opportunity, while she might just see me as a texting buddy cause she is not interested in dating right now.

It depends on someone's personality, past experiences, what they are looking for... But thinking that people go into dating with the analytical mind just sounds sad to me. It also scares me because I am a ""follow your heart"" type of a person.

Recently I was talking to a guy I dated for a minute and who is a friend now. We got deep into talking about love. I was saying how this dating thing is not for me - I met a person I felt an incredibly strong connection with and was left stranded. Truth be told, it was for valid reasons (mental health), but it hurts. I am definitely an idealist when it comes to love and want to believe that when you meet someone you connect with on every level, it just shouldn't be that hard. True, we all have our issues and demons, but finding someone you vibe with should help you feel calm. It should help ease the pain and bring a smile on your face. Things have been easy for me with this person because that's how I was feeling. And I wanted to grow it from there. But they didn't because all of it was too intense and too scary.

My friend said it's just not that easy. He's a few years older so a bit more experienced in the dating game, but also a very analytical type in all aspects of life. He said it's a numbers game. You have to go on many dates, get disappointed, try and fail and if you're lucky, your person will show up after some time. 

That makes me incredibly anxious. Do people really look at dating in this way? Of course, you have good and bad dates, not everyone is going to be a fit, but I don't want to think that in order to find love, I HAVE TO give a chance to as many people as possible to get to the right one. In my view, it's all about chance, luck and timing - whether you run into the right person, at the right place, at the right time.

So, yeah. Do people really rationalise love? Can it be love if you're able to decide on someone based on the list of pros and cons? Or is that just settling - you go on many dates, have bad and disappointing experiences, so when someone nice comes along, you almost already have low expectations and they blow you away easily?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153678,public,self,"Can dating, relationships, love be rational?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7unf7/can_dating_relationships_love_be_rational/,no_ads,0,

the only thing is that we‚Äôve never met each other in person yet. which has really been upsetting to me because meeting someone in person is such a big deal in any relationship. we‚Äôve made plans to meet before but she‚Äôs always cancelled last minute because she‚Äôs too anxious about seeing me (she says she really likes me and doesn‚Äôt want to fuck it up). she keeps promising, however, that we‚Äôll meet and go on a date extremely soon.

well over the weekend she posted some pics of her kissing another girl while drunk. this girl was her friend and also had a bf, and i knew that. i wasn‚Äôt so upset about the fact that she had gone and kissed another girl because i knew that that was only her friend and i kiss my friends all the time. i was more upset about the fact that earlier that day she had promised to come meet me for the first time but then ended up bailing because things came up (again). and then after that she went and kissed another girl. it made me feel useless because if she won‚Äôt meet me and she wants to go kiss other girls, then why am i in her life ?

so i told her that i was upset and kinda emotionally over shared because of how upset i was. i told her that i didn‚Äôt understand her and how she felt about me and that i needed to stop looking for love from people who weren‚Äôt willing to give it to me. she apologized immediately and offered to talk about it with me, but i wasn‚Äôt able to rationally talk about it that night yet so we didn‚Äôt. the next morning (sunday morning) when i was ready to talk, she seemed emotionally cold and distant. she said that she wasn‚Äôt ready to talk yet because she didn‚Äôt know how she was feeling.

from sunday morning to yesterday night (tuesday night) she ignored my texts asking to just talk things out with her because i never wanted this to be a dealbreaker. finally, i texted her last night that i wouldn‚Äôt be able to do this with her anymore if she was just gonna ignore me when i was upset and not communicate with me. i told her that she had one last chance to tell me how she was feeling before i just moved on. 

she texted back immediately that she has no idea how she‚Äôs feeling and that she wished she knew. she said that she liked me so much it scared her before i became upset with her. then when i became upset, she shut down and has been in that state since. she knows she still likes me and wants me, but that reaction to conflict has alerted her of the fact that she‚Äôs not ready to be in a relationship. i won‚Äôt get into details, but her last relationship was really problematic and i think has given her commitment issues/fear to be vulnerable in that way. she said that she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants because she wants me and likes me but doesn‚Äôt want a relationship. thinking of a relationship for her ruins all of the attraction.

i don‚Äôt know what i want. i think i‚Äôd be okay with not having a relationship with her, but i still want to be in her life in a romantic way. i want us to foster our connection because i know it‚Äôs really special. but what should i do if she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship but i want to preserve our connection? should we take a break and i let her figure things out on her own and come back to me? the only risk is that she might just ghost me and never talk to me again. should i just take it slow with her again and not bring up conflict so it goes back to being no strings attached flirtation? the only thing is that there‚Äôs always gonna be conflict, but maybe i shouldn‚Äôt have brought it up so early. should we still go on dates or ‚Äúhang out‚Äù but just take it slow? or is that too much like a relationship ?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153679,public,self,she (18F) really likes me (18F) but she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship. should we still go on dates?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7usnj/she_18f_really_likes_me_18f_but_shes_not_ready/,no_ads,0,

Every single woman that has messaged me is originally from mainland China. Nothing wrong with that in and of itself but it's just a very strange coincidence.

Some people do not know what love bombing is. Love bombing in early stages can be seen as someone you don‚Äôt know well doing any of these things, usually without commitment:
-  giving you lots of attention/spending lots of time with you
- overly giving physical affection
- Constant compliments
- Using ‚Äúpet names‚Äù (baby, babe, beautiful)
- giving you gifts 
- saying right away you‚Äôre soulmates or meant to be
- making you feel special/putting you on a pedestal/it‚Äôs too got to be true in such a short timeframe 
- saying ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô very fast
- excessive or constant communication
- disrespecting your boundaries, etc. 

But in reality they are performing an act to use you in some way for their selfish benefits and possibly leading to control/manipulation/abuse/harassment or other narcissistic behavior, usually to get you to have sex. But love bombing can be used for other motives, and eventually or suddenly they ghost or cut you out after using you for what they want, by having misleading intentions. 

I think in 2022 we should all try to recognize going forward that love bombing is a big red flag and as a clear form of manipulation. If someone is doing this to you don‚Äôt give into it and step away.

I have been divorced for a little bit. About 8 months. I was in a disaster of a marriage. It was a sexless and intimate devoid marriage.  I was a roommate to my ex. On top of that he was verbally and emotionally abusive. 
I was in therapy almost immediately after us say I do.
I'm still in therapy.

Anyway I dated here and there after the divorce. I felt ready because I literally had no relationship with my ex. The love I had dissolved as soon as I realized who he really was and how I would be treated. On top of this amazingness he cheated. I know I wasn't perfect. But I never yelled at him or cheated. I've discussed in therapy my feelings as to what I possibly did wrong in the marriage. Lots of fun inner work. 

I randomly met my current partner at the gym. We went on a few dates and it was so simple and easy to get along with him. So three times a week dates turned into seeing each other six times a week at the gym, and sleepovers four times a week and day long hangouts on the weekends. 
It didn't happen ight away but it just happened. Like it wasn't a thought. It was natural. It flowed. 
We are intimate all the time and we cuddle constantly.
We talk for hours in person and sometimes we just cuddle. 
I love you hasn't been said. But there are clearly big feelings at work. More blatant when when we're cuddling and just looking at each other smiling.  We even have plans for a vacation in three months. 

I guess I still have a wall up. I want to let him all the way into my life..but on the same hand I'm like...your a guy. This can only end in disaster your gonna hurt me. 

I'm trying to not let what happened in my past dictate what is happening now. Because he is NOT my ex and I really just want to enjoy him and our time. 

Has anyone dealt with this? How did you work thru it. I'm working on it in therapy still but would like to hear people's experiences.
