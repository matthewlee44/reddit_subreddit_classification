I'm 35m and she claimed to be 36. 

Her photos were nice and her personality was sweet at 1st. 

As time went on (about 2 weeks) she seemed to have some sort of victim/crisis mentality. 

I thought maybe I was focusing on the wrong things and proceeded. 

A few days ago she sends me a photo that barely looks like the woman I've been talking to and that killed the entire urge to continue communication with her. 

I feel really shitty about blocking her and ghosting, but I don't want to be played and guilted either. 

The last photo she sent looked like she could be my mom. 

Maybe I'm shallow. But if I can't lust after you to any degree, you can go ahead and hang it up. 

What do these people think is going to happen? 

I blocked her because I've been torn down and guilted about their situation before upon finding out the photos were fake or 10 years old, etc. 

I didn't wanna find out what she was gonna say next.

TLDR at the bottom.

Last month I (M32) asked out a girl (F29). I met her through my job and thought we had a lot in common. Let's just call her Jane.

Our first date went really well, or so I thought it did. We met at the restaurant we had dinner at, then went to a show at a jazz club that brings in talent for live shows. It was honestly one of the funniest dates I've ever had, we had some drinks and danced a little too. We also had some great conversations, made each other genuily laugh. I paid for everything, was completely respectful. 

When things slowed down for the night, we agreed to a second date, I walked her to her car and we had a quick kiss goodnight. I texted her when I got home to make sure she made it home safe, thanked her for a fun night and went to bed. 

Here's a quick thing about me, I don't believe in trying to hook-up on a first date. It's happened to me in the past but, that's not my goal when I'm trying to build a genuine relationship. I believe that trust and honest communication should be established before sex is on the table. It's better sex that way anyways.

Moving on, the night of our 2nd date comes, I plan it all out. Again, she wants to meet me at the restaurant for dinner and I am perfectly fine with that. However, when I arrive there's firetrucks on the street and the restaurant is evacuated. Turns out a carbon monoxide alarm went off and they had to close for the night. 

I talk to Jane and we agree to a different restaurant down the road. She jumps in with me and we head that way. Almost immediately after we pull into the parking lot her phone goes off. She shares her phone's location with her friends for safety, and they want to know why we're going somewhere different. The new restaurant we're going to is inside a hotel so they think I'm trying to pull some shenanigans on her. 

We get inside and put my name down on the waiting list, it's going to be about half an hour before we can be seated. Thankfully there's also a lounge, so we wait there for a table to open up. The whole time her phone is going off and it's really distracting, so I tell her to just call her friends, and explain what's going on while I use the restroom. She tries to apologize but I tell her not to worry about it, he friends just want to make sure everything is on the level. She agrees and I go to the bathroom.

When I got to the men's room there is line out to the hall from some banquet the hotel is hosting. I think screw it, there's a bathroom in the restaurant and I can hold it.

When I make it back to the lounge where Jane and I were setting I see she's on the phone still, so I just set next to her and wait for the bartender so I can order us some drinks. I thought Jane saw me set next to her but it turns out she didn't.

Unfortunately, I hear the conversation she's having with one of her friends. I hear her say ""it's okay we're just getting dinner here""  a quick pause while her friend says something ""eww I would never fuck this guy"" another pause ""the same douchebag I went out with last weekend"" then some other stuff I didn't pay attention to because I was too shocked. 

After she hung-up I asked her if she was talking about me. When she saw me sitting next to her she had a look of total shock on her face, she had no idea I had came back.

""No, no I wasn't talking about you"" I asked her what she meant about the ""same douchebag from last weekend"" after some back-and-forth, she admitted it was me they were talking about but, that's the way her girl friends talk about guys. 
I said ""that's pretty messed up"" and let's just cancel on the rest of the night. She said she was sorry and didn't mean what she said, but I didn't care. 
I told her I would drive her back to her car but, I'm going home. 
She got a little heated and asked me what the big deal is, I told her ""sorry but I got more self respect then that."" 

I then said ""If you and your toxic ass friends don't have any respect for people who have been nothing but nice to you, then I don't want anything to do with you, do you want a ride or not?"" 
I admit, I was a little heated too.

She agrees to ride back to her car, I drop her off tell her to have a good night and drive off. When I get home, my phone starts blowing up from texts, Jane us trying to apologize again and I'm ignoring her. I go to bed early so I don't stay up and get more pissed off. The next morning she tries to call and I let it go to voicemail. She left a long one, still trying to apologize and just wanting to talk, she's crying through out.

Here's where I'm asking for advice.
I'm on the fence trying to decide if I should call her back or not. Am I being thin-skinned, or unreasonable? I think the relationship potential is still there but, we're still in the stages of first impressions, and you can't take those back. 
However, in her defense she was having and candid conversation that I technically eavesdroped on. 

I could use some different perspectives.

But ever since we started hanging out, I noticed that she calls him quite a bit. He’s never picked up while he was with me (which I find a bit odd but I think he’s just trying to be polite) but I’ve seen her call him about 3-4 times so far, all late in the evening/late at night. 

Last night he called me and told me that he told her about me over the phone, and she was surprised to hear about it. Is it weird that I find it a bit odd that they talk on the phone? 
I don’t really have close guy friends but I just don’t know if it’s usual for a girl to be calling her guy friend at night just to talk about her week/etc.

Should I even bring this up to him? I almost feel like I should just stop seeing him, since I’ve had problematic relationships where the guys “female friends” became an issue down the road.

Sometimes, she is at a point in her life where she truly is busy, and is not proactively looking to get involved with someone. This means her threshold for being open to someone is a little higher, and she might be a little more guarded with her emotions.

But make no mistake, no matter how busy someone is, they will make time for someone they have a high level attraction to, or someone they see a future with. Finding a partner is something that is always prevalent in most people lives, whether they admit it or not.

If a woman tells you she’s too busy, it means one of two things. Either she is just trying to spare your feelings, and is using being busy as an excuse to phase you out. The reason for her lack of attraction doesn’t matter at this point. Move on.

The other scenario is that she truly is busy or emotionally distracted. And while she may have a certain level of attraction to you, but under these circumstances, she’s still not attracted to you enough to pursue something. Maybe under different circumstances she might be more open, but hypotheticals don’t matter. In the present moment, she does not have a very high level of attraction. Again, there is no point trying to reason with her, or keep pursuing.

Pull back. If she wants to come you once she’s more open, she will. If you keep being an overbearing presence and push harder, she will associate you as being a needy burden in her life. The ball’s in her court, you only want to pursue and be with people who value you and make you a priority.

One area I’ve particularly struggled with is relationships with other people: romantic and platonic. One thing I’ve come to realize is I’m a very ‘intense’ person, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I would call myself a shy introvert, so making connections doesn’t exactly come easy. I don’t lack social skills, but I do find it challenging to “act natural” around people I’m unfamiliar with. I’ve had the same core group of friends for years, and of course I’ve tried to make new friends, but superficial connections aren’t satisfying to me. Plainly put, that’s likely why dating has never been easy for me. I didn’t luck out and meet my SO at a young age, at school and now at work. I’ve tried dating apps, but years of bad dates and dead end situations have proven to be a nightmare. Everyone in my life has a partner, and as dramatic as this sounds, I’m genuinely worried that will never happen for me. I’m a perfectly normal person, who is -at least by societies standards- conventionally attractive, educated and generally well rounded. I’m aware these qualities do not entitle me to a partner, it’s just that I don’t understand what the heck my issue is. Most of my dating experiences have been negative, like literally since HS I haven’t really caught a break. I’m not 16 anymore, people my age ARE in serious relationships: travelling together, moving in together; getting engaged, or married; having KIDS, investing in a future together etc. I’m not interested in anything casual, being breadcrumbed and last but not least, treated poorly. I don’t know why this keeps happening to me, dating apps seems to be ripe with unsavoury characters, and it’s SCARY. My future is uncertain, I’m damn near an existential crisis if things keep going at the current rate they are :(

She mentioned that it was okay to touch her while we made out, but when things started heating up a bit - she said she wants to take things slow. I told her that I was okay with that and we continued making out for a bit more before I headed out.

We had been texting on the app, off and on for a month, until he finally asked me out. We had a coffee first date. It was great! Conversation came easily, we laughed. I hugged him hello and goodbye. About an hour after the date he said he had a great time. I like being honest, so I came out and said I thought he was great and that I would like to get to know him better. He said he felt the same way. I gave him my phone number. We then had short daily texts( like what are you doing? How are you?). 4 days after the 1st date, I asked him if he wanted to go with me to the museum. He said he felt uncomfortable being indoors still, but that he did want to do something. So we arranged to go for dinner outside in a few days. Meantime, we continued our short daily texts, alternating who would reach out first.

 We met for the second date and I think it went better than the first. We talked more, I felt he was getting more comfortable with me. We joked around a lot, he even made little comments that made it seem like he thought this could last. At the end of the night, he said he would have to plan something next time, if there was a next time? And I said that it was a yes from me and we hugged goodbye (I even felt that he hugged me harder than he had the first time). Then he didn't text me until I texted him on Sunday, asking what he was up to. Then nothing again until I texted him Tuesday, asking how he was. He answered me enthusiastically both time. Now I haven't heard from him since that Tuesday, so 6 days ago? 

I didn't want to reach out myself because I had already done so the last 2 times and I don't want to seem desperate. I was going to wait until tomorrow (so it'll be a full week) and say like ""Hey, are you still interested in going out since I haven't heard from you? It's okay if you're not anymore."" Should I? Or should I wait a few more days to do so? It's only been 2 dates, so I know we didn't have anything really established, but I really like him and feel like we could go somewhere. But I don't want to be pushy or seem desperate. Should I just forget it and just chalk it up to him ghosting me? Should I just wait and see if he every reaches out?

I am a male, 34 and there's a female that is a server at a place that I go to about once a week, sometimes twice.  It's sort of hard to tell her age, but my best estimate is that she is 24-27. 

I am not dense and do realize that there is some flirting involved with being a server.  I am not some overly hopeless romantic that romanticizes everything.  But since May, this server seems to have made it known that she's interested in me (much to my surprise).

She isn't always assigned to our room/area - but she seems to make a point to at least say 'hi' to me directly when in the hall, passing through other sections, etc.  

I hadn't planned on acting on it until this past weekend.  I was visiting the bar with my friend and looking at what beers they had in an upright case.  The bartender was there, this girl, and another server that was a female.  The second female (not the interested party) was sort of in my line of sight for the beer case but I could still see everything in the case.  I made a joke that was ""Oh, don't worry, I am not staring at you, just looking past you to see all of the beers"".  She laughed and said ""How romantic?!  Here I thought you were interested in me!""  Jokingly I chided ""Ehh, trust me, you could do better than me"".  Which was met with laughter from everyone.  But shortly after saying that and without missing a beat, the potential interested girl said ""Oh, I don't think at all"".

So, paraphrasing, even with an age gap and assuming she would flirt with people for tips - if a server goes out of their way to speak to someone, looks at them, and jokes with them even when they're not their customer over a period of 3 months - should I ask her casually out?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,933740,public,self,"Asking a Server Out - Shared Interest, Possible Age Gap",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owmxng/asking_a_server_out_shared_interest_possible_age/,all_ads,6,,

Usually the answers are go to clubs, walk around downtown, go see live bands, etcs.

I'm 29 years old and I live in a town of around 250,000-300,000 people. It's very much a modern Sunbelt city. By that I mean it's all sprawl and there really isn't a true downtown or any place with foot traffic. Most of the homes are in subdivisions or isolate suburbs. It's mostly just plaza after plaza after plaza after office park after plaza after gas station, etc. You get the picture. 

I really see anyone male or female walking around. Our tiny downtown is a ghosttown by 8pm and even during the day no foot traffic since it's all offices. I've been to the parks but even on weekends it's 90% moms and their kids. Even from Googling to meet places to find girls in small towns most of the usual results say grocery stores, the library, parks, dog parks, etc. But I never see any single 20 somethings there. Just women in their mid 30s and up. I'm a teetotaler, so bars aren't for me. I tried volunteering with a dog rescue a while ago pre-covid. I loved it, I loved playing with the dogs but everyone else was an older woman. None of them had any single daughters or granddaughters to set me up with either.

Even regarding meeting guy friends to hang with, I play in a beer league hockey league but it's 95% male and even all of the other players are 40+. I have a few acquaintances but everyone is in a different stage of life.

I also surf and skateboard but those are both heavily male dominated and lean younger like most a bunch of 16-22 year olds. I'm kind of the old man of the group there. So more acquaintances but no real friends.

Then I recently brought a Ninja 250 but the free ride group I'm part of, leans older with everyone in their 40s and male.

Hopefully this won’t get deleted, as I just wanna vent about my dating experience as an abuse survivor.

Anyways, a few years ago I realized I was sexually abused as a child, and a couple of years of therapy has done wonders. However, there is still alot to be done. 

Perhaps what bothers me the most now, is when it comes to dating. The abuse I endured was grooming and peeping/mocking/bullying when I was exploring my sexuality by my now (fourtunately) dead stepfather. My problem is that I’m scared to death to actually pursue girls I find attractive, as my young self was manipulates towards liking older men, or in my abusers words “highly moral people”. 

Every time a girl hits on me, I almost panic. I avoid social settings with girls, mostly for this reason, as I’m scared I’ll do or say anything not ‘morally acceptable’. Now I did stay with a girl for seven years, but the last five years was mostly because I believed it was morally wrong to break up, and I hated myself for not finding her attractive (which was basicly a ‘mortal sin’ the way I thought of it). I know this is wrong, and there is nothing wrong with being attracted to someone, but I can’t shake this knee-jerk reaction, as it terrifies me. 

What almost makes it worse, is that I’m a fairly attractive man, and get hit on not too rarely. It just feels like I’m tearing myself apart here, as it seems like I can’t have what I want, and subconsciously avoid ornsabotage any ways to meet and get with a girl. It’s to the point where I’m genuinely uncomfortable when I see someone is attracted to me. I can flirt and stuff, but only when I know there’s no chance of success, or if I know I will turn it down before anything could happen. I’m trying out tinder, but I notice I can only do it right when I aim for basicly marriage (which I know is a bad idea due to my unresolved issues.) 

And, just to vent a little, I feel like my youth was stolen, as all the girls I ever wanted, and who wanted me, I sabotaged/avoided. Every time I try to have sex with a new girl, I panic and everything just dies down because I fear I will be attacked or mocked. I f*cking hate pedophiles, and especially that people assume that since you was abused as a child, they assume you yourself will abuse children (which I’d rather kill myself than do).

I just wonder if anyone else has experienced the same, and how do you deal with it? How do you accept yourself being a victim?

Seven weeks later after almost daily communication, he returns home and we go on two dates over the course of a week, the second being a concert with some of my friends. 

The next morning, I post a candid photo from the concert that he’s in to my private Instagram account (I did not tag him in it). He then calls me and asks me to take down the photo because he’s married (this was the first time I’ve heard about this) and just starting the divorce process with his wife who allegedly “cheated on him” while he was deployed. It seemed like an open conversation; he told me he’d be willing to ask whatever questions I have in person and that he wants to be “fully transparent”. He even asked for the photo twice and said it was “cute AF”.

I followed up after the phone call and asked him to set a time and place for the in-person chat. In my mind, I figured if he fully intended to pursue this/me, he’d be jumping at the opportunity to set the record straight, show me that he’s emotionally available, and assure me that he is on top of the divorce process. 

When he failed to commit to a meet up but continued to watch my Instagram stories while ignoring my follow up text for a day and a half, I told him that he’s falling below what I deserve from him in the communication and transparency department. I also told him to stop watching my Instagram stories and to stop big brothering me until he communicates that he’s ready to talk.

Cue the flip switch. He accused me of being “aggressive,” threatened to never talk to me again if I ever speak like this to him again, said he feels “violated and gross” for having to disclose his marriage to me so soon “for his sake,” and told me that we should take a step back until he finalizes his divorce.

I responded with “that’s exactly what I needed to hear. Truly wishing you the best.”

Here’s where I may be the asshole: I blocked him on social media, blocked his number, and had my secretary first-class mail him a t-shirt I borrowed from him with a return address from my work (he knows where I work) rather than my home (he doesn’t know where I live) so that I make it abundantly clear that I want nothing to do with him. I had it mailed so someone at his house will have to sign for it &amp; I will then know what is done is done. I feel very unsafe by his threat coupled with his insane delusion that there is still a chance for us after his divorce.

TL;DR: Is requiring that a married man I’m seeing give me assurances that he is emotionally available before having further access to my life and my social media aggressive at this stage in the game?

We immediately connected, went out for dates, and started to date for about 1-2 months. Although short, we had great chemistry. I was the one who ended it. Without going into specifics, I was turned off by the way she handled disagreement.

At the time, I thought I made the right choice. But sometimes, I wonder if it was a minor issue that could easily be resolved, or I might have over-reacted because I have a tendency to do that. Rather than working out the issues, I just walk away.

More than a year passed. This July, I ran into her, and we exchanged numbers. I asked her out for coffee. We spent hours chatting, laughing, and talking about how things were misinterpreted. And she mentioned that she was really hurt because we had such great chemistry. In the end, I asked her to give it a try, and she said yes. Things were going well, and I knew that we still had the chemistry. But after a few dates, she ended it and said she no longer felt the chemistry. I respected her decision and moved on.

Yesterday I got a call from her out of the blue. She mentioned that she lied to me about the chemistry and had to end it because she was so afraid of getting hurt again and wanted to protect herself. She asked me for another chance. 

She mentioned that she had not dated anyone after that. Of course, I wanted to trust her and give her the benefit of the doubt, but I would appreciate some objective perspective on this because I feel like I am being her backup.

So me(25F) was seeing/dating this guy(27m) for a four months already, past month things got complicated, I felt like I was took for granted. besides that, both of us had some other problems in personal lives and mental health, so I snapped at him(didn’t tell hurtful things, just got angry and heartbroken) and i know it’s really immature but blocked him. after day or two, as I have cooled down, I unblocked him and texted that I was genuinely sorry and everything proved that we weren’t romantically compatible, but he’s really my kind of person and I’d love to hang out someday, sometime and return his stuff, as we overcome our personal issues. it’s been almost week and he still haven’t responded or signed in. Although he was online shortly after I texted him but never opened my chat (you can’t do *unread* on that app) &amp; I don’t want to call him and steal his time, as he was dealing with some hard stuff and I don’t double text as wel and come out as desperate or pushy. am I being ghosted? or week is norm? a few years ago a guy with whom i hooked up twice tried to ghost me but at least he had balls to respond with single “it’s not about you”. 
It’s really hard for me to let people who i genuinely like go. even though I have lot of problems going on in my life, this is always in back of my mind, wondering what is going on and the without closure it’s slowly driving me crazy. so “focusing on myself” and other decent advices really don’t work for me rn. Also, I know that he’s alive :) 
It’s not my first relationship, hopefully not last and other than blocking I think of myself as a mature person.

want. This  magnet is called charisma, and it is 

very important if you want to attract the woman 

of your life. But, if this is a problem for you, 

you must try some tricks to pick-up the woman you 

want.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, use your dog to pick-up girls. You 

have a dog? Now its your chance. Take a walk with 

your dog on the place where you know your special 

one passes by every day. Any girl likes dogs. 

Small ones are very cute and the big ones make 

you look hot.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are with your dog out and suddenly 

your girl pass over. Make sure that she sees you. 

If it happens that your dog had a bad behavior 

and starts barking at her you might apologize and 

tell her to not take it personally. So, you can 

discus with her. Show her that your dog know some 

tricks  and while your dog is sitting and rolling 

over you' re getting to know the girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Babies. Every woman love babies.  Your friend is 

married and has a baby? Join your friend when he 

goes out with the baby and show interest by 

playing with the kid when she passes by you. Next 

day you can offer to watch out the baby for your 

friend and take him to a walk to show her you 

like kids. But make sure she has saw you in the 

day before with your friend to not think that the 

baby is yours. If the baby is crying when she 

passes by you, you might be lucky and she might 

offer her help to make the baby stop crying. So, 

you get to talk with her and may ask her for a 

date.

&amp;#x200B;

Use some magic tricks to attract her. You are 

seeing her every day and you don't have the 

courage to talk to her. First of all, relax. One 

of the biggest turnoffs for women is a guy who’s 

uptight. Just relax and you’ll be fine. After you 

start talking with her use some magic tricks to 

impress her and attract her. You may say that you 

are good at magick and you are offering to guess 

her future by reading her hand. She'll definitely 

laugh but if she's ok with this you may tell her 

that she will have a glorious future.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't forget to make her laugh. Laughter is all 

you need to attract  women easily and quickly. If 

you are able to make her laugh any time and any 

places it will be easier to you to get the woman 

you are  looking after for some long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:

We all know that approaching woman isn't easy. It 

can be  embarrassing and downright difficult. But,

 if you know what you are doing and have faith in 

your own forces you can get the one you like.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,933984,public,nsfw,"""Tools"" For Picking-Up Girls",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owqorg/tools_for_pickingup_girls/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,

There have been SO many times where I thought that if I just showed someone I cared more or went out of my way more for them or even hung out with someone more, they would come around and like me. You can't convince or force someone to like you.

If someone isn’t showing their appreciation for you, stop trying to force it and it's better to move on.

The dates themselves went really great and had our first kiss on the second date. There was never a question of whether he was into me because he made that very clear. He called me just to say hi last week. He would message me to have a great day pretty girl, so lots of compliments and communication was excellent. Lots of messages and lots to talk about. He even talked about future date activities together and also found out I was vegan so listened to podcasts to learn more about it. There was a lot of effort on his end.

The last date was Friday and at this stage there were no future dates planned but I wasn't worried about it as we were messaging a bit and he was being very sweet. On Sunday he all of a sudden stopped replying mid conversation and my last message was quite long. I checked in later that night and told him I hope he had a nice day and still nothing.

Next day I hear nothing so I assume another ghost. What a shame and this time I stupidly didn't see it coming. I sent him one last message that night asking if everything was okay and of course crickets. Until this morning I wake up to a message telling me to have a great day??
