I moved back into my own apartment (I had been staying with family over the course of the pandemic) and I have made my way back to the gym (I had been working out at a home gym I built for myself at my family's place.) While I'm still working from home, a lot of my time is now being attended to by my daily life. It takes more time to go to the gym now, for example, since I have to drive there, plus it's been incredibly busy once I'm there, so my workouts take slightly longer. I also have to do more errands around my place rather than just sit at home.

What I've noticed in the past few weeks is that where dating apps got more of my attention and time prior to these changes, I'm not really spending a whole lot of time swiping through them and staying on top of conversations. It's not that I don't have the time to date, but maybe after spending the past year staring at them and leaning heavily onto them with not much progress, I'm naturally at the burnout point with them and throwing fate to the wind while I go about living my life as usual. I'm not working hard to get those matches. If they happen, they happen.

Something I have also noticed in running errands and being out and about is that there are a ton of attractive people around the area who probably aren't anywhere on a dating app (they may also be in relationships for all I know,) and while it is a matter of figuring out how to meet new people IRL, it's at least promising to know that options aren't restricted to the select profiles within a 25 mile radius which an algorithm has determined you are worthy of (but will change if you subscribe to a premium service for the price of $29.99/month.)

I've been around the block with different women and I am aware that some women need extra help from a toy in order to finish with a partner, now that we've established that, let's get into it.

So in the very beginning of me and my girlfriend's relationship I told her that honesty is a very important virtue to me in a realtionship, I take pride in being able to be honest even when it's hard, and I think that is how you build a strong healthy relationship.

Anyways once we started being intimate, I told her that if she doesn't finish, to tell me and we can work out how we can get her there, as that's what's important to me, that we both enjoy the act. She agreed and said word for word ""well duh I'm going to tell you, because I want to be able to get off too""

So that made me happy to hear that, as I believed we were on the same page. And apparently I had made her orgasm a lot (I tried to make it happen at least once every time we had sex).

A few weeks ago we went of a binge of, doing the act, and at the very end, she squirted. And I was surprised because she had never done that with me before, I asked her ""has that ever happened to you before?"" and she replied with ""no that was a first, I didn't even know I could do that"" we went to bed afterwards.

And then today we were chatting on the phone talking about how sex is different for girls and guys and she said something about how girls always need a toy in order to orgasm, and I then responded ""what do you mean? you orgasm all the time when we have sex, and we've only used a toy like that a few times"" She then got nervous and I put two and two together and asked her if she had being faking orgasming the entire time, and lying to me. She then responded that she had been, and that when she squirted that was not the first time for her, that was a normal thing for her, that happens when she has an orgasm every time (that's what she does during an actual orgasm). And that to usually orgasm she needs a vibe toy during sex

I told her that I was hurt that she lied and I hung up on her. Lying is something I take pretty seriously and this isn't the first thing she's lied to me about. while I don't think this lie is that bad, I don't understand why she would agree in the beginning of the relationship to tell me the truth so that we could satisfy her, and then not agree to that and lie for the entire relationship.

She said she faked them because she didn't want to hurt my confidence, but I told her in the beginning that it wouldn't hurt my confidence, I just wanted to make sure she was having a good time as well.

Our relationship is only 2 months long (we were unofficial for 3 before) so technically 5 months I guess. And this isn't the first lie she told me, I'm starting to seriously doubt my trust in her if she can't even tell me the small things. The last lie we told I was debating ending the relationship altogether.

And it's not that I'm bad at communicating, I'm very good at communication, and am not afraid to express my thoughts good or bad, and am able to keep my cool when I say them.

She's a really great girl otherwise but idk, the lying messes with my head, quite a bit.

Anyone had experience like this? or has dated someone who lied a lot? how did it turn out/ Did talks about trust and communication ever change anything?

I know I said this would be short but it wasn't lol, whoops.

I have the weirdest question I have ever faced in regards to dating and relationships. Please share ALL your thoughts :)   


So, I (F36) met on a dating app a younger guy (M26). We seemed to hit it off, as we texted a lot, and had really good convos via text. Eventually we meet, it seems we both are satisfied by the meeting and would like to do it again. But right after, due to life and yes, COVID, the guy had to move away, and aside from texting sometimes, we pretty much agree to put whatever this is on hold, and maybe try again after, when he moves back to the city.

On one conversation he expressed how he is not ready for serious dating. Things have happened in his past relationships that have screwed him up, and he needs to work on his demons, which is why he can't have a serious relationship. 

Recently we chatted a little, and I love that he confides in me. I have a bad crush on this guy, anyway. And he told me all about some of these things that happened to him, as a way to explain why he doesn't date seriously. What really got me is that he expressed, very clearly, that he is incapable of feeling romantic love. Exactly like that. I felt sad for him, because it sucks to feel this way, and I had the impression the he was telling me to explain on one hand, but I was left with the doubt, what if he told me this to scare me away? Other subjects were discussed on our chat, but this one left like..... ""why are you telling me this?!""

I can ask him eventually. I do doubt he would say all that (which was really personal info) just to scare me away. But I can't shake the feeling off. And a part of me thinks I should take the hint, and make sure I only see him as a friend. Because the moment I catch feelings and he doesn't, this is really going to suck.

I, 25, M have been working at this place for about half a year now. Everything is fine, I enjoy the work and the people around. Eventhough COVID has made people more distant, I find myself well adapted. 

I am not actively looking for but neither am i avoiding any kind of relationship with women. Eventhough i have never dated, had a GF or even had sex, I find myself getting into the ""just do it"" mentality and out of the ""what if?"" mentality about women and dating. I kind of feel ready for the bad stuff about dating and getting to know women. Eventhough it sucks being single.

Unlike before, this time I really don't know what to do as opposed to being scared about what could happen. 

This is where the workplace comes in, the trouble being, that I get mixed singals from my co-worker, 28 F. 
Our department is located in an open space with dedicated desk positions. (this might seem outdated in some places, but hey, this is central europe. It is not outdated if we do it, right?Anyways, i'm diverging) So I am sitting next to and in front of 2 of my coworkers most of the day. They know each other a bit longer and have even shared a single office for a longer time. I am ""the new dude"" and a part from my boss the only dude in less than 10 people.

Now to the mixed signals: very often when she laughs or smiles about something said in a discussion, she looks at me instead of anyone else We already have inside jokes and seem to have a lot in common, both personally and interests-wise. But sometimes, when we are alone at the office (being the only singles often are the last ones in and so the last ones out) we barely talk, eventhough when there are still coworkers we talk normally.
She even went on one or another smoke break with me eventhough she doesn't smoke. (that could be to escape the badly cooled offices and get some fresh air but still)

Since she is a coworker, sitting right next to me i really wouldn't want to misread those signals because i still have 1 ½ years of training time at the job and i don't want there to be a strange ambiance around the office, especially since other coworkers are quite chatty in not necessarily a good way and i do share a good part of my work with her.


Am I exaggerating? Should I just not give a damn about the work ambiance? Is this normal women behaviour? Am i to desperate?
I have no clue. Help would be appreciated.

fast forward to sopho yr of college, we are both 20. he goes to college 2 hrs away from me. i completely went psycho for NO reason and this caused arguments, more unhappy times than happy ones. yes in hindsight he had given me 0 reasons to not trust him but yep i grew suspicious and lost my crap. projected a lot of past trauma into the relationship. still he was patient. wanted to work things out. of course reflecting on everything i realize that i was stupid and will never ever make a huge deal out of something small like that.

fast forward to yesterday. we still text everyday, mainly just gm/gn texts, recap of the day text at night, try to call at least once a week, he is home for the summer, but its mostly me that initiates the plans. yes we had a heart-to-heart, he did say that he wanted to stay in a relationship with me and wanted to work things out. his mom said to him ""u know its not the end of the world if u guys take a break"" and while he agrees yes, its not, he told me that if we can work on it together theres no reason to take one. i asked him where he sees us 10 yrs from now he says ""hopefully with a family""

Well she became a little flakey, and we stopped talking for a month. I started coming back into the picture and we started chatting again with her being super open finally for a 2nd date and this time I didn't bring up who pays lol. Anyways when we chatted on the phone again, I got a funny vibe and realized something: she's used to friends and family doing everything for her, and she's NEVER done things back in return. She mentioned a few times losing friends and becoming depressed because of it and it's all making sense now. I noticed people on her social media, guys and girls doing very nice things for her, but she never seems to have done stuff for them. I also noticed she can talk on and on about herself but hardly asks anything when we've talked and noticed the same thing on her timeline. It's kinda left a bitter taste now and I don't feel the same about her anymore. I feel sad she's been becoming anti-social, but it seems like it's of her own doing. She seemed super sweet and we secured a 2nd date finally, however yesterday I canceled it nicely with a valid excuse (home projects got me busy this month).

Now I feel like im just getting old and ugly and that my life is over.

Im not one for online dating and I guess to ugly now as current pics wont get any matches, and my younger pics not even doing great either, Im 30s and cant be posting pics when i was 18-22 when i was really attractive, posting pics mid late 20s but i wont even post any current picture, my hair is receding/messy, i just look ugly, i mean most people older just dont look as attractive thats life sadly.

Yet when i see women i like look off always under 25. When I match or see some older women auto swipe left, just dont find them attractive, not interested to start my dating life with some older women whos had 3 kids etc haha, well not their fault i didnt date when young but still put me in a predicament now.

I just feel like well may as well jump of a bridge. In terms of dating, have to concede fact that there never will be any dating life for me, not sure I even want one. Wish I tried dating when i was young and good looking coulda had fun, to busy just hanging with friends, having fun, getting drunk, some casual flings etc. Now im like wow im this creepy old ugly bloke with a fetish for younger women, and with lockdown no friends, and my age, no parties, my looks, no dating....Honestly finding it hard to even motivate myself to do anything.

Seen a few of my mates, even ones with kids, split up during lockdown as well so may be effecting not only the singles.

As for being single, well nevermind not getting any interest even if I did in the covid era what would I do, not interested in getting physical, no where to go dates, parties etc...

I very briefly met someone (24m) in my area who actually wasn't local. I was able to find them on social media and shot my shot. They said they'd be willing to get to know me and consider long distance if everything was going well. He mentioned that he's currently emotionally unavailable due to his job since he travels a lot, but wouldn't mind considering something down the line. We'd been talking on social media and everything seemed to be going great. Got along well, similar sense of humor, sending each other pics and memes, compliments, etc. He even mentioned coming back to visit soon so we could really meet up and get to know each other for the first time. 

One day out of the blue he started being nonchalant, opening my messages and not responding, responding with one word answers, etc. I figured he must've been tired and just gave him some space, since he mentioned how tired his job made him. I eventually decided to confront him and ask what was wrong, to which he eventually, after beating around the bush a bit, responded that he was worried I might be a catfish or that we wouldn't get along in person. Part of me thinks he was just trying to find an excuse to stop talking to me since he was so busy and maybe didn't see long distance working out. I'm not sure why he'd think I'm a catfish since I had sent him several live snapchat photos, so I assumed he might've been implying that he was expecting me to look less attractive irl than my photos, which was pretty insulting tbh. We were getting along great via messaging so idk why he was expecting something completely different when we met up. Even then, we'd find that out once we met up, right? He never really explained himself and just ended up blocking me. I'm not sure what I did to make him think these things or act that way so suddenly.

It took my nearly a year to work on myself again :) while I did put in a lot of time and effort by working on my inner self , in this one year I didn't date anyone or have any flings as I wanted undivided attention to myself 
Nonetheless  after getting over all this , I did try.online dating again ( literally had 3 matches in months) and tbh I did try hooking up for a online but that never worked for me either and I haven't ever done.this before and all I received was rejection  or being ghosted and I also genuinely  tried dating but filled with rejection  again :) Nonetheless  I started thinking eat was going on and till date , I can't figure it out 
I wouldn't say am.the best looking guy nor the worst looking guy tbh , I have decent appearance and take care of myself well considering the fact I suffer from anxiety . 

Nonetheless  I have been Optimistic about dating or just hooking up , but nothing seems to be working and office I'm showing since of giving up as it's making me tired 😫

All I want is someone  to grow with , build something  with and compliment  each other and make memories and share intimacy in a relationship  and nothing more , I have no reservations against any culture and am really open minded but unfortunately I face a lot of racist experiences  in dating in Germany ( am an south Asian here ) people markwt themselves as.open minded here but their actions proves they are so full of shit 

While if it's just hooking up I'd like to build a friendship over it and share some intimate  and sensual moments , of course only with consent and have fun like the rest 

But nothing is really happening  and it's making me frustrated and thinking if am not desirable 

What do I do? 

I am.1.78m tall , a bit overweight by 8 kgs due to my anxiety , I am working on it by cycling as it keeps me calm and helps me reduce as.well 
I'm 28 year old guy

I've never really  dated someone with this much of an age-gap but I was wondering   what  other people think of it.

I  am a man and I had a discussion a few days ago with a friend of mine.   We talked about dating and I told her, I meet a girl and she told me a  lot of personal problems after 60minutes talking. Like her father died,  she hates her roommate, her mothers annoys her etc. You see a lot of  stuff. I almost did not talk about myself.

Firstly  because I dont like it if someone says negative things and to add some negative stuff from my side. I feel worse after that, but thats just me. And  secondly because I just wanted to listen and I did not have the  intention to discuss things about myself, if she had asked I would have  answered (more or less but not as deep as her).

I  dont know why but the girl and I never met again. I had the impression  we had a good connection but it I guess it was just me. So I told that  story my friend. And she told me, that a lot of women dont like it when a  boy is just listening because then he is like her psychologist, she is  confused because now I (or the man in generell) knows so much stuff  about her and she does not know nothing about him, and its getting even  worse, she told me in some cases the girl could get mad at the guy  because she opened up to him and told him so much stuff that he now has  the ""power"". She also stated like when I dont open up we cant have a  connection.

To be honest, I was  quite shocked about her thoughts. Because I did not think about this,  especially not the power thing (keep in mind, my friend is always  talking about being submissive and dominat). I just wanne be equal with  my partner thats it, i dont wanne dominate someone and I dont wanne be  dominated. I always thought, if she wanne talkes about that and i am  listening she feels better and thats it.

So  she told me, because I was just listening that I should open up more to  creat a connection between me and her.

But I will say that I’m a mid 20s something female and am on the apps for a relationship , not just hooking up.

So onto the advice:

1. Put your career/job in it. It makes a difference. I personally am looking for someone who has their shit together and typically swipe LEFT if the person doesn’t have a career/job listed even if I like other things about their profile simply because I don’t wanna waste my time. 

2. I see it as a negative not to list your age or “hide” it. Left swipe. It’s deceiving and red flaggy. What are you hiding it for? They’re gonna find out when they see you in person.

3. THE MORE PICS THE BETTER👏 A guy that looks cute in 1 pic and unrecognizable in his second? Swipe left. Don’t wanna waste my time.

4. Don’t leave your bio blank!!! I’ve seen this SOO MANY times. I could like everything about your profile and if I see that you didn’t put in the effort to type one sentence or something about yourself then it’s a swipe left for me. Most people can look good on paper and take the right pics but it’s their personality that’s lacking. I like it when there’s a joke or something sweet written down there to really seal the deal.

5. Take off those sunglasses.... I shouldn’t have to say this. There are way too many people who have sunglasses on ALLL of their pics. Am I supposed to guess what your face looks like? Just post a real pic so you can stand a real chance.

6. Snapchat filtered selfies... with the Snapchat caption going across it. Honey baby what! is you doing. 

7. And while we’re on the topic of Snapchat, I will 10000% swipe left if you make it clear to me that you use Snapchat, such as listing it in your bio. Again, this is my opinion but we all know Snapchat’s rep and it typically means you’re still a kid. No thanks.

8. No weirdly angled body shots... I understand that you work out and get them gains and wanna show it off, but this just tells me that you’re only into hooking up (could be the case for most!) and need attention. Posting a full sized normal pic can also get the point across that you work out and are fit. 

9. Memes or inspiring/love-related quotes... Why? Just why? Pics only. I don’t care that you find spongebob memes funny, that’s not gonna make me wanna swipe right",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,842453,public,self,Dating app profile ADVICE for those who wanna hear it:,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1imko/dating_app_profile_advice_for_those_who_wanna/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I matched with a girl on hinge and we were talking around a week. Things go well. We mutually express interest in meeting. One night we were both out and decided let’s meet. We met each other’s friends and everything and drank together. It went great. Good conversation but she is definitely shy and so am I. We are both attracted to each other. Her friends told my friend she likes me a lot. The night ended, kept texting the next few days (very spaced out texts from both of us).

Shortly after, I finally set up a real date with her. The whole time the conversation felt great, but I didn’t really escalate past some back touches lol. No kissing. We are together for like 4 hours, great convo but not necessarily romantic. Part of me thinks she is super closed off and shy (same vibes as the first night out), but part of me didn’t want to go for a kiss because maybe she’s just not interested. She even invited to something (that I couldn’t go to). She mentioned I was great company and I asked in person if we could do something again (she said yes). 

I text her after saying how great a time I had. Now, we typically take a lot of time to text back, but she didn’t say anything for quite a while…. 5 hours? She finally said “I hope you made it back ok!” And that’s it. I responded. Then I didn’t hear from her for a day. Finally I double text her and she gives a decent response. Nothing to insinuate disinterest, but nothing to start a conversation. I haven’t responded.

I really don’t know where to go from here. I’ve only had one girlfriend and I’m 25 so I’m super inexperienced. So don’t text her until I want to set up a date?

It’s been a while since I dated, the last person that I haven’t seeing was an ex and we are very much hung up on each other sexually but not relationship wise as we are both in two separate stages in our lives and I just believe that he needs someone that’s more around his age as I need someone around mine. 

Anyways, this guy reached out to me that is two years older than me and as far as I’m concerned him and I hit it off quite well but because I was still/still am seeing my ex even though I know nothing is coming out of it, I decided to proceed going on this mini date with this other person. We had fun at least that’s what he claims and I feel like it was mutual but he wouldn’t stop mentioning his ex girlfriend, he says they’ve been broken up for a while now but they are super close and still hang out everyday and he occasionally sleeps over at her apartment and all the stuff. like I do think this guy is good looking, smart and I would like to proceed something with him but I feel as though his ex girlfriend will get in the way of that and it’s kind of like a dealbreaker for me because I don’t wanna already mention it when I’ve only just met despite talking to each other for like months now (as friends) and I’m not really the type of person to tell him who he can and can’t be friends with because it’s super unfair and I know that I wouldn’t like it to be done to me but it makes me super uncomfortable knowing that they are very close still. Do I just kind of “dismiss us” or wait it out until something actually happens between us and then mention it to him as like a dealbreaker, I have no idea…

They were together for almost 3 years, and he even said to me that he doesn’t want to hurt her which also was kind of like suspicious to me and plus when he drove an hour to see me, he turned off his location which I assumed he was sharing with his ex girlfriend as well and he didn’t turn it on until he went back home so that’s also a huge red flag to me (I only checked location to see how close he was)

I am 42. Personally, I would pay for the first date, for sure, and probably the next couple, but I would hope after that we would split and pay for ourselves? I recently dated a girl who was 26, and over a 6 week period, she paid once I think. I was short on cash, in between jobs, but she would still, when asked where to go for food, be like ""that korean bbq place!"" (the one that cost me a min of $80!) 

One time, I mentioned needing to be careful about money, so she agreed on Chipotle (she was a fast food snob and would basically not go to any of them, but she would go to chipotle)...she sent me a text with what she wanted and I thought, ""she knows I am broke and have no income really, she will order a burrito."" She orders that, then adds chips and queso and a bottled drink. I remember seeing the $30 bill after I got my burrito and thinking, this seems really unfair to me. Then again, she was pretty old-fashioned. Once said she would not consider a dinner a date unless the man was paying for it all. Wanted to get married and be a stay-at-home wife and eventually stay-at-home mom. It was definitely stressful financially. Anyone else find the financial stuff stressful sometimes if one partner is all about the other paying for it all?

I suspect this sort of thing (all of the above) is not the norm these days? God, I hope not. Lol.

Is this ever a make or break issue for any of you? Would it make you think less of a guy who didn't pay all the time or most of the time? I always wonder.

What do you all think? I figure if a woman has a job, and with the way things are today, I would hope after a couple of dates, paying for ourselves would be the general vibe.

He seems to be genuine and respectful and is also looking for a relationship. I'm sure that he has dated before, and I am scared to tell him that I'm completely inexperienced. I also don't want to move so slowly that he loses interest.

He is planning a picnic date for us(ow my heart) and I am scared he is going to try to kiss me. I really want to kiss him, but I don't know how I won't explode. I don't know if I should tell him beforehand that I've never kissed anyone, or if I should wait till afterwards. 

I've been texting him for a while and he is the first guy I have seen as good potential relationship material, but I am so scared to even get in a relationship even though I really, really want to. I've struggled with intimacy my whole life and am slowly become more affectionate towards friends and family, but I still don't know how to show him I am interested in being more than just friends. 

I'm not really worried about never being able to find anyone, I'm more worried about never being able to initiate a relationship. I feel like I am at the age where it is more common for relationships to be casual and without labels, but I don't want that.

Girl that works the line at my local Chipotle seems interested in me. Only thing is, we only literally have like, 30 seconds to communicate in the damn line. Frustratingly short amount of time. I've never asked anybody on a date without at least like, a minute or two of conversation first, and ""Hi! Nice day right? Let's go do stuff on a date, extra chicken please"" just doesn't sound very appealing to me, lol.

I'd be lying if I said the added pressure of her entire team being within earshot, the people in line next to me waiting for their chance to order, and the fact I'm totally putting her on the spot- wasn't a factor in my confusion about how to take action here. She seems a little shy as well. Not much, but I'm concerned that putting her on the spot even if she wanted to say yes, would just be way too much pressure, and kinda put a big, self-conscious, ""STOP"" sign on the whole thing.

So! I need some help. Creative solutions, anecdotes, speculation, philosophical analysis, whatever you've got. ...Oh, except two things: A. ""Just do it"" comments without direction, or consideration (if it's ""just do it"" but prefaced with a thoughtful analysis, then it's okay. But ""Just shoot your shot because YOLO"" won't be doing me any favors here) and B. Anything surreptitious, or ""smooth."" Something like ""slipping"" her my number etc. is in my opinion, cowardly- I wouldn't be able to do something like that and call myself a Man... Not to mention if I were her?

i’ve always been rather shy about having casual sex/ one night stands. i’m very much more of an ‘emotional connection’ person and haven’t been intimate with anyone that i haven’t known for a while. 

i’m in my mid 20’s now &amp; have had sex with 3 people. i guess i’m sort of questioning whether it’s time to maybe be more open to casual stuff

i mean i think i would be alright if i got to know the person but i feel like casual—especially online—dating doesn’t really work like that? idk what people expect these days so i’m nervous that i’d end up hanging out with someone that just wants to fuck once 

how do you explain this to someone? i feel like most people wouldn’t be into that &amp; now i have a sense of impending doom

I don't feel I get respected like I should be and feel its pulling teeth to get any good interaction going.  

I consider myself thoughtful and try to come up with original openers and questions to matches I get connected with.  Sometimes its tough as many leave profiles with not much details to work with and to add on that their responses don't help either. 

What makes me the most angry is when the girls have to make the first move and the best they could come up with is just ""Hi how are you"". It really strikes my nerve cuz I know a girl would never respond back to me if I did the same.   Its like I have to be Shakespeare to get a back an forth going and it just drains me.  

I end up deleting matches I feel are not going anywhere or taking too long to respond back to me because I lack the patience to wait to see if its going to get better and makes it easier for me to forget about them, out of sight out of mind.  I just don't like looking back and seeing how I am getting disrespected.

Its just easier living life just working, exercising and doing my hobbies than having to worry about getting my dating life in order.  I have been indoctrinated from family upbringing that I ought to get married but with the way the world is programmed and how people are, its just not setting up anyone for success.

At the end he asked for my number, then texted me to give me his. He said if you're ever in town (we live close but not the same town, maybe 40 min drive) we should do *insert local bars and dancing. He named some places* I said yeah as enthusiastically as I could when he asked, exchanged numbers, then he left for the evening. So no time or day secured.

We met at a conference so not work related but also not as casual as a bar. Well lit and lots of people around when he asked.

That was this past weekend, this is Wednesday and I haven't heard from him. So now I'm wondering 1) did he even really ask me out or was he just being friendly 2) is it up to me to text him since we don't live in the same town?

There’s a lot of girls where we live and he still wants to be with you” My ex then stated that I took his virginity and that he has to be with me (for the long haul) He started tearing up and what not saying there’s no way he could be with someone else. I absolutely did not take his virginity; he one hundred percent took mine so this is ridic what he’s trying to pin on me. This happened back in 2019 so the fact I’m hearing this for the first time is mind boggling. I’ve been told many times to stop speaking To him since then and clearly I didn’t listen.
